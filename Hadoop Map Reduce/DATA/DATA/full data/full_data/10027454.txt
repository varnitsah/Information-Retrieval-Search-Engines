dramatic works in six volumes 12mo printed for tonson in 1735 has been chiefly resorted to for the text of the plays in the present edition although the assistance of the older copies in quarto and folio has been called in where difficulties occurred or improvements were obvious the preliminary dissertations dedications and prefaces have been corrected from the excellent edition of mr malone congreve appears deeply to have felt the bequest left him by his great predecessor when just abandoning the ungrateful stage he made it his intreaty that his successor would be kind to his remains considerable pains have been bestowed by the present editor in correcting the text the notes are limited to the explanation of such passages as the fashion in language in manners or in literature has in the space of a century rendered doubtful or obscure     dedication to mr congreves edition of drydens dramatic works  to his grace the duke of newcastle1 lord chamberlain of his majestys household c  footnote 1 thomas pelham duke of newcastle no satire ever can convey such bitter reproof as the highstrained eulogy of this dedication this great and wealthy man unblushingly received congreves tribute of praise and gratitude for his munificence in directing a splendid monument to be raised over drydens remains but the incense of the dedicator was wasted on a block more insensible than his graces workmen could have dug from the quarry neither pride nor shame could induce the duke to accomplish what vanity had led him voluntarily to propose and the dedication instead of producing a tomb in honour of dryden will remain itself an eternal monument of the patrons disgrace   my lord it is the fortune of this edition of the dramatic works of the late mr dryden to come into the world at a time when your grace has just given order for erecting at your own expense a noble monument to his memory  this is an act of generosity which has something in it so very uncommon that the most unconcerned and indifferent persons must be moved with it how much more must all such be affected by it who had any due regard for the personal merits of the deceased or are capable of any taste and distinction for the remains and elegant labours of one of the greatest men that our nation has produced  that which distinguisheth actions of pure and elevated generosity from those of a mixed and inferior nature is nothing else but the absolutely disinterested views of the agent  my lord this being granted in how fair a light does your munificence stand a munificence to the memory to the ashes of a man whom you never sawwhom you never can see and who consequently never could by any personal obligation induce you to do this deed of bounty nor can he ever make you any acknowledgment for it when it shall be done  it is evident your grace can have acted thus from no other motive but your pure regard to merit from your entire love for learning and from that accurate taste and discernment which by your studies you have so early attained to in the politer arts  and these are the qualities my lord by which you are more distinguished than by all those other uncommon advantages with which you are attended your great disposition your great ability to be beneficent to mankind could by no means answer that end if you were not possessed of a judgment to direct you in the right application and just distribution of your good offices  you are now in a station by which you necessarily preside over the liberal arts and all the practisers and professors of them poetry is more particularly within your province and with very good reason may we hope to see it revive and flourish under your influence and protection  what hopes of reward may not the living deserver entertain when even the dead are sought out for and their very urns and ashes made partakers of your liberality  as i have the honour to be known to you my lord and to have been distinguished by you by many expressions and instances of your goodwill towards me i take a singular pleasure to congratulate you upon an action so entirely worthy of you and as i had the happiness to be very conversant and as intimately acquainted with mr dryden as the great disproportion in our years could allow me to be i hope it will not be thought too assuming in me if in love to his memory and in gratitude for the many friendly offices and favourable instructions which in my early youth i received from him i take upon me to make this public acknowledgment to your grace for so public a testimony as you are pleased to give to the world of that high esteem in which you hold the performances of that eminent man  i can in some degree justify myself for so doing by a citation of a kind of right to it bequeathed to me by him and it is indeed upon that pretension that i presume even to make a dedication of these his works to you  in some very elegant though very partial verses which he did me the honour to write to me he recommended it to me to be kind to his remains2  footnote 2 these are the affecting lines referred to    already i am worn with cares and age   and just abandoning th ungrateful stage   unprofitably kept at heavens expense   i live a rentcharge on his providence   but you whom every muse and grace adorn   whom i foresee to better fortune born   be kind to my remains and o defend   against your judgment your departed friend   let not the insulting foe my fame pursue   but shade those laurels which descend to you   and take for tribute what these lines express   you merit more nor could my love do less  epistle to mr congreve  i was then and have been ever since most sensibly touched with that expression and the more so because i could not find in myself the means of satisfying the passion which i felt in me to do something answerable to an injunction laid upon me in so pathetic and so amicable a manner  you my lord have furnished me with ample means of acquitting myself both of my duty and obligation to my departed friend what kinder office lies in me to do to these his most valuable and imperishable remains than to commit them to the protection and lodge them under the roof of a patron whose hospitality has extended itself even to his dust  if i would permit myself to run on in the way which so fairly opens itself before me i should tire your grace with reiterated praises and acknowledgments and i might possibly notwithstanding my pretended right so to do give some handle to such who are inclinable to censure to tax me of affectation and officiousness in thanking you more than comes to my share for doing a thing which is in truth of a public consideration as it is doing an honour to your country for so unquestionably it is to do honour to him who was an honour to it  i have but one thing to say either to obviate or to answer such an objection if it shall be made to me which is that i loved mr dryden  i have not touched upon any other public honour or bounty done by you to your country i have industriously declined entering upon a theme of so extensive a nature and of all your numerous and continual largesses to the public i have only singled out this as what most particularly affected me i confess freely to your grace i very much admire all those other donations but i much more love this and i cannot help it if i am naturally more delighted with any thing that is amiable than with any thing that is wonderful  whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for any thing that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him  he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him  such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency  as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations  to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that ever i knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals  i have given your grace this slight sketch of his personal character as well to vindicate his memory as to justify myself for the love which i bore to his person and i have the rather done it because i hope it may be acceptable to you to know that he was worthy of the distinction you have shewn him as a man as well as an author  as to his writings i shall not take upon me to speak of them for to say little of them would not be to do them right and to say all that i ought to say would be to be very voluminous but i may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to his last even to near seventy years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his ode on st cecilias day and his fables his latest performances  he was equally excellent in verse and in prose his prose had all the clearness imaginable together with all the nobleness of expression all the graces and ornaments proper and peculiar to it without deviating into the language or diction of poetry i make this observation only to distinguish his style from that of many poetical writers who meaning to write harmoniously in prose do in truth often write mere blank verse  i have heard him frequently own with pleasure that if he had any talent for english prose it was owing to his having often read the writings of the great archbishop tillotson  his versification and his numbers he could learn of no body for he first possessed those talents in perfection in our tongue and they who have best succeeded in them since his time have been indebted to his example and the more they have been able to imitate him the better have they succeeded  as his style in prose is always specifically different from his style in poetry so on the other hand in his poems his diction is wherever his subject requires it so sublimely and so truly poetical that its essence like that of pure gold cannot be destroyed take his verses and divest them of their rhymes disjoint them in their numbers transpose their expressions make what arrangement and disposition you please of his words yet shall there eternally be poetry and something which will be found incapable of being resolved into absolute prose an incontestible characteristic of a truly poetical genius  i will say but one word more in general of his writings which is that what he has done in any one species or distinct kind would have been sufficient to have acquired him a great name if he had written nothing but his prefaces or nothing but his songs or his prologues each of them would have entitled him to the preference and distinction of excelling in his kind  but i have forgot myself for nothing can be more unnecessary than an attempt to say any thing to your grace in commendation of the writings of this great poet since it is only to your knowledge taste and approbation of them that the monument which you are now about to raise to him is owing i will therefore my lord detain you no longer by this epistle and only entreat you to believe that it is addressed to your grace from no other motive than a sincere regard to the memory of mr dryden and a very sensible pleasure which i take in applauding an action by which you are so justly and so singularly entitled to a dedication of his labours though many years after his death and even though most of them were produced by him many years before you were born i am with the greatest respect  my lord  your graces most obedient  and most humble servant  william congreve     the wild gallant a comedy    the wild gallant  the editor may be pardoned in bestowing remarks upon drydens plays only in proportion to their intrinsic merit and to the attention which each has excited either at its first appearance or when the public attention has been since directed towards them in either point of view little need be said on the wild gallant it was drydens first theatrical production and its reception by no means augured his future preeminence in literature nor was it more than tolerated when afterwards revived under the sanction of his increasing fame it was brought upon the stage in february 16623 according to the conjecture of mr malone who observes that the following lines in the prologue    it should have been but one continued song   or at the least a dance of three hours long   must refer to davenants opera called the siege of rhodes acted in 1662 and that the expression in plays he finds you love mistakes alludes to the blunders of teague an irish footman in sir robert howards play of the committee the wild gallant was revived and published in 1669 with a new prologue and epilogue and some other alterations not of a nature judging from the prologue to improve the morality of the piece that the play had but indifferent success in the action the poet himself has informed us with the qualifying addition that it more than once was the divertisement of charles ii by his own command this honourable distinction it probably acquired by the influence of the countess of castlemaine then the royal favourite to whom dryden addresses some verses on her encouraging this playsee vol xi p 18the plot is borrowed avowedly from the spanish and partakes of the unnatural incongruity common to the dramatic pieces of that nation as also of the bustle and intrigue with which they are usually embroiled few modern audiences would endure the absurd grossness of the deceit practised on lord nonsuch in the fourth act nor is the plot of lady constance to gain her lover by marrying him in the disguise of a heathen divinity more grotesque than unnaturalyet in the under characters some liveliness of dialogue is maintained and the reader may be amused with particular scenes though as a whole the early fate of the play was justly merited  these passages in which the plot stands still while the spectators are entertained with flippant dialogue and repartee are ridiculed in the scene betwixt prince prettyman and tom thimble in the rehearsal the facetious mr bibber being the original of the latter personage the character of trice at least his whimsical humour of drinking playing at dice by himself and quarrelling as if engaged with a successful gamester is imitated from the character of carlo in jonsons every man out of his humour who drinks with a supposed companion quarrels about the pledge and tosses about the cups and flasks in the imaginary brawl we have heard similar frolics related of a bonvivant of the last generation inventor of a game called solitaire who used to complain of the hardship of drinking by himself because the toast came too often about  the whole piece seems to have been intended as a sacrifice to popular taste and perhaps our poet only met a deserved fate when he stooped to sooth the depraved appetite which his talents enabled him to have corrected and purified something like this feeling may be interred from the last lines of the second epilogue  would you but change for serious plot and verse this motley garniture of fool and farce nor scorn a mode because tis taught at home which dues like vestsa our gravity become our poet yields you should this play refuse as tradesmen by the change of fashions lose with some content their fripperies of france in hope it may their staple trade advance  footnote a this seems to allude to the polish dress which upon his restoration charles wished to introduce into britain it was not altered for the french till his intimacy with that court was cemented by pecuniary dependence  in the prologue the author indulges himself in a display of the terms of astrology of which vain science he was a believer and a student     preface   it would be a great impudence in me to say much of a comedy which has had but indifferent success in the action i made the town my judges and the greater part condemned it after which i do not think it my concernment to defend it with the ordinary zeal of a poet for his decried poem though corneille is more resolute in his preface before his pertharitea which was condemned more universally than this for he avows boldly that in spite of censure his play was well and regularly written which is more than i dare say for mine yet it was received at court and was more than once the divertisement of his majesty by his own command but i have more modesty than to ascribe that to my merit which was his particular act of grace it was the first attempt i made in dramatic poetry and i find since a very bold one to begin with comedy which is the most difficult part of it the plot was not originally my own but so altered by me whether for the better or worse i know not that whoever the author was he could not have challenged a scene of it i doubt not but you will see in it the uncorrectness of a young writer which is yet but a small excuse for him who is so little amended since the best apology i can make for it and the truest is only this that you have since that time received with applause as bad and as uncorrect plays from other men  footnote a le succés de cette tragédie à été si malheureux que pour mepargner le chagrin de men

tis true but now your love and hatred judge not you and cruel factions bribed by interest come not to weigh merit but to give their doom our poet therefore jealous of th event and though much boldness

occasion having brought you here you are too grateful to become severe there is not any person here so mean but he may freely judge each act and scene but if you bid him chuse his judges then he boldly names true english gentlemen for he neer thought a handsome garb or dress so great a crime to make their judgment less and with these gallants he these ladies joins to judge that language their converse refines but if their censures should condemn his play far from disputing he does only pray he may leanders destiny obtain now spare him drown him when he comes again    epilogue  when revived

slaves began so you at each new play must have a man hither you come as to see prizes fought if no bloods drawn you cry the prize is naught but fools grow wary now and when they see a poet eyeing round the company straight eachman for himself begins to doubt they shrink like seamen when a press comes out few of them will be found for public use except you charge an oaf upon each house like the train bands and every man engage for a sufficient fool to serve the stage and when with much ado you get him there where he in all his glory should appear your poets make him such rare things to say that hes more wit than any man i th play but of so ill a mingle with the rest as when a parrots taught to break a jest thus aiming to be fine they make a show as tawdry squires in country churches do things well considered tis so hard to make a comedy which should the knowing take that our dull poet in despair to please does humbly beg by me his writ of ease tis a landtax which hes too poor to pay you therefore must some other impost lay would you but change for serious plot and verse this motely garniture of fool and farce nor scorn a mode because tis taught at home which does like vests our gravity become our poet yields you should this play refuse as tradesmen by the change of fashions lose with some content their fripperies of france in hope it may their staple trade advance     the rival ladies  a tragicomedy    the rival ladies   this play like that which preceded it is a drama of intrigue borrowed from the spanish and claiming merit only in proportion to the diversity and ingenuity of the incidents represented on this point every reader can decide for himself and it would be an invidious task to point out blemishes where to own the truth there are but few beauties the ease with which the affections of almost every female in the drama are engrossed by gonsalvo and afterwards transferred to the lovers upon whom the winding up of the plot made it necessary to devolve them will it is probable strike every reader as unnatural in truth when the depraved appetite of the public requires to be gratified by trick and bustle instead of nature and sentiment authors must sacrifice the probable as well as the simple process of events  the author seems principally to have valued himself on this piece because it contains some scenes executed in rhyme in what was then called the heroic manner upon this opinion which dryden lived to retract i have ventured to offer my sentiments in the life of the author in other respects though not slow in perceiving and avouching his own merit our author seems to consider the rival ladies as no very successful dramatic effort  the rival ladies is supposed to have been first acted in 1663 and was certainly published in the year following of its success we know nothing particular it is probable the flowing verse into which some part of the dialogue is thrown with the strong point and antithesis which distinguishes drydens works and particularly his argumentative poetry tended to redeem the credit of the author of the wild gallant    the right honourable roger earl of orrery1  footnote 1 this distinguished person was fifth son of richard boyle known by the title of the great earl of cork his first title was lord broghill under which he distinguished himself in ireland cromwell although his lordship was a noted royalist and in actual correspondence with the exiled monarch had so much confidence in his honour and talents that he almost compelled him to act as lord lieutenant of that kingdom under the stipulation that he was to come under no oaths and only to act against the rebel irish then the common enemy he was instrumental in the restoration and created earl of orrery by charles ii in 1660 he deserved drydens panegyric in every respect except as a poetthe very character however in which he is most complimented and perhaps was best pleased to be so he wrote 1st the art of war2d parthenissa a romance3d some poems4th eight plays5th state tracts   my lord  this worthless present was designed you long before it was a play when it was only a confused mass of thoughts tumbling over one another in the dark when the fancy was yet in its first work moving the sleeping images of things towards the light there to be distinguished and then either chosen or rejected by the judgment it was yours my lord before i could call it mine and i confess in that first tumult of my thoughts there appeared a disorderly kind of beauty in some of them which gave me hope something worthy my lord of orrery might be drawn from them but i was then in that eagerness of imagination which by overpleasing fanciful men flatters them into the danger of writing so that when i had moulded it into that shape it now bears i looked with such disgust upon it that the censures of our severest critics are charitable to what i thought and still think of it myself it is so far from me to believe this perfect that i am apt to conclude our best plays are scarcely so for the stage being the representation of the world and the actions in it how can it be imagined that the picture of human life can be more exact than life itself is he may be allowed sometimes to err who undertakes to move so many characters and humours as are requisite in a play in those narrow channels which are proper to each of them to conduct his imaginary persons through so many various intrigues and chances as the labouring audience shall think them lost under every billow and then at length to work them so naturally out of their distresses that when the whole plot is laid open the spectators may rest satisfied that every cause was powerful enough to produce the effect it had and that the whole chain of them was with such due order linked together that the first accident would naturally beget the second till they all rendered the conclusion necessary  these difficulties my lord may reasonably excuse the errors of my undertaking but for this confidence of my dedication i have an argument which is too advantageous for me not to publish it to the world it is the kindness your lordship has continually shown to all my writings you have been pleased my lord they should sometimes cross the irish seas to kiss your hands which passage contrary to the experience of others i have found the least dangerous in the world your favour has shone upon me at a remote distance without the least knowledge of my person and like the influence of the heavenly bodies you have done good without knowing to whom you did it it is this virtue in your lordship which emboldens me to this attempt for did i not consider you as my patron i have little reason to desire you for my judge and should appear with as much awe before you in the reading as i had when the full theatre sat upon the action for who could so severely judge of faults as he who has given testimony he commits none your excellent poems have afforded that knowledge of it to the world that your enemies are ready to upbraid you with it as a crime for a man of business to write so well neither durst i have justified your lordship in it if examples of it had not been in the world before you if xenophon had not written a romance and a certain roman called augustus caesar a tragedy and epigrams but their writing was the entertainment of their pleasure yours is only a diversion of your pain the muses have seldom employed your thoughts but when some violent fit of the gout has snatched you from affairs of state and like the priestess of apollo you never come to deliver his oracles but unwillingly and in torment so that we are obliged to your lordships misery for our delight you treat us with the cruel pleasure of a turkish triumph where those who cut and wound their bodies sing songs of victory as they pass and divert others with their own sufferings other men endure their diseases your lordship only can enjoy them plotting and writing in this kind are certainly more troublesome employments than many which signify more and are of greater moment in the world the fancy memory and judgment are then extended like so many limbs upon the rack all of them reaching with their utmost stress at nature a thing so almost infinite and boundless as can never fully be comprehended but where the images of all things are always present yet i wonder not your lordship succeeds so well in this attempt the knowledge of men is your daily practice in the world to work and bend their stubborn minds which go not all after the same grain but each of them so particular a way that the same common humours in several persons must be wrought upon by several means thus my lord your sickness is but the imitation of your health the poet but subordinate to the statesman in you you still govern men with the same address and manage business with the same prudence allowing it here as in the world the due increase and growth till it comes to the just height and then turning it when it is fully ripe and nature calls out as it were to be delivered with this only advantage of ease to you in your poetry that you have fortune here at your command with which wisdom does often unsuccessfully struggle in the world here is no chance which you have not foreseen all your heroes are more than your subjects they are your creatures and though they seem to move freely in all the sallies of their passions yet you make destinies for them which they cannot shun they are moved if i may dare to say so like the rational creatures of the almighty poet who walk at liberty in their own opinion because their fetters are invisible when indeed the prison of their will is the more sure for being large and instead of an absolute power over their actions they have only a wretched desire of doing that which they cannot chuse but do1  footnote 1 the earl of orrery was author of several plays if the reader is not disposed to admit that his habit of composing them when tormented by the gout enhanced their value it may be allowed to apologise for their faults  i have dwelt my lord thus long upon your writing not because you deserve not greater and more noble commendations but because i am not equally able to express them in other subjects like an ill swimmer i have willingly staid long in my own depth and though i am eager of performing more yet am loth to venture out beyond my knowledge for beyond your poetry my lord all is ocean to me to speak of you as a soldier or a statesman were only to betray my own ignorance and i could hope no better success from it than that miserable rhetorician had who solemnly declaimed before hannibal of the conduct of armies and the art of war i can only say in general that the souls of other men shine out at little crannies they understand some one thing perhaps to admiration while they are darkened on all the other parts but your lordships soul is an entire globe of light breaking out on every side and if i have only discovered one beam of it it is not that the light falls unequally but because the body which receives it is of unequal parts  the acknowledgment of which is a fair occasion offered me to retire from the consideration of your lordship to that of myself i here present you my lord with that in print which you had the goodness not to dislike upon the stage and account it happy to have met you here in england it being at best like small wines to be drunk out upon the place and has not body enough to endure the sea  i know not whether i have been so careful of the plot and language as i ought but for the latter i have endeavoured to write english as near as i could distinguish it from the tongue of pedants and that of affected travellers only i am sorry that speaking so noble a language as we do we have not a more certain measure of it as they have in france where they have an academy erected for that purpose and endowed with large privileges by the present king i wish we might at length leave to borrow words from other nations which is now a wantonness in us not a necessity but so long as some affect to speak them there will not want others who will have the boldness to write them  but i fear lest defending the received words i shall be accused for following the new way i mean of writing scenes in verse though to speak properly it is not so much a new way amongst us as an old way new revived for many years before shakspeares plays was the tragedy of queen gorboduc in english verse written by that famous lord buckhurst afterwards earl of dorset and progenitor to that excellent person who as he inherits his soul and title i wish may inherit his good fortune1 but supposing our countrymen had not received this writing till of late shall we oppose ourselves to the most polished and civilised nations of europe shall we with the same singularity oppose the world in this as most of us do in pronouncing latin or do we desire that the brand which barclay has i hope unjustly laid upon the english should still continue angli suos ac sua omnia impense mirantur caeteras nationes despectui habent all the spanish and italian tragedies i have yet seen are writ in rhyme for the french i do not name them because it is the fate of our countrymen to admit little of theirs among us but the basest of their men the extravagancies of their fashions and the frippery of their merchandise shakspeare who with some errors not to be avoided in that age had undoubtedly a larger soul of poesy than ever any of our nation was the first who to shun the pains of continual rhyming inventeda that kind of writing which we call blank verse but the french more properly prose mesuré into which the english tongue so naturally slides that in writing prose it is hardly to be avoided and therefore i admire some men should perpetually stumble in a way so easy and inverting the order of their words constantly close their lines with verbs which though commended sometimes in writing latin yet we were whipt at westminster if we used it twice together i knew some who if they were to write in blank verse sir i ask your pardon would think it sounded more heroically to write sir i your pardon ask i should judge him to have little command of english whom the necessity of a rhyme should force often upon this rock though sometimes it cannot easily be avoided and indeed this is the only inconvenience with which rhyme can be charged this is that which makes them say rhyme is not natural it being only so when the poet either makes a vicious choice of words or places them for rhyme sake so unnaturally as no man would in ordinary speaking but when it is so judiciously ordered that the first word in the verse seems to beget the second and that the next till that becomes the last word in the line which in the negligence of prose would be so it must then be granted rhyme has all the advantages of prose besides its own but the excellence and dignity of it were never fully known till mr waller taught it he first made writing easily an art first shewed us to conclude the sense most commonly in distichs which in the verse of those before him runs on for so many lines together that the reader is out of breath to overtake it this sweetness of mr wallers lyric poesy was afterwards followed in the epic by sir john denham in his coopershill a poem which your lordship knows for the majesty of the style is and ever will be the exact standard of good writing but if we owe the invention of it to mr waller we are acknowledging for the noblest use of it to sir william davenant who at once brought it upon the stage and made it perfect in the siege of rhodes  footnote 1 the tragedy of ferrex and perrex which is the proper title was written by thomas sackville lord buckhurst afterwards earl of dorset and thomas norton a barrister at law in sackvilles part of the play which comprehends the two last acts there is some poetry worthy of the author of the sublime introduction to the mirror of magistrates while both the authors were out of england one william griffiths published a spurious copy under the title of gorboduc the name of one of the principal personages who is not however queen but king of england but what was a wider mistake considering drydens purpose of mentioning the work it is not written in rhyme but in blank verse excepting the choruses which are in stanzas of six lines the name of the queen is videna sir philip sydney says gorboduc is full of stately speeches and well sounding phrases climbing up to the height of seneca his style and as full of notable morality which it doth most delightfully teach and thereby obtain the very end of poetry  footnote a this is a mistake marlow and several other dramatic authors used blank verse before the days of shakspeare  the advantages which rhyme has over blank verse are so many that it were lost time to name them sir philip sidney in his defence of poesy gives us one which in my opinion is not the least considerable i mean the help it brings to memory which rhyme so knits up by the affinity of sounds that by remembering the last word in one line we often call to mind both the verses then in the quickness of repartees which in discoursive scenes fall very often it has so particular a grace and is so aptly suited to them that the sudden smartness of the answer and the sweetness of the rhyme set off the beauty of each other but that benefit which i consider most in it because i have not seldom found it is that it bounds and circumscribes the fancy for imagination in a poet is a faculty so wild and lawless that like an highranging spaniel it must have clogs tied to it lest it outrun the judgment the great easiness of blank verse renders the poet too luxuriant he is tempted to say many things which might better be omitted or at least shut up in fewer words but when the difficulty of artful rhyming is interposed where the poet commonly confines his sense to his couplet and must contrive that sense into such words that the rhyme shall naturally follow them not they the rhyme the fancy then gives leisure to the judgment to come in which seeing so heavy a tax imposed is ready to cut off all unnecessary expences this last consideration has already answered an objection which some have made that rhyme is only an embroidery of sense to make that which is ordinary in itself pass for excellent with less examination but certainly that which most regulates the fancy and gives the judgment its busiest employment is like to bring forth the richest and clearest thoughts the poet examines that most which he produceth with the greatest leisure and which he knows must pass the severest test of the audience because they are aptest to have it ever in their memory as the stomach makes the best concoction when it strictly embraces the nourishment and takes account of every little particle as it passes through but as the best medicines may lose their virtue by being ill applied so is it with verse if a fit subject be not chosen for it neither must the argument alone but the characters and persons be great and noble otherwise as scaliger says of claudian the poet will be ignobitiore materiâ depressus the scenes which in my opinion most commend it are those of argumentation and discourse on the result of which the doing or not doing some considerable action should depend  but my lord though i have more to say upon this subject yet i must remember it is your lordship to whom i speak who have much better commended this way by your writing in it than i can do by writing for it where my reasons cannot prevail i am sure your lordships example must your rhetoric has gained my cause at least the greatest part of my design has already succeeded to my wish which was to interest so noble a person in the quarrel and withal to testify to the world how happy i esteem myself in the honour of being  my lord  your lordships most

sir robert howard and mr dryden    the indian queen  the plays of sir robert howard were tolerated by his contemporaries on account of the rank gallantry and loyalty of the author at least we are now unable to discover any better reason for their success the committee alone kept possession of the stage till our time and that solely supported by the humours of teague an honest blundering irish footman such as we usually see in a modern farce from a hint given by langbaine sir robert howard seems to have been suspected of frequent plagiarisms at any rate it is certain that in the composition of the indian queen he was so fortunate as to have the assistance of our great poet who was bound to him by ties of personal obligation  it is of course difficult even to guess at the share which dryden had in the indian queen several of the characters have a strong resemblance to others which he afterwards drew in bolder colours thus montezuma who like the hero of an ancient romance bears fortune to any side which he pleases to espouse is justly pointed out by settle as the prototype of almanzor though we look in vain for the glowing language which though sometimes bordering on burlesque suits so well the extravagant character of the moorish hero zempoalla strongly resembles nourmuhal in aurengzebe both shewing that high spirit of pride with which dryden has often invested his female characters the language of the indian queen possesses in general greater ease and a readier flow of verse than sir robert howard appears to have possessed when unassisted of this he seems himself to have been sensible and alludes to drydens acknowledged superiority when maintaining against him the cause of dramatic blank verse as preferable to rhyme1 besides general hints towards the conception of the characters and a superintendance of the dialogue it is probable that dryden wrote some entire scenes of the following piece in the third act particularly the passage respecting the incantation which resembles that in the indian emperor has strong traces of our authors manner  footnote 1 but writing the epistle in so much haste i had almost forgot one argument or observation which that author dryden has most good fortune in it is in his epistle dedicatory before his essay of dramatic poesie where speaking of rhyme in plays he desires it may be observed that none are violent against it but such as have not attempted it or who have succeeded ill in the attempt which as to myself and him i easily acknowledgefor i confess none has written in that way better than himself nor few worse than i  introduction to the great favourite or the duke of lerma  the indian queen was acted in 1664 and received says langbaine with great applause it was printed in 1665    prologue  as the music plays a soft air the curtain rises slowly and discovers an indian boy and girl sleeping under two plantaintrees and when the curtain is almost up the music turns into a tune expressing an alarm at which the boy awakes and speaks   boy wake wake quevira our soft rest must cease and fly together with our countrys peace no more must we sleep under plantain shade which neither heat could pierce nor cold invade where bounteous nature never feels decay and opening buds drive falling fruits away  que why should men quarrel here where all possess as much as they can

scripsisse pudet quia plurima cerno   me quoque qui feci judice digna limi  ovid    to the most excellent and most illustrious princess anne duchess of monmouth and buccleuch wife to the most illustrious and highborn prince james duke of monmoutha  footnote a anne scott duchess of buccleuch and monmouth was the last scion of a race of warriors more remarkable for their exploits in the field than their address in courts or protection of literature she was the heiress of the scotts barons and earls of buccleuch and became countess in her own right upon the death of her elder sister lady mary who married the unfortunate walter scott earl of tarras and died without issue in 1662 in 1665 anne countess of buccleuch married james fitzroy duke of monmouth eldest natural son of charles ii they were afterwards created duke and duchess of buccleuch she was an accomplished and highspirited lady distinguished for her unblemished conduct in a profligate court it was her patronage which first established drydens popularity a circumstance too honourable to her memory to be here suppressed   may it please your grace the favour which heroic plays have lately found upon our theatres has been wholly derived to them from the countenance and approbation they have received at court the most eminent persons for wit and honour in the royal circle having so far owned them that they have judged no way so fit as verse to entertain a noble audience or to express a noble passion and among the rest which have been written in this kind they have been so indulgent to this poem as to allow it no inconsiderable place since therefore to the court i owe its fortune on the stage so being now more publicly exposed in print i humbly recommend it to your graces protection who by all knowing persons are esteemed a principal ornament of the court but though the rank which you hold in the royal family might direct the eyes of a poet to you yet your beauty and goodness detain and fix them high objects it is true attract the sight but it looks up with pain on craggy rocks and barren mountains and continues not intent on any object which is wanting in shades and greens to entertain it beauty in courts is so necessary to the young that those who are without it seem to be there to no other purpose than to wait on the triumphs of the fair to attend their motions in obscurity as the moon and stars do the sun by day or at best to be the refuge of those hearts which others have despised and by the unworthiness of both to give and take a miserable comfort but as needful as beauty is virtue and honour are yet more the reign of it without their support is unsafe and short like that of tyrants every sun which looks on beauty wastes it and when it once is decaying the repairs of art are of as short continuance as the afterspring when the sun is going further off this madam is its ordinary fate but yours which is accompanied by virtue is not subject to that common destiny your grace has not only a long time of youth in which to flourish but you have likewise found the way by an untainted preservation of your honour to make that perishable good more lasting and if beauty like wines could be preserved by being mixed and embodied with others of their own natures then your graces would be immortal since no part of europe can afford a parallel to your noble lord in masculine beauty and in goodliness of shape to receive the blessings and prayers of mankind you need only to be seen together we are ready to conclude that you are a pair of angels sent below to make virtue amiable in your persons or to sit to poets when they would pleasantly instruct the age by drawing goodness in the most perfect and alluring shape of nature but though beauty be the theme on which poets love to dwell i must be forced to quit it as a private praise since you have deserved those which are more public for goodness and humanity which shine in you are virtues which concern mankind and by a certain kind of interest all people agree in their commendation because the profit of them may extend to many it is so much your inclination to do good that you stay not to be asked which is an approach so nigh the deity that human nature is not capable of a nearer it is my happiness that i can testify this virtue of your graces by my own experience since i have so great an aversion from soliciting courtfavours that i am ready to look on those as very bold who dare grow rich there without desert but i beg your graces pardon for assuming this virtue of modesty to myself which the sequel of this discourse will no way justify for in this address i have already quitted the character of a modest man by presenting you this poem as an acknowledgment which stands in need of your protection and which ought no more to be esteemed a present than it is accounted bounty in the poor when they bestow a child on some wealthy friend who will better breed it up offsprings of this nature are like to be so numerous with me that i must be forced to send some of them abroad only this is like to be more fortunate than his brothers because i have landed him on a hospitable shore under your patronage montezuma hopes he is more safe than in his native indies and therefore comes to throw himself at your graces feet paying that homage to your beauty which he refused to the violence of his conquerors he begs only that when he shall relate his sufferings you will consider him as an indian prince and not expect any other eloquence from his simplicity than what his griefs have furnished him withal his story is perhaps the greatest which was ever represented in a poem of this nature the action of it including the discovery and conquest of a new world in it i have neither wholly followed the truth of the history nor altogether left it but have taken all the liberty of a poet to add alter or diminish as i thought might best conduce to the beautifying of my work it being not the business of a poet to represent historical truth but probability but i am not to make the justification of this poem which i wholly leave to your graces mercy it is an irregular piece if compared with many of corneilles and if i may make a judgment of it written with more flame than art in which it represents the mind and intentions of the author who is with much more zeal and integrity than design and artifice  madam your graces most obedient and most obliged servant john dryden october 12 1667    betwixt 1664 when our author assisted sir robert howard in composing the preceding play and the printing of the indian emperor in 1668 some disagreement had arisen betwixt them sir robert appears to have given the first provocation by prefixing to his tragedy of the duke of lerma or great favourite in 1668 some remarks which drew down the following severe retort it is therefore necessary to mention the contents of the offensive preface  sir robert howard begins as one taking leave of the drama and dramatic authors his too long acquaintances and unwilling again to venture into the civil wars of censure  ubinullos habitura triumphos  he states his unwilling interference to be owing to the unnecessary understanding of some who endeavoured to apply as strict rules to poetry as mathematics which rendered it incumbent on him to justify his having written some scenes of his tragedy in blank verse in the next paragraph dryden is expressly pointed out as the author of the essay on dramatic poetry and is ridiculed for attempting to prove not that rhyme is more natural in a dialogue on the stage supposed to be spoken extempore but grander and more expressive in like manner sir robert unfortunately banters our author for drawing from seneca an instance of a lofty mode of expressing so ordinary a thing as shutting a doora instead of giving an example to the same effect in english  footnote a  reserate clusos regii postes laris  howards mistranslation of this passage seems to have been inadvertent in the essay it is rendered  set wide the palace gates  the author of the duke of lerma proceeds to attack the unities arguing because it is impossible that the stage can represent exactly a house or that the time of acting can be extended to twentyfour hours therefore it is needless there should be any limitation whatever as to time or place since otherwise it must be inferred that there are degrees in impossibility and that one thing may be more impossible than another  the whole tone of the preface is that of one who wished to have it supposed that he was writing concerning a subject rather beneath his notice and only felt himself called forth to do so by the dogmatism of those who laid down confident rules or laws in matters so trifling this affectation of supercilious censure appears deeply to have provoked dryden and prompted the acrimony of the following defence which he prefixed to a second edition of the indian emperor published in 1668 probably shortly after the offence had been given the angry friends were afterwards reconciled and dryden listening more to the feelings of former kindness than of recent passion cancelled the defence which was never afterwards reprinted till congreve collected our authors dramatic works it is worthy of preservation as it would be difficult to point out deeper contempt and irony couched under language so temperate cold and outwardly respectful    a defence of an essay of dramatic poesy being an answer to the preface of the great favourite or the duke of lerma   the former edition of the indian emperor being full of faults which had escaped the printer i have been willing to overlook this second with more care and though i could not allow myself so much time as was necessary yet by that little i have done the press is freed from some errors which it had to answer for before as for the more material faults of writing which are properly mine though i see many of them i want leisure to amend them it is enough for those who make one poem the business of their lives to leave that correct yet excepting virgil i never met with any which was so in any language  but while i was thus employed about this impression there came to my hands a new printed play called the great favourite or the duke of lerma the author of which a noble and most ingenious person has done me the favour to make some observations and animadversions upon my dramatic essay i must confess he might have better consulted his reputation than by matching himself with so weak an adversary but if his honour be diminished in the choice of his antagonist it is sufficiently recompensed in the election of his cause which being the weaker in all appearance as combating the received opinions of the best ancient and modern authors will add to his glory if he overcome and to the opinion of his generosity if he be vanquished since he engages at so great odds and so like a cavalier undertakes the protection of the weaker party i have only to fear on my own behalf that so good a cause as mine may not suffer by my ill management or weak defence yet i cannot in honour but take the glove when it is offered me though i am only a champion by succession and no more able to defend the right of aristotle and horace than an infant dimocka to maintain the title of a king  footnote a the family of dimock or dymock are hereditary champions of england and as such obliged to maintain the kings title in single combat against all challengers  for my own concernment in the controversy it is so small that i can easily be contented to be driven from a few notions of dramatic poesy especially by one who has the reputation of understanding all things and i might justly make that excuse for my yielding to him which the philosopher made to the emperor why should i offer to contend with him who is master of more than twenty legions of arts and sciences but i am forced to fight and therefore it will be no shame to be overcome  yet i am so much his servant as not to meddle with any thing which does not concern me in his preface therefore i leave the good sense and other excellencies of the first twenty lines to be considered by the critics as for the play of the duke of lerma having so much altered and beautified it as he has done it can justly belong to none but him indeed they must be extremely ignorant as well as envious who would rob him of that honour for you see him putting in his claim to it even in the first two lines    repulse upon repulse like waves thrown back   that slide to hung upon obdurate rocks  after this let detraction do its worst for if this be not his it deserves to be for my part i declare for distributive justice and from this and what follows he certainly deserves those advantages which he acknowledges to have received from the opinion of sober men  in the next place i must beg leave to observe his great address in courting the reader to his party for intending to assault all poets both ancient and modern he discovers not his whole design at once but seems only to aim at me and attacks me on my weakest side my defence of verse  to begin with me he gives me the compellation of the author of a dramatic essay which is a little discourse in dialogue for the most part borrowed from the observations of others therefore that i may not be wanting to him in civility i return his compliment by calling him the author of the duke of lerma  but that i may pass over his salute he takes notice of my great pains to prove rhyme as natural in a serious play and more effectual than blank verse thus indeed i did state the question but he tells me i pursue that which i call natural in a wrong application for tis not the question whether rhyme or not rhyme be best or most natural for a serious subject but what is nearest the nature of that it represents  if i have formerly mistaken the question i must confess my ignorance so far as to say i continue still in my mistake but he ought to have proved that i mistook it for it is yet but gratis dictum i still shall think i have gained my point if i can prove that rhyme is best or most natural for a serious subject as for the question as he states it whether rhyme be nearest the nature of what it represents i wonder he should think me so ridiculous as to dispute whether prose or verse be nearest to ordinary conversation  it still remains for him to prove his inference that since verse is granted to be more remote than prose from ordinary conversation therefore no serious plays ought to be writ in verse and when he clearly makes that good i will acknowledge his victory as absolute as he can desire it  the question now is which of us two has mistaken it and if it appear i have not the world will suspect what gentleman that was who was allowed to speak twice in parliament because he had not yet spoken to the questiona and perhaps conclude it to be the same who as it is reported maintained a contradiction in terminis in the face of three hundred persons  footnote a a sneer which sir robert aims at dryden dryden had written twice on the question of rhyming tragedies  but to return to verse whether it be natural or not in plays is a problem which is not demonstrable of either side it is enough for me that he acknowledges he had rather read good verse than prose for if all the enemies of verse will confess as much i shall not need to prove that it is natural i am satisfied if it cause delight for delight is the chief if not the only end of poesy instruction can be admitted but in the second place for poesy only instructs as it delights it is true that to imitate well is a poets work but to affect the soul and excite the passions and above all to move admiration which is the delight of serious plays a bare imitation will not serve the converse therefore which a poet is to imitate must be heightened with all the arts and ornaments of poesy and must be such as strictly considered could never be supposed spoken by any without premeditation  as for what he urges that a play will still be supposed to be a composition of several persons speaking extempore and that good verses are the hardest things which can be imagined to be so spoken i must crave leave to dissent from his opinion as to the former part of it for if i am not deceived a play is supposed to be the work of the poet imitating or representing the conversation of several persons and this i think to be as clear as he thinks the contrary  but i will be bolder and do not doubt to make it good though a paradox that one great reason why prose is not to be used in serious plays is because it is too near the nature of converse there may be too great a likeness as the most skilful painters affirm that there may be too near a resemblance in a picture to take every lineament and feature is not to make an excellent piece but to take so much only as will make a beautiful resemblance of the whole and with an ingenious flattery of nature to heighten the beauties of some parts and hide the deformities of the rest for so says horace    ut pictura poesis erit c   haec amat obscurum vult haec sub luce videri   judicis argutum quae formidat acumen                               et quae   desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit  in bartholomew fair or the lowest kind of comedy that degree of heightening is used which is proper to set off that subject it is true the author was not there to go out of prose as he does in his higher arguments of comedy the fox and alchemist yet he does so raise his matter in that prose as to render it delightful which he could never have performed had he only said or done those very things that are daily spoken or practised in the fair for then the fair itself would be as full of pleasure to an ingenious person as the play which we manifestly see it is not but he hath made an excellent lazar of it the copy is of price though the original be vile you see in catiline and sejanus where the argument is great he sometimes ascends to verse which shews he thought it not unnatural in serious plays and had his genius been as proper for rhyme as it was for humour or had the age in which he lived attained to as much knowledge in verse as ours it is probable he would have adorned those subjects with that kind of writing  thus prose though the rightful prince yet is by common consent deposed as too weak for the government of serious plays and he failing there now start up two competitors one the nearer in blood which is blank verse the other more fit for the ends of government which is rhyme blank verse is indeed the nearer prose but he is blemished with the weakness of his predecessor rhyme for i will deal clearly has somewhat of the usurper in him but he is brave and generous and his dominion pleasing for this reason of delight the ancients whom i will still believe as wise as those who so confidently correct them wrote all their tragedies in verse though they knew it most remote from conversation  but i perceive i am falling into the danger of another rebuke from my opponent for when i plead that the ancients used verse i prove not that they would have admitted rhyme had it then been written all i can say is only this that it seems to have succeeded verse by the general consent of poets in all modern languages for almost all their serious plays are written in it which though it be no demonstration that therefore they ought to be so yet at least the practice first and then the continuation of it shews that it attained the end which was to please and if that cannot be compassed here i will be the first who shall lay it down for i confess my chief endeavours are to delight the age in which i live if the humour of this be for low comedy small accidents and raillery i will force my genius to obey it though with more reputation i could write in verse i know i am not so fitted by nature to write comedy i want that gaiety of humour which is required to it my conversation is slow and dull my humour saturnine and reserved in short i am none of those who endeavour to break jests in company or make repartees so that those who decry my comedies do me no injury except it be in point of profit reputation in them is the last thing to which i shall pretend i beg pardon for entertaining the reader with so ill a subject but before i quit that argument which was the cause of this digression i cannot but take notice how i am corrected for my quotation of seneca in my defence of plays in verse my words are these our language is noble full and significant and i know not why he who is a master of it may not clothe ordinary things in it as decently as in the latin if he use the same diligence in his choice of words one would think unlock a door was a thing as vulgar as could be spoken yet seneca could make it sound high and lofty in his latin  reserate clusos regii postes laris  but he says of me that being filled with the precedents of the ancients who writ their plays in verse i commend the thing declaring our language to be full noble and significant and charging all defects upon the ill placing of words which i prove by quoting seneca loftily expressing such an ordinary thing as shutting a door  here he manifestly mistakes for i spoke not of the placing but of the choice of words for which i quoted that aphorism of julius caesar delectus verborum est origo eloquentiae but delectus verborum is no more latin for the placing of words than reserate is latin for shut the door as he interprets it which i ignorantly construed unlock or open it  he supposes i was highly affected with the sound of those words and i suppose i may more justly imagine it of him for if he had not been extremely satisfied with the sound he would have minded the sense a little better  but these are now to be no faults for ten days after his book is published and that his mistakes are grown so famous that they are come back to him he sends his errataa to be printed and annexed to his play and desires that instead of shutting you would read opening which it seems was the printers fault i wonder at his modesty that he did not rather say it was senecas or mine and that in some authors reserate was to shut as well as to open as the word barach say the learned is both to bless and curse  footnote a this erratum has been suffered to remain in the edition of the knights plays now before us published in 1692  well since it was the printer he was a naughty man to commit the same mistake twice in six lines i warrant you delectus verborum for placing of words was his mistake too though the author forgot to tell him of it if it were my book i assure you i should for those rascals ought to be the proxies of every gentleman author and to be chastised for him when he is not pleased to own an error yet since he has given the errata i wish he would have enlarged them only a few sheets more and then he would have spared me the labour of an answer for this cursed printer is so given to mistakes that there is scarce a sentence in the preface without some false grammar or hard sense in it which will all be charged upon the poet because he is so goodnatured as to lay but three errors to the printers account and to take the rest upon himself who is better able to support them but he needs not apprehend that i should strictly examine those little faults except i am called upon to do it i shall return therefore to that quotation of seneca and answer not to what he writes but to what he means i never intended it as an argument but only as an illustration of what i had said before concerning the election of words and all he can charge me with is only this that if seneca could make an ordinary thing sound well in latin by the choice of words the same with the like care might be performed in english if it cannot i have committed an error on the right hand by commending too much the copiousness and wellsounding of our language which i hope my countrymen will pardon me at least the words which follow in my dramatic essay will plead somewhat in my behalf for i say there that this objection happens but seldom in a play and then too either the meanness of the expression may be avoided or shut out from the verse by breaking it in the midst  but i have said too much in the defence of verse for after all it is a very indifferent thing to me whether it obtain or not i am content hereafter to be ordered by his rule that is to write it sometimes because it pleases me and so much the rather because he has declared that it pleases him but he has taken his last farewell of the muses and he has done it civilly by honouring them with the name of his long acquaintances which is a compliment they have scarce deserved from him for my own part i bear a share in the public loss and how emulous soever i may be of his fame and reputation i cannot but give this testimony of his style that it is extremely poetical even in oratory his thoughts elevated sometimes above common apprehension his notions politic and grave and tending to the instruction of princes and reformation of states that they are abundantly interlaced with variety of fancies tropes and figures which the critics have enviously branded with the name of obscurity and false grammar  well he is now fettered in business of more unpleasant nature the muses have lost him but the commonwealth gains by it the corruption of a poet is the generation of a statesman  he will not venture again into the civil wars of censure ubinullos habitura triumphos if he had not told us he had left the muses we might have half suspected it by that word ubi which does not any way belong to them in that place the rest of the verse is indeed lucans but that ubi i will answer for it is his own yet he has another reason for this disgust of poesy for he says immediately after that the manner of plays which are now in most esteem is beyond his power to perform to perform the manner of a thing i confess is new english to me however he condemns not the satisfaction of others but rather their unnecessary understanding who like sancho panzas doctor prescribe too strictly to our appetites for says he in the difference of tragedy and comedy and of farce itself there can be no determination but by the taste nor in the manner of their composure  we shall see him now as great a critic as he was a poet and the reason why he excelled so much in poetry will be evident for it will appear to have proceeded from the exactness of his judgment in the difference of tragedy comedy and farce itself there can be no determination but by the taste i will not quarrel with the obscurity of his phrase though i justly might but beg his pardon if i do not rightly understand him if he means that there is no essential difference betwixt comedy tragedy and farce but what is only made by the peoples taste which distinguishes one of them from the other that is so manifest an error that i need not lose time to contradict it were there neither judge taste nor opinion in the world yet they would differ in their natures for the action character and language of tragedy would still be great and high that of comedy lower and more familiar admiration would be the delight of one and satire of the other  i have but briefly touched upon these things because whatever his words are i can scarce imagine that he who is always concerned for the true honour of reason and would have no spurious issue fathered upon her should mean any thing so absurd as to affirm that there is no difference betwixt comedy and tragedy but what is made by the taste only unless he would have us understand the comedies of my lord l where the first act should be pottages the second fricassees c and the fifth a chere entiere of women  i rather guess he means that betwixt one comedy or tragedy and another there is no other difference but what is made by the liking or disliking of the audience this is indeed a less error than the former but yet it is a great one the liking or disliking of the people gives the play the denomination of good or bad but does not really make or constitute it such to please the people ought to be the poets aim because plays are made for their delight but it does not follow that they are always pleased with good plays or that the plays which please them are always good the humour of the people is now for comedy therefore in hope to please them i write comedies rather than serious plays and so far their taste prescribes to me but it does not follow from that reason that comedy is to be preferred before tragedy in its own nature for that which is so in its own nature cannot be otherwise as a man cannot but be a rational creature but the opinion of the people may alter and in another age or perhaps in this serious plays may be set up above comedies  this i think a sufficient answer if it be not he has provided me of an excuse it seems in his wisdom he foresaw my weakness and has found out this expedient for me that it is not necessary for poets to study strict reason since they are so used to a greater latitude than is allowed by that severe inquisition that they must infringe their own jurisdiction to profess themselves obliged to argue well  i am obliged to him for discovering to me this back door but i am not yet resolved on my retreat for i am of opinion that they cannot be good poets who are not accustomed to argue well false reasonings and colours of speech are the certain marks of one who does not understand the stage for moral truth is the mistress of the poet as much as of the philosopher poesy must resemble natural truth but it must be ethical indeed the poet dresses truth and adorns nature but does not alter them  ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris  therefore that is not the best poesy which resembles notions of things that are not to things that are though the fancy may be great and the words flowing yet the soul is but half satisfied when there is not truth in the foundation this is that which makes virgil be preferred before the rest of poets in variety of fancy and sweetness of expression you see ovid far above him for virgil rejected many of those things which ovid wrote a great wits great work is to refuse as my worthy friend sir john berkenhead has ingeniously expressed it you rarely meet with any thing in virgil but truth which therefore leaves the strongest impression of pleasure in the soul this i thought myself obliged to say in behalf of poesy and to declare though it be against myself that when poets do not argue well the defect is in the workmen not in the art  and now i come to the boldest part of his discourse wherein he attacks not me but all the ancients and moderns and undermines as he thinks the very foundations on which dramatic poesy is built i could wish he would have declined that envy which must of necessity follow such an undertaking and contented himself with triumphing over me in my opinions of verse which i will never hereafter dispute with him but he must pardon me if i have that veneration for aristotle horace ben jonson and corneille that i dare not serve him in such a cause and against such heroes but rather fight under their protection as homer reports of little teucer who shot the trojans from under the large buckler of ajax telamon  greek stae d ax up aiantos sachei telamoniadao he stood beneath his brothers ample shield and covered there shot death through all the field  the words of my noble adversary are these  but if we examine the general rules laid down for plays by strict reason we shall find the errors equally gross for the great foundation which is laid to build upon is nothing as it is generally stated as will appear upon the examination of the particulars  these particulars in due time shall be examined in the mean while let us consider what this great foundation is which he says is nothing as it is generally stated i never heard of any other foundation of dramatic poesy than the imitation of nature neither was there ever pretended any other by the ancients or moderns or me who endeavour to follow them in that rule this i have plainly said in my definition of a play that it is a just and lively image of human nature c thus the foundation as it is generally stated will stand sure if this definition of a play be true if it be not he ought to have made his exception against it by proving that a play is not an imitation of nature but somewhat else which he is pleased to think it  but tis very plain that he has mistaken the foundation for that which is built upon it though not immediately for the direct and immediate consequence is this if nature be to be imitated then there is a rule for imitating nature rightly otherwise there may be an end and no means conducing to it hitherto i have proceeded by demonstration but as our divines when they have proved a deity because there is order and have inferred that this deity ought to be worshipped differ afterwards in the manner of the worship so having laid down that nature is to be imitated and that proposition proving the next that then there are means which conduce to the imitating of nature i dare proceed no farther positively but have only laid down some opinions of the ancients and moderns and of my own as means which they used and which i thought probable for the attaining of that end those means are the same which my antagonist calls the foundations how properly the world may judge and to prove that this is his meaning he clears it immediately to you by enumerating those rules or propositions against which he makes his particular exceptions as namely those of time and place in these words first we are told the plot should not be so ridiculously contrived as to crowd two several countries into one stage secondly to cramp the accidents of many years or days into the representation of two hours and an half and lastly a conclusion drawn that the only remaining dispute is concerning time whether it should be contained in twelve or twentyfour hours and the place to be limited to that spot of ground where the play is supposed to begin and this is called nearest nature for that is concluded most natural which is most probable and nearest to that which it presents  thus he has only made a small mistake of the means conducing to the end for the end itself and of the superstructure for the foundation but he proceeds  to shew therefore upon what ill grounds they dictate laws for dramatic poesy c he is here pleased to charge me with being magisterial as he has done in many other places of his preface therefore in vindication of myself i must crave leave to say that my whole discourse was sceptical according to that way of reasoning which was used by socrates plato and all the academics of old which tully and the best of the ancients followed and which is imitated by the modest inquisitions of the royal society that it is so not only the name will shew which is an essay but the frame and composition of the work you see it is a dialogue sustained by persons of several opinions all of them left doubtful to be determined by the readers in general and more particularly deferred to the accurate judgment of my lord buckhurst to whom i made a dedication of my book these are my words in my epistle speaking of the persons whom i introduced in my dialogue tis true they differed in their opinions as tis probable they would neither do i take upon me to reconcile but to relate them leaving your lordship to decide it in favour of that part which you shall judge most reasonable and after that in my advertisement to the reader i said this the drift of the ensuing discourse is chiefly to vindicate the honour of our english writers from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the french before them this i intimate lest any should think me so exceeding vain as to teach others an art which they understand much better than myself but this is more than necessary to clear my modesty in that point and i am very confident that there is scarce any man who has lost so much time as to read that trifle but will be my compurgator as to that arrogance whereof i am accused the truth is if i had been naturally guilty of so much vanity as to dictate my opinions yet i do not find that the character of a positive or selfconceited person is of such advantage to any in this age that i should labour to be publicly admitted of that order  but i am not now to defend my own cause when that of all the ancients and moderns is in question for this gentleman who accuses me of arrogance has taken a course not to be taxed with the other extreme of modesty those propositions which are laid down in my discourse as helps to the better imitation of nature are not mine as i have said nor were ever pretended so to be but derived from the authority of aristotle and horace and from the rules and examples of ben jonson and corneille these are the men with whom properly he contends and against whom he will endeavour to make it evident that there is no such thing as what they all pretend  his argument against the unities of place and time is this that tis as impossible for one stage to present two rooms or houses truly as two countries or kingdoms and as impossible that five hours or twentyfour hours should be two hours as that a thousand hours or years should be less than what they are or the greatest part of time to be comprehended in the less for all of them being impossible they are none of them nearest the truth or nature of what they present for impossibilities are all equal and admit of no degree  this argument is so scattered into parts that it can scarce be united into a syllogism yet in obedience to him i will abbreviate and comprehend as much of it as i can in few words that my answer to it may be more perspicuous i conceive his meaning to be what follows as to the unity of place if i mistake i beg his pardon professing it is not out of any design to play the argumentative poet if one stage cannot properly present two rooms or houses much less two countries or kingdoms then there can be no unity of place but one stage cannot properly perform this therefore there can be no unity of place  i plainly deny his minor proposition the force of which if i mistake not depends on this that the stage being one place cannot be two this indeed is as great a secret as that we are all mortal but to requite it with another i must crave leave to tell him that though the stage cannot be two places yet it may properly represent them successively or at several times his argument is indeed no more than a mere fallacy which will evidently appear when we distinguish place as it relates to plays into real and imaginary the real place is that theatre or piece of ground on which the play is acted the imaginary that house town or country where the action of the drama is supposed to be or more plainly where the scene of the play is laid let us now apply this to that herculean argument which if strictly and duly weighed is to make it evident that there is no such thing as what they all pretend tis impossible he says for one stage to present two rooms or houses i answer tis neither impossible nor improper for one real place to represent two or more imaginary places so it be done successively which in other words is no more than this that the imagination of the audience aided by the words of the poet and painted scenes may suppose the stage to be sometimes one place sometimes another now a garden or wood and immediately a camp which i appeal to every mans imagination if it be not true neither the ancients nor moderns as much fools as he is pleased to think them ever asserted that they could make one place two but they might hope by the good leave of this author that the change of a scene might lead the imagination to suppose the place altered so that he cannot fasten those absurdities upon this scene of a play or imaginary place of action that it is one place and yet two and this being so clearly proved that tis past any shew of a reasonable denial it will not be hard to destroy that other part of his argument which depends upon it namely that tis as impossible for a stage to represent two rooms or houses as two countries or kingdoms for his reason is already overthrown which was because both were alike impossible this is manifestly otherwise for tis proved that a stage may properly represent two rooms or houses for the imagination being judge of what is represented will in reason be less choked with the appearance of two rooms in the same house or two houses in the same city than with two distant cities in the same country or two remote countries in the same universe imagination in a man or reasonable creature is supposed to participate of reason and when that governs as it does in the belief of fiction reason is not destroyed but misled or blinded that can prescribe to the reason during the time of the representation somewhat like a weak belief of what it sees and hears and reason suffers itself to be so hoodwinked that it may better enjoy the pleasures of the fiction but it is never so wholly made a captive as to be drawn headlong into a persuasion of those things which are most remote from probability it is in that case a freeborn subject not a slave it will contribute willingly its assent as far as it sees convenient but will not be forced now there is a greater vicinity in nature betwixt two rooms than betwixt two houses betwixt two houses than betwixt two cities and so of the rest reason therefore can sooner be led by imagination to step from one room into another than to walk to two distant houses and yet rather to go thither than to fly like a witch through the air and be hurried from one region to another fancy and reason go hand in hand the first cannot leave the last behind and though fancy when it sees the wide gulph would venture over as the nimbler yet it is withheld by reason which will refuse to take the leap when the distance over it appears too large if ben jonson himself will remove the scene from rome into tuscany in the same act and from thence return to rome in the scene which immediately follows reason will consider there is no proportionable allowance of time to perform the journey and therefore will choose to stay at home so then the less change of place there is the less time is taken up in transporting the persons of the drama with analogy to reason and in that analogy or resemblance of fiction to truth consists the excellency of the play  for what else concerns the unity of place i have already given my opinion of it in my essay that there is a latitude to be allowed to it as several places in the same town or city or places adjacent to each other in the same country which may all be comprehended under the larger denomination of one place yet with this restriction that the nearer and fewer those imaginary places are the greater resemblance they will have to truth and reason which cannot make them one will be more easily led to suppose them so  what has been said of the unity of place may easily be applied to that of time i grant it to be impossible that the greater part of time should be comprehended in the less that twentyfour hours should be crowded into three but there is no necessity of that supposition for as place so time relating to a play is either imaginary or real the real is comprehended in those three hours more or less in the space of which the play is represented the imaginary is that which is supposed to be taken up in the representation as twentyfour hours more or less now no man ever could suppose that twentyfour real hours could be included in the space of three but where is the absurdity of affirming that the feigned business of twentyfour imagined hours may not more naturally be represented in the compass of three real hours than the like feigned business of twentyfour years in the same proportion of real time for the proportions are always real and much nearer by his permission of twentyfour to three than of four thousand to it  i am almost fearful of illustrating any thing by similitude lest he should confute it for an argument yet i think the comparison of a glass will discover very aptly the fallacy of his argument both concerning time and place the strength of his reason depends on this that the less cannot comprehend the greater i have already answered that we need not suppose it does i say not that the less can comprehend the greater but only that it may represent it as in a glass or mirror of halfayard diameter a whole room and many persons in it may be seen at once not that it can comprehend that room or those persons but that it represents them to the sight  but the author of the duke of lerma is to be excused for his declaring against the unity of time for if i be not much mistaken he is an interested personthe time of that play taking up so many years as the favour of the duke of lerma continued nay the second and third act including all the time of his prosperity which was a great part of the reign of philip the third for in the beginning of the second act he was not yet a favourite and before the end of the third was in disgrace i say not this with the least design of limiting the stage too servilely to twentyfour hours however he be pleased to tax me with dogmatising on that point in my dialogue as i before hinted several persons maintained their several opinions one of them indeed who supported the cause of the french poesy said how strict they were in that particular but he who answered in behalf of our nation was willing to give more latitude to the rule and cites the words of corneille himself complaining against the severity of it and observing what beauties it banished from the stage p 44 of my essay in few words my own opinion is this and i willingly submit it to my adversary when he will please impartially to consider it that the imaginary time of every play ought to be contrived into as narrow a compass as the nature of the plot the quality of the persons and variety of accidents will allow in comedy i would not exceed twentyfour or thirty hours for the plot accidents and persons of comedy are small and may be naturally turned in a little compass but in tragedy the design is weighty and the persons great therefore there will naturally be required a greater space of time in which to move them and this though ben jonson has not told us yet it is manifestly his opinion for you see that to his comedies he allows generally but twentyfour hours to his two tragedies sejanus and catiline a much larger time though he draws both of them into as narrow a compass as he can for he shews you only the latter end of sejanuss favour and the conspiracy of catiline already ripe and just breaking out into action  but as it is an error on the one side to make too great a disproportion betwixt the imaginary time of the play and the real time of its representation so on the other side it is an oversight to compress the accidents of a play into a narrower compass than that in which they could naturally be produced of this last error the french are seldom guilty because the thinness of their plots prevents them from it but few englishmen except ben jonson have ever made a plot with variety of design in it included in twentyfour hours which was altogether natural for this reason i prefer the silent woman before all other plays i think justly as i do its author in judgment above all other poets yet of the two i think that error the most pardonable which in too strait a compass crowds together many accidents since it produces more variety and consequently more pleasure to the audience and because the nearness of proportion betwixt the imaginary and real time does speciously cover the compression of the accidents  thus i have endeavoured to answer the meaning of his argument for as he drew it i humbly conceive that it was noneas will appear by his proposition and the proof of it his proposition was this  if strictly and duly weighed it is as impossible for one stage to present two rooms or houses as two countries or kingdoms c and his proof this for all being impossible they are none of them nearest the truth or nature of what they present  here you see instead of proof or reason there is only petitio principii for in plain words his sense is this two things are as impossible as one another because they are both equally impossible but he takes those two things to be granted as impossible which he ought to have proved such before he had proceeded to prove them equally impossible he should have made out first that it was impossible for one stage to represent two houses and then have gone forward to prove that it was as equally impossible for a stage to present two houses as two countries  after all this the very absurdity to which he would reduce me is none at all for he only drives at this that if his argument be true i must then acknowledge that there are degrees in impossibilities which i easily grant him without dispute and if i mistake not aristotle and the school are of my opinion for there are some things which are absolutely impossible and others which are only so ex parte as it is absolutely impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same time but for a stone to move naturally upward is only impossible ex parte materiae but it is not impossible for the first mover to alter the nature of it  his last assault like that of a frenchman is most feeble for whereas i have observed that none have been violent against verse but such only as have not attempted it or have succeeded ill in their attempt he will needs according to his usual custom improve my observation to an argument that he might have the glory to confute it but i lay my observation at his feet as i do my pen which i have often employed willingly in his deserved commendations and now most unwillingly against his judgment for his person and parts i honour them as much as any man living and have had so many particular obligations to him that i should be very ungrateful if i did not acknowledge them to the world but i gave not the first occasion of this difference in opinions in my epistle dedicatory before my rival ladies i had said somewhat in behalf of verse which he was pleased to answer in his preface to his plays that occasioned my reply in my essay and that reply begot this rejoinder of his in his preface to the duke of lenna but as i was the last who took up arms i will be the first to lay them down for what i have here written i submit it wholly to him and if i do not hereafter answer what may be objected against this paper i hope the world will not impute it to any other reason than only the due respect which i have for so noble an opponent    the indian emperor   the indian emperor is the first of drydens plays which exhibited in a marked degree the peculiarity of his stile and drew upon him the attention of the world without equalling the extravagancies of the conquest of granada and the royal martyr works produced when our author was emboldened by public applause to give full scope to his daring genius the following may be considered as a model of the heroic drama a few words therefore will not be here misplaced on the nature of the kind of tragedies in which during the earlier part of his literary career our author delighted and excelled  the heroic or rhyming plays were borrowed from the french to whose genius they are better suited than to the british an analogy may be observed between all the different departments of the belles lettres and none seem more closely allied than the pursuits of the dramatic writer and those of the composer of romances or novels both deal in fictitious adventure both write for amusement and address themselves nearly to the same class of admirers nay although the pride of the dramatist may be offended by the assertion it would seem that the nature of his walk is often prescribed by the successful impression of a novel upon the public mind if we laugh over low adventures in a novel we soon see low comedy upon the stage if we are horrorstruck with a tale of robbers and murder in our closet the dagger and the green carpet will not long remain unemployed in the theatre and if ghosts haunt our novels they soon stalk amongst our scenes under this persuasion we have little doubt that the heroic tragedies were the legitimate offspring of the french romances of calprenede and scuderi such as may deign to open these venerable and neglected tomes will be soon convinced of their extreme resemblance to the heroic drama a remarkable feature in both is the ideal world which they form for themselves every sentiment is lofty splendid and striking and no apology is admitted for any departure from the dignity of character however natural or impressive the beauty of the heroine and the valour of the hero must be alike resistless and the moving spring through the whole action is the overbearing passion of love their language and manners are as peculiar to themselves as their prowess and susceptibility the pastoral arcadian does not differ more widely from an ordinary rustic than these lofty persons do from the princes and kings of this world neither is any circumstance of national character or manners allowed as an apology for altering the established character which must be invariably sustained by the persons of the heroic drama the religion and the state of society of the country where the scene is laid may be occasionally alluded to as authority for varying a procession or introducing new dresses and decorations but in all other respects an indian inca attired in feathers must hold the same dignity of deportment and display the same powers of declamation and ingenuity of argument with a roman emperor in his purple or a feudal warrior in his armour for the rule and decorum of this species of composition is too peremptory to give way either to the current of human passions or to the usages of nations gibbon has remarked that the kings of the gepidae and the ostrogoths in corneilles tragedy of attila are profound politicians and sentimental loversa description which with a varying portion of pride courtesy and heroism will apply to almost all the characters in plays drawn upon this model  it is impossible to conceive any thing more different from the old english drama than the heroic plays which were introduced by charles ii the former in labouring to exhibit a variety and contrast of passions tempers or humours frequently altogether neglected the dignity of the scene in the heroical tragedy on the other hand nothing was to be indecorous nothing grotesque the personages were to speak not as men but as heroes to whom as statuaries have assigned a superiority of stature so these poets have given an uniform grandeur of feeling and of expression it may be thought that this monotonous splendour of diction would have palled upon an english audience less pleased generally with refinement however elegant than with bursts of passion and flights of novelty but dryden felt his force in the line which he chose to pursue and recommend the indescribable charms of his versification gratified the ear of the public while their attention was engaged by the splendour of his images and the matchless ingenuity of his arguments it must also be admitted that by their total neglect of the unities our ancient dramatic authors shocked the feelings of the more learned and embarrassed the understanding of the less acute among the spectators we do not hold it treason to depart from the strict rules respecting time and place inculcated by the ancients and followed in the heroic plays but it will surely be granted to us that where they can be observed without the sacrifice of great beauties or incurring such absurdities as dennis has justly charged upon cato the play will be proportionally more intelligible on the stage and more pleasing in the closet and although we willingly censure the practice of driving argument upon the stage into metaphysical refinement and rendering the contest of contrasted passions a mere combat in logic yet we must equally condemn those tragedies in which the poet sketches out the character with a few broken commonplaces expressive of love of rage or of grief and leaves the canvas to be filled up by the actor according to his own taste power and inclination  the indian emperor is an instance what beautiful poetry may be united to we had almost said thrown away upon the heroic drama the very first scene exhibits much of those beauties and their attendant deformities a modern audience would hardly have sate in patience to hear more than the first extravagant and ludicrous supposition of cortez    as if our old world modestly withdrew   and here in private had brought forth a new  but had they condemned the piece for this uncommon case of parturition they would have lost the beautiful and melodious verses in which cortez and his followers describe the advantages of the newly discovered world and they would have lost the still more exquisite account which immediately after guyomar gives of the arrival of the spanish fleet of the characters little need be said they stalk on in their own fairy land in the same uniform livery and with little peculiarity of discrimination all the men from montezuma down to pizarro are brave warriors and only vary in proportion to the mitigating qualities which the poet has infused into their military ardour the women are all beautiful and all deeply in love differing from each other only as the haughty or tender predominates in their passion but the charm of the poetry and the ingenuity of the dialogue render it impossible to peruse without pleasure a drama the faults of which may be imputed to its structure while its beauties are peculiar to dryden  the plot of the indian emperor is certainly of our authors own composition since even the malignant assiduity of langbaine has been unable to point out any author from whom it is borrowed the play was first acted in 1665 and received with great applause    connection of the indian emperor to the indian queen a  footnote a this argument was printed and dispersed amongst the audience upon the first night of representation hence bayes is made to say in the rehearsal that he had printed many reams to instil into the audience some conception of his plot   the conclusion of the indian queen part of which poem was wrote by me left little matter for another story to be built on there remaining but two of the considerable characters alive viz montezuma and orazia thereupon the author of this thought it necessary to produce new persons from the old ones and considering the late indian queen before she loved montezuma lived in clandestine marriage with her general traxalla from those two he has raised a son and two daughters supposed to be left young orphans at their death on the other side he has given to montezuma and orazia two sons and a daughter all now supposed to be grown up to mens and womens estate and their mother orazia for whom there was no further use in the story lately dead  so that you are to imagine about twenty years elapsed since the coronation of montezuma who in the truth of the history was a great and glorious prince and in whose time happened the discovery and invasion of mexico by the spaniards under the conduct of hernando cortez who joining with the traxallan indians the inveterate enemies of montezuma wholly subverted that flourishing empirethe conquest of which is the subject of this dramatic poem  i have neither wholly followed the story nor varied from it and as near as i could have traced the native simplicity and ignorance of the indians in relation to european customsthe shipping armour horses swords and guns of the spaniards being as new to them as their habits and their language were to the christians  the difference of their religion from ours i have taken from the story itself

court or coffeehouse or town from his most mighty sons whose confidence is placed in lofty sound and humble sense even to his little infants of the time who write new songs and trust in tune and rhyme bet known that phoebus being daily grieved to see good plays condemned and bad received ordains your judgment upon every cause henceforth be limited by wholesome laws he first thinks fit no sonnetteer advance his censure farther than the song or dance your wit burlesque may one step higher climb and in his sphere may judge all doggrel rhyme all proves and moves and loves and honours too all that appears high sense and scarce is low as for the coffeewits he says not much their proper business is to damn the dutch for the great dons of wit phoebus gives them full privilege alone to damn all others and cry up their own last for the ladies tis apollos will they should have power to save but not to kill for love and he long since have thought it fit wit live by beauty beauty reign by wit      secret love or the maiden queen    vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille qui minimis urgetur       horat    the maiden queen  the maiden queen is said by langbaine to be founded upon certain passages in the grand cyrus and in ibrahim the illustrious bassa few readers will probably take the trouble of consulting these huge volumes for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of this charge even our duty as editors cannot impel us to the task satisfied as we are that since these ponderous folios at that time loaded every toilette dryden can hardly have taken more from such wellknown sources than the mere outline of the story indeed to a certain degree the foundation of the plot upon a story in the cyrus is admitted by the author the character of the queen is admirably drawn and the catastrophe is brought very artfully forward the uncertainty as to her final decision continuing till the last moment in this as in all our authors plays some passages of beautiful poetry occur in the dialogue as for example the scene in act 3d betwixt philocles and candiope the characters excepting that of the maiden queen herself are lame and uninteresting philocles in particular has neither enough of love to make him despise ambition nor enough of ambition to make him break the fetters of love we might have admired him had he been constant or sympathised with him had he sinned against his affections and repented but there is nothing interesting in the vacillations of his indecision the comic part of the play contains much of what was thought wit in the reign of charles ii for marriage is railed against and a male and female rake join in extolling the pleasures of a single life even while the usage of the theatre compels them at length to put on the matrimonial chains it is surprising that no venturous author in that gay age concluded by making such a couple happy in their own way the novelty of such a catastrophe would have insured its success and unlike to the termination of the loves of celadon and florimel it would have been strictly in character  the maiden queen was first acted in 1667 and printed as the poet has informed us by the command of charles himself who graced it with the title of his play dryden mentions the excellence of the acting so it was probably received very favourably    preface   it has been the ordinary practice of the french poets to dedicate their works of this nature to their king especially when they have had the least encouragement to it by his approbation of them on the stage but i confess i want the confidence to follow their example though perhaps i have as specious pretences to it for this piece as any they can boast of it having been owned in so particular a manner by his majesty that he has graced it with the title of his play and thereby rescued it from the severity that i may not say malice of its enemies but though a character so high and undeserved has not raised in me the presumption to offer such a trifle to his most serious view yet i will own the vanity to say that after this glory which it has received from a sovereign prince i could not send it to seek protection from any subject be this poem then sacred to him without the tedious form of a dedication and without presuming to interrupt those hours which he is daily giving to the peace and settlement of his people  for what else concerns this play i would tell the reader that it is regular according to the strictest of dramatic laws but that it is a commendation which many of our poets now despise and a beauty which our common audiences do not easily discern neither indeed do i value myself upon it because with all that symmetry of parts it may want an air and spirit which consists in the writing to set it off tis a question variously disputed whether an author may be allowed as a competent judge of his own works as to the fabric and contrivance of them certainly he may for that is properly the employment of the judgment which as a masterbuilder he may determine and that without deception whether the work be according to the exactness of the model still granting him to have a perfect idea of that pattern by which he works and that he keeps himself always constant to the discourse of his judgment without admitting selflove which is the false surveyor of his fancy to intermeddle in it these qualifications granted being such as all sound poets are presupposed to have within them i think all writers of what kind soever may infallibly judge of the frame and contexture of their works but for the ornament of writing which is greater more various and bizarre in poesy than in any other kind as it is properly the child of fancy so it can receive no measure or at least but a very imperfect one of its own excellences or failures from the judgment selflove which enters but rarely into the offices of the judgment here predominates and fancy if i may so speak judging of itself can be no more certain or demonstrative of its own effects than two crooked lines can be the adequate measure of each other what i have said on this subject may perhaps give me some credit with my readers in my opinion of this play which i have ever valued above the rest of my follies of this kind yet not thereby in the least dissenting from their judgment who have concluded the writing of this to be much inferior to my indian emperor but the argument of that was much more noble not having the allay of comedy to depress it yet if this be more perfect either in its kind or in the general notion of a play it is as much as i desire to have granted for the vindication of my opinion and what as nearly touches me the sentence of a royal judge many have imagined the character of philocles to be faulty some for not discovering the queens love others for his joining in her restraint but though i am not of their number who obstinately defend what they have once said i may with modesty take up those answers which have been made for me by my friends namely that philocles who was but a gentleman of ordinary birth had no reason to guess so soon at the queens passion she being a person so much above him and by the suffrages of all her people already destined to lysimantes besides that he was prepossessed as the queen somewhere hints it to him with another inclination which rendered him less clearsighted in it since no man at the same time can distinctly view two different objects and if this with any shew of reason may be defended i leave my masters the critics to determine whether it be not much more conducing to the beauty of my plot that philocles should be long kept ignorant of the queens love than that with one leap he should have entered into the knowledge of it and thereby freed himself to the disgust of the audience from that pleasing labyrinth of errors which was prepared for him as for that other objection of his joining in the queens imprisonment it is indisputably that which every man if he examines himself would have done on the like occasion if they answer that it takes from the height of his character to do it i would enquire of my overwise censors who told them i intended him a perfect character or indeed what necessity was there he should be so the variety of images being one great beauty of a play it was as much as i designed to shew one great and absolute pattern of honour in my poem which i did in the person of the queen all the defects of the other parts being set to shew the more to recommend that one character of virtue to the audience but neither was the fault of philocles so great if the circumstances be considered which as moral philosophy assures us make the essential differences of good and bad he himself best explaining his own intentions in his last act which was the restoration of his queen and even before that in the honesty of his expressions when he was unavoidably led by the impulsions of his love to do it that which with more reason was objected as an indecorum is the management of the last scene of the play where celadon and florimel are treating too lightly of their marriage in the presence of the queen who likewise seems to stand idle while the great action of the drama is still depending this i cannot otherwise defend than by telling you i so designed it on purpose to make my play go off more smartly that scene being in the opinion of the best judges the most divertising of the whole comedy but though the artifice succeeded i am willing to acknowledge it as a fault since it pleased his majesty the best judge to think it so  i have only to add that the play is founded on a story in the cyrus which he calls the queen of corinth in whose character as it has been affirmed to me he represents that of the famous christina queen of sweden this is what i thought convenient to write by way of preface to the maiden queen in the reading of which i fear you will not meet with that satisfaction which you have had in seeing it on the stage the chief parts of it both serious and comic being performed to that height of excellence that nothing but a command which i could not handsomely disobey could have given me the courage to have made it public    prologue   i  he who writ this not without pains and thought from french and english theatres has brought the exactest rules by which a play is wrought  ii  the unities of action place and time the scenes unbroken and a mingled chime of jonsons humour with corneilles rhyme  iii  but while dead colours he with care did lay he fears his wit or plot he did not weigh which are the living beauties of a play  iv  plays are like towns which howeer fortified by engineers have still some weaker side by the oerseen defendant unespied  v  and with that art you make approaches now such skilful fury in assaults you show that every poet without shame may bow  vi  ours therefore humbly would attend your doom if soldierlike he may have terms to come with flying colours and with beat of drum  the prologue goes out and stays while a tune is played after which he returns again    second prologue   i had forgot one half i do protest and now am sent again to speak the rest he bows to every great and noble wit but to the little hectors of the pit our poets sturdy and will not submit hell be beforehand with em and not stay to see each peevish critic stab his play each puny censor who his skill to boast is cheaply witty on the poets cost no critics verdict should of right stand good they are excepted all as men of blood and the same law shall shield him from their fury which has excluded butchers from a jury youd all be wits but writings tedious and that way may fail the most compendious method is to rail which you so like you think yourselves ill used when in smart prologues you are not abused a civil prologue is approved by no man you hate it as you do a civil woman your fancys palled and liberally you pay to have it quickened ere you see a play just as old sinners worn from their delight give money to be whipped to appetite but what a pox keep i so much ado to save our poet he is one of you a brother judgment and as i hear say a cursed critic as eer damned a play good savage gentlemen your own kind spare he is like you a very wolf or bear yet think not hell your ancient rights invade or stop the course of your free damning

in mine  phil you yourself clear me madam had i sought more power this marriage sure was not the way but when your safety was in question when all your people were unsatisfied desired a kingnay more

your sovereign authority  queen i fear that were to make him hate me or whats as bad to let him know i love him could you not do it of yourself  ast ill not be wanting to my powr but if your majesty

he cannot hang and drown and break his neck and poison himself all together  flo well then because you are but a beginner and i would not discourage you any of these shall serve your turn in a fair way  cel i am much deceivd in those eyes of yours if a treat a song and the fiddles be not a more acceptable proof of love to you than any of those tragical ones you have mentioned  flo however you will grant it is but decent you should be pale and lean and melancholick to shew you are in love and that i shall require of you when i see you next  cel when you see me next why you do not make a

it not pass almost for madness and extreme ambition in me  queen you know you have a favourable judge it lies in you not to ask any thing i cannot grant  phil madam perhaps you think me too faulty but love alone inspires me with ambition tho but to look on fair candiope were an excuse for both  queen keep your ambition and let love alone that i can cloy but this i cannot cure i have some reasons invincible to me which must forbid your marriage with candiope  phil i knew i was not worthy  queen not for that philocles you deserve all things and to shew i think it my admiral i hear is dead his vacant place the best in all my kingdom i here confer on you  phil rather take back all you had givn before than not give this for believe madam nothing is so near my soul as the possession of candiope  queen since that belief would be to your disadvantage i will not entertain it  phil why madam can you be thus cruel to me to give me all things which i did not ask and yet deny that only thing i beg and so beg that i find i cannot live without the hope of it  queen hope greater things but hope not this haste to oercome your love it is but putting a shortlivd passion to a violent death  phil i cannot live without candiope but i can die without a murmur having my doom pronounced from your fair mouth  queen if i am to pronounce it live my philocles but live without i was about to say aside without his love but that i cannot do live philocles without candiope  phil madam could you give my doom so quickly and knew it was irrevocable tis too apparent you who alone love glory and whose soul is loosened from your senses cannot judge what torments mine of grosser mould endures  queen i cannot suffer you to give me praises which are not my own i love like you and am yet much more wretched than you can think yourself  phil weak bars they needs must be that fortune puts twixt sovereign power and all it can desire when princes love they call themselves unhappy only because the word sounds handsome in a lovers mouth but you can cease to be so when you please by making lysimantes fortunate  queen were he indeed the man you had some reason but tis another more without my power and yet a subject too  phil o madam say not so it cannot be a subject if not he it were to be injurious to yourself to make another choice  queen yet lysimantes set by him i love is more obscured than stars too near the sun he has a brightness of his own not borrowed of his fathers but born with him  phil pardon me if i say whoeer he be he has practisd some ill arts upon you madam for he whom you describe i see is born but from the lees o the people  queen you offend me philocles whence had you leave to use those insolent terms of him i please to love one i must tell you since foolishly i have gone thus far whom i esteem your equal and far superior to prince lysimantes one who deserves to wear a crown  phil whirlwinds bear me hence before i live to that detested daythat frown assures me i have offended by my overfreedom but yet methinks a heart so plain and honest and zealous of your glory might hope your pardon for it  queen i give it you but when you know him better youll alter your opinion hes no ill friend of yours  phil i well perceive he has supplanted me in your esteem but thats the least of ills this fatal wretch has practisedthink for heavens sake madam think if you have drunk no philtre  queen yes he has given me a philtre but i have drunk it only from his eyes  phil hot irons thank em fort  softly or turning from her  queen whats that you mutter hence from my sight

your queen  exit philocles bowing asteria come hither was ever boldness like to this of philocles help me to reproach him for i resolve henceforth no more to love him  ast truth is i wondered at your

vulgar parts and presence  queen or allow him something handsome valiant or soyet this to me  ast the workmanship of inconsiderate favour the creature of rash love one of those meteors which monarchs raise from earth and people wondering how they came so high fear from their influence plagues and wars and famine  queen ha  ast one whom instead of banishing a day you should have plumed of all his borrowed honours and let him see what abject things they are whom princes often love without desert  queen what has my philocles deserved from thee that thou shouldst use him thus were he the basest of mankind thou couldst not have given him ruder language  ast did not your majesty command me did not yourself begin  queen i grant i did but i have right to do it i love him and may rail in you tis malice malice in the most high degree for never man was more deserving than my philocles or do you love him ha and plead that title confess and ill forgive you for none can look on him but needs must love  ast i love him madam i beseech your majesty have better thoughts of me  queen dost thou not love him then good heaven how stupid and how dull is she how most invincibly insensible no woman does deserve to live that loves not philocles  ast dear madam recollect yourself alas how much distracted are your thoughts and how disjointed all your words the sibyls leaves more orderly were laid where is that harmony of mind that prudence which guided all you did that sense of glory which raised you high above the rest of kings as kings are oer the level of mankind  queen gone gone asteria all is gone or lost within me far from any use sometimes i struggle like the sun in clouds but straight i am oercast  ast i grieve to see it  queen then thou hast yet the goodness to pardon what i said alas

her softly  queen ha banished him tis true indeed but as thou sayest i had forgot it quite  ast thats very strange scarce half an hour ago  queen but love had drawn his pardon up so soon that i forgot he eer offended me  phil pardon me that i could not thank you sooner your sudden grace like some swift flood poured in on narrow banks oerflowed my spirits  queen no tis for me to ask your pardon

forfeit my late pardon  queen but youll be glad to know it  phil may i not hope then you have some quarrel to him  queen yes a great one but first to justify myself know philocles i have concealed my passion with such care from him that he knows not yet i love but only that i much esteem him  phil o stupid wretch that by a thousand tokens could not guess it  queen he loves elsewhere and that has blinded him  phil hes blind indeed so the dull beasts in the first paradise with levelled eyes gazed each upon their kind there fixed their love and neer looked up to view that glorious creature man

him traitor but only rude audacious and impertinent to use his sovereign soi beg your leave to wish you have at least imprisoned him  queen some people may speak ill and yet mean well remember you were not confined and yet your fault was great in short i love him and that excuses all but be not jealous his rising shall not be your overthrow nor will i ever marry him  phil thats some comfort yet

shall pardon me a beauty such as yours deserves a more than ordinary care to set it out come hither philocles do but observe she has but one gross fault in all her shape that is she bears up here too much and the malicious workman has left it open to your eye  phil where and please your majesty methinks tis very well  queen do not you see it oh how blind is love  cand and how quicksighted malice

vain when they are past we are ourselves again  enter queen and asteria above  queen look look asteria yet they are not gone hence we may hear what they discourse alone  phil my love inspires me with a generous thought which you unknowing in those wishes taught since happiness may out of courts be found why stay we here on this enchanted ground and chuse not rather with content to dwell if love and joy can find it in a cell  cand those who like you have once in courts been great may think they wish but wish not to retreat they seldom go but when they cannot stay as losing gamesters throw the dice away even in that cell where you repose would find visions of court will haunt your restless mind and glorious dreams stand ready to restore the pleasing shapes of all you had before  phil he who with your possession once is blest on easy terms will part with all the rest all my ambition will in you be crowned and those white arms shall all my wishes bound our life shall be but one long nuptial day and like chafed odours melt in sweets away soft as the night our minutes shall be worn and chearful as the birds that wake the morn  cand thus hope misleads itself in pleasant way and takes more joys on trust than love can pay but love with long possession once decayed that face which now you court you will upbraid  phil false lovers broach these tenets to remove the fault from

imprisonment  queen nay now i am confirmed my thought was true for you could give him no such reason of his obligements as my love  ast because i saw him much a malecontent i thought to win him to your interest madam by telling him it was no want of kindness made your refusal of candiope and he perhaps  queen what of him now  ast as men are apt interpreted my words to all the advantage he could wrest the sense as if i meant you loved him  queen have i deposited within thy breast the dearest treasure of my life my glory and hast thou thus betrayed me but why do i accuse thy female weakness and not my own for trusting thee unhappy queen philocles knows thy fondness and needs must think it done by thy command  ast dear madam think not so  queen peace peace thou shouldst for ever hold thy tongue for it has spoke too much for all thy life to her then philocles has told candiope and courts her kindness with his scorn of me o whither am i fallen but i must rouse myself and give a stop to

ambition were taught me by a master with whom you are not unacquainted madam  queen explain yourself dark purposes like yours need an interpretation  lys tis love i mean  queen have my low fortunes given thee this insolence to name it to thy queen  lys yet you have heard love named without offence as much below you as you think my passion i can look down on yours  queen does he know it too this is the extremest malice of my stars aside  lys you see that princes faults howeer they think them safe from public view fly out thro the dark crannies of their closets we know what the sun does even when we see him not in tother world  queen my actions cousin never feared the light  lys produce him then your darling of the dark for such an one you have  queen i know no such  lys you know but will not own him  queen rebels neer want pretence to blacken kings and this it seems is yours do you produce him or neer hereafter sully my renown with this aspersionsure he dare not name him  aside  lys i am too tender of your frame or else nor are things brought to that extremity provided you accept my passion ill gladly yield to think i was deceived  queen keep in your error still i will not buy your good opinion at so dear a rate and my own misery by being yours  lys do not provoke my patience by such scorns for fear i break through all and name him to you  queen hope not to fright me with your mighty looks know i dare stem that tempest in your brow and dash it back upon you  lys spite of prudence it will outtis philocles now judge when i was made a property to cheat myself by making him your prisoner whether i had not right to take up arms  queen poor envious wretch was this the venom that swelled up thy breast my grace to philocles misdeemed my love  lys tis true the gentleman is innocent he neer sinned up so high not in his wishes you know he loves elsewhere  queen you mean your sister  lys i wish some sibyl now would tell me why you refused her to him  queen perhaps i did not think him worthy of her  lys did you not think him too worthy madam this is too thin a veil to hide your passion to prove you love him not yet give her him and ill engage my honour to lay down my arms  queen he is arrived where i would wish  aside call in the company and you shall see what i will do  lys who waits without there exit lys  queen now hold my heart for this one act of honour and i will never ask more courage of thee once more i have the means to reinstate myself into my glory i feel my love to philocles within me shrink and pull back my heart from this hard trial but it must be when glory says it must as children wading from some rivers bank first try the water with their tender feet then shuddering up with cold step back again and straight a little further venture on till at the last they plunge into the deep and pass at once what they were doubting long ill make the experiment it shall be done in haste because ill put it past my power to undo  enter at one door

him the fever of my love returns to shake me i see love is not banished from my soul he is still there but is chained up by glory  ast youve made a noble conquest madam  queen come hither philocles i am first to tell you i and my cousin are agreed he has engaged to lay down arms  phil tis well for him he has for all his party by my command already are surprised while i was talking with your majesty  cel yes faith i have done him that courtesy i brought his followers under pretence of guarding it to a strait place where they are all coupt up without use of their arms and may be pelted to death by the small infantry oer the town  queen twas more than i expected or could hope yet still i thought your meaning honest  phil my fault was rashness but twas full of zeal nor had i eer been led to that attempt had i not seen it would be done without me but by compliance i preserved the power which i have since made use of for your service  queen and which i purpose so to recompence  lys with her crown she means i knew twould come to it  aside  phil o heavens shell own her love then i must lose candiope for ever and floating in a vast abyss of glory seek and not find myself  queen take your candiope and be as happy as love can make you bothhow pleased i am that i can force my tongue to speak words so far distant from my heart  aside  cand my happiness is more than i can utter  lys methinks i could do violence on myself for taking arms against a queen so good so bountiful give me leave madam in my ecstasy of joy to give you thanks for philocles you have preserved my friend and now he owes not his fortunes only to your favour but whats more his life and more than that his love i am convinced she never loved him now since by her free consent all force removed she gives him to my sister flavia was an impostor and deceived me aside  phil as for me madam i can only say that i beg respite for my thanks for on a sudden the benefits so great it overwhelms me  ast mark but the faintness of the acknowledgement  to the queen aside  queen to ast i have observed it with you and am pleased he seems not satisfied for i still wish that he may love me  phil i see asteria deluded me with flattering hopes of the queens love only to draw me off from lysimantes but i will think no more ont im going to possess candiope and i am ravished with the joy ontha not ravished neither for what can be more charming than that queen behold how night sits lovely on her eyebrows while day breaks from her eyes then a crown too lost lost for ever lost and now tis gone tis beautifulaside  ant how he eyes you still to the queen  phil sure i had one of the fallen angels dreams all heaven within this hour was mine aside  cand what is it that disturbs you dear  phil only the greatness of my joy ive taen too strong a cordial love and cannot yet digest it  queen tis done  clapping her hand on asteria but this pang more and then a glorious birth the tumults of this day my loyal subjects have settled in my heart a resolution happy for you and glorious too for me first for my cousin tho attempting on my person he has incurred the danger of the laws i will not punish him  lys you bind me ever to my loyalty  queen then that i may oblige you more to it i here declare you rightful successor and heir immediate to my crown this gentlemento the deputies i hope will still my subjects discontents when they behold succession firmly settled  dep heaven preserve your majesty  queen as for myself i have resolved still to continue as i am unmarried the cares observances and all the duties which i should pay an husband i will place upon my people and our mutual love shall make a blessing more than conjugal and this the states shall ratify  lys heaven bear me witness that i take no joy in the succession of a crown which must descend to me so sad a way  queen cousin no more my resolutions past which fate shall never alter  phil then i am once more happy for since none must possess her i am pleased with my own choice and will desire no more for multiplying wishes is a curse that keeps the mind still painfully awake  queen celadon your care and loyalty have this day obliged me but how to be acknowledging i know not unless you give the means  cel i was in hope your majesty had forgot me therefore if you please madam ill only beg a pardon for having taken up arms once today against you for i have a foolish kind of conscience which i wish many of your subjects had that will not let me ask a recompence for my loyalty when i know i have been a rebel  queen your modesty shall not serve the turn ask something  cel then i beg madam you will command florimel never to be friends with me  flo ask again i grant that without the queen but why are you afraid ont  cel because i am sure as soon as ever you are youll marry me  flo do you fear it  cel no twill come with a fear  flo if you do i will not stick with you for an oath  cel i require no oath till we come to church and then after the priest i hope for i find it will be my destiny to marry thee  flo if ever i say a word after the black gentleman for thee celadon  cel then i hope youll give me leave to bestow a faithful heart elsewhere  flo ay but if you would have one you must bespeak it for i am sure you have none ready made  cel what say you shall i marry flavia  flo no shell be too cunning for you  cel what say you to olinda then shes tall and fair and bonny  flo and foolish and apish and fickle  cel but sabina theres pretty and young and loving and innocent  flo and dwarfish and childish and fond and flippant if you marry her sister you will get maypoles and if you marry her you will get fairies to dance about them  cel nay then the case is clear florimel if you take em all from me tis because you reserve me for yourself  flo but this marriage is such a bugbear to me much might be if we could invent but any way to make it easy  cel some foolish people have made it uneasy by drawing the knot faster than they need but we that are wiser will loosen it a little  flo tis true indeed theres some difference betwixt a girdle and a halter  cel as for the first year according to the laudable custom of newmarried people we shall follow one another up into chambers and down into gardens and think we shall never have enough of one another so far tis pleasant enough i hope  flo but after that when we begin to live like husband and wife and never come near one anotherwhat then sir  cel why then our only happiness must be to have one mind and one will florimel  flo one mind if thou wilt but prythee let us have two wills for i find one will be little enough for me alone but how if those wills should meet and clash celadon  cel i warrant thee for that husbands and wives keep their wills far enough asunder for ever meeting one thing let us be sure to agree on that is never to be jealous  flo no but een love one another as long as we can and confess the truth when we can love no longer  cel when i have been at play you shall never ask me what money i have lost  flo when i have been abroad you shall never enquire who treated me  cel item i will have the liberty to sleep all night without your interrupting my repose for any evil design whatsoever  flo item then you shall bid me goodnight before you sleep  cel provided always that whatever liberties we take with other people we continue very honest to one another  flo as far as will consist with a pleasant life  cel lastly whereas the names of husband and wife hold forth nothing but clashing and cloying and dulness and faintness in their signification they shall be abolished for ever betwixt us  flo and instead of those we will be married by the more agreeable names of mistress and gallant  cel none of my privileges to be infringed by thee florimel under the penalty of a month of fasting nights  flo none of my privileges to be infringed by thee celadon under the penalty of cuckoldom  cel well if it be my fortune to be made a cuckold i had rather thou shouldst make me one than any one in sicily and for my comfort i shall have thee oftener than any of thy servants  flo look ye now is not such a marriage as good as wenching celadon  cel this is very good but not so good florimel  queen now set we forward to the assemblyyou promise cousin your consent  lys but most unwillingly  queen philocles i must beg your voice too  phil most joyfully i give it  lys madam but one word more since you are so resolved that you may see bold as my passion was twas only for your person not your crown i swear no second love shall violate the flame i had for you but in strict imitation of your oath i vow a single life  queen now my asteria my joys are full  to asteria the powers above that see the innocent love i bear to philocles have given its due reward for by this means the right of lysimantes will devolve upon candiope and i shall have this great content to think when i am dead my crown may fall on philocless head  exeunt    epilogue written by a person of honour   our poet something doubtful of his fate made choice of me to be his advocate relying on my knowledge in the laws and i as boldly undertook the cause i left my client yonder in a rant against the envious and the ignorant who are he says his only enemies but he condemns their malice and defies the sharpest of his censurers to say where there is one gross fault in all his play the language is so fitted for each part the plot according to the rules of art and twenty other things he bid me tell you but i cried een go dot yourself for nellya reason with judges urged in the defence of those they would condemn is insolence i therefore wave the merits of his play and think it fit to plead this safer way if when too many in the purchase share robbings not worth the danger nor the care the men of business must in policy cherish a little harmless poetry all wit would else grow up to knavery wit is a bird of music or of prey mounting she strikes at all things in her way but if this birdlime once but touch her wings on the next bush she sits her down and sings i have but one word more tell me i pray what you will get by damning of our play a whipt fanatic who does not recant is by his brethren called a suffering saint and by your hands should this poor poet die before he does renounce his poetry his death must needs confirm the party more than all his scribbling life could do before where so much zeal does in a sect appear tis to no purpose faith to be severe but tother day i heard this rhyming fop saycritics

mrs reeves who spoke the epilogue it is probable he wrote both that and the prologue and therefore although not much worth preserving we have here added them from the reference to ravenscrofts play of
