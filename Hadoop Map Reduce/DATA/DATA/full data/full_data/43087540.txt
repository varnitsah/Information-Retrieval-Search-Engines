intelligencer   london george bell and sons 1902  chiswick press charles whittingham and co tooks court chancery lane london   introduction  swift has been styled the prince of journalists like most titles whose aim is to express in modern words the character and achievements of a man of a past age this phrase is not of the happiest applied to so extraordinary a man as jonathan swift it is both misleading and inadequate at best it embodies but a halftruth it belongs to that class of phrases which in emphasizing a particular side of the character sacrifices truth to a superficial cleverness and so does injustice to the character as a whole the vogue such phrases obtain is thus the measure of the misunderstanding that is current so that it often becomes necessary to receive them with caution and to test them with care  a prince in his art swift certainly was but his art was not the art of the journalist swift was a master of literary expression and of all forms of that expression which aim at embodying in language the common life and common facts of men and their common nature he had his limitations of course but just here lies the power of his special genius he never attempted to express what he did not fully comprehend if he saw things narrowly he saw them definitely and there was no mistaking the ideas he wished to convey he understands himself said dr johnson and his reader always understands him within his limitations swift swayed a sovereign power his narrowness of vision however did never blind him to the relations that exist between fact and fact between object and subject between the actual and the possible at the same time it was not his province as it was not his nature to handle such relations in the abstract the bent of his mind was towards the practical and not the pure reason the moralist and the statesman went hand in hand in himan excellent example of the eighteenth century thinker  but to say this of swift is not to say that he was a journalist the journalist is the man of the hour writing for the hour in harmony with popular opinion both his text and his heads are readymade for him he follows the beaten road and only essays new paths when conditions have become such as to force him along them such a man swift certainly was not journalism was not his way to the goal if anything it was as epictetus might have said but a tavern by the wayside in which he took occasion to find the means by which the better to attain his goal if swifts contributions to the literature of his day be journalism then did journalism spring fullgrown into being and its history since his time must be considered as a history of its degeneration but they were much more than journalism that they took the form they did in contributions to the periodicals of his day is but an accident which does not in the least affect the contributions themselves these in reality constitute a criticism of the social and political life of the first thirty years of the english eighteenth century from the time of the writing of a tale of a tub to the days of the drapiers letters swift dissected his countrymen with the pitiless hand of the mastersurgeon so profound was his knowledge of human anatomy individual and social that we shudder now at the pain he must have inflicted in his unsparing operations so accurate was his judgment that we stand amazed at his knowledge and our amazement often turns to a species of horror as we see the cuticle flapped open revealing the crude arrangement beneath nor is it to argue too nicely to suggest that our present sympathy for the past pain our amazement and our horror are after all our own unconscious tributes to the power of the man who calls them up and our confession of the lasting validity of his criticism  this is not the power nor is it the kind of criticism that are the elements of the art of the journalist perhaps we should be glad that it is not which is but to say that we are content with things as they exist it requires a special set of conditions to precipitate a swift happily if we will have it so the conditions in which we find ourselves ask for that kind of journalist whose function is amply fulfilled when he has measured the movements of the hour by the somewhat higher standards of the day the conditions under which swift lived demanded a journalist of an entirely different calibre and they got him they obtained a man who dissolved the petty jealousies of party power in the acid of satire and who distilled the affected fears for church and state in the alembic of a statesmanship that establishes a nations majesty and dignity on the common welfare of its free people when swift at the beginning of the november of 1710 was called in to assist the tory party by undertaking the work of the examiner he found a condition of things so involved and so unstable that it required the very nicest appreciation the most delicate handling and the boldest of hearts to readjust and reestablish without fearful consequences harley and st john were safely housed and apparently amply protected by a substantial majority but majorities are often not the most trustworthy of supports apart from the overconfidence which they inspire and apart from the danger of a tooenthusiastic following such as found expression in the october club there was the danger which might come from the dissatisfaction of the people at large should their temper be wrongly gauged and at this juncture it was not easy to gauge the popularity of marlborough and his victories on the one hand was undoubted on the other however there was the growing opinion that those victories had been paid for at a price greater than england could afford if she had gained reputation and prestige these could not fill the mouths of the landed class gradually growing poorer and the members of this class were not of a disposition to restrain their feelings as they noted the growing prosperity of the whig stockjobbersa prosperity that was due to the very war which was beggaring them if the landed man cried for peace he was answered by the whig stockjobber that peace meant the ultimate repudiation of the national debt with the certainty of the reign of the pretender if the landed man spoke for the church the whig speculator raised the shout of no popery the war had transformed parties into factions and the ministry stood between a scylla of a peaceatanyprice on the one side and a charybdis of a waratanyprice on the other or if not a war then a peace so onesided that it would be almost impossible to bring it about  in such troubled waters and at such a critical juncture it was given to swift to act as pilot to the ship of state his papers to the examiner must bear witness to the skill with which he accomplished the task set before him his appeal to the people of england for confidence in the ministry should be an appeal not alone on behalf of its distinguished and able members but also on behalf of a policy by which the crooked should be made straight and the rough places plain such was to be the nature of his appeal and he made it in a series of essays that turned every advantage with admirable effect to the side of his clients not another man then living could have done what he did and we question if either harley or st john ever realized the service he rendered them the later careers of these two men furnish no doubtful hints of what might have happened at this period had swift been other than the man he was  but swifts examiners did much more than preserve harleys head on his shoulders they brought the nation to a calmer sense of its position and tutored it to a juster appreciation of the men who were using it for selfish ends let us make every allowance for purely special pleadings for indulgence in personal feeling against the men who had either disappointed injured or angered him for the party man affecting or genuinely feeling party bitterness for the tricks and subterfuges of the paid advocate appealing to the passions and weaknesses of those whose favour he was seeking to win allowing for these there are yet left in these papers a noble spirit of wideeyed patriotism and a distinguished grasp of the meaning of national greatness and national integrity  the pamphleteers whom he opposed and who opposed him were powerless against swift where they pried with the curiosity and meanness of petty dealers swifts insight seized on the larger relations and insisted on them where they bantered cajoled and sneered arousing a very mild irritation swifts scornful invective and biting satire silenced into fear the enemies of the queens chosen ministers where their jejune answers gained a simper swifts virility of mind range of power and dexterity of handling compelled a homage his whig antagonists had good reason to dread him he scoffed at them for an existence that was founded not on a devotion to principles but on a jealousy for the power others enjoyed the bulk of the whigs appears rather to be linked to a certain set of persons than any certain set of principles to these persons also he directed his grim attention somers cowper godolphin marlborough and wharton were each drawn with iron stylus and acid to wharton he gave special care he had some private scores to pay off and in the character of verres he etched the portrait of a profligate an unscrupulous governor a scoundrel an infidel to his religion and country a reckless selfish lowliving blackguard in the letter to marcus crassus marlborough is addressed in language that the simplest farmlabourer could understand the letter is a lay sermon on the vice of avarice and every point and illustration are taken from marlboroughs life with such telling application that marlborough himself must have taken thought as he read it no man swift finely concludes of true valour and true understanding upon whom this vice has stolen unawares when he is convinced he is guilty will suffer it to remain in his breast an hour  but these attentions to the whigs as a party and as individuals were after all but the byplay of the skilled orator preparing the minds of his hearers for the true purpose in hand that purpose may originally have been to fix the ministry in the countrys favour but swift having fulfilled it and so discharged his office turned it as indeed he could not help turning it and as later in the drapiers letters he turned another purpose to the persuasion of an acceptance of those broad principles which so influenced political thought during the last years of the reign of queen anne it is with these principles in his mind that dr johnson confessed that swift dictated for a time the political opinions of the english nation he recalled the nation to a consideration of the constitution he attributed to the people because of course they had elected the new ministry into power an appreciation of what was best for the protection of their ancient privileges and rights the past twenty years had been a period of mismanagement in which the constitution had been ignored but the body of the people is wiser and by the choice they have made shew they do understand our constitution and would bring it back to the old form the nation has groaned under the intolerable burden of those who sucked her blood for gain we have carried on wars that we might fill the pockets of stockjobbers we have revised our constitution and by a great and united national effort have secured our protestant succession only that we may become the tools of a faction who arrogate to themselves the whole merit of what was a national act we are governed by upstarts who are unsettling the landmarks of our social system and are displacing the influence of our landed gentry by that of a class of men who find their profit in our woes the rule of the tradesman must be replaced by the rule of those whose lives are bound up with the land of their country the art of government was not the importation of nutmegs and the curing of herrings but the political embodiment of the will of a parliament freely chosen without threatening or corruption and composed of landed men whose interests being in the soil would be at one with the interests of those who lived on the soil whigs and tories may dispute as they will among themselves as to the best side from which to defend the country but the men of the true party are the men of the national partythey whose principles in church and state are what i have above related whose actions are derived from thence and who have no attachment to any set of ministers further than as these are friends to the constitution in all its parts but will do their utmost to save their prince and country whoever be at the helm1  in this spirit and in such wise did swift temper his time and champion the cause of those men who had chosen him this was a kind of examining to which neither the whigs nor the tories had been accustomed it shed quite a new light on matters which the country at large was not slow to appreciate throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom the examiner was welcomed and its appeals responded to its success was notable even magnificent but it was not a lasting success it did the work that the ministry had intended it to do and did it unmistakably but the principles of this national party were for men of a sterner mould than either harley or st john swift had laid a burden on their shoulders heavier than they could carry and they fell when they were bereft of his support but the work swift did bears witness today to a very unusual combination of qualities in the genius of this man whose personality stands out even above his work it was ever his fate to serve and never his happiness to command but then he had himself accepted servitude when he donned the robe of the priest  it is deserving of repeated record to note that dr johnson in admitting that swift in the examiner had the advantage in argument adds that with regard to wit i am afraid none of swifts papers will be found equal to those by which addison opposed him to which monck mason pertinently remarks the doctor should have told us what these papers were which addison wrote in opposition to swifts examiner for the last whig examiner written by addison was published october 12th 1710 and swifts first examiner on the 2nd november following2                                       in this volume have been collected those writings of swift which form his contributions to the periodicals of his time care has been taken to give the best text and to admit nothing that swift did not write in the preparation of the volume the editor has received such assistance from mr w spencer jackson that it might with stricter justice be said that he had edited it he collated the texts revised the proofs and supplied most of the notes without his assistance the volume must inevitably have been further delayed and the editor gladly takes this occasion to acknowledge his indebtedness to mr jackson and to thank him for his help  his further indebtedness must be acknowledged to the researches of those writers already named in the previously published volumes of this edition and also cited in the notes to the present volume  temple scott  glen ridge new jersey

its projector and editor gives characteristic expression to the motive which prompted him in its establishment the state of conversation and business in this town says steele having been long perplexed with pretenders in both kinds in order to open mens eyes against such abuses it appeared no unprofitable undertaking to publish a paper which should observe upon the manners of the pleasurable as well as the busy part of mankind he goes on to say that the general purpose of this paper is to expose the false arts of life to pull off the disguises of cunning vanity and affectation and to recommend a general simplicity in our dress our discourse and our behaviour  that steele succeeded in this laudable purpose has been amply made evident by the effect the tatler had upon his literary successors both of his own age and of the generations since his time the tatler was if we except defoes weekly review the earliest literary periodical which in the language of scott had no small effect in fixing and refining the character of the english nation  steele conducted his periodical under the name of isaac bickerstaff he chose this name purposely because he felt as he himself expressed it that a work of this nature required time to grow into the notice of the world it happened very luckily that a little before i had resolved upon this design a gentleman had written predictions and two or three other pieces in my name which had rendered it famous through all parts of europe and by an inimitable spirit and humour raised it to as high a pitch of reputation as it could possibly arrive at the gentleman referred to is of course swift whose pamphlets on partridge had been the talk of the town  steele very kindly ascribes the success of the periodical to this good fortune and though there may be something in what he said we in the present day can more justly appreciate the great benefit conferred upon his countrymen by himself and his coworkers  the influence of the tatler on contemporary thought is acknowledged by gay in his present state of wit published in 1711 gay remarks his writings have set all our wits and men of letters upon a new way of thinking of which they had little or no notion before and though we cannot yet say that any of them have come up to the beauties of the original i think we may venture to affirm that every one of them writes and thinks much more justly than they did some time since  among the contributors in addition to the editor himself were swift addison yalden john hughes william harrison and james greenwood  it must always remain to a great extent a matter of conjecture as to the exact authorship of the tatler papers in the preface to the fourth volume the authorship of a very few of the articles was admitted peter wentworth wrote to his brother lord raby on may 9th 1709 saying the tatlers are writ by a club of wits who make it their business to pick up all the merry stories they can three of the authors are guessed at viz swift yalden and steele wentworth papers 85  swifts first recognized prose contribution to the tatler was in no 32 june 23rd and he continued from time to time as the following reprint will show to assist his friend but unfortunately party politics separated the two and swift retired from the venture  a particular meaning was attached to the place from which the articles in the tatler were dated the following notice appeared in the first number all accounts of gallantry pleasure and entertainment shall be under the article of whites chocolatehouse poetry under that of wills coffeehouse learning under the title of grecian foreign and domestic news you will have from st jamess coffeehouse and what else i have to offer on any other subject shall be dated from my own apartment  the tatler was reprinted in edinburgh as soon as possible after its publication in london commencing apparently with no 130 as no 31 edinburgh james watson is dated april 24th 1710 and corresponds to no 160 of the original edition april 18th 1710 ts   the tatler numb 32  from tuesday june 21 to thursday june 23 1709  to isaac bickerstaff esq1  june 18 1709  sir  i know not whether you ought to pity or laugh at me for i am fallen desperately in love with a professed platonne the most unaccountable creature of her sex to hear her talk seraphics and run over norris2 and more3 and milton4 and the whole set of intellectual triflers torments me heartily for to a lover who understands metaphors all this pretty prattle of ideas gives very fine views of pleasure which only the dear declaimer prevents by understanding them literally why should she wish to be a cherubim when it is flesh and blood that makes her adorable if i speak to her that is a high breach of the idea of intuition if i offer at her hand or lip she shrinks from the touch like a sensitive plant and would contract herself into mere spirit she calls her chariot vehicle her furbelowed scarf pinions her blue manteau and petticoat is her azure dress and her footman goes by the name of oberon it is my misfortune to be six foot and a half high two full spans between the shoulders thirteen inches diameter in the calves and before i was in love i had a noble stomach and usually went to bed sober with two bottles i am not quite six and twenty and my nose is marked truly aquiline for these reasons i am in a very particular manner her aversion what shall i do impudence itself cannot reclaim her if i write miserable she reckons me among the children of perdition and discards me her region if i assume the gross and substantial she plays the real ghost with me and vanishes in a moment i had hopes in the hypocrisy of the sex but perseverance makes it as bad as a fixed aversion i desire your opinion whether i may not lawfully play the inquisition upon her make use of a little force and put her to the rack and the torture only to convince her she has really fine limbs without spoiling or distorting them i expect your directions ere i proceed to dwindle and fall away with despair which at present i dont think advisable because if she should recant she may then hate me perhaps in the other extreme for my tenuity i am with impatience  your most humble servant  charles sturdy   my patient has put his case with very much warmth and represented it in so lively a manner that i see both his torment and tormentor with great perspicuity this order of platonic ladies are to be dealt with in a peculiar manner from all the rest of the sex flattery is the general way and the way in this case but it is not to be done grossly every man that has wit and humour and raillery can make a good flatterer for woman in general but a platonne is not to be touched with panegyric she will tell you it is a sensuality in the soul to be delighted that way you are not therefore to commend but silently consent to all she does and says you are to consider in her the scorn of you is not humour but opinion  there were some years since a set of these ladies who were of quality and gave out that virginity was to be their state of life during this mortal condition and therefore resolved to join their fortunes and erect a nunnery the place of residence was pitched upon and a pretty situation full of natural falls and risings of waters with shady coverts and flowery arbours was approved by seven of the founders there were as many of our sex who took the liberty to visit those mansions of intended severity among others a famous rake5 of that time who had the grave way to an excellence he came in first but upon seeing a servant coming towards him with a design to tell him this was no place for him or his companions up goes my grave impudence to the maid young woman said he if any of the ladies are in the way on this side of the house pray carry us on the other side towards the gardens we are you must know gentlemen that are travelling england after which we shall go into foreign parts where some of us have already been here he bows in the most humble manner and kissed the girl who knew not how to behave to such a sort of carriage he goes on now you must know we have an ambition to have it to say that we have a protestant nunnery in england but pray mrs bettysir she replied my name is susan at your servicethen i heartily beg your pardonno offence in the least says she for i have a cousingerman whose name is betty6indeed said he i protest to you that was more than i knew i spoke at random but since it happens that i was near in the right give me leave to present this gentleman to the favour of a civil salute his friend advances and so on till that they had all saluted her by this means the poor girl was in the middle of the crowd of these fellows at a loss what to do without courage to pass through them and the platonics at several peepholes pale trembling and fretting rake perceived they were observed and therefore took care to keep sukey in chat with questions concerning their way of life when appeared at last madonella7 a lady who had writ a fine book concerning the recluse life and was the projectrix of the foundation she approaches into the hall and rake knowing the dignity of his own mien and aspect goes deputy from his company she begins sir i am obliged to follow the servant who was sent out to know what affair could make strangers press upon a solitude which we who are to inhabit this place have devoted to heaven and our own thoughts madam replies rake with an air of great distance mixed with a certain indifference by which he could dissemble dissimulation your great intention has made more noise in the world than you design it should and we travellers who have seen many foreign institutions of this kind have a curiosity to see in its first rudiments this seat of primitive piety for such it must be called by future ages to the eternal honour of the founders i have read madonellas excellent and seraphic discourse on this subject the lady immediately answers if what i have said could have contributed to raise any thoughts in you that may make for the advancement of intellectual and divine conversation i should think myself extremely happy he immediately fell back with the profoundest veneration then advancing are you then that admired lady if i may approach lips which have uttered things so sacred he salutes her his friends followed his example the devoted within stood in amazement where this would end to see madonella receive their address and their company but rake goes onwe would not transgress rules but if we may take the liberty to see the place you have thought fit to choose for ever we would go into such parts of the gardens as is consistent with the severities you have imposed on yourselves  to be short madonella permitted rake to lead her into the assembly of nuns followed by his friends and each took his fair one by the hand after due explanation to walk round the gardens the conversation turned upon the lilies the flowers the arbours and the growing vegetables and rake had the solemn impudence when the whole company stood round him to say that he sincerely wished men might rise out of the earth like plants8 and that our minds were not of necessity to be sullied with carnivorous appetites for the generation as well as support of our species this was spoke with so easy and fixed an assurance that madonella answered sir under the notion of a pious thought you deceive yourself in wishing an institution foreign to that of providence these desires were implanted in us for reverend purposes in preserving the race of men and giving opportunities for making our chastity more heroic the conference was continued in this celestial strain and carried on so well by the managers on both sides that it created a second and a second interview9 and without entering into further particulars there was hardly one of them but was a mother or father that day twelvemonth  any unnatural part is long taking up and as long laying aside therefore mr sturdy may assure himself platonica will fly for ever from a forward behaviour but if he approaches her according to this model she will fall in with the necessities of mortal life and condescend to look with pity upon an unhappy man imprisoned in so much body and urged by such violent desires  footnote 1 this letter is introduced by the following words  whites chocolatehouse june 22  an answer to the following letter being absolutely necessary to be dispatched with all expedition i must trespass upon all that come with horary questions into my antechamber to give the gentleman my opinion  this paper is written in ridicule of some affected ladies of the period who pretended with rather too much ostentation to embrace the doctrines of platonic love mrs mary astell a learned and worthy woman had embraced this fantastic notion so deeply that in an essay upon the female sex in 1696 she proposed a sort of female college in which the young might be instructed and ladies nauseating the parade of the world might find a happy retirement the plan was disconcerted by bishop burnet who understanding that the queen intended to give £10000 towards the establishment dissuaded her by an assurance that it would lead to the introduction of popish orders and be called a nunnery this lady is the madonella of the tatler this paper has been censured as a gross reflection on mrs astells character but on no very just foundation swift only prophesies the probable issue of such a scheme as that of the protestant nunnery and it is a violent interpretation of his words to suppose him to insinuate that the conclusion had taken place without the premises indeed the scourge of ridicule is seldom better employed than on that species of précieuse who is anxious to confound the boundaries which nature has fixed for the employments and studies of the two sexes no man was more zealous than swift for informing the female mind in those points most becoming and useful to their sex his letter to a young married lady and thoughts on education point out the extent of those studies s  nichols in his edition of the tatler 1786 ascribes this paper to swift and addison but he thinks the humour of it certainly originated in the licentious imagination of the dean of st patricks ts  footnote 2 john norris 16571711 rector of bemerton

cruel insinuations against her character in this paper the libel is repeated in the 59th and 63rd numbers of the tatler her correspondence with norris was published in 1695 with the title letters

whence i suppose you would insinuate that it is the most ancient and numerous house in all europe but i positively deny that it is either and wonder much at your audacious proceedings in this matter since it is well known that our most illustrious most renowned and most celebrated roman family of ix has enjoyed the precedency to all others from the reign of good old saturn i could say much to the

where he takes me rather than disoblige him  sir having a peculiar humour of desiring to be somewhat the better or wiser for what i read i am always uneasy when in any profound writer for i read no others i happen to meet with what i cannot understand when this falls out it is a great grievance to me that i am not able to consult the author himself about his meaning for commentators are a sect that has little share in my esteem your elaborate writings have among many others this advantage that their author is still alive and ready as his extensive charity makes us expect to explain whatever may be found in them too sublime for vulgar understandings this sir makes me presume to ask you how the hampstead heros character could be perfectly new1 when the last letters came away and yet sir john suckling so well acquainted with it sixty years ago i hope sir you will not take this amiss i can assure you i have a profound respect for you which makes me write this with the same disposition with which longinus bids us read homer and plato  when in reading says he any of those celebrated authors we meet with a passage to which we cannot well reconcile our reasons we ought firmly to believe that were those great wits present to answer for themselves we should to our wonder be convinced that we only are guilty of the mistakes we before attributed to them if you think fit to remove

this expression for the same reason for which you once desired us to excuse you when you seemed anything dull most writers like the generality of paul lorrains2 saints seem to place a peculiar vanity in dying hard but you sir to show a good example to your brethren have not only confessed but of your own accord mended the indictment nay you have been so goodnatured as to discover beauties in it

since taken her flight towards the ethereal mansions still walks it seems in the regions of mortality where she has found by deep reflections on the revolution4 mentioned in yours of june the 23rd that where early instructions have been wanting to imprint true ideas of things on the tender souls of those of her sex they are never after able to arrive at such a pitch of perfection as to be above the laws of matter and motion laws which are considerably enforced by the principles usually imbibed in nurseries and boardingschools to remedy this evil she has laid the scheme of a college for young damsels where instead of scissors needles and samplers pens compasses quadrants books manuscripts greek latin and hebrew are to take up their whole time only on holidays the students will for moderate exercise be allowed to divert themselves with the use of some of the lightest and most voluble weapons and proper care will be taken to give them at least a superficial tincture of the ancient and modern amazonian tactics of these military performances the direction is undertaken by epicene5 the writer of memoirs from the mediterranean who by the help of some artificial poisons conveyed by smells has within these few weeks brought many persons of both sexes to an untimely fate and what is more surprising has contrary to her profession with the same odours revived others who had long since been drowned in the whirlpools of lethe another of the professors is to be a certain lady who is now publishing two of the choicest saxon novels6 which are said to have been in as great repute

coffeehouse september 9  we have been very much perplexed here this evening by two gentlemen who took upon them to talk as loud as if it were expected from them to entertain the company their subject was eloquence and graceful action lysander who is something particular in his way of thinking and speaking told us a man could not be eloquent without action for the deportment of the body the turn of the eye and an apt sound to every word that is uttered must all conspire to make an accomplished speaker action in one that speaks in public is the same thing which a good mien is in ordinary life thus as a certain insensibility in the countenance recommends a sentence of humour and jest so it must be a very lively consciousness that gives grace to great sentiments for the jest is to be a thing unexpected therefore your undesigning manner is a beauty in expressions of mirth but when you are to talk on a set subject the more you are moved yourself the more you will move others  there is said he a remarkable example of that kind aeschines a famous orator of antiquity had pleaded at athens in a great cause against demosthenes but having lost it retired to rhodes eloquence was then the quality most admired among men and the magistrates of that place having heard he had a copy of the speech of demosthenes desired him to repeat both their pleadings after his own he recited also the oration of his antagonist the people expressed their admiration of both but more of that of demosthenes if you are said he thus touched with hearing only what that great orator said how would you have been affected had you seen him speak for he who hears demosthenes only loses much the better part of the oration certain it is that they who speak gracefully are very lamely represented in having their speeches read or repeated by unskilful people for there is something native to each man that is so inherent to his thoughts and sentiments which it is hardly possible for another to give a true idea of you may observe in common talk when a sentence of any mans is repeated an acquaintance of his shall immediately observe that is so like him methinks i see how he looked when he said it but of all the people on the earth there are none who puzzle me so much as the clergy of great britain who are i believe the most learned body of men now in the world and yet this art of speaking with the proper ornaments of voice and gesture is wholly neglected among them and i will engage were a deaf man to behold the greater part of them preach he would rather think they were reading the contents only of some discourse they intended to make than actually in the body of an oration even when they are upon matters of such a nature as one would believe it were impossible to think of without emotion  i own there are exceptions to this general observation and that the dean1 we heard the other day together is an orator he has so much regard to his congregation that he commits to his memory what he is to say to them and has so soft and graceful a behaviour that it must attract your attention his person it is to be confessed is no small recommendation but he is to be highly commended for not losing that advantage and adding to the propriety of speech which might pass the criticism of longinus2 an action which would have been approved by demosthenes he has a peculiar force in his way and has many of his audience3 who could not be intelligent hearers of his discourse were there not explanation as well as grace in his action this art of his is used with the most exact and honest skill he never attempts your passions till he has convinced your reason all the objections which he can form are laid before you and dispersed before he uses the least vehemence in his sermon but when he thinks he has your head he very soon wins your heart and never pretends to show the beauty of holiness till he has convinced you of the truth of it  would every one of our clergymen be thus careful to recommend truth and virtue in their proper figures and show so much concern for them as to give them all the additional force they were able it is not possible that nonsense should have so many hearers as you find it has in dissenting congregations for no reason in the world but because it is spoken extempore for ordinary minds are wholly governed by their eyes and ears and there is no way to come at their hearts but by power over their imagination there is my friend and merry companion daniel4 he knows a great deal better than he speaks and can form a proper discourse as well as any orthodox neighbour but he knows very well that to bawl out my beloved and the words grace regeneration sanctification a new light the day the day aye my beloved the day or rather the night the night is coming and judgment will come when we least think of itand so forthhe knows to be vehement is the only way to come at his audience and daniel when he sees my friend greenhat come in can give him a good hint and cry out this is only for the saints the regenerated by this force of action though mixed with all the incoherence and ribaldry imaginable daniel can laugh at his diocesan and grow fat by voluntary subscription while the parson of the parish goes to law for half his dues daniel will tell you it is not the shepherd but the sheep with the bell which the flock follows another thing very wonderful this learned body should omit is learning to read which is a most necessary part of eloquence in one who is to serve at the altar for there is no man but must be sensible that the lazy tone and inarticulate sound of our common readers depreciates the most proper form of words that were ever extant in any nation or language to speak our own wants or his power from whom we ask relief  there cannot be a greater instance of the power of action than in little parson dapper5 who is the common relief to all the lazy pulpits in town this smart youth has a very good memory a quick eye and a clean handkerchief thus equipped he opens his text shuts his book fairly shows he has no notes in his bible opens both palms and shows all is fair there too thus with a decisive air my young man goes on without hesitation and though from the beginning to the end of his pretty discourse he has not used one proper gesture yet at the conclusion the churchwarden pulls his gloves from off his head pray who is this extraordinary young man thus the force of action is such that it is more prevalent even when improper than all the reason and argument in the world without it this gentleman concluded his discourse by saying i do not doubt but if our preachers would learn to speak and our readers to read within six months time we should not have a dissenter within a mile of a church in great britain  footnote 1 in his original preface to the fourth volume steele explains that the amiable character of the dean in the sixtysixth tatler was drawn for dr atterbury steele cites this as a proof of his impartiality scott thinks that it must have cost him some effort to permit insertion of a passage so favourable to a tory divine at the time the character was published atterbury was dean of carlisle and one of the queens chaplains he was later created bishop of rochester there is no doubt that atterbury was deeply implicated in the various jacobite plots for the bringing in of the pretender under a bill of pains and penalties he was condemned and deprived of all his ecclesiastical offices in 1723 he left england and died in exile in 1732 his body however was privately buried in

whom they pay by sending him to ireland january 7th 17101 see vol ii p 96 this sending to ireland refers to his chaplaincy to sir constantine phipps lord chancellor of ireland 171012 on july 17th 1712

publicspirited person i am sure i am unable to express to the world how much anxiety i have suffered to see of how little benefit my lucubrations have been to my fellowsubjects men will go on in their own way in spite of all my labour i gave mr didapper a private reprimand for wearing redheeled shoes and at the same time was so indulgent as to connive at him for fourteen days because i would give him the wearing of them out but after all this i am informed he appeared yesterday with a new pair of the same sort i have no better success with mr whatdeecall1 as to his buttons stentor2 still roars and box and dice rattle as loud as they did before i writ against them partridge3 walks about at noonday and aesculapius4 thinks of adding a new lace to his livery however i must still go on in laying these enormities before mens eyes and let them answer for going on in their practice5 my province is much larger than at first sight men would imagine and i shall lose no part of my jurisdiction which extends not only to futurity but also is retrospect to things past and the behaviour of persons who have long ago acted their parts is as much liable to my examination as that of my own contemporaries  in order to put the whole race of mankind in their proper distinctions according to the opinion their cohabitants conceived of them i have with very much care and depth of meditation thought fit to erect a chamber of fame and established certain rules which are to be observed in admitting members into this illustrious society in this chamber of fame there are to be three tables but of different lengths the first is to contain exactly twelve persons the second twenty the third an hundred this is reckoned to be the full number of those who have any competent share of fame at the first of these tables are to be placed in their order the twelve most famous persons in the world not with regard to the things they are famous for but according to the degree of their fame whether in valour wit or learning thus if a scholar be more famous than a soldier he is to sit above him neither must any preference be given to virtue if the person be not equally famous when the first table is filled the next in renown must be seated at the second and so on in like manner to the number of twenty as also in the same order at the third which is to hold an hundred at these tables no regard is to be had to seniority for if julius caesar shall be judged more famous than romulus and scipio he must have the precedence no person who has not been dead an hundred years must be offered to a place at any of these tables and because this is altogether a lay society and that sacred persons move upon greater motives than that of fame no persons celebrated in holy writ or any ecclesiastical men whatsoever are to be introduced here  at the lower end of the room is to be a sidetable for persons of great fame but dubious existence such as hercules theseus aeneas achilles hector and others but because it is apprehended that there may be great contention about precedence the proposer humbly desires the opinion of the learned towards his assistance in placing every person according to his rank that none may have just occasion of offence  the merits of the cause shall be judged by plurality of voices  for the more impartial execution of this important affair it is desired that no man will offer his favourite hero scholar or poet and that the learned will be pleased to send to mr bickerstaff at mr morphews near stationers hall their several lists for the first table only and in the order they would have them placed after which the composer will compare the several lists and make another for the public wherein every name shall be ranked according to the voices it has had under this chamber is to be a dark vault for the same number of persons of evil fame  it is humbly submitted to consideration whether the project would not be better if the persons of true fame meet in a middle room those of dubious existence in an upper room and those of evil fame in a lower dark room  it is to be noted that no historians are to be admitted at any of these tables because they are appointed to conduct the several persons to their seats and are to be made use of as ushers to the assemblies  i call upon the learned world to send me their assistance towards this design it being a matter of too great moment for any one person to determine but i do assure them their lists shall be examined with great fidelity and those that are exposed to the public made with all the caution imaginable

predictions see vol i of this edition p 298 and issued his broadside concluding with the lines    here five feet deep lies on his back   a cobler starmonger and quack   who to the stars in pure good will   does to his best look upward still   weep all you customers that use   his pills his almanacks or shoes  in no 59 of the tatler his death is referred to in harmony with the tone of swifts fun

william iii and offended anne by his churlish disregard of her requests to attend on her he fell in love with a miss tempest one of queen annes maids of honour in the 44th number of the tatler steele ridicules this attachment by making him address his mistress in the following words o fair for thee i sit amidst a crowd of painted deities on my chariot buttoned in gold clasped in gold without having any value for that beloved metal but as it adorns the person and laces the hat of thy dying lover radcliffe attended swift for his dizziness but that did not prevent the latter from referring to him as that puppy in writing to stella for neglecting to attend to harleys wound he seems to have had a high standing for skill as a physician and probably on that account gave himself airs it is told of him that during a long attendance in the family of a particular friend he regularly refused the fee pressed upon him at each visit at length when the cure was performed and the doctor about to give up attendance the convalescent patient again proffered him a purse containing the fees for every days visit the doctor eyed it some time in silence and at length extended his hand exclaiming singly i could have refused them for ever but altogether they are irresistible radcliffe died at carshalton in 1714 from his bequests were founded the radcliffe infirmary and observatory at oxford ts  footnote 5 scott omits from his edition the whole of this paragraph up to this point ts    the tatler numb 68  from tuesday september 13 to thursday september 15 1709  from my own apartment september 14  the progress of our endeavours will of necessity be very much interrupted except the learned world will please to send their lists to the chamber of fame with all expedition there is nothing can so much contribute to create a noble emulation in our youth as the honourable mention of such whose actions have outlived the injuries of time and recommended themselves so far to the world that it is become learning to know the least circumstance of their affairs it is a great incentive to see that some men have raised themselves so highly above their fellowcreatures that the lives of ordinary men are spent in inquiries after the particular actions of the most illustrious true it is that without this impulse to fame and reputation our industry would stagnate and that lively desire of pleasing each other die away this opinion was so established in the heathen world that their sense of living appeared insipid except their being was enlivened with a consciousness that they were esteemed by the rest of the world  upon examining the proportion of mens fame for my table of twelve i thought it no ill way since i had laid it down for a rule that they were to be ranked simply as they were famous without regard to their virtue to ask my sister jennys advice and particularly mentioned to her the name of aristotle she immediately told me he was a very great scholar and that she had read him at the boardingschool she certainly means a trifle sold by the hawkers called aristotles problems 1 but this raised a great scruple in me whether a fame increased by imposition of others is to be added to his account or that these excrescencies which grow out of his real reputation and give encouragement to others to pass things under the covert of his name should be considered in giving him his seat in the chamber this punctilio is referred to the learned in the mean time so illnatured are mankind that i believe i have names already sent me sufficient to fill up my lists for the dark room and every one is apt enough to send in their accounts of ill deservers this malevolence does not proceed from a real dislike of virtue but a diabolical prejudice against it which makes men willing to destroy what they care not to imitate thus you see the greatest characters among your acquaintance and those you live with are traduced by all below them in virtue who never mention them but with an exception however i believe i shall not give the world much trouble about filling my tables for those of evil fame for i have some thoughts of clapping up the sharpers there as fast as i can lay hold of them  at present i am employed in looking over the several notices which i have received of their manner of dexterity and the way at dice of making all rugg as the cant is the whole art of securing a die has lately been sent me by a person who was of the fraternity but is disabled by the loss of a finger by which means he cannot as he used to do secure a die but i am very much at a loss how to call some of the fair sex who are accomplices with the knights of industry for my metaphorical dogs2 are easily enough understood but the feminine gender of dogs has so harsh a sound that we know not how to name it but i am credibly informed that there are female dogs as voracious as the males and make advances to young fellows without any other design but coming to a familiarity with their purses i have also long lists of persons of condition who are certainly of the same regiment with these banditti and instrumental to their cheats upon undiscerning men of their own rank these add their good reputation to carry on the impostures of those whose very names would otherwise be defence enough against falling into their hands but for the honour of our nation these shall be unmentioned provided we hear no more of such practices and that they shall not from henceforward suffer the society of such as they know to be the common enemies of order discipline and virtue if it prove that they go on in encouraging them they must be proceeded against according to severest rules of history where all is to be laid before the world with impartiality and without respect to persons  so let the stricken deer go weep3  footnote 1 this was not a translation of aristotles problemata but an indecent pamphlet with that title ts  footnote 2 in the 62nd number of the tatler

with great pleasure in the tatler2 of saturday last the conversation upon eloquence permit me to hint to you one thing the great roman orator observes upon this subject caput enim arbitrabatur oratoris he quotes menedemus3 an athenian ut ipsis apud quos ageret talis qualem ipse optaret videretur id fieri vitae dignitate4 it is the first rule in oratory that a man must appear such as he would persuade others to be and that can be accomplished only by the force of his life i believe it might be of great service to let our public orators know that an unnatural gravity or an unbecoming levity in their behaviour out of the pulpit will take very much from the force of their eloquence in it excuse another scrap of latin it is from one of the fathers i think it will appear a just observation to all as it may have authority with some qui autem docent tantum nec faciunt ipsi praeceptis suis detrahunt pondus quis enim obtemperet cum ipsi praeceptores doceant non obtemperare5 i am  sir  your humble servant  jonathan rosehat  ps you were complaining in that paper that the clergy of greatbritain had not yet learned to speak a very great defect indeed and therefore i shall think myself a welldeserver of the church in recommending all the dumb clergy to the famous speaking doctor6 at kensington this ingenious gentleman out of compassion to those of a bad utterance has placed his whole study in the newmodelling the organs of voice which art he has so far advanced as to be able even to make a good orator of a pair of bellows he lately exhibited a specimen of his skill in this way of which i was informed by the worthy gentlemen then present who were at once delighted and amazed to hear an instrument of so simple an organization use an exact articulation of words a just cadency in its sentences and a wonderful pathos in its pronunciation not that he designs to expatiate in this practice because he cannot as he says apprehend what use it may be of to mankind whose benefit he aims at in a more particular manner and for the same reason he will never more instruct the feathered kind the parrot having been his last scholar in that way he has a wonderful faculty in making and mending echoes and this he will perform at any time for the use of the solitary in the country being a man born for universal good and for that reason recommended to your patronage by sir

admonition to our vicar and schoolmaster who in his preaching to his auditors stretches his jaws so wide that instead of instructing youth it rather frightens them likewise in reading prayers he has such a careless loll that people are justly offended at his irreverent posture besides the extraordinary charge they are put to in sending their children to dance to bring them off of those ill gestures another evil faculty he has in making the bowlinggreen his daily residence instead of his church where his curate reads prayers every day if the weather is fair his time is spent in visiting if cold or wet in bed or at least at home though within 100 yards of the church these out of many such irregular practices i write for his reclamation but two or three things more before i conclude to wit that generally when his curate preaches in the afternoon he sleeps sotting in the desk on a hassock with all this he is so extremely proud that he will go but once to the sick except they return

expressions are done out of french latin or other language and made english i cannot but observe to you that till of late years a grubstreet book was always bound in sheepskin with suitable print and paper the price never above a shilling and taken off wholly by common tradesmen or country pedlars but now they appear in all sizes and shapes and in all places they are handed about from lapfuls in every coffeehouse to persons of quality are shewn in westminsterhall and the court of requests you may see them gilt and in royal paper of five or six hundred pages and rated accordingly i would engage to furnish you with a catalogue of english books published within the compass of seven years past which at the first hand would cost you a hundred pounds wherein you shall not be able to find ten lines together of common grammar or common sense  these two evils ignorance and want of taste have produced a third i mean the continual corruption of our english tongue which without some timely remedy will suffer more by the false refinements of twenty years past than it hath been improved in the foregoing hundred and this is what i design chiefly to enlarge upon leaving the former evils to your animadversion  but instead of giving you a list of the late refinements crept into our language i here send you the copy of a letter i received some time ago from a most accomplished person in this way of writing upon which i shall make some remarks it is in these terms  sir  i couldnt get the things you sent for all about towni thôt to ha come down myself and then id ha brôut umn but i hant dont and i believe i cant dot thats pozztom3 begins to gimself airs because hes going with the plenipostis said the french king will bamboozl us agen which causes many speculations the jacks and others of that kidney are very uppish and alert upont as you may see by their phizzswill hazzard has got the hipps having lost to the tune of five hundrd pound thô he understands play very well nobody better he has promist me upon rep to leave off play but you know tis a weakness hes too apt to give into thô he has as much wit as any man nobody more he has lain incog ever sincethe mobbs very quiet with us nowi believe you thôt i bantered you in my last like a country puti shant leave town this month c  this letter is in every point an admirable pattern of the present polite way of writing nor is it of less authority for being an epistle you may gather every flower in it with a thousand more of equal sweetness from the books pamphlets and single papers offered us every day in the coffeehouses and these are the beauties introduced to supply the want of wit sense humour and learning which formerly were looked upon as qualifications for a writer if a man of wit who died forty years ago were to rise from the grave on purpose how would he be able to read this letter and after he had gone through that difficulty how would he be able to understand it the first thing that strikes your eye is the breaks at the end of almost every sentence of which i know not the use only that it is a refinement and very frequently practised then you will observe the abbreviations and elisions by which consonants of most obdurate sound are joined together without one softening vowel to intervene and all this only to make one syllable of two directly contrary to the example of the greeks and romans altogether of the gothic strain and a natural tendency towards relapsing into barbarity which delights in monosyllables and uniting of mute consonants as it is observable in all the northern languages and this is still more visible in the next refinement which consists in pronouncing the first syllable in a word that has many and dismissing the rest such as phizz hipps mobb4 poz rep and many more when we are already overloaded with monosyllables which are the disgrace of our language thus we cram one syllable and cut off the rest as the owl fattened her mice after she had bit off their legs to prevent their running away and if ours be the same reason for maiming words it will certainly answer the end for i am sure no other nation will desire to borrow them some words are hitherto but fairly split and therefore only in their way to perfection as incog and plenipo but in a short time it is to be hoped they will be further docked to inc and plen this reflection has made me of late years very impatient for a peace which i believe would save the lives of many brave words as well as men the war has introduced abundance of polysyllables which will never be able to live many more campaigns speculations operations preliminaries ambassadors palisadoes communication circumvallation battalions as numerous as they are if they attack us too frequently in our coffeehouses we shall certainly put them to flight and cut off the rear  the third refinement observable in the letter i send you consists in the choice of certain words invented by some pretty fellows such as banter bamboozle country put and kidney as it is there applied some of which are now struggling for the vogue and others are in possession of it i have done my utmost for some years past to stop the progress of mobb and banter but have been plainly borne down by numbers and betrayed by those who promised to assist me  in the last place you are to take notice of certain choice phrases scattered through the letter some of them tolerable enough till they were worn to rags by servile imitators you might easily find them though they were not in a different print and therefore i need not disturb them  these are the false refinements in our style which you ought to correct first by argument and fair means but if those fail i think you are to make use of your authority as censor and by an annual index expurgatorius expunge all words and phrases that are offensive to good sense and condemn those barbarous mutilations of vowels and syllables in this last point the usual pretence is that they spell as they speak a noble standard for language to depend upon the caprice of every coxcomb who because words are the clothing of our thoughts cuts them out and shapes them as he pleases and changes them oftener than his dress i believe all reasonable people would be content that such refiners were more sparing in their words and liberal in their syllables and upon this head i should be glad you would bestow some advice upon several young readers in our churches who coming up from the university full fraught with admiration of our town politeness will needs correct the style of their prayerbooks in reading the absolution they are very careful to say pardons and absolves and in the prayer for the royal family it must be endueum enrichum prosperum and bringum5 then in their sermons they use all the modern terms of art sham banter mob bubble bully cutting shuffling and palming all which and many more of the like stamp as i have heard them often in the pulpit from such young sophisters so i have read them in some of those sermons that have made most noise of late the design it seems is to avoid the dreadful imputation of pedantry to shew us that they know the town understand men and manners and have not been poring upon old unfashionable books in the university  i should be glad to see you the instrument of introducing into our style that simplicity which is the best and truest ornament of most things in life which the politer ages always aimed at in their building and dress simplex munditiis as well as their productions of wit it is manifest that all new affected modes of speech whether borrowed from the court the town or the theatre are the first perishing parts in any language and as i could prove by many hundred instances have been so in ours the writings of hooker6 who was a country clergyman and of parsons7 the jesuit both in the reign of queen elizabeth are in a style that with very few allowances would not offend any present reader much more clear and intelligible than those of sir h wotton8sir robert naunton9 osborn10 daniel11 the historian and several others who writ later but being men of the court and affecting the phrases then in fashion they are often either not to be understood or appear perfectly ridiculous  what remedies are to be applied to these evils i have not room to consider having i fear already taken up most of your paper besides i think it is our office only to represent abuses and yours to redress them  i am with great respect sir  your c   footnote 1 in his journal to stella swift writes under date

number of the examiner and in faulkners reprint of 1741 the word was changed to rabble scott notes the dean carried on the war against the word mob to the very last a lady who died in 1788 and was

tablecloth being not so fine as we could have wished was northbritish cloth but the worst of it was we were disturbed all dinnertime by the noise of the children who were playing in the paved court at northbritish hoppers so we paid our northbriton3 sooner than we designed and took coach to northbritain yard about which place most of us live we had indeed gone afoot only we were under some apprehensions lest a northbritish mist should wet a southbritish man to the skin  we think this matter properly expressed according to the accuracy of the new style settled by you in one of your late

and nr the first letters of our names congreve told me today he smoked it immediately the passage referred to by swift was a letter signed scotobritannus printed in no 241 of the tatler in which it was objected that a gentleman ended every sentence with the words the best of any man in england and called upon him to mend his phrase and be hereafter the wisest of any man in great britain writing to alderman barber under date august 8 1738 swift remarks the modern phrase great britain is only to distinguish it from little britain where old clothes and old books are to be bought and sold ts  footnote 3 we paid our scot ie our share of the reckoning ts   note  with no 271 steele brought his venture to a close it was issued on january 2nd 1710 i am now he wrote come to the end of my ambition in this matter and have nothing further to say to the world under the character of isaac bickerstaff his ostensible reason for thus terminating so successful an undertaking he put down to the fact that bickerstaff was no longer a disguise and that he could not hope to have the same influence when it was known who it was that led the movement another reason however suggests itself in steeles recognition of harleys kindness in not depriving him of his commissionership of stamps as well as of his gazetteership for the satires steele permitted to appear against harley in the tatler that steele did have something further to say to the world may be gathered from the fact that two months after the tatlers decease he started the spectator  but the tatler was too good a thing for the publishers to permit to die two days after the issue of no 271 appeared a no 272 with the imprint of john baker of the black boy at paternoster row it extolled the character of richard steele alias isaac bickerstaff esq and promised to continue in his footsteps and be delivered regularly to its subscribers at 5 in the morning on january 6th 1710 no 273 was published by isaac bickerstaff jr john baker however was not to have it all his own way for on january 6th 1710 morphew brought out a numbernot a double number although called numbers 272 273and continued it without intermission on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays until may 19th when the final number no 330 was issued the date 1711 was first used on march 31st meanwhile on january 13th a baldwin issued a no 1 of a tatler in which the public were informed that isaac bickerstaff had had no intention to discontinue the paper but would continue to publish it every tuesday and saturday this was the new tatler in which swift was interesting himself on behalf of william harrison writing to stella under date january 11th he says i am setting up a new tatler little harrison whom i have mentioned to you others have put him on it and i encourage him and he was with me this morning and evening showing me his first which comes out on saturday i doubt he will not succeed for i do not much approve his manner but the scheme is mr secretary st johns and mine and would have done well enough in good hands when the paper came out he wrote again there is not much in it but i hope he will mend you must understand that upon steeles leaving off there were two or three scrub tatlers came out and one of them holds on still and today it advertised against harrisons and so there must be disputes which are genuine like the strops for razors i am afraid the little toad has not the true vein for it apparently he hadnt for later referring to another number swift writes the jackanapes wants a right taste i doubt he wont do  with all swifts assistance harrison did not hold out he quarrelled with baldwin and went to morphew and lillie the publishers of the original tatler only six numbers bear baldwins imprint namely nos 16 dated respectively january 13th january 16th january 20th january 23rd january 27th and february 1st harrisons first number under morphew was called no 285 february 3rd for a very exhaustive and careful research into the publications of the tatler and its imitators the reader is referred to aitkens life of sir richard steele 2 vols 1889  william harrison 16851713 was educated at winchester college and new college oxford he obtained addisons favour by his acquaintance with polite literature and was introduced by him to swift swift took to him very kindly spoke of the young fellow we are all fond of thought him a pretty little fellow with a great deal of wit good sense and good nature and interested himself in him to the extent that through him st john got lord raby to take him to the hague as his secretary he returned with the barrier treaty but without a penny he had not been paid any of his salary swift heard of this and immediately went about collecting a sum of money for his assistance when however he called with the money at harrisons lodgings in knightsbridge he found the poor fellow had died an hour before  these contributions to the new tatler are printed from the original periodical issue with the exception of no 5 which is taken from the second edition of the reprint 1720 as no copy of the original issue has been met with  ts   the tatler numb i  quis ego sum saltem si non sum sosia te interrogo plaut amphitr1  saturday january 13 17112  it is impossible perhaps for the best and wisest amongst us to keep so constant a guard upon our temper but that we may at one time or other lie open to the strokes of fortune and such incidents as we cannot foresee with sentiments of this kind i came home to my lodgings last night much fatigued with a long and sudden journey from the country and full of the ungrateful occasion of it it was natural for me to have immediate recourse to my pen and ink but before i would offer to make use of them i resolved deliberately to tell over a hundred and when i came to the end of that sum i found it more advisable to defer drawing up my intended remonstrance till i had slept soundly on my resentments without any other preface than this i shall give the world a fair account of the treatment i have lately met with and leave them to judge whether the uneasiness i have suffered be inconsistent with the character i have generally pretended to about three weeks since i received an invitation from a kinsman in staffordshire to spend my christmas in those parts upon taking leave of mr morphew i put as many papers into his hands as would serve till my return and charged him at parting to be very punctual with the town in what manner he and mr lillie have been tampered with since i cannot say they have given me my revenge if i desired any by allowing their names to an idle paper that in all human probability cannot live a fortnight to an end myself and the family i was with were in the midst of gaiety and a plentiful entertainment when i received a letter from my sister jenny who after mentioning some little affairs i had intrusted to her goes on thusthe inclosed2 i believe will give you some surprise as it has already astonished every body here who mr steele is that subscribes it i do not know any more than i can comprehend what could induce him to it morphew and lillie i am told are both in the secret i shall not presume to instruct you but hope you will use some means to disappoint the ill nature of those who are taking pains to deprive the world of one of its most reasonable entertainments i am c  i am to thank my sister for her compliment but be that as it will i shall not easily be discouraged from my former undertaking in pursuance of it i was obliged upon this notice to take places in the coach for myself and my maid with the utmost expedition lest i should in a short time be rallied out of my existence as some people will needs fancy mr partridge has been and the real isaac bickerstaff have passed for a creature of mr steeles imagination this illusion might have hoped for some tolerable success if i had not more than once produced my person in a crowded theatre and such a person as mr steele if i am not misinformed in the gentleman would hardly think it an advantage to own though i should throw him in all the little honour i have gained by my lucubrations i may be allowed perhaps to understand pleasantry as well as other men and can in the usual phrase take a jest without being angry but i appeal to the world whether the gentleman has not carried it too far and whether he ought not to make a public recantation if the credulity of some unthinking people should force me to insist upon it the following letter is just come to hand and i think it not improper to be inserted in this paper  to isaac bickerstaff esq  sir  i am extremely glad to hear you are come to town for in your absence we were all mightily surprised with an unaccountable paper signed richard steele who is esteemed by those that know him to be a man of wit and honour and therefore we took it either to be a counterfeit or a perfect christmas frolic of that ingenious gentleman but then your paper ceasing immediately after we were at a loss what to think if you were weary of the work you had so long carried on and had given this mr steele orders to signify so to the public he should have said it in plain terms but as that paper is worded one would be apt to judge that he had a mind to persuade the town that there was some analogy between isaac bickerstaff and him possibly there may be a secret in this which i cannot enter into but i flatter my self that you never had any thoughts of giving over your labours for the benefit of mankind when you cannot but know how many subjects are yet unexhausted and how many others as being less obvious are wholly untouched i dare promise not only for my self but many other abler friends that we shall still continue to furnish you with hints on all proper occasions which is all your genius requires i think by the way you cannot in honour have any more to do with morphew and lillie who have gone beyond the ordinary pitch of assurance and transgressed the very letter of the proverb by endeavouring to cheat you of your christian and surname too wishing you sir long to live for our instruction and diversion and to the defeating of all impostors i remain  your most obedient humble servant  and affectionate kinsman  humphry wagstaff  footnote 1 amphitryon i i 282 who am i at all events if i am not sosia i ask you thatht riley ts

appointed a day and hour to meet a certain lady of great wit whom he had never seen in order to make an acquaintance between them two of racans friends who had heard of the appointment resolved to play him a trick the first went to the lady two hours before the time said his name was racan and talked with her an hour they were both mightily pleased began a great friendship and parted with much satisfaction a few minutes after comes the second and sends up the same name the lady wonders at the meaning and tells him mr racan had just left her the gentleman says it was some rascally impostor and that he had been frequently used in that manner the lady is convinced and they laugh at the oddness of the adventure she now calls to mind several passages which confirm her that the former was a cheat he appoints a second meeting and takes his leave he was no sooner gone but the true racan comes to the door and desires under that name to see the lady she was out of all patience sends for him up rates him for an impostor and after a thousand injuries flings a slipper at his head it was impossible to pacify or disabuse her he was forced to retire and it was not without some time and the intervention of friends that they could come to an éclaircissement this as i take it is exactly the case with mr steele the pretended tatler from morphew and myself only i presume the world will be sooner undeceived than the lady in ménage the very day my last paper came out my printer brought me another of the same date called the tatler by isaac bickerstaff esq and which was still more pleasant with an advertisement4 at the end calling me the female tatler it is not enough to rob me of my name but now they must impose a sex on me when my years have long since determined me to be of none at all there is only one thing wanting in the operation that they would renew my age and then i will heartily forgive them all the rest in the mean time whatever uneasiness i have suffered from the little malice of these men and my retirement in the country the pleasures i have received from the same occasion will fairly balance the account on the one hand i have been highly delighted to see my name and character assumed by the scribblers of the age in order to recommend themselves to it and on the other to observe the good taste of the town in distinguishing and exploding them through every disguise and sacrificing their trifles to the supposed manes of isaac bickerstaff esquire but the greatest merit of my journey into staffordshire is that it has opened to me a new fund of unreproved follies and errors that have hitherto lain out of my view and by their situation escaped my censure for as i have lived generally in town the images i had of the country were such only as my senses received very early and my memory has since preserved with all the advantages they first appeared in  hence it was that i thought our parish church the noblest structure in england and the squires placehouse as we called it a most magnificent palace i had the same opinion of the almshouse in the churchyard and of a bridge over the brook that parts our parish from the next it was the common vogue of our school that the master was the best scholar in europe and the usher the second not happening to correct these notions by comparing them with what i saw when i came into the world upon returning back i began to resume my former imaginations and expected all things should appear in the same view as i left them when i was a boy but to my utter disappointment i found them wonderfully shrunk and lessened almost out of my knowledge i looked with contempt on the tribes painted on the church walls which i once so much admired and on the carved chimneypiece in the squires hall i found my old master to be a poor ignorant pedant and in short the whole scene to be extremely changed for the worse this i could not help mentioning because though it be of no consequence in itself yet it is certain that most prejudices are contracted and retained by this narrow way of thinking which in matters of the greatest moment are hardly shook off and which we only think true because we were made to believe so before we were capable to distinguish between truth and falsehood but there was one prepossession which i confess to have parted with much to my regret i mean the opinion of that native honesty and simplicity of manners which i had always imagined to be inherent in countrypeople i soon observed it was with them and us as they say of animals that every species at land has one to resemble it at sea for it was easy to discover the seeds and principles of every vice and folly that one meets with in the more known world though shooting up in different forms i took a fancy out of the several inhabitants round to furnish the camp the bar and the exchange and some certain chocolate and coffeehouses with exact parallels to what in many instances they already produce there was a drunken quarrelsome smith whom i have a hundred times fancied at the head of a troop of dragoons a weaver within two doors of my kinsman was perpetually setting neighbours together by the ears i lamented to see how his talents were misplaced and imagined what a figure he might make in westminsterhall goodman crop of compton farm wants nothing but a plum and a gold chain to qualify him for the government of the city my kinsmans stableboy was a gibing companion that would always have his jest he would often put cowitch in the maids beds pull stools from under folks and lay a coal upon their shoes when they were asleep he was at last turned off for some notable piece of roguery and when i came away was loitering among the alehouses bless me thought i what a prodigious wit would this have been with us i could have matched all the sharpers between st jamess and covent garden with a notable fellow in the same neighbourhood since hanged for picking pockets at fairs could he have had the advantages of their education so nearly are the corruptions of the country allied to those of the town with no further difference than what is made by another turn of

pecus               vir1  from tuesday jan 23 to saturday jan 27 17102   amongst other severities i have met with from some critics the cruellest for an old man is that they will not let me be at quiet in my bed but pursue me to my very dreams i must not dream but when they please nor upon long continued subjects however visionary in their own natures because there is a manifest moral quite through them which to produce as a dream is improbable and unnatural the pain i might have had from this objection is prevented by considering they have missed another against which i should have been at a loss to defend myself they should have asked me whether the dreams i publish can properly be called lucubrations which is the name i have given to all my papers whether in volumes or halfsheets so manifest a contradiction in terminis that i wonder no sophister ever thought of it but the other is a cavil i remember when i was a boy at school i have often dreamed out the whole passages of a day that i rode a journey baited supped went to bed and rose the next morning and i have known young ladies who could dream a whole contexture of adventures in one night large enough to make a novel in youth the imagination is strong not mixed with cares nor tinged with those passions that most disturb and confound it such as avarice ambition and many others now as old men are said to grow children again so in this article of dreaming i am returned to my childhood my imagination is at full ease without care avarice or ambition to clog it by which among many others i have this advantage of doubling the small remainder of my time and living fourandtwenty hours in the day however the dream i am now going to relate is as wild as can well be imagined and adapted to please these refiners upon sleep without any moral that i can discover  it happened that my maid left on the table in my bedchamber one of her story books as she calls them which i took up and found full of strange impertinences fitted to her taste and condition of poor servants that came to be ladies and servingmen of low degree who married kings daughters among other things i met this sage observation that a lion would never hurt a true virgin with this medley of nonsense in my fancy i went to bed and dreamed that a friend waked me in the morning and proposed for pastime to spend a few hours in seeing the parish lions which he had not done since he came to town and because they showed but once a week he would not miss the opportunity i said i would humour him though to speak the truth i was not fond of those cruel spectacles and if it were not so ancient a custom founded as i had heard upon the wisest maxims i should be apt to censure the inhumanity of those who introduced it all this will be a riddle to the waking reader till i discover the scene my imagination had formed upon the maxim that a lion would never hurt a true virgin i dreamed that by a law of immemorial time a helion was kept in every parish at the common charge and in a place provided adjoining to the churchyard that before any one of the fair sex was married if she affirmed herself to be a virgin she must on her wedding day and in her wedding clothes perform the ceremony of going alone into the den and stay an hour with the lion let loose and kept fasting fourandtwenty hours on purpose at a proper height above the den were convenient galleries for the relations and friends of the young couple and open to all spectators no maiden was forced to offer herself to the lion but if she refused it was a disgrace to marry her and every one might have liberty of calling her a whore and methought it was as usual a diversion to see the parish lions as with us to go to a play or an opera and it was reckoned convenient to be near the church either for marrying the virgin if she escaped the trial or for burying the bones when the lion had devoured the rest as he constantly did  to go on therefore with the dream we called first as i remember to see st dunstans lion but we were told they did not shew today from thence we went to that of coventgarden which to my great surprise we found as lean as a skeleton when i expected quite the contrary but the keeper said it was no wonder at all because the poor beast had not got an ounce of womans flesh since he came into the parish this amazed me more than the other and i was forming to myself a mighty veneration for the ladies in that quarter of the town when the keeper went on and said he wondered the parish would be at the charge of maintaining a lion for nothing friend said i do you call it nothing to justify the virtue of so many ladies or has your lion lost his distinguishing faculty can there be anything more for the honour of your parish than that all the ladies married in your church were pure virgins that is true said he and the doctor knows it to his sorrow for there has not been a couple married in our church since his worship has been amongst us the virgins hereabouts are too wise to venture the claws of the lion and because nobody will marry them have all entered into vows of virginity so that in proportion we have much the largest nunnery in the whole town this manner of ladies entering into a vow of virginity because they were not virgins i easily conceived and my dream told me that the whole kingdom was full of nunneries plentifully stocked from the same reason  we went to see another lion where we found much company met in the gallery the keeper told us we should see sport enough as he called it and in a little time we saw a young beautiful lady put into the den who walked up towards the lion with all imaginable security in her countenance and looked smiling upon her lover and friends in the gallery which i thought nothing extraordinary because it was never known that any lion had been mistaken but however we were all disappointed for the lion lifted up his right paw which was the fatal sign and advancing forward seized her by the arm and began to tear it the poor lady gave a terrible shriek and cried out the lion is just i am no true virgin oh sappho sappho she could say no more for the lion gave her the coup de grace by a squeeze in the throat and she expired at his feet the keeper dragged away her body to feed the animal when the company was gone for the parishlions never used to eat in public after a little pause another lady came on towards the lion in the same manner as the former we observed the beast smell her with great diligence he scratched both her hands with lifting them to his nose and clapping a claw on her bosom drew blood however he let her go and at the same time turned from her with a sort of contempt at which she was not a little mortified and retired with some confusion to her friends in the gallery methought the whole company immediately understood the meaning of this that the easiness of the lady had suffered her to admit certain imprudent and dangerous familiarities bordering too much upon what is criminal neither was it sure whether the lover then present had not some sharers with him in those freedoms of which a lady can never be too sparing  this happened to be an extraordinary day for a third lady came into the den laughing loud playing with her fan tossing her head and smiling round on the young fellows in the gallery however the lion leaped on her with great fury and we gave her for gone but on a sudden he let go his hold turned from her as if he were nauseated then gave her a lash with his tail after which she returned to the gallery not the least out of countenance and this it seems was the usual treatment of coquettes  i thought we had now seen enough but my friend would needs have us go and visit one or two lions in the city we called at two or three dens where they happened not to shew but we generally found half a score young girls between eight and eleven years old playing with each lion sitting on his back and putting their hands into his mouth some of them would now and then get a scratch but we always discovered upon examining that they had been hoydening with the young apprentices one of them was calling to a pretty girl of about twelve years that stood by us in the gallery to come down to the lion and upon her refusal said ah miss betty we could never get you to come near the lion since you played at hoop and hide with my brother in the garret  we followed a couple with the weddingfolks going to the church of st maryaxe the lady though well stricken in years extremely crooked and deformed was dressed out beyond the gaiety of fifteen having jumbled together as i imagined all the tawdry remains of aunts godmothers and grandmothers for some generations past one of the neighbours whispered me that she was an old maid and had the clearest reputation of any in the parish there is nothing strange in that thought i but was much surprised when i observed afterwards that she went towards the lion with distrust and concern the beast was lying down but upon sight of her snuffed up his nose two or three times and then giving the sign of death proceeded instantly to execution in the midst of her agonies she was heard to name the words italy and artifices with the utmost horror and several repeated execrations and at last concluded fool that i was to put so much confidence in the toughness of my skin  the keeper immediately set all in order again for another customer which happened to be a famous prude whom her parents after long threatenings and much persuasion had with the extremest difficulty prevailed on to accept a young handsome goldsmith that might have pretended to five times her fortune the fathers and mothers in the neighbourhood used to quote her for an example to their daughters her elbows were rivetted to her sides and her whole person so ordered as to inform everybody that she was afraid they should touch her she only dreaded to approach the lion because it was a he one and abhorred to think an animal of that sex should presume to breathe on her the sight of a man at twenty yards distance made her draw back her head she always sat upon the farther corner of the chair though there were six chairs between her and her lover and with the door wide open and her little sister in the room she was never saluted but at the tip of her ear and her father had much ado to make her dine without her gloves when there was a man at table she entered the den with some fear which we took to proceed from the height of her modesty offended at the sight of so many men in the gallery the lion beholding her at a distance immediately gave the deadly sign at which the poor creature methinks i see her still miscarried in a fright before us all the lion seemed to be surprised as much as we and gave her time to make her confession that she was four months gone by the foreman of her fathers shop that this was her third big belly and when her friends asked why she would venture the trial she said her nurse assured her that a lion would never hurt a woman with child upon this i immediately waked and could not help wishing that the deputycensors of my late institution were endued with the same instinct as these parishlions were  footnote 1     manditque trahitque molle pecus                        aeneid ix 340341

with us distinguished by the name of good manners4 or breeding this i look upon in the general notion of it to be a sort of artificial good sense adapted to the meanest capacities and introduced to make mankind easy in their commerce with each other low and little understandings without some rules of this kind would be perpetually wandering into a thousand indecencies and irregularities in behaviour and in their ordinary conversation fall into the same boisterous familiarities that one observes amongst them when a debauch has quite taken away the use of their reason in other instances it is odd to consider that for want of common discretion the very end of good breeding is wholly perverted and civility intended to make us easy is employed in laying chains and fetters upon us in debarring us of our wishes and in crossing our most reasonable desires and inclinations this abuse reigns chiefly in the country as i found to my vexation when i was last there in a visit i made to a neighbour about two miles from my cousin as soon as i entered the parlour they forced me into the great chair that stood close by a huge fire and kept me there by force till i was almost stifled then a boy came in great hurry to pull off my boots which i in vain opposed urging that i must return soon after dinner in the mean time the good lady whispered her eldest daughter and slipped a key into her hand she returned instantly with a beer glass half full of aqua mirabilis and syrup of gillyflowers i took as much as i had a mind for but madam vowed i should drink it off for she was sure it would do me good after coming out of the cold air and i was forced to obey which absolutely took away my stomach when dinner came in i had a mind to sit at a distance from the fire but they told me it was as much as my life was worth and set me with my back just against it though my appetite was quite gone i resolved to force down as much as i could and desired the leg of a pullet indeed mr bickerstaff says the lady you must eat a wing to oblige me and so put a couple upon my plate i was persecuted at this rate during the whole meal as often as i called for small beer the master tipped the wink and the servant brought me a brimmer of october some time after dinner i ordered my cousins man who came with me to get ready the horses but it was resolved i should not stir that night and when i seemed pretty much bent upon going they ordered the stable door to be locked and the children hid away my cloak and boots the next question was what i would have for supper i said i never eat anything at night but was at last in my own defence obliged to name the first thing that came into my head after three hours spent chiefly in apology for my entertainment insinuating to me that this was the worst time of the year for provisions that they were at a great distance from any market that they were afraid i should be starved and they knew they kept me to my loss the lady went and left me to her husband for they took special care i should never be alone as soon as her back was turned the little misses ran backwards and forwards every moment and constantly as they came in or went out made a curtsy directly at me which in good manners i was forced to return with a bow and your humble servant pretty miss exactly at eight the mother came up and discovered by the redness of her face that supper was not far off it was twice as large as the dinner and my persecution doubled in proportion i desired at my usual hour to go to my repose and was conducted to my chamber by the gentleman his lady and the whole train of children they importuned me to drink something before i went to bed and upon my refusing at last left a bottle of stingo as they called it for fear i should wake and be thirsty in the night i was forced in the morning to rise and dress myself in the dark because they would not suffer my kinsmans servant to disturb me at the hour i had desired to be called i was now resolved to break through all measures to get away and after sitting down to a monstrous breakfast of cold beef mutton neatstongues venisonpasty and stale beer took leave of the family but the gentleman would needs see me part of my way and carry me a short cut through his own grounds which he told me would save half a miles riding this last piece of civility had like to have cost me dear being once or twice in danger of my neck by leaping over his ditches and at last forced to alight in the dirt when my horse having slipped his bridle ran away and took us up more than an hour to recover him again  it is evident that none of the absurdities i met with in this visit proceeded from an ill intention but from a wrong judgment of complaisance and a misapplication of the rules of it

nature as he has found it described in the writings of the greatest men not as he is like to meet with it in the common course of life hence it is that he gives no offence that he converses with great

others their own behaviour and the usage they meet with being generally very much of a piece i have at this time in my hands an alphabetical list of the beaux esprits about this town four or five of whom have made the proper use of their genius by gaining the esteem of the best and greatest men and by turning it to their own advantage in some establishment of their fortunes however unequal to their merit others satisfying themselves with the honour of having access to great tables and of being subject to the call of every man of quality who upon occasion wants one to say witty things for the diversion of the company this treatment never moves my indignation so much as when it is practised by a person who though he owes his own rise purely to the reputation of his parts yet appears to be as much ashamed of it as a rich city knight to be denominated from the trade he was first apprenticed to and affects the air of a man born to his titles and consequently above the character of a wit or a scholar if those who possess great endowments of the mind would set a just value upon themselves they would think no mans acquaintance whatsoever a condescension nor accept it from the greatest upon unworthy or ignominious terms i know a certain lord that has often invited a set of people and proposed for their diversion a buffoon player and an eminent poet to be of the party and which was yet worse thought them both sufficiently recompensed by the dinner and the honour of his company this kind of insolence is risen to such a height that i my self was the other day sent to by a man with a title whom i had never seen desiring the favour that i would dine with him and half a dozen of his select friends i found afterwards the footman had told my maid below stairs that my lord having a mind to be merry had resolved right or wrong to send for honest isaac i was sufficiently provoked with the message however i gave the fellow no other answer than that i believed he had mistaken the person for i did not remember that his lord had ever been introduced to me i have reason to apprehend that this abuse hath been owing rather to a meanness of spirit in men of parts than to the natural pride or ignorance of their patrons young students coming up to town from the places of their education are dazzled with the grandeur they everywhere meet and making too much haste to distinguish their parts instead of waiting to be desired and caressed are ready to pay their court at any rate to a great man whose name they have seen in a public paper or the frontispiece of a dedication it has not always been thus wit in polite ages has ever begot either esteem or fear the hopes of being celebrated or the dread of being stigmatized procured an universal respect and awe for the persons of such as were allowed to have the power of distributing fame or infamy where they pleased aretine had all the princes of europe his tributaries and when any of them had committed a folly that laid them open to his censure they were forced by some present extraordinary to compound for his silence of which there is a famous instance on record when charles the fifth had miscarried in his african expedition which was looked upon as the weakest undertaking of that great emperor he sent aretine4 a gold chain who made some difficulty of accepting it saying it was too small a present in all reason for so great a folly for my own part in this point i differ from him and never could be prevailed upon by any valuable consideration to conceal a fault or a folly since i first took the censorship upon me  having long considered with my self the ill application that some make of their talents i have this day erected a court of alienation by the statutes of which the next a kin is empowered to beg the parts and understanding of any such person as can be proved either by embezzling making a wrong use or no use at all of the said parts and understanding not to know the true value thereof who shall immediately be put out of possession and disqualified for ever the said kinsman giving sufficient security that he will employ them as the court shall direct i have set down under certain heads the several ways by which men prostitute and abuse their parts and from thence have framed a table of rules whereby the plaintiff may be informed when he has a good title to eject the defendant i may in a following paper give the world some account of the proceedings of this court i have already got two able critics for my assessors upon the bench who though they have always exercised their pens in taking off from the wit of others have never pretended to challenge any themselves and consequently are in no danger of being engaged in making claims or of having any suits commence against them every writer shall be tried by his peers throughly versed in that point wherein he pretends to excel for which reason the jury can never consist of above half the ordinary number i shall in general be very tender how i put any person out of his wits but as the management of such possessions is of great consequence to the world i shall hold my self obliged to vest the right in

this kind from an unknown fair to frame immediately some idea of her person which being suited to the opinion we have of our own merit is commonly as beautiful and perfect as the most lavish imagination can furnish out strongly possessed with these notions i have read over sylvias billet and notwithstanding the reserve i have had upon this matter am resolved to go a much greater length than i yet ever did in making my self known to the world and in particular to my charming correspondent in order to it i must premise that the person produced as mine in the playhouse last winter did in nowise appertain to me it was such a one however as agreed well with the impression my writings had made and served the purpose i intended it for which was to continue the awe and reverence due to the character i was vested with and at the same time to let my enemies see how much i was the delight and favourite of this town this innocent imposture which i have all along taken care to carry on as it then was of some use has since been of singular service to me and by being mentioned in one of my papers effectually recovered my egoity out of the hands of some gentlemen who endeavoured to wrest it from me this is saying in short what i am not what i am and have been for many years is next to be explained here it will not be improper to remind sylvia that there was formerly such a philosopher as pythagoras who amongst other doctrines taught the transmigration of souls which if she sincerely believes she will not be much startled at the following relation  i will not trouble her nor my other readers with the particulars of all the lives i have successively passed through since my first entrance into mortal being which is now many centuries ago it is enough that i have in every one of them opposed myself with the utmost resolution to the follies and vices of the several ages i have been acquainted with that i have often rallied the world into good manners and kept the greatest princes in awe of my satire there is one circumstance which i shall not omit though it may seem to reflect on my character i mean that infinite love of change which has ever appeared in the disposal of my existence since the days of the emperor trajan i have not been confined to the same person for twenty years together but have passed from one abode to another much quicker than the pythagorean system generally allows by this means i have seldom had a body to myself but have lodged up and down wherever i found a genius suitable to my own in this manner i continued some time with the top wit of france at another with that of italy who had a statue erected to his memory in rome towards the end of the 17th century i set out for england but the gentleman i came over in dying as soon as he got to shore i was obliged to look out again for a new habitation it was not long before i met with one to my mind for having mixed myself invisibly with the literati of this kingdom i found it was unanimously agreed amongst them that nobody was endowed with greater talents than hiereus4 or consequently would be better pleased with my company i slipped down his throat one night as he was fast asleep and the next morning as soon as he awaked he fell to writing a treatise that was received with great applause though he had the modesty not to set his name to that nor to any other of our productions some time after he published a paper of predictions which were translated into several languages and alarmed some of the greatest princes in europe to these he prefixed the name of isaac bickerstaff esq which i have been extremely fond of ever since and have taken care that most of the writings i have been concerned in should be distinguished by it though i must observe that there have been many counterfeits imposed upon the public by this means this extraordinary man being called out of the kingdom by affairs of his own i resolved however to continue somewhat longer in a country where my works had been so well received and accordingly bestowed myself with hilario5 his natural wit his lively turn of humour and great penetration into human nature easily determined me to this choice the effects of which were soon after produced in this paper called the tatler i know not how it happened but in less than two years time hilario grew weary of my company and gave me warning to be gone in the height of my resentment i cast my eyes on a young fellow6 of no extraordinary qualifications whom for that very reason i had the more pride in taking under my direction and enabling him by some means or other to carry on the work i was before engaged in lest he should grow too vain upon this encouragement i to this day keep him under due mortification i seldom reside with him when any of his friends are at leisure to receive me by whose hands however he is duly supplied as i have passed through many scenes of life and a long series of years i choose to be considered in the character of an old fellow and take care that those under my influence should speak consonantly to it this account i presume will give no small consolation to sylvia who may rest assured that isaac bickerstaff is to be seen in more forms than she dreamt of out of which variety she may choose what is most agreeable to her fancy on tuesdays he is sometimes a black proper young gentleman with a mole on his left cheek on thursdays a decent welllooking man of a middle stature long flaxen hair and a florid complexion on saturdays he is somewhat of the shortest and may be known

the fall of the able administration of godolphin in 1710 was the famous oxford ministry headed by harley and st john the new leaders were well aware that they would have to use all the means in their power not only to justify themselves to the english nation but successfully to defeat the strong opposition which had such a man as marlborough for its moving spirit the address to queen anne from the commons showing undoubted evidences of st johns hand was the first employment of a means by which this ministry hoped to appeal to the public but this remarkable literary effort had already been preceded by the establishment of a weekly political paper entitled the examiner a few weeks before godolphins fall during the months of august september and october in which were issued twelve papers dr freind atterbury prior and st john were the men employed to arouse the nation to a necessary condition of discontent now that the ministry was in power the necessity for continuing these public appeals was felt to be all the stronger and harleys shrewdness in selecting swift to take this important matter in hand shows his ability as a party leader  the first number of the examiner was issued on august 3rd 1710 and the paper was continued until july 26th 1711 on december 6th 1711 william oldisworth revived it and issued it weekly until december 18th 1712 after which date it was published twice a week until july 26th 1714 though it occasionally happened that only one was issued in a week the last number was no 19 of the sixth volume so that oldisworth edited vols ii iii iv v and what was published of vol vi the death of the queen put an end to the publication  swift was called to his work about the middle of october of 1710 and his first paper appeared in no 14 from that number to no 45 swift continued with unabated zeal and with masterly effect to carry out the policy of his friends he also wrote a part of no 46 and nos 16 and 21 of the third volume which appeared on january 16th and february 2nd 171213 these two last numbers are not included in the present volume since they have been printed in the fifth volume of this edition of swifts works with the titles an appendix to the conduct of the allies and the vindication of erasmus lewis  the appearance of the examiner had brought an opposition paper into the field entitled the whig examiner a periodical that ably maintained its partys stand in the face of st johns attacks but this paper only lasted for five weeks and when swift took charge of the tory organ the position of the examiner was entirely altered as mr churton collins ably remarks it became a voice of power in every town and in every hamlet throughout england it was an appeal made not to the political cliques of the metropolis but to the whole kingdom and to the whole kingdom it spoke no one who will take the trouble to glance at swifts contributions to the examiner will be surprised at their effect they are masterpieces of polemical skill every sentenceevery wordcomes home their logic adapted to the meanest capacity smites like a hammer their statements often a tissue of mere sophistry and assumption appear so plausible that it is difficult even for the cool historian to avoid being carried away by them at a time when party spirit was running high and few men stopped to weigh evidence they must have been irresistible jonathan swift 1893 p 81  in his memoirs relating to that change vol v p 384 swift gives the following explanation of the foundation of this paper upon the rise of this ministry the principal persons in power thought it necessary that some weekly paper should be published with just reflections upon former proceedings and defending the present measures of her majesty this was begun about the time of the lord godolphins removal under the name of the examiner  the determination was that i should continue it which i did accordingly for about eight months  gay remarks in his pamphlet the present state of wit in a letter to a friend in the country 1711 the examiner is a paper which all men who speak without prejudice allow to be well writ though his subject will admit of no great variety he is continually placing it on so many different lights and endeavouring to inculcate the same thing by so many beautiful changes of expressions that men who are concerned in no party may read him with pleasure his way of assuming the question in debate is extremely artful and his letter to crassus no 28 is i think a masterpiece i presume i need not tell you that the examiner carries much the more sail as tis supposed to be writ by the direction and under the eye of some great persons who sit at the helm of affairs and is consequently looked on as a sort of public notice which way they are

generally followed to converse in equal freedom with the deserving men of both parties and it was never without some contempt that i have observed persons wholly out of employment affect to do otherwise i doubted whether any man could owe so much to the side he was of though he were retained by it but without some great point of interest either in possession or prospect i thought it was the mark of a low and narrow spirit  it is hard that for some weeks past i have been forced in my own defence to follow a proceeding that i have so much condemned in others but several of my acquaintance among the declining party are grown so insufferably peevish and splenetic profess such violent apprehensions for the public and represent the state of things in such formidable ideas that i find myself disposed to share in their afflictions though i know them to be groundless and imaginary or which is worse purely affected to offer them comfort one by one would be not only an endless but a disobliging task some of them i am convinced would be less melancholy if there were more occasion i shall therefore instead of hearkening to further complaints employ some part of this paper for the future in letting such men see that their natural or acquired fears are illgrounded and their artificial ones as illintended that all our present inconveniencies3 are the consequence of the very counsels they so much admire which would still have increased if those had continued and that neither our constitution in church or state could probably have been long preserved without such methods as have been lately taken  the late revolutions at court have given room to some specious objections which i have heard repeated by wellmeaning men just as they had taken them up on the credit of others who have worse designs they wonder the queen would choose to change her ministry at this juncture4 and thereby give uneasiness to a general who has been so long successful abroad and might think himself injured if the entire ministry were not of his own nomination that there were few complaints of any consequence against the late men in power and none at all in parliament which on the contrary passed votes in favour of the chief minister that if her majesty had a mind to introduce the other party it would have been more seasonable after a peace which now we have made desperate by spiriting the french who rejoice at these changes and by the fall of our credit which unqualifies us for continuing the war that the parliament so untimely dissolved5 had been diligent in their supplies and dutiful in their behaviour that one consequence of these changes appears already in the fall of the stocks that we may soon expect more and worse and lastly that all this naturally tends to break the settlement of the crown and call over the pretender  these and the like notions are plentifully scattered abroad by the malice of a ruined party to render the queen and her administration odious and to inflame the nation and these are what upon occasion i shall endeavour to overthrow by discovering the falsehood and absurdity of them  it is a great unhappiness when in a government constituted like ours it should be so brought about that the continuance of a war must be for the interest of vast numbers peaceable as well as military who would otherwise have been as unknown as their original i think our present condition of affairs is admirably described by two verses in lucan    hinc usura vorax avidumque in tempore foenus   hinc concussa fides et multis utile bellum6  which without any great force upon the words may be thus translated  hence are derived those exorbitant interests and annuities hence those large discounts for advances and prompt payment hence public credit is shaken and hence great numbers find their profit in prolonging the war  it is odd that among a free trading people as we take ourselves to be there should so many be found to close in with those counsels who have been ever averse from all overtures towards a peace but yet there is no great mystery in the matter let any man observe the equipages in this town he shall find the greater number of those who make a figure to be a species of men quite different from any that were ever known before the revolution consisting either of generals and colonels or of such whose whole fortunes lie in funds and stocks so that power which according to the old maxim was used to follow land is now gone over to money and the country gentleman is in the condition of a young heir out of whose estate a scrivener receives half the rents for interest and hath a mortgage on the whole and is therefore always ready to feed his vices and extravagancies while there is any thing left so that if the war continues some years longer a landed man will be little better than a farmer at a rack rent to the army and to the public funds  it may perhaps be worth inquiring from what beginnings and by what steps we have been brought into this desperate condition and in search of this we must run up as high as the revolution  most of the nobility and gentry who invited over the prince of orange or attended him in his expedition were true lovers of their country and its constitution in church and state and were brought to yield to those breaches in the succession of the crown out of a regard to the necessity of the kingdom and the safety of the people which did and could only make them lawful but without intention of drawing such a practice into precedent or making it a standing measure by which to proceed in all times to come and therefore we find their counsels ever tended to keep things as much as possible in the old course but soon after an under set of men who had nothing to lose and had neither borne the burthen nor heat of the day found means to whisper in the kings ear that the principles of loyalty in the church of england were wholly inconsistent with the revolution7 hence began the early practice of caressing the dissenters reviling the universities as maintainers of arbitrary power and reproaching the clergy with the doctrines of divineright passive obedience and nonresistance8 at the same time in order to fasten wealthy people to the new government they proposed those pernicious expedients of borrowing money by vast premiums and at exorbitant interest a practice as old as eumenes9 one of alexanders captains who setting up for himself after the death of his master persuaded his principal officers to lend him great sums after which they were forced to follow him for their own security  this introduced a number of new dexterous men into business and credit it was argued that the war could not last above two or three campaigns and that it was easier for the subject to raise a fund for paying interest than to tax them annually to the full expense of the war several persons who had small or encumbered estates sold them and turned their money into those funds to great advantage merchants as well as other moneyed men finding trade was dangerous pursued the same method but the war continuing and growing more expensive taxes were increased and funds multiplied every year till they have arrived at the monstrous height we now behold them and that which was at first a corruption is at last grown necessary and what every good subject must now fall in with though he may be allowed to wish it might soon have an end because it is with a kingdom as with a private fortune where every new incumbrance adds a double weight by this means the wealth of the nation that used to be reckoned by the value of land is now computed by the rise and fall of stocks and although the foundation of credit be still the same and upon a bottom that can never be shaken and though all interest be duly paid by the public yet through the contrivance and cunning of stockjobbers there has been brought in such a complication of knavery and cozenage such a mystery of iniquity and such an unintelligible jargon of terms to involve it in as were never known in any other age or country of the world i have heard it affirmed by persons skilled in these calculations that if the funds appropriated to the payment of interest and annuities were added to the yearly taxes and the fourshilling aid10 strictly exacted in all counties of the kingdom it would very near if not fully supply the occasions of the war at least such a part as in the opinion of very able persons had been at that time prudence not to exceed for i make it a question whether any wise prince or state in the continuance of a war which was not purely defensive or immediately at his own door did ever propose that his expense should perpetually exceed what he was able to impose annually upon his subjects neither if the war lasts many years longer do i see how the next generation will be able to begin another which in the course of human affairs and according to the various interests and ambition of princes may be as necessary for them as it has been for us and had our fathers left us as deeply involved as we are like to leave our children i appeal to any man what sort of figure we should have been able to make these twenty years past besides neither our enemies nor allies are upon the same foot with us in this particular france and holland our nearest neighbours and the farthest engaged will much sooner recover themselves after a war the first by the absolute power of the prince who being master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects will quickly find expedients to pay his debts and so will the other by their prudent administration the greatness of their trade their wonderful parsimony the willingness of their people to undergo all kind of taxes and their justice in applotting as well as collecting them but above all we are to consider that france and holland fight in the continent either upon or near their own territories and the greatest part of the money circulates among themselves whereas ours crosses the sea either to flanders spain or portugal and every penny of it whether in specie or returns is so much lost to the nation for ever  upon these considerations alone it was the most prudent course imaginable in the queen to lay hold of the disposition of the people for changing the parliament and ministry at this juncture and extricating herself as soon as possible out of the pupillage of those who found their accounts only in perpetuating the war neither have we the least reason to doubt but the ensuing parliament will assist her majesty with the utmost vigour11 till her enemies again be brought to sue for peace and again offer such terms as will make it both honourable and lasting only with this difference that the ministry

autore susurri2   i am prevailed on through the importunity of friends to interrupt the scheme i had begun in my last paper by an essay upon the art of political lying we are told the devil is the father of lies and was a liar from the beginning so that beyond contradiction the invention is old and which is more his first essay of it was purely political employed in undermining the authority of his prince and seducing a third part of the subjects from their obedience for which he was driven down from heaven where as milton expresseth it he had been viceroy of a great western province3 and forced to exercise his talent in inferior regions among other fallen spirits or poor deluded men whom he still daily tempts to his own sin and will ever do so till he is chained in the bottomless pit  but though the devil be the father of lies he seems like other great inventors to have lost much of his reputation by the continual improvements that have been made upon him  who first reduced lying into an art and adapted it to politics is not so clear from history though i have made some diligent enquiries i shall therefore consider it only according to the modern system as it has been cultivated these twenty years past in the southern part of our own island  the poets tell us that after the giants were overthrown by the gods the earth in revenge produced her last offspring which was fame4 and the fable is thus interpreted that when tumults and seditions are quieted rumours and false reports are plentifully spread through a nation so that by this account lying is the last relief of a routed earthborn rebellious party in a state but here the moderns have made great additions applying this art to the gaining of power and preserving it as well as revenging themselves after they have lost it as the same instruments are made use of by animals to feed themselves when they are hungry and bite those that tread upon them  but the same genealogy cannot always be admitted for political lying i shall therefore desire to refine upon it by adding some circumstances of its birth and parents a political lie is sometimes born out of a discarded statesmans head and thence delivered to be nursed and dandled by the mob sometimes it is produced a monster and licked into shape at other times it comes into the world completely formed and is spoiled in the licking it is often born an infant in the regular way and requires time to mature it and often it sees the light in its full growth but dwindles away by degrees sometimes it is of noble birth and sometimes the spawn of a stockjobber here it screams aloud at the opening of the womb and there it is delivered with a whisper i know a lie that now disturbs half the kingdom with its noise which though too proud and great at present to own its parents i can remember in its whisperhood to conclude the nativity of this monster when it comes into the world without a sting it is stillborn and whenever it loses its sting it dies  no wonder if an infant so miraculous in its birth should be destined for great adventures and accordingly we see it has been the guardian spirit of a prevailing party for almost twenty years it can conquer kingdoms without fighting and sometimes with the loss of a battle it gives and resumes employments can sink a mountain to a molehill and raise a molehill to a mountain has presided for many years at committees of elections can wash a blackamoor white make a saint of an atheist and a patriot of a profligate can furnish foreign ministers with intelligence and raise or let fall the credit of the nation this goddess flies with a huge lookingglass in her hands to dazzle the crowd and make them see according as she turns it their ruin in their interest and their interest in their ruin in this glass you will behold your best friends clad in coats powdered with flowerdeluces5 and triple crowns their girdles hung round with chains and beads and wooden shoes and your worst enemies adorned with the ensigns of liberty property indulgence and moderation and a cornucopia in their hands her large wings like those of a flyingfish are of no use but while they are moist she therefore dips them in mud and soaring aloft scatters it in the eyes of the multitude flying with great swiftness but at every turn is forced to stoop in dirty way for new supplies  i have been sometimes thinking if a man had the art of the second sight for seeing lies as they have in scotland for seeing spirits how admirably he might entertain himself in this town to observe the different shapes sizes and colours of those swarms of lies which buzz about the heads of some people like flies about a horses ears in summer or those legions hovering every afternoon in popeshead alley6 enough to darken the air or over a club of discontented grandees and thence sent down in cargoes to be scattered at elections  there is one essential point wherein a political liar differs from others of the faculty that he ought to have but a short memory which is necessary according to the various occasions he meets with every hour of differing from himself and swearing to both sides of a contradiction as he finds the persons disposed with whom he has to deal in describing the virtues and vices of mankind it is convenient upon every article to have some eminent person in our eye from whence we copy our description i have strictly observed this rule and my imagination this minute represents before me a certain great man7 famous for this talent to the constant practice of which he owes his twenty years reputation of the most skilful head in england for the management of nice affairs the superiority of his genius consists in nothing else but an inexhaustible fund of political lies which he plentifully distributes every minute he speaks and by an unparalleled generosity forgets and consequently contradicts the next halfhour he never yet considered whether any proposition were true or false but whether it were convenient for the present minute or company to affirm or deny it so that if you think to refine upon him by interpreting every thing he says as we do dreams by the contrary you are still to seek and will find yourself equally deceived whether you believe him or no the only remedy is to suppose that you have heard some inarticulate sounds without any meaning at all and besides that will take off the horror you might be apt to conceive at the oaths wherewith he perpetually tags both ends of every proposition though at the same time i think he cannot with any justice be taxed for perjury when he invokes god and christ because he has often fairly given public notice to the world that he believes in neither  some people may think that such an accomplishment as this can be of no great use to the owner or his party after it has been often practised and is become notorious but they are widely mistaken few lies carry the inventors mark and the most prostitute enemy to truth may spread a thousand without being known for the author besides as the vilest writer has his readers so the greatest liar has his believers and it often happens that if a lie be believed only for an hour it has done its work and there is no farther occasion for it falsehood flies and truth comes limping after it so that when men come to be undeceived it is too late the jest is over and the tale has had its effect like a man who has thought of a good repartee when the discourse is changed or the company parted or like a physician who has found out an infallible medicine after the patient is dead  considering that natural disposition in many men to lie and in multitudes to believe i have been perplexed what to do with that maxim so frequent in every bodys mouth that truth will at last prevail here has this island of ours for the greatest part of twenty years lain under the influence of such counsels and persons whose principle and interest it was to corrupt our manners blind our understandings drain our wealth and in time destroy our constitution both in church and state and we at last were brought to the very brink of ruin yet by the means of perpetual misrepresentations have never been able to distinguish between our enemies and friends we have seen a great part of the nations money got into the hands of those who by their birth education and merit could pretend no higher than to wear our liveries while others8 who by their credit quality and fortune were only able to give reputation and success to the revolution were not only laid aside as dangerous and useless but loaden with the scandal of jacobites men of arbitrary principles and pensioners to france while truth who is said to lie in a well seemed now to be buried there under a heap of stones but i remember it was a usual complaint among the whigs that the bulk of landed men was not in their interests which some of the wisest looked on as an ill omen and we saw it was with the utmost difficulty that they could preserve a majority while the court and ministry were on their side till they had learned those admirable expedients for deciding elections and influencing distant boroughs by powerful motives from the city but all this was mere force and constraint however upheld by most dexterous artifice and management till the people began to apprehend their properties their religion and the monarchy itself in danger then we saw them greedily laying hold on the first occasion to interpose but of this mighty change in the dispositions of the people i shall discourse more at large in some following paper wherein i shall endeavour to undeceive those deluded or deluding persons who hope or pretend it is only a short madness in the vulgar from which they may soon recover whereas i believe it will appear to be very different in its causes its symptoms and its consequences and prove a great example to illustrate the maxim i lately mentioned that truth however sometimes

things more wanted in england than such a paper as this ought to be and such as i will endeavour to make it as long as it shall be found of any use without entering into the violences of either party considering the many grievous misrepresentations of persons and things it is highly requisite at this juncture that the people throughout the kingdom should if possible be set right in their opinions by some impartial hand which has never been yet attempted those who have hitherto undertaken it being upon every account the least qualified of all humankind for such a work  we live here under a limited monarchy and under the doctrine and discipline of an excellent church we are unhappily divided into two parties both which pretend a mighty zeal for our religion and government only they disagree about the means3 the evils we must fence against are on one side fanaticism and infidelity in religion and anarchy under the name of a commonwealth in government on the other side popery slavery and the pretender from france now to inform and direct us in our sentiments upon these weighty points here are on one side two stupid illiterate scribblers both of them fanatics by profession i mean the review4 and observator5 on the other side we have an open nonjuror6 whose character and person as well as good learning and sense discovered upon other subjects do indeed deserve respect and esteem but his rehearsal and the rest of his political papers are yet more pernicious than those of the former two if the generality of the people know not how to talk or think till they have read their lesson in the papers of the week what a misfortune is it that their duty should be conveyed to them through such vehicles as those for let some gentlemen think what they please i cannot but suspect that the two worthies i first mentioned have in a degree done mischief among us the mock authoritative manner of the one and the insipid mirth of the other however insupportable to reasonable ears being of a level with great numbers among the lowest part of mankind neither was the author of the rehearsal while he continued that paper less infectious to many persons of better figure who perhaps were as well qualified and much less prejudiced to judge for themselves  it was this reason that moved me to take the matter out of those rough as well as those dirty hands to let the remote and uninstructed part of the nation see that they have been misled on both sides by mad ridiculous extremes at a wide distance on each side from the truth while the right path is so broad and plain as to be easily kept if they were once put into it  further i had lately entered on a resolution to take very little notice of other papers unless it were such where the malice and falsehood had so great a mixture of wit and spirit as would make them dangerous which in the present circle of scribbles from twelvepence to a halfpenny i could easily foresee would not very frequently occur but here again i am forced to dispense with my resolution though it be only to tell my reader what measures i am like to take on such occasions for the future i was told that the paper called the observator was twice filled last week with remarks upon a late examiner7 these i read with the first opportunity and to speak in the newswriters phrase they gave me occasion for many speculations i observed with singular pleasure the nature of those things which the owners of them usually call answers and with what dexterity this matchless author had fallen into the whole art and cant of them to transcribe here and there three or four detached lines of least weight in a discourse and by a foolish comment mistake every syllable of the meaning is what i have known many of a superior class to this formidable adversary entitle an answer8 this is what he has exactly done in about thrice as many words as my whole discourse which is so mighty an advantage over me that i shall by no means engage in so unequal a combat but as far as i can judge of my own temper entirely dismiss him for the future heartily wishing he had a match exactly of his own size to meddle with who should only have the odds of truth and honesty which as i take it would be an effectual way to silence him for ever upon this occasion i cannot forbear a short story of a fanatic farmer who lived in my neighbourhood and was so great a disputant in religion that the servants in all the families thereabouts reported how he had confuted the bishop and all his clergy i had then a footman who was fond of reading the bible and i borrowed a comment for him which he studied so close that in a month or two i thought him a match for the farmer they disputed at several houses with a ring of servants and other people always about them where ned explained his texts so full and clear to the capacity of his audience and showed the insignificancy of his adversarys cant to the meanest understanding that he got the whole country of his side and the farmer was cured of his itch of disputation for ever after  the worst of it is that this sort of outrageous partywriters i have above spoke of are like a couple of makebates who inflame small quarrels by a thousand stories and by keeping friends at a distance hinder them from coming to a good understanding as they certainly would if they were suffered to meet and debate between themselves for let any one examine a reasonable honest man of either side upon those opinions in religion and government which both parties daily buffet each other about he shall hardly find one material point in difference between them i would be glad to ask a question about two great men9 of the late ministry how they came to be whigs and by what figure of speech half a dozen others lately put into great employments can be called tories i doubt whoever would suit the definition to the persons must make it directly contrary to what we understood it at the time of the revolution  in order to remove these misapprehensions among us i believe it will be necessary upon occasion to detect the malice and falsehood of some popular maxims which those idiots scatter from the press twice a week and draw an hundred absurd consequences from them  for example i have heard it often objected as a great piece of insolence in the clergy and others to say or hint that the church was in danger when it was voted otherwise in parliament some years ago and the queen herself in her last speech did openly condemn all such insinuations10 notwithstanding which i did then and do still believe the church has since that vote been in very imminent danger and i think i might then have said so without the least offence to her majesty or either of the two houses the queens words as near as i can remember mentioned the church being in danger from her administration and whoever says or thinks that deserves in my opinion to be hanged for a traitor but that the church and state may be both in danger under the best princes that ever reigned and without the least guilt of theirs is such a truth as a man must be a great stranger to history or common sense to doubt the wisest prince on earth may be forced by the necessity of his affairs and the present power of an unruly faction or deceived by the craft of ill designing men one or two ministers most in his confidence may at first have good intentions but grow corrupted by time by avarice by love by ambition and have fairer terms offered them to gratify their passions or interests from one set of men than another till they are too far involved for a retreat and so be forced to take seven spirits more wicked than themselves this is a very possible case and will not the last state of such men be worse than the first that is to say will not the public which was safe at first grow in danger by such proceedings as these and shall a faithful subject who foresees and trembles at the consequences be called disaffected because he delivers his opinion though the prince declares as he justly may that the danger is not owing to his administration or shall the prince himself be blamed when in such a juncture he puts his affairs into other hands with the universal applause of his people as to the vote against those who should affirm the church was in danger i think it likewise referred to danger from or under the queens administration for i neither have it by me nor can suddenly have recourse to it but if it were otherwise i know not how it can refer to any dangers but what were past or at that time present or how it could affect the future unless the senators were all inspired or at least that majority which voted it neither do i see any crime further than ill manners to differ in opinion from a majority of either or both houses and that ill manners i must confess i have been often guilty of for some years past though i hope i never shall again  another topic of great use to these weekly inflamers is the young pretender11 in france to whom their whole party is in a high measure indebted for all their greatness and whenever it lies in their power they may perhaps return their acknowledgments as out of their zeal for frequent revolutions they were ready to do to his supposed father which is a piece of secret history that i hope will one day see the light and i am sure it shall if ever i am master of it without regarding whose ears may tingle12 but at present the word pretender is a term of art in their possession a secretary of state cannot desire leave to resign but the pretender is at bottom the queen cannot dissolve a parliament but it is a plot to dethrone herself and bring in the pretender half a score stockjobbers are playing the knave in exchangealley and there goes the pretender with a sponge one would be apt to think they bawl out the pretender so often to take off the terror or tell so many lies about him to slacken our caution that when he is really coming by their connivance we may not believe them as the boy served the shepherds about the coming of the wolf or perhaps they scare us with the pretender because they think he may be like some diseases that come with a fright do they not believe that the queens present ministry love her majesty at least as well as some others loved the church and why is it not as great mark of disaffection now to say the queen is in danger as it was some months ago to affirm the same of the church suppose it be a false opinion that the queens right is hereditary and indefeasible yet how is it possible that those who hold and believe that doctrine can be in the pretenders interest his title is weakened by every argument that strengthens hers it is as plain as the words of an act of parliament can make it that her present majesty is heir to the survivor of the late king and queen her sister is not that an hereditary right what need we explain it any further i have known an article of faith expounded in much looser and more general terms and that by an author whose opinions are very much followed by a certain party13 suppose we go further and examine the word indefeasible with which some writers of late have made themselves so merry i confess it is hard to conceive how any law which the supreme power makes may not by the same power be repealed so that i shall not determine whether the queens right be indefeasible or no but this i will maintain that whoever affirms it so is not guilty of a crime for in that settlement of the crown after the revolution where her present majesty is named in remainder14 there are as near as i can remember these remarkable words to which we bind ourselves and our posterity for ever lawyers may explain this or call them words of form as they please and reasoners may argue that such an obligation is against the very nature of government but a plain reader who takes the words in their natural meaning may be excused in thinking a right so confirmed is indefeasible and if there be an absurdity in such an opinion he is not to answer for it  ps when this paper was going to the press the printer brought me two more observators15 wholly taken up in my examiner upon lying which i was at the pains to read and they are just such an answer as the two others i have mentioned this is all i have to say on that matter   footnote 1 no 15 in the reprint ts

thursday november 16 to thursday november 23 1710  qui sunt boni cives qui belli qui domi de patriâ bene merentes nisi qui patriae beneficia meminerunt2   i will employ this present paper upon a subject which of late hath very much affected me which i have considered with a good deal of application and made several enquiries about among those persons who i thought were best able to inform me and if i deliver my sentiments with some freedom i hope it will be forgiven while i accompany it with that tenderness which so nice a point requires  i said in a former paper numb 14 that one specious objection to the late removals at court was the fear of giving uneasiness to a general who has been long successful abroad and accordingly the common clamour of tongues and pens for some months past has run against the baseness the inconstancy and ingratitude of the whole kingdom to the duke of marlborough in return of the most eminent services that ever were performed by a subject to his country not to be equalled in history and then to be sure some bitter stroke of detraction against alexander and caesar who never did us the least injury besides the people that read plutarch come upon us with parallels drawn from the greeks and romans who ungratefully dealt with i know not how many of their most deserving generals while the profounder politicians have seen pamphlets where tacitus and machiavel have been quoted to shew the danger of too resplendent a merit should a stranger hear these furious outcries of ingratitude against our general without knowing the particulars he would be apt to enquire where was his tomb or whether he were allowed christian burial not doubting but we had put him to some ignominious death or has he been tried for his life and very narrowly escaped has he been accused of high crimes and misdemeanours has the prince seized on his estate and left him to starve has he been hooted at as he passed the streets by an ungrateful mob have neither honours offices nor grants been conferred on him or his family have not he and they been barbarously stripped of them all have not he and his forces been ill paid abroad and does not the prince by a scanty limited commission hinder him from pursuing his own methods in the conduct of the war has he no power at all of disposing commissions as he pleases is he not severely used by the ministry or parliament who yearly call him to a strict account has the senate ever thanked him for good success and have they not always publicly censured him for the least miscarriage will the accusers of the nation join issue upon any of these particulars or tell us in what point our damnable sin of ingratitude lies why it is plain and clear for while he is commanding abroad the queen dissolves her parliament and changes her ministry at home in which universal calamity no less than two persons3 allied by marriage to the general have lost their places whence came this wonderful sympathy between the civil and military powers will the troops in flanders refuse to fight unless they can have their own lord keeper their own lord president of the council their own chief governor of ireland and their own parliament in a kingdom where the people are free how came they to be so fond of having their councils under the influence of their army or those that lead it who in all well instituted states had no commerce with the civil power further than to receive their orders and obey them without reserve  when a general is not so popular either in his army or at home as one might expect from a long course of success it may perhaps be ascribed to his wisdom or perhaps to his complexion the possession of some one quality or a defect in some other will extremely damp the peoples favour as well as the love of the soldiers besides this is not an age to produce favourites of the people while we live under a queen who engrosses all our love and all our veneration and where the only way for a great general or minister to acquire any degree of subordinate affection from the public must be by all marks of the most entire submission and respect to her sacred person and commands4 otherwise no pretence of great services either in the field or the cabinet will be able to screen them from universal hatred  but the late ministry was closely joined to the general by friendship interest alliance inclination and opinion which cannot be affirmed of the present and the ingratitude of the nation lies in the peoples joining as one man to wish that such a ministry should be changed is it not at the same time notorious to the whole kingdom that nothing but a tender regard to the general was able to preserve that ministry so long till neither god nor man could suffer their continuance yet in the highest ferment of things we heard few or no reflections upon this great commander but all seemed unanimous in wishing he might still be at the head of the confederate forces only at the same time in case he were resolved to resign they chose rather to turn their thoughts somewhere else than throw up all in despair and this i cannot but add in defence of the people with regard to the person we are speaking of that in the high station he has been for many years past his real defects as nothing human is without them have in a detracting age been very sparingly mentioned either in libels or conversation and all his successes very freely and universally applauded  there is an active and a passive ingratitude applying both to this occasion we may say the first is when a prince or people returns good services with cruelty or ill usage the other is when good services are not at all or very meanly rewarded we have already spoke of the former let us therefore in the second place examine how the services of our general have been rewarded and whether upon that article either prince or people have been guilty of ingratitude  those are the most valuable rewards which are given to us from the certain knowledge of the donor that they fit our temper best i shall therefore say nothing of the title of duke or the garter which the queen bestowed on the general in the beginning of her reign but i shall come to more substantial instances and mention nothing which has not been given in the face of the world5 the lands of woodstock may i believe be reckoned worth 40000l on the building of blenheim castle 200000l have been already expended though it be not yet near finished the grant of 5000l per ann on the postoffice is richly worth 100000l his principality in germany may be computed at 30000l pictures jewels and other gifts from foreign princes 60000l the grant at the pallmall the rangership c for want of more certain knowledge may be called 10000l his own and his duchesss employments at five years value reckoning only the known and avowed salaries are very low rated at 100000l here is a good deal above half a million of money and i dare say those who are loudest with the clamour of ingratitude will readily own that all this is but a trifle in comparison of what is untold6  the reason of my stating this account is only to convince the world that we are not quite so ungrateful either as the greeks or the romans and in order to adjust this matter with all fairness i shall confine myself to the latter who were much the more generous of the two a victorious general of rome in the height of that empire having entirely subdued his enemy was rewarded with the larger triumph and perhaps a statue in the forum a bull for a sacrifice an embroidered garment to appear in a crown of laurel a monumental trophy with inscriptions sometimes five hundred or a thousand copper coins were struck on occasion of the victory which doing honour to the general we will place to his account and lastly sometimes though not very frequently a triumphal arch these are all the rewards that i can call to mind which a victorious general received after his return from the most glorious expedition conquered some great kingdom brought the king himself his family and nobles to adorn the triumph in chains and made the kingdom either a roman province or at best a poor depending state in humble alliance to that empire now of all these rewards i find but two which were of real profit to the general the laurel crown made and sent him at the charge of the public and the embroidered garment but i cannot find whether this last were paid for by the senate or the general however we will take the more favourable opinion and in all the rest admit the whole expense as if it were ready money in the generals pocket now according to these computations on both sides we will draw up two fair accounts the one of roman gratitude and the other of british ingratitude and

probable computations and differ yet more upon the balance if we consider that all the gold and silver for safeguards and contributions also all valuable prizes taken in the war were openly exposed in the triumph and then lodged in the capitol for the public service  so that upon the whole we are not yet quite so bad at worst as the romans were at best and i doubt those who raise this hideous cry of ingratitude may be mightily mistaken in the consequence they propose from such complaints i remember a saying of seneca multos ingratos invenimus plures facimus we find many ungrateful persons in the world but we make more by setting too high a rate upon our pretensions and undervaluing the rewards we receive when unreasonable bills are brought in they ought to be taxed or cut off in the middle where there have been long accounts between two persons i have known one of them perpetually making large demands and pressing for payments who when the accounts were cast up on both sides was found to be creditor for some hundreds i am thinking if a proclamation were issued out for every man to send in his bill of merits and the lowest price he set them at what a pretty sum it would amount to and how many such islands as this must be sold to pay them i form my judgment from the practice of those who sometimes happen to pay themselves and i dare affirm would not be so unjust to take a farthing more than they think is due to their deserts i will instance only in one article a lady of my acquaintance8 appropriated twentysix pounds a year out of her allowance for certain uses which her woman received and was to pay to the lady or her order as it was called for but after eight years it appeared upon the strictest calculation that the woman had paid but four pound a year and sunk twoandtwenty for her own pocket it is but supposing instead of twentysix pound twentysix thousand and by that you may judge what the pretensions of modern merit are where it happens to be its own

ever was printed i mean the examiner numb 17 in which he pretends to give an account of what the duke of marlborough has got by his services the writer in the medley admitting even the correctness of the examiners sum of £540000 sets off against this the value of the several battles won by the duke and twenty seven towns taken which being reckoned at 300000l a town the price that dunkirk was sold

take the 200l a year and i wrote at the same time to ask her majesty whether she would allow me to charge in the privypurse accounts which i was to send her that yearly sum from the time of the offer

contumeliis efficere potuisset eas omnes sese hoc uno praetore per triennium pertulisse aiebant2  when i first undertook this paper i was resolved to concern myself only with things and not with persons whether i have kept or broken this resolution i cannot recollect and i will not be at the pains to examine but leave the matter to those little antagonists who may want a topic for criticism thus much i have discovered that it is in writing as in building where after all our schemes and calculations we are mightily deceived in our accounts and often forced to make use of any materials we can find that the work may be kept a going besides to speak my opinion the things i have occasion to mention are so closely linked to persons that nothing but time the father of oblivion can separate them let me put a parallel case suppose i should complain that last week my coach was within an inch of overturning in a smooth even way and drawn by very gentle horses to be sure all my friends would immediately lay the fault upon john3 because they knew he then presided in my coachbox again suppose i should discover some uneasiness to find myself i knew not how over headandears in debt though i was sure my tenants paid their rents very well and that i never spent half my income they would certainly advise me to turn off mr oldfox4 my receiver and take another if as a justice of peace i should tell a friend that my warrants and mittimuses were never drawn up as i would have them that i had the misfortune to send an honest man to gaol and dismiss a knave he would bid me no longer trust charles and harry5 my two clerks whom he knew to be ignorant wilful assuming and illinclined fellows if i should add that my tenants made me very uneasy with their squabbles and broils among themselves he would counsel me to cashier will bigamy6 the seneschal of my manor and lastly if my neighbour and i happened to have a misunderstanding about the delivery of a message what could i do less than strip and discard the blundering or malicious rascal that carried it7  it is the same thing in the conduct of public affairs where they have been managed with rashness or wilfulness corruption ignorance or injustice barely to relate the facts at least while they are fresh in memory will as much reflect upon the persons concerned as if we had told their names at length  i have therefore since thought of another expedient frequently practised with great safety and success by satirical writers which is that of looking into history for some character bearing a resemblance to the person we would describe and with the absolute power of altering adding or suppressing what circumstances we please i conceived we must have very bad luck or very little skill to fail however some days ago in a coffeehouse looking into one of the politic weekly papers i found the writer had fallen into this scheme and i happened to light on that part where he was describing a person who from small beginnings grew as i remember to be constable of france and had a very haughty imperious wife8 i took the author as a friend to our faction for so with great propriety of speech they call the queen and ministry almost the whole clergy and nine parts in ten of the kingdom9 and i said to a gentleman near me that although i knew well enough what persons the author meant yet there were several particulars in the husbands character which i could not reconcile for that of the lady was just and adequate enough but it seems i mistook the whole matter and applied all i had read to a couple of persons who were not at that time in the writers thoughts  now to avoid such a misfortune as this i have been for some time consulting livy and tacitus to find out a character of a princeps senatus a praetor urbanus a quaestor aerarius a caesari ab epistolis and a proconsul10 but among the worst of them i cannot discover one from whom to draw a parallel without doing injury to a roman memory so that i am compelled to have recourse to tully but this author relating facts only as an orator i thought it would be best to observe his method and make an extract from six harangues of his against verres only still preserving the form of an oration i remember a younger brother of mine who deceased about two months ago presented the world with a speech of alcibiades against an athenian brewer11 now i am told for certain that in those days there was no ale in athens and therefore that speech or at least a great part of it must needs be spurious the difference between me and my brother is this he makes alcibiades say a great deal more than he really did and i make cicero say a great deal less12 this verres had been the roman governor of sicily for three years and on return from his government the sicilians entreated cicero to impeach him in the senate which he accordingly did in several orations from whence i have faithfully translated and abstracted that which follows  my lords13  a pernicious opinion hath for some time prevailed not only at rome but among our neighbouring nations that a man who has money enough though he be ever so guilty cannot be condemned in this place but however industriously this opinion be spread to cast an odium on the senate we have brought before your lordships caius verres a person for his life and actions already condemned by all men but as he hopes and gives out by the influence of his wealth to be here absolved in condemning this man you have an opportunity of belying that general scandal of redeeming the credit lost by former judgments and recovering the love of the roman people as well as of our neighbours i have brought a man here before you my lords who is a robber of the public treasure an overturner of law and justice and the disgrace as well as destruction of the sicilian province of whom if you shall determine with equity and due severity your authority will remain entire and upon such an establishment as it ought to be but if his great riches will be able to force their way through that religious reverence and truth which become so awful an assembly i shall however obtain thus much that the defect will be laid where it ought and that it shall not be objected that the criminal was not produced or that there wanted an orator to accuse him this man my lords has publicly said that those ought to be afraid of accusations who have only robbed enough for their own support and maintenance but that he has plundered sufficient to bribe numbers and that nothing is so high or so holy which money cannot corrupt take that support from him and he can have no other left for what eloquence will be able to defend a man whose life has been tainted with so many scandalous vices and who has been so long condemned by the universal opinion of the world to pass over the foul stains and ignominy of his youth his corrupt management in all employments he has borne his treachery and irreligion his injustice and oppression he has left of late such monuments of his villainies in sicily made such havoc and confusion there during his government that the province cannot by any means be restored to its former state and hardly recover itself at all under many years and by a long succession of good governors while this man governed in that island the sicilians had neither the benefit of our laws nor their own nor even of common right in sicily no man now possesses more than what the governors lust and avarice have overlooked or what he was forced to neglect out of mere weariness and satiety of oppression every thing where he presided was determined by his arbitrary will and the best subjects he treated as enemies to recount his abominable debaucheries would offend any modest ear since so many could not preserve their daughters and wives from his lust i believe there is no man who ever heard his name that cannot relate his enormities we bring before you in judgment my lords a public robber an adulterer a defiler of altars14 an enemy of religion and of all that is sacred he sold all employments in sicily of judicature magistracy and trust places in the council and the priesthood itself to the highest bidder and has plundered that island of forty millions of sesterces and here i cannot but observe to your lordships in what manner verres passed the day the morning was spent in taking bribes and selling employments the rest of it in drunkenness and lust his discourse at table was scandalously unbecoming the dignity of his station noise brutality and obsceneness one particular i cannot omit that in the high character of governor of sicily upon a solemn day a day set apart for public prayer for the safety of the commonwealth he stole at evening in a chair to a married woman of infamous character15 against all decency and prudence as well as against all laws both human and divine didst thou think o verres the government of sicily was given thee with so large a commission only by the power of that to break all the bars of law modesty and duty to suppose all mens fortunes thine and leave no house free from thy rapine or lust c  this extract to deal ingenuously has cost me more pains than i think it is worth having only served to convince me that modern corruptions are not to be paralleled by ancient examples without having recourse to poetry or fable for instance i never read in story of a law enacted to take away the force of all laws whatsoever16 by which a man may safely commit upon the last of june what he would infallibly be hanged for if he committed on the first of july by which the greatest criminals may escape provided they continue long enough in power to antiquate their crimes and by stifling them a while can deceive the legislature into an amnesty of which the enactors do not at that time foresee the consequence a cautious merchant will be apt to suspect when he finds a man who has the repute of a cunning dealer and with whom he has old accounts urging for a general release when i reflect on this proceeding i am not surprised that those who contrived a parliamentary sponge for their crimes are now afraid of a new revolution sponge for their money and if it were possible to contrive a sponge that could only affect those who had need of the other perhaps it would not be ill employed   footnote 1 no 17 in the

atque nefas tot bella per orbem tam multae scelerum facies2  i am often violently tempted to let the world freely know who the author of this paper is to tell them my name and titles at length which would prevent abundance of inconsistent criticisms i daily hear upon it those who are enemies to the notions and opinions i would advance are sometimes apt to quarrel with the examiner as defective in point of wit and sometimes of truth at other times they are so generous and candid to allow it is written by a club and that very great hands have fingers in it as for those who only appear its adversaries in print they give me but very little pain the paper i hold lies at my mercy and i can govern it as i please therefore when i begin to find the wit too bright the learning too deep and the satire too keen for me to deal with a very frequent case no doubt where a man is constantly attacked by such shrewd adversaries i peaceably fold it up or fling it aside and read no more it would be happy for me to have the same power over peoples tongues and not be forced to hear my own work railed at and commended fifty times a day affecting all the while a countenance wholly unconcerned and joining out of policy or good manners with the judgment of both parties this i confess is too great a hardship for so bashful and unexperienced a writer3  but alas i lie under another discouragement of much more weight i was very unfortunate in the choice of my party when i set up to be a writer where is the merit or what opportunity to discover our wit our courage or our learning in drawing our pens for the defence of a cause which the queen and both houses of parliament and nine parts in ten of the kingdom have so unanimously embraced i am cruelly afraid we politic authors must begin to lessen our expenses and lie for the future at the mercy of our printers all hopes now are gone of writing ourselves into places or pensions a certain starveling author who worked under the late administration told me with a heavy heart above a month ago that he and some others of his brethren had secretly offered their service dogcheap to the present ministry but were all refused and are now maintained by contribution like jacobites or fanatics i have been of late employed out of perfect commiseration in doing them good offices for whereas some were of opinion that these hungry zealots should not be suffered any longer in their malapert way to snarl at the present course of public proceedings and whereas others proposed that they should be limited to a certain number and permitted to write for their masters in the same manner as counsel are assigned for other criminals that is to say all they can in defence of their client but not reflect upon the court i humbly gave my advice that they should be suffered to write on as they used to do which i did purely out of regard to their persons for i hoped it would keep them out of harms way and prevent them from falling into evil courses which though of little consequence to the public would certainly be fatal to themselves if i have room at the bottom of this paper i will transcribe a petition to the present ministry sent me by one of these authors in behalf of himself and fourscore others of his brethren  for my own part notwithstanding the little encouragement to be hoped for at this time from the men in power i shall continue my paper till either the world or myself grow weary of it the latter is easily determined and for the former i shall not leave it to the partiality of either party but to the infallible judgment of my printer one principal end i designed by it was to undeceive those wellmeaning people who have been drawn unaware into a wrong sense of things either by the common prejudices of education and company the great personal qualities of some party leaders or the foul misrepresentations that were constantly made of all who durst differ from them in the smallest article i have known such men struck with the thoughts of some late changes which as they pretend to think were made without any reason visible to the world in answer to this it is not sufficient to allege what nobody doubts that a prince may choose his own servants without giving a reason to his subjects because it is certain that a wise and good prince will not change his ministers without very important reasons and a good subject ought to suppose that in such a case there are such reasons though he be not apprised of them otherwise he must inwardly tax his prince of capriciousness inconstancy or illdesign such reasons indeed may not be obvious to persons prejudiced or at great distance or short thinkers and therefore if they be no secrets of state nor any ill consequences to be apprehended from their publication it is no uncommendable work in any private hand to lay them open for the satisfaction of all men and if what i have already said or shall hereafter say of this kind be thought to reflect upon persons though none have been named i know not how it can possibly be avoided the queen in her speech mentions with great concern that the navy and other offices are burthened with heavy debts and desires that the like may be prevented for the time to come4 and if it be now possible to prevent the continuance of an evil that has been so long growing upon us and is arrived to such a height surely those corruptions and mismanagements must have been great which first introduced them before our taxes were eaten up by annuities  if i were able to rip up and discover in all their colours only about eight or nine thousand of the most scandalous abuses5 that have been committed in all parts of public management for twenty years past by a certain set of men and their instruments i should reckon it some service to my country and to posterity but to say the truth i should be glad the authors names were conveyed to future times along with their actions for though the present age may understand well enough the little hints we give the parallels we draw and the characters we describe yet this will all be lost to the next however if these papers reduced into a more durable form should happen to live till our grandchildren are men i hope they may have curiosity enough to consult annals and compare dates in order to find out what names were then intrusted with the conduct of affairs in the consequences whereof themselves will so deeply share like a heavy debt in a private family which often lies an incumbrance upon an estate for three generations  but leaving the care of informing posterity to better pens i shall with due regard to truth discretion and the safety of my person from the men of the newfangled moderation continue to take all proper opportunities of letting the misled part of the people see how grossly they have been abused and in what particulars i shall also endeavour to convince them that the present course we are in is the most probable means with the blessing of god to extricate ourselves out of all our difficulties  among those who are pleased to write or talk against this paper i have observed a strange manner of reasoning which i should be glad to hear them explain themselves upon they make no ceremony of exclaiming upon all occasions against a change of ministry in so critical and dangerous a conjuncture what shall we who heartily approve and join in those proceedings say in defence of them we own the juncture of affairs to be as they describe we are pushed for an answer and are forced at last freely to confess that the corruptions and abuses in every branch of the administration were so numerous and intolerable that all things must have ended in ruin without some speedy reformation this i have already asserted in a former paper and the replies i have read or heard have been in plain terms to affirm the direct contrary and not only to defend and celebrate the late persons and proceedings but to threaten me with law and vengeance for casting reflections on so many great and honourable men whose birth virtue and abilities whose morals and religion whose love of their country and its constitution in church and state were so universally allowed and all this set off with odious comparisons reflecting on the present choice is not this in plain and direct terms to tell all the world that the queen has in a most dangerous crisis turned out a whole set of the best ministers that ever served a prince without any manner of reason but her royal pleasure and brought in others of a character directly contrary and how so vile an opinion as this can consist with the least pretence to loyalty or good manners let the world determine  i confess myself so little a refiner in the politics as not to be able to discover what other motive besides obedience to the queen a sense of public danger and a true love of their country joined with invincible courage could spirit those great men who have now under her majestys authority undertaken the direction of affairs what can they expect but the utmost efforts of malice from a set of enraged domestic adversaries perpetually watching over their conduct crossing all their designs and using every art to foment divisions among them in order to join with the weakest upon any rupture the difficulties they must encounter are nine times more and greater than ever and the prospects of interest after the reapings and gleanings of so many years nine times less every misfortune at home or abroad though the necessary consequence of former counsels will be imputed to them and all the good success given to the merit of former schemes a sharper has held your cards all the evening played booty and lost your money and when things are almost desperate you employ an honest gentleman to retrieve your losses  i would ask whether the queens speech does not contain her intentions in every particular relating to the public that a good subject a briton and a protestant can possibly have at heart to carry on the war in all its parts particularly in spain6 with the utmost vigour in order to procure a safe and honourable peace for us and our allies to find some ways of paying the debts on the navy to support and encourage the church of england to preserve the british constitution according to the union to maintain the indulgence by law allowed to scrupulous consciences and to employ none but such as are for the protestant succession in the house of hanover7 it is known enough that speeches on these occasions are ever digested by the advice of those who are in the chief confidence and consequently that these are the sentiments of her majestys ministers as well as her own and we see the two houses have unanimously agreed with her in every article when the least counterpaces8 are made to any of these resolutions it will then be time enough for our malcontents to bawl out popery persecution arbitrary power and the pretender in the mean while it is a little hard to think that this island can hold but six men of honesty and ability enough to serve their prince and country or that our safety should depend upon their credit any more than it would upon the breath in their nostrils why should not a revolution in the ministry be sometimes necessary as well as a revolution in the crown it is to be presumed the former is at least as lawful in itself and perhaps the experiment not quite so dangerous the revolution of the sun about the earth was formerly thought a necessary expedient to solve appearances though it left many difficulties unanswered till philosophers contrived a better which is that of the earths revolution about the sun this is found upon experience to save much time and labour to correct many irregular motions and is

satira videor nimis acer et ultra   legem tendere opus sine nervis altera quicquid   composui pars esse putat2   when the printer came last week for his copy he brought along with him a bundle of those papers3 which in the phrase of whig coffeehouses have swinged off the examiner most of which i had never seen nor heard of before i remember some time ago in one of the tatlers to have read a letter4 wherein several reasons are assigned for the present corruption and degeneracy of our taste but i think the writer has omitted the principal one which i take to be the prejudice of parties neither can i excuse either side of this infirmity i have heard the arrantest drivellers pro and con commended for their smartness even by men of tolerable judgment and the best performances exploded as nonsense and stupidity this indeed may partly be imputed to policy and prudence but it is chiefly owing to that blindness which prejudice and passion cast over the understanding i mention this because i think it properly within my province in quality of examiner and having granted more than is usual for an enemy to do i must now take leave to say that so weak a cause and so ruined a faction were never provided with pens more resembling their condition or less suited to their occasions    non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis   tempus eget5  this is the more to be wondered at when we consider they have the full liberty of the press that they have no other way left to recover themselves and that they want not men of excellent parts to set their arguments in the best light they will bear now if two men would argue on both sides with fairness good sense and good manners it would be no ill entertainment to the town and perhaps be the most effectual means to reconcile us but i am apt to think that men of a great genius are hardly brought to prostitute their pens in a very odious cause which besides is more properly undertaken by noise and impudence by gross railing and scurrility by calumny and lying and by little trifling cavils and carpings in the wrong place which those whifflers use for arguments and answers  i was well enough pleased with a story of one of these answerers who in a paper6 last week found many faults with a late calculation of mine being it seems more deep learned than his fellows he was resolved to begin his answer with a latin verse as well as other folks his business was to look out for something against an examiner that would pretend to tax accounts and turning over virgil he had the luck to find these words    fugiant examina taxos7  so down they went and out they would have come if one of his unlucky prompters had not hindered it  i here declare once for all that if these people will not be quiet i shall take the bread out of their mouths and answer the examiner myself8 which i protest i have never yet done though i have been often charged with it neither have those answers been written or published with my privity as malicious people are pleased to give out nor do i believe the common whiggish report that the authors are hired by the ministry to give my paper a value  but the friends of this paper have given me more uneasiness with their impatience than its enemies by their answers i heard myself censured last week by some of the former for promising to discover the corruptions in the late administration but never performing any thing the latter on the other side are thundering out their anathemas against me for discovering so many i am at a loss how to decide between these contraries and shall therefore proceed after my own way as i have hitherto done my design being of more importance than that of writing only to gratify the spleen of one side or provoke that of the other though it may occasionally have both effects  i shall therefore go on to relate some facts that in my humble opinion were no hindrance to the change of the ministry  the first i shall mention was that of introducing certain new phrases into the court style which had been very seldom or never made use of in former times they usually ran in the following terms madam i cannot serve you while such a one is in employment i desire humbly to resign my commission if mr  continues secretary of state i cannot answer that the city will lend money unless my l  be president of the council i must beg leave to surrender except  has the staff i must not accept the seals unless  comes into the other office this has been the language of late years from subjects to their prince9 thus they stood upon terms and must have their own conditions to ruin the nation nay this dutiful manner of capitulating had spread so far that every understrapper began at length to perk up and assume he expected a regiment or his son must be a major or his brother a collector else he threatened to vote according to his conscience  another of their glorious attempts was the clause intended in the bill for the encouragement of learning10 for taking off the obligation upon fellows of colleges in both universities to enter upon holy orders the design of which as i have heard the undertakers often confess was to remove the care of educating youth out of the hands of the clergy who are apt to infuse into their pupils too great a regard for the church and the monarchy but there was a farther secret in this clause which may best be discovered by the first projectors or at least the garblers of it and these are known to be collins11 and tindal12 in conjunction with a most pious lawyer their disciple13  what shall we say to their prodigious skill in arithmetic discovered so constantly in their decision of elections where they were able to make out by the rule of false that three were more than threeandtwenty and fifteen than fifty nay it was a maxim which i never heard any of them dispute that in determining elections they were not to consider where the right lay but which of the candidates was likelier to be true to the cause this they used to illustrate by a very apt and decent similitude of gaming with a sharper if you cannot cheat as well as he you are certainly undone  another cast of their politics was that of endeavouring to impeach an innocent lady for no reason imaginable but her faithful and diligent service to the queen14 and the favour her majesty bore to her upon that account when others had acted contrary in so shameful a manner what else was the crime had she treated her royal mistress with insolence or neglect had she enriched herself by a long practice of bribery and obtaining exorbitant grants had she engrossed her majestys favours without admitting any access but through her means had she heaped employments upon herself her family and dependants had she an imperious haughty behaviour or after all was it a perfect blunder and mistake of one person for another i have heard of a man who lay all night on a rough pavement and in the morning wondering what it could possibly be that made him rest so ill happened to see a feather under him and imputed the uneasiness of his lodging to that i remember likewise the story of a giant in rabelais15 who used to feed upon windmills but was unfortunately choked with a small lump of fresh butter before a warm oven  and here i cannot but observe how very refined some people are in their generosity and gratitude there is a certain great person16 i shall not say of what sex who for many years past was the constant mark and butt against which our present malcontents used to discharge their resentment upon whom they bestowed all the terms of scurrility that malice envy and indignation could invent whom they publicly accused of every vice that can possess a human heart pride covetousness ingratitude oppression treachery dissimulation violence and fury all in the highest extremes but of late they have changed their language on a sudden that person is now the most faithful and just that ever served a prince that person originally differing from them in principles as far as east and west but united in practice and falling together they are now reconciled and find twenty resemblances between each other which they could never discover before tanti est ut placeam tibi perire17  but to return how could it be longer suffered in a free nation that all avenues to preferment should be shut up except a very few when one or two stood constant sentry who docked all favours they handed down or spread a huge invisible net between the prince and subject through which nothing of value could pass and here i cannot but admire at one consequence from this management which is of an extraordinary nature generally speaking princes who have ill ministers are apt to suffer in their reputation as well as in the love of the people but it was not so with the queen when the sun is overcast by those clouds he exhales from the earth we still acknowledge his light and influence and at last find he can dispel and drive them down to the horizon the wisest prince by the necessity of affairs the misrepresentations of designing men or the innocent mistakes even of a good predecessor may find himself encompassed by a crew of courtiers whom time opportunity and success have miserably corrupted and if he can save himself and his people from ruin under the worst administration what may not his subjects hope for when with their universal applause he changes hands and makes use of the best  another great objection with me against the late party was the cruel tyranny they put upon conscience by a barbarous inquisition refusing to admit the least toleration or indulgence they imposed a hundred tests but could never be prevailed with to dispense with or take off the smallest nor even admit of occasional conformity18 but went on daily as their apostle tindal expresseth it narrowing their terms of communion pronouncing nine parts in ten of the kingdom heretics and shutting them out of the pale of their church these very men who talk so much of a comprehension in religion among us how came they to allow so little of it in politics which is their sole religion you shall hear them pretending to bewail the animosities kept up between the church of england and dissenters where the differences in opinion are so few and inconsiderable yet these very sons of moderation were pleased to excommunicate every man who disagreed with them in the smallest article of their political creed or who refused to receive any new article how difficult soever to digest which the leaders imposed at pleasure to serve their own interest  i will quit this subject for the present when i have told one story19 there was a great king in scythia whose dominions were bounded to the north by the poor mountainous territories of a petty lord who paid homage as the kings vassal the scythian prime minister being largely bribed indirectly obtained his masters consent to suffer this lord to build forts and provide himself with arms under pretence of preventing the inroads of the tartars this little depending sovereign finding he was now in a condition to be troublesome began to insist upon terms and threatened upon every occasion to unite with the tartars upon which the prime minister who began to be in pain about his head proposed a match betwixt his master and the only daughter of this tributary lord which he had the good luck to bring to pass and from that time valued himself as author of a most glorious union which indeed was grown of absolute necessity by his corruption this passage cited literally from an old history of sarmatia i

am very much at a loss how to proceed upon the subject intended in this paper which a new incident has led me to engage in the subject i mean is that of soldiers and the army but being a matter wholly out of my trade i shall handle it in as cautious a manner as i am able  it is certain that the art of war hath suffered great changes almost in every age and country of the world however there are some maxims relating to it that will be eternal truths and which every reasonable man will allow  in the early times of greece and rome the armies of those states were composed of their citizens who took no pay because the quarrel was their own and therefore the war was usually decided in one campaign or if it lasted longer however in winter the soldiers returned to their several callings and were not distinguished from the rest of the people the gothic governments in europe though they were of military institution yet observed almost the same method i shall instance only here in england those who held lands in capite of the king were obliged to attend him in his wars with a certain number of men who all held lands from them at easy rents on that condition these fought without pay and when the service was over returned again to their farms it is recorded of william rufus that being absent in normandy and engaged in a war with his brother he ordered twenty thousand men to be raised and sent over from hence to supply his army3 but having struck up a peace before they were embarked he gave them leave to disband on condition they would pay him ten shillings a man which amounted to a mighty sum in those days  consider a kingdom as a great family whereof the prince is the father and it will appear plainly that mercenary troops are only servants armed either to awe the children at home or else to defend from invaders the family who are otherwise employed and choose to contribute out of their stock for paying their defenders rather than leave their affairs to be neglected in their absence the art of making soldiery a trade and keeping armies in pay seems in europe to have had two originals the first was usurpation when popular men destroyed the liberties of their country and seized the power into their own hands which they were forced to maintain by hiring guards to bridle the people such were anciently the tyrants in most of the small states in greece and such were those in several parts of italy about three or four centuries ago as machiavel informs us the other original of mercenary armies seems to have risen from larger kingdoms or commonwealths which had subdued provinces at a distance and were forced to maintain troops upon them to prevent insurrections from the natives of this sort were macedon carthage and rome of old venice and holland at this day as well as most kingdoms of europe so that mercenary forces in a free state whether monarchy or commonwealth seem only necessary either for preserving their conquests which in such governments it is not prudent to extend too far or else for maintaining a war at distance  in this last which at present is our most important case there are certain maxims that all wise governments have observed  the first i shall mention is that no private man should have a commission to be general for life4 let his merit and services be ever so great or if a prince be unadvisedly brought to offer such a commission in one hand let him to save time and blood deliver up his crown with the other the romans in the height and perfection of their government usually sent out one of the new consuls to be general against their most formidable enemy and recalled the old one who often returned before the next election and according as he had merit was sent to command in some other part which perhaps was continued to him for a second and sometimes a third year but if paulus aemilius5 or scipio6 himself had presumed to move the senate to continue their commissions for life they certainly would have fallen a sacrifice to the jealousy of the people caesar indeed between whom and a certain general some of late with much discretion have made a parallel had his command in gaul continued to him for five years and was afterwards made perpetual dictator that is to say general for life which gave him the power and the will of utterly destroying the roman liberty but in his time the romans were very much degenerated and great corruptions crept into their morals and discipline however we see there still were some remains of a noble spirit among them for when caesar sent to be chosen consul notwithstanding his absence they decreed he should come in person give up his command and petere more majorum7  it is not impossible but a general may desire such a commission out of inadvertency at the instigation of his friends or perhaps of his enemies or merely for the benefit and honour of it without intending any such dreadful consequences and in that case a wise prince or state may barely refuse it without shewing any marks of their displeasure but the request in its own nature is highly criminal and ought to be entered so upon record to terrify others in time to come from venturing to make it  another maxim to be observed by a free state engaged in war is to keep the military power in absolute subjection to the civil nor ever suffer the former to influence or interfere with the latter a general and his army are servants hired by the civil power to act as they are directed from thence and with a commission large or limited as the administration shall think fit for which they are largely paid in profit and honour the whole system by which armies are governed is quite alien from the peaceful institutions of states at home and if the rewards be so inviting as to tempt a senator to take a post in the army while he is there on his duty he ought to consider himself in no other capacity i know not any sort of men so apt as soldiers are to reprimand those who presume to interfere in what relates to their trade when they hear any of us in a coffeehouse wondering that such a victory was not pursued complaining that such a town cost more men and money than it was worth to take it or that such an opportunity was lost of fighting the enemy they presently reprove us and often with justice enough for meddling in matters out of our sphere and clearly convince us of our mistakes in terms of art that none of us understand nor do we escape so for they reflect with the utmost contempt of our ignorance that we who sit at home in ease and security never stirring from our firesides should pretend from books and general reason to argue upon military affairs which after all if we may judge from the share of intellectuals in some who are said to excel that way is not so very profound or difficult a science but if there be any weight in what they offer as perhaps there may be a great deal surely these gentlemen have a much weaker pretence to concern themselves in matters of the cabinet which are always either far above or much beside their capacities soldiers may as well pretend to prescribe rules for trade to determine points in philosophy to be moderators in an assembly of divines or direct in a court of justice as to misplace their talent in examining affairs of state especially in what relates to the choice of ministers who are never so likely to be ill chosen as when approved by them it would be endless to shew how pernicious all steps of this nature have been in many parts and ages of the world i shall only produce two at present one in rome and the other in england the first is of caesar when he came to the city with his soldiers to settle the ministry there was an end of their liberty for ever the second was in the great rebellion against king charles the first the king and both houses were agreed upon the terms of a peace but the officers of the army as ludlow relates it sets a guard upon the house of commons took a list of the members and kept all by force out of the house except those who were for bringing the king to a trial8 some years after when they erected a military government and ruled the island by majorgenerals we received most admirable instances of their skill in politics to say the truth such formidable sticklers9 can have but two reasons for desiring to interfere in the administration the first is that of caesar and cromwell of which god forbid i should accuse or suspect any body since the second is pernicious enough and that is to preserve those in power who are for perpetuating a war rather than see others advanced who they are sure will use all proper means to promote a safe and honourable peace  thirdly since it is observed of armies that in the present age they are brought to some degree of humanity and a more regular demeanour to each other and to the world than in former times it is certainly a good maxim to endeavour preserving this temper among them without which they would soon degenerate into savages to this end it would be prudent among other things to forbid that detestable custom of drinking to the damnation or confusion of any person whatsoever  such desperate acts and the opinions infused along with them into heads already inflamed by youth and wine are enough to scatter madness and sedition through a whole camp so seldom upon their knees to pray and so often to curse this is not properly atheism but a sort of antireligion prescribed by the devil and which an atheist of common sense would scorn as an absurdity i have heard it mentioned as a common practice last autumn somewhere or other to drink damnation and confusion10 and this with circumstances very aggravating and horrid to the new ministry and to those who had any hand in turning out the old that is to say to those persons whom her majesty has thought fit to employ in her greatest affairs with something more than a glance against the queen herself and if it be true that these orgies were attended with certain doubtful words of standing by their general who without question abhorred them let any man consider the consequence of such dispositions if they should happen to spread i could only wish for the honour of the army as well as of the queen and ministry that a remedy had been applied to the disease in the place and time where it grew if men of such principles were able to propagate them in a camp and were sure of a general for life who had any tincture of ambition we might soon bid farewell to ministers and parliaments whether new or old  i am only sorry such an accident has happened towards the close of a war when it is chiefly the interest of those gentlemen who have posts in the army to behave themselves in such a manner as might encourage the legislature to make some provision for them when there will be no further need of their services they are to consider themselves as persons by their educations unqualified for many other stations of life their fortunes will not suffer them to retain to a party after its fall nor have they weight or abilities to help towards its resurrection their future dependence is wholly upon the prince and parliament to which they will never make their way by solemn execrations of the ministry a ministry of the queens own election and fully answering the wishes of her people this unhappy step in some of their brethren may pass for an uncontrollable argument that politics are not their business or their element the fortune of war hath raised several persons up to swelling titles and great commands over numbers of men which they are too apt to transfer along with them into civil life and appear in all companies as if it were at the head of their regiments with a sort of deportment that ought to have been dropt behind in that short passage to harwich it puts me in mind of a dialogue in lucian11 where charon wafting one of their predecessors over styx ordered him to strip off his armour and fine clothes yet still thought him too heavy but said he put off likewise that pride and presumption those highswelling words and that vainglory because they were of no use on the other side the water thus if all that array of military grandeur were confined to the proper scene it would be much more for the interest of the owners and less offensive to their fellow subjects12   footnote 1 no 20 in the

is a true lover of our constitution must needs be pleased to see what successful endeavours are daily made to restore it in every branch to its ancient form from the languishing condition it hath long lain in and with such deadly symptoms  i have already handled some abuses during the late management and shall in convenient time go on with the rest hitherto i have confined myself to those of the state but with the good leave of those who think it a matter of small moment i shall now take liberty to say something of the church4  for several years past there hath not i think in europe been any society of men upon so unhappy a foot as the clergy of england nor more hardly treated by those very persons from whom they deserved much better quarter and in whose power they chiefly had put it to use them so ill i would not willingly misrepresent facts but i think it generally allowed by enemies and friends that the bold and brave defences made before the revolution against those many invasions of our rights proceeded principally from the clergy who are likewise known to have rejected all advances made them to close with the measures at that time concerting while the dissenters to gratify their ambition and revenge fell into the basest compliances with the court approved of all proceedings by their numerous and fulsome addresses and took employments and commissions by virtue of the dispensing power against the direct laws of the land5 all this is so true that if ever the pretender comes in they will next to those of his own religion have the fairest claim and pretensions to his favour from their merit and eminent services to his supposed father who without such encouragement would probably never have been misled to go the lengths he did it should likewise be remembered to the everlasting honour of the london divines that in those dangerous times they writ and published the best collection of arguments against popery that ever appeared in the world at the revolution the body of the clergy joined heartily in the common cause except a few whose sufferings perhaps have atoned for their mistakes like men who are content to go about for avoiding a gulf or a precipice but come into the old straight road again as soon as they can but another temper had now begun to prevail for as in the reign of k charles the first several wellmeaning people were ready to join in reforming some abuses while others who had deeper designs were still calling out for a thorough reformation which ended at last in the ruin of the kingdom so after the late kings coming to the throne there was a restless cry from men of the same principles for a thorough revolution which as some were carrying it on must have ended in the destruction of the monarchy and church  what a violent humour hath run ever since against the clergy and from what corner spread and fomented is i believe manifest to all men it looked like a set quarrel against christianity and if we call to mind several of the leaders it must in a great measure have been actually so nothing was more common in writing and conversation than to hear that reverend body charged in gross with what was utterly inconsistent despised for their poverty hated for their riches reproached with avarice and taxed with luxury accused for promoting arbitrary power and resisting the prerogative censured for their pride and scorned for their meanness of spirit the representatives of the lower clergy railed at for disputing the power of the bishops by the known abhorrers of episcopacy and abused for doing nothing in their convocations by those very men who helped to bind up their hands the vice the folly the ignorance of every single man were laid upon the character their jurisdiction censures and discipline trampled under foot yet mighty complaints against their excessive power6 the men of wit employed to turn the priesthood itself into ridicule in short groaning every where under the weight of poverty oppression contempt and obloquy a fair return for the time and money spent in their education to fit them for the service of the altar and a fair encouragement for worthy men to come into the church however it may be some comfort for persons of that holy function that their divine founder as well as his harbinger met with the like reception john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a glutton and a winebibber c  in this deplorable state of the clergy nothing but the hand of providence working by its glorious instrument the queen could have been able to turn the peoples hearts so surprisingly in their favour this princess destined for the safety of europe and a blessing to her subjects began her reign with a noble benefaction to the church7 and it was hoped the nation would have followed such an example which nothing could have prevented but the false politics of a set of men who form their maxims upon those of every tottering commonwealth which is always struggling for life subsisting by expedients and often at the mercy of any powerful neighbour these men take it into their imagination that trade can never flourish unless the country becomes a common receptacle for all nations religions and languages a system only proper for small popular states but altogether unworthy and below the dignity of an imperial crown which with us is best upheld by a monarch in possession of his just prerogative a senate of nobles and of commons and a clergy established in its due rights with a suitable maintenance by law but these men come with the spirit of shopkeepers to frame rules for the administration of kingdoms or as if they thought the whole art of government consisted in the importation of nutmegs and the curing of herrings such an island as ours can afford enough to support the majesty of a crown the honour of a nobility and the dignity of a magistracy we can encourage arts and sciences maintain our bishops and clergy and suffer our gentry to live in a decent hospitable manner yet still there will remain hands sufficient for trade and manufactures which do always indeed deserve the best encouragement but not to a degree of sending every living soul into the warehouse or the workhouse  this pedantry of republican politics hath done infinite mischief among us to this we owe those noble schemes of treating christianity as a system of speculative opinions which no man should be bound to believe of making the being and the worship of god a creature of the state in consequence of these that the teachers of religion ought to hold their maintenance at pleasure or live by the alms and charitable collection of the people and be equally encouraged of all opinions that they should be prescribed what to teach by those who are to learn from them and upon default have a staff and a pair of shoes left at their door8 with many other projects of equal piety wisdom and good nature  but god be thanked they and their schemes are vanished and their places shall know them no more when i think of that inundation of atheism infidelity profaneness and licentiousness which were like to overwhelm us from what mouths and hearts it first proceeded and how the people joined with the queens endeavours to divert this flood i cannot but reflect on that remarkable passage in the revelation9 where the serpent with seven heads cast out of his mouth water after the woman like a flood that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood but the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had cast out of his mouth for the queen having changed her ministry suitable to her own wisdom and the wishes of her subjects and having called a free parliament at the same time summoned the convocation by her royal writ10 as in all times had been accustomed and soon after their meeting sent a most gracious letter11 to the archbishop of canterbury to be communicated to the bishops and clergy of his province taking notice of the loose and profane principles which had been openly scattered and propagated among her subjects that the consultations of the clergy were particularly requisite to repress and prevent such daring attempts for which her subjects from all parts of the kingdom have shown their just abhorrence she hopes the endeavours of the clergy in this respect will not be unsuccessful and for her part is ready to give them all fit encouragement to proceed in the dispatch of such business as properly belongs to them and to grant them powers requisite to carry on so good a work in conclusion earnestly recommending to them to avoid disputes and determining to do all that in her lies to compose and extinguish them  it is to be hoped that this last part of her majestys letter will be the first she will please to execute for it seems this very letter created the first dispute12 the fact whereof is thus related the upper house having formed an address to the queen before they received her majestys letter sent both address and letter together to the lower house with a message excusing their not mentioning the letter in the address because this was formed before the other was receivedl3 the lower house returned them with a desire that an address might be formed with due regard and acknowledgments for the letter after some difficulties the same address was sent down again with a clause inserted making some short mention of the said letter this the lower house did not think sufficient and sent it back again with the same request whereupon the archbishop after a short consultation with some of his brethren immediately adjourned the convocation for a month and no address at all was sent to the queen  i understand not ecclesiastical affairs well enough to comment upon this matter14 but it seems to me that all methods of doing service to the church and kingdom by means of a convocation may be at any time eluded if there be no remedy against such an incident and if this proceeding be agreeable to the institution spiritual assemblies must needs be strangely contrived very different from any lay senate yet known in the world surely from the nature of such a synod it must be a very unhappy circumstance when the majority of the bishops draws one way and that of the lower clergy another the latter i think are not at this time suspected for any principles bordering upon those professed by enemies to episcopacy and if they happen to differ from the greater part of the present set of bishops i doubt it will call some things to mind that may turn the scale of general favour on the inferior clergys side who with a profound duty to her majesty are perfectly pleased with the present turn of affairs besides curious people will be apt to enquire into the dates of some promotions to call to mind what designs were then upon the anvil and from thence make malicious deductions perhaps they will observe the manner of voting on the bishops bench and compare it with what shall pass in the upper house of convocation there is however one comfort that under the present dispositions of the kingdom a dislike to the proceedings of any of their lordships even to the number of a majority will be purely personal and not turned to the disadvantage of the order and for my part as i am a true lover of the church i had rather find the inclinations of the people favourable to episcopacy in general than see a majority of prelates cried up by those who are known enemies to the character nor indeed hath anything given me more offence for several years past than to observe how some of that bench have been caressed by certain persons and others of them openly celebrated by the infamous pens of atheists republicans and fanatics  time and mortality can only remedy these inconveniencies in the church which are not to be cured like those in the state by a change of ministry if we may guess the temper of a convocation from the choice of a prolocutor15 as it is usual to do that of a house of commons by the speaker we may expect great things from that reverend body who have done themselves much reputation by pitching upon a gentleman of so much piety wit and learning for that office and one who is so thoroughly versed in those parts of knowledge which are proper for it i am sorry that the three latin speeches delivered upon presenting the prolocutor were not made public16 they might perhaps have given us some light into the dispositions of each house and besides one of them is said to be so peculiar in the style and matter as might have made up in entertainment what it wanted in instruction   footnote 1 no 21 in the reprint ts  footnote 2 under date january 1st

sunt occultiores insidiae quam eae quae latent in simulatione officii aut in aliquo necessitudinis nomine3  the following answer is written in the true style and with the usual candour of such pieces which i have imitated to the best of my skill and doubt not but the reader will be extremely satisfied with it  the examiner crossexamined or a full answer to the last examiner  if i durst be so bold with this author i would gladly ask him a familiar question pray sir who made you an examiner he talks in one of his insipid papers of eight or nine thousand corruptions4 while we were at the head of affairs yet in all this time he has hardly produced fifty  parturiunt montes c5  but i shall confine myself at present to his last paper he tells us the queen began her reign with a noble benefaction to the church heres priestcraft with a witness this is the constant language of your highfliers to call those who are hired to teach the religion of the magistrate by the name of the church6 but this is not all for in the very next line he says it was hoped the nation would have followed this example you see the faction begins already to speak out this is an open demand for the abbeylands this furious zealot would have us priestridden again like our popish ancestors but it is to be hoped the government will take timely care to suppress such audacious attempts else we have spent so much blood and treasure to very little purpose in maintaining religion and revolution but what can we expect from a man who at one blow endeavours to ruin our trade a country says he may flourish these are his own words without being the common receptacle for all nations religions and languages what we must immediately banish or murder the palatines forbid all foreign merchants not only the exchange but the kingdom persecute the dissenters with fire and faggot and make it hightreason to speak any other tongue but english in another place he talks of a serpent with seven heads which is a manifest corruption of the text for the words seven heads are not mentioned in that verse7 however we know what serpent he would mean a serpent with fourteen legs or indeed no serpent at all but seven great men who were the best ministers the truest protestants and the most disinterested patriots that ever served a prince8 but nothing is so inconsistent as this writer i know not whether to call him a whig or a tory a protestant or a papist he finds fault with convocations says they are assemblies strangely contrived and yet lays the fault upon us that we bound their hands i wish we could have bound their tongues too but as fast as their hands were bound they could make a shift to hold their pens and have their share in the guilt of ruining the hopefullest party and ministry that ever prescribed to a crown this captious gentleman is angry to see a majority of prelates cried up by those who are enemies to the character now i always thought that the concessions of enemies were more to a mans advantage than the praise of his friends time and mortality he says can only remedy these inconveniencies in the church that is in other words when certain bishops are dead we shall have others of our own stamp not so fast you are not yet so sure of your game we have already got one comfortable loss in spain though by a general of our own9 for joy of which our junto had a merry meeting at the house of their great proselyte on the very day we received the happy news one or two more such blows would perhaps set us right again and then we can employ mortality as well as others he concludes with wishing that three letters spoke when the prolocutor was presented were made public i suppose he would be content with one and that is more than we shall humour him to grant however i hope he will allow it possible to have grace without either eloquence or latin which is all i shall say to his malicious innuendo  having thus i hope given a full and satisfactory answer to the examiners last paper i shall now go on to a more important affair which is to prove by several undeniable instances that the late ministry and their abettors were true friends to the church it is yet i confess a secret to the clergy wherein this friendship did consist for information therefore of that reverend body that they may never forget their benefactors as well as of all others who may be equally ignorant i have determined to display our merits to the world upon that weighty article and i could wish that what i am to say were to be written in brass for an eternal memorial the rather because for the future the church must endeavour to stand unsupported by those patrons who expired in doing it their last good office and will never rise to preserve it any more  let us therefore produce the pious endeavours of these churchdefenders who were its patrons by their power and authority as well as ornaments of it by their exemplary lives  first st paul tells us there must be heresies in the church that the truth may be manifest and therefore by due course of reasoning the more heresies there are the more manifest will the truth be made this being maturely considered by these lovers of the church they endeavoured to propagate as many heresies as they could that the light of truth might shine the clearer  secondly to shew their zeal for the churchs defence they took the care of it entirely out of the hands of god almighty because that was a foreign jurisdiction and made it their own creature depending altogether upon them and issued out their orders to tindal and others to give public notice of it  thirdly because charity is the most celebrated of all christian virtues therefore they extended theirs beyond all bounds and instead of shutting the church against dissenters were ready to open it to all comers and break down its walls rather than that any should want room to enter the strength of a state we know consists in the number of people how different soever in their callings and why should not the strength of a church consist in the same how different soever in their creeds for that reason they charitably attempted to abolish the test which tied up so many hands from getting employments in order to protect the church  i know very well that this attempt is objected to us as a crime by several malignant tories and denied as a slander by many unthinking people among ourselves the latter are apt in their defence to ask such questions as these was your test repealed10 had we not a majority might we not have done it if we pleased to which the others answer you did what you could you prepared the way but you found a fatal impediment from that quarter whence the sanction of the law must come and therefore to save your credit you condemned a paper to be burnt which yourselves had brought in11 but alas the miscarriage of that noble project for the safety of the church had another original the knowledge whereof depends upon a piece of secret history that i shall now lay open  these churchprotectors had directed a presbyterian preacher to draw up a bill for repealing the test it was accordingly done with great art and in the preamble several expressions of civility to the established church and when it came to the qualifications of all those who were to enter on any office the compiler had taken special care to make them large enough for all christians whatsoever by transcribing the very words only formed into an oath which quakers are obliged to profess by a former act of parliament as i shall here set them down12 i ab profess faith in god the father and in jesus christ his eternal son the true god and in the holy spirit one god blessed for evermore and do acknowledge the holy scriptures of the old and new testament to be given by divine inspiration this bill was carried to the chief leaders for their approbation with these terrible words turned into an oath what should they do those few among them who fancied they believed in god were sure they did not believe in christ or the holy spirit or one syllable of the bible and they were as sure that every body knew their opinion in those matters which indeed they had been always too sincere to disguise how therefore could they take such an oath as that without ruining their reputation with tindal toland13 coward14 collins clendon15 and all the tribe of freethinkers and so give a scandal to weak unbelievers upon this nice point of honour and conscience the matter was hushed the project for repealing the test let fall and the sacrament left as the smaller evil of the two  fourthly these pillars of the church because the harvest was great and the labourers few and because they would ease the bishops from that grievous trouble of laying on hands were willing to allow that power to all men whatsoever to prevent that terrible consequence of unchurching those who thought a hand from under a cloak as effectual as from lawnsleeves and indeed what could more contribute to the advancement of true religion than a bill of general naturalization for priesthood  fifthly in order to fix religion in the minds of men because truth never appears so fair as when confronted with falsehood they directed books to be published that denied the being of a god the divinity of the second and third person the truth of all revelation and the immortality of the soul to this we owe that great sense of religion that respect and kindness to the clergy and that true love of virtue so manifest of late years among the youth of our nation nor could anything be more discreet than to leave the merits of each cause to such wise impartial judges who might otherwise fall under the slavery of believing by education and prejudice  sixthly because nothing so much distracts the thoughts as too great a variety of subjects therefore they had kindly prepared a bill to prescribe the clergy what subjects they should preach upon and in what manner that they might be at no loss and this no doubt was a proper work for such hands so thoroughly versed in the theory and practice of all christian duties  seventhly to save trouble and expense to the clergy they contrived that convocations should meet as seldom as possible and when they were suffered to assemble would never allow them to meddle with any business because they said the office of a clergyman was enough to take up the whole man for the same reason they were very desirous to excuse the bishops from sitting in parliament that they might be at more leisure to stay at home and look after their clergy  i shall mention at present but one more instance of their pious zeal for the church they had somewhere heard the maxim that sanguis martyrum est semen ecclesiae16 therefore in order to sow this seed they began with impeaching a clergyman and that it might be a true martyrdom in every circumstance they proceeded as much as possible against common law17 which the longrobe part of the managers knew was in a hundred instances directly contrary to all their positions and were sufficiently warned of it beforehand but their love of the church prevailed neither was this impeachment an affair taken up on a sudden for a certain great person whose character has been lately published by some stupid and lying writer18 who very much distinguished himself by his zeal in forwarding this impeachment had several years ago endeavoured to persuade the late king to give way to just such another attempt he told his majesty there was a certain clergyman preached very dangerous sermons and that the only way to put a stop to such insolence was to impeach him in parliament the king enquired the character of the man o sir said my lord the most violent hot positive fellow in england so extremely wilful that i believe he would be heartily glad to be a martyr the king answered is it so then i am resolved to disappoint him and would never hear more of the matter by which that hopeful project unhappily miscarried  i have hitherto confined myself to those endeavours for the good of the church which were common to all the leaders and principal men of our party but if my paper were not drawing towards an end i could produce several instances of particular persons who by their exemplary lives and actions have confirmed the character so justly due to the whole body i shall at present mention only two and illustrate the merits of each by a matter of fact  that worthy patriot and true lover of the church whom the late examiner is supposed to reflect on under the name of verres19 felt a pious impulse to be a benefactor to the cathedral of gloucester but how to do it in the most decent generous manner was the question at last he thought of an expedient one morning or night he stole into the church mounted upon the altar and there did that which in cleanly phrase is called disburthening of nature he was discovered prosecuted and condemned to pay a thousand pounds which sum was all employed to support the church as no doubt the benefactor meant it  there is another person whom the same writer is thought to point at under the name of will bigamy20 this gentleman knowing that marriage fees were a considerable perquisite to the clergy found out a way of improving them cent per cent for the good of the church his invention was to marry a second wife while the first was alive convincing her of the lawfulness by such arguments as he did not doubt would make others follow the same example these he had drawn up in writing with intention to publish for the general good and it is hoped he may now have leisure to finish them21   footnote 1 no 22 in the reprint ts  footnote 2 i e 171011 ts  footnote 3 cicero in verrem ii i 15 there are no intrigues more

videatur3  i am satisfied that no reasonable man of either party can justly be offended at any thing i said in one of my papers relating to the army4 from the maxims i there laid down perhaps many persons may conclude that i had a mind the world should think there had been occasion given by some late abuses among men of that calling and they conclude right for my intention is that my hints may be understood and my quotations and allegories applied and i am in some pain to think that in the orcades on one side and the western coasts of ireland on the other the examiner may want a key in several parts which i wish i could furnish them with as for the french king i am under no concern at all i hear he has left off reading my papers and by what he has found in them dislikes our proceedings more than ever and intends either to make great additions to his armies or propose new terms for a peace so false is that which is commonly reported of his mighty satisfaction in our change of ministry and i think it clear that his late letter of thanks to the tories of great britain5 must either have been extorted from him against his judgment or was a cast of his politics to set the people against the present ministry wherein it has wonderfully succeeded  but though i have never heard or never regarded any objections made against that paper which mentions the army yet i intended this as a sort of apology for it and first i declare because we live in a mistaking world that in hinting at some proceedings wherein a few persons are said to be concerned i did not intend to charge them upon the body of the army i have too much detested that barbarous injustice among the writers of a late party to be ever guilty of it myself i mean the accusing societies for the crimes of a few on the other side i must take leave to believe that armies are no more exempt from corruptions than other numbers of men the maxims proposed were occasionally introduced by the report of certain facts which i am bound to believe is true because i am sure considering what has passed it would be a crime to think otherwise all posts in the army all employments at court and many others are or ought to be given and resumed at the mere pleasure of the prince yet when i see a great officer broke a change made in the court or the ministry and this under the most just and gracious princess that ever reigned i must naturally conclude it is done upon prudent considerations and for some great demerit in the sufferers but then is not the punishment sufficient is it generous or charitable to trample on the unfortunate and expose their faults to the world in the strongest colours and would it not suit better with magnanimity as well as common goodnature to leave them at quiet to their own thoughts and repentance yes without question provided it could be so contrived that their very names as well as actions might be forgotten for ever such an act of oblivion would be for the honour of our nation and beget a better opinion of us with posterity and then i might have spared the world and myself the trouble of examining but at present there is a cruel dilemma in the case the friends and abettors of the late ministry are every day publishing their praises to the world and casting reflections upon the present persons in power this is so barefaced an aspersion upon the queen that i know not how any good subject can with patience endure it though he were ever so indifferent with regard to the opinions in dispute shall they who have lost all power and love of the people be allowed to scatter their poison and shall not those who are at least of the strongest side be suffered to bring an antidote and how can we undeceive the deluded remainder but by letting them see that those discarded statesmen were justly laid aside and producing as many instances to prove it as we can not from any personal hatred to them but in justification to the best of queens the many scurrilities i have heard and read against this poor paper of mine are in such a strain that considering the present state of affairs they look like a jest they usually run after the following manner what shall this insolent writer presume to censure the late ministry the ablest the most faithful and truest lovers of their country and its constitution that ever served a prince shall he reflect on the best house of commons that ever sat within those walls has not the queen changed both for a ministry and parliament of jacobites and highfliers who are selling us to france and bringing over the pretender this is the very sum and force of all their reasonings and this their method of complaining against the examiner in them it is humble and loyal to reflect upon the queen and the ministry and parliament she has chosen with the universal applause of her people in us it is insolent to defend her majesty and her choice or to answer their objections by shewing the reasons why those changes were necessary  the same style has been used in the late case relating to some gentlemen in the army6 such a clamour was raised by a set of men who had the boldness to tax the administration with cruelty and injustice that i thought it necessary to interfere a little by shewing the ill consequences that might arise from some proceedings though without application to particular persons and what do they offer in answer nothing but a few poor commonplaces against calumny and informers which might have been full as just and seasonable in a plot against the sacred person of the queen  but by the way why are these idle people so indiscreet to name those two words which afford occasion of laying open to the world such an infamous scene of subornation and perjury as well as calumny and informing as i believe is without example when a whole cabal attempted an action wherein a condemned criminal refused to join with them for the reward of his life7 not that i disapprove their sagacity who could foretell so long before by what hand they should one day fall and therefore thought any means justifiable by which they might prevent it  but waiving this at present it must be owned in justice to the army that those violences did not proceed so far among them as some have believed nor ought the madness of a few to be laid at their doors for the rest i am so far from denying the due praises to those victorious troops who did their part in procuring so many victories for the allies that i could wish every officer and private soldier had their full share of honour in proportion to their deserts being thus far of the athenians mind who when it was proposed that the statue of miltiades should be set up alone in some public place of the city said they would agree to it whenever he conquered alone but not before neither do i at all blame the officers of the army for preferring in their hearts the late ministry before the present or if wishing alone could be of any use to wish their continuance because then they might be secure of the wars continuance too whereas since affairs have been put into other hands they may perhaps lie under some apprehensions of a peace which no army especially in a course of success was ever inclined to and which all wise states have in such a juncture chiefly endeavoured this is a point wherein the civil and military politics have always disagreed and for that reason i affirmed it necessary in all free governments that the latter should be absolutely in subjection to the former otherwise one of these two inconveniencies must arise either to be perpetually in war or to turn the civil institution into a military  i am ready to allow all that has been said of the valour and experience of our troops who have fully contributed their part to the great successes abroad nor is it their fault that those important victories had no better consequences at home though it may be their advantage war is their trade and business to improve and cultivate the advantages of success is an affair of the cabinet and the neglect of this whether proceeding from weakness or corruption according to the usual uncertainty of wars may be of the most fatal consequence to a nation for pray let me represent our condition in such a light as i believe both parties will allow though perhaps not the consequences i shall deduce from it we have been for above nine years blessed with a queen who besides all virtues that can enter into the composition of a private person possesses every regal quality that can contribute to make a people happy of great wisdom yet ready to receive the advice of her counsellors of much discernment in choosing proper instruments when she follows her own judgment and only capable of being deceived by that excess of goodness which makes her judge of others by herself frugal in her management in order to contribute to the public which in proportion she does and that voluntarily beyond any of her subjects but from her own nature generous and charitable to all that want or deserve and in order to exercise those virtues denying herself all entertainments of expense which many others enjoy then if we look abroad at least in flanders our arms have been crowned with perpetual success in battles and sieges not to mention several fortunate actions in spain these facts being thus stated which none can deny it is natural to ask how we have improved such advantages and to what account they have turned i shall use no discouraging terms when a patient grows daily worse by the tampering of mountebanks there is nothing left but to call in the best physicians before the case grows desperate but i would ask whether france or any other kingdom would have made so little use of such prodigious opportunities the fruits whereof could never have fallen to the ground without the extremist degree of folly and corruption and where those have lain let the world judge instead of aiming at peace while we had the advantage of the war which has been the perpetual maxim of all wise states it has been reckoned factious and malignant even to express our wishes for it and such a condition imposed as was never offered to any prince who had an inch of ground to dispute quae enim est conditio pacis in qua ei cum quo pacem facias nihil concedi potest8  it is not obvious to conceive what could move men who sat at home and were called to consult upon the good of the kingdom to be so utterly averse from putting an end to a long expensive war which the victorious as well as conquered side were heartily weary of few or none of them were men of the sword they had no share in the honour they had made large fortunes and were at the head of all affairs but they well knew by what tenure they held their power that the queen saw through their designs that they had entirely lost the hearts of the clergy that the landed men were against them that they were detested by the body of the people and that nothing bore them up but their credit with the bank and other stocks which would be neither formidable nor necessary when the war was at an end for these reasons they resolved to disappoint all overtures of a peace till they and their party should be so deeply rooted as to make it impossible to shake them to this end they began to precipitate matters so fast as in a little time must have ruined the constitution if the crown had not interposed and rather ventured the accidental effects of their malice than such dreadful consequences of their power and indeed had the former danger been greater than some hoped or feared i see no difficulty in the choice which was the same with his who said he had rather be devoured by wolves than by rats i therefore still insist that we cannot wonder at or find fault with the army for concurring with a ministry who was for prolonging the war the inclination is natural in them all pardonable in those who have not yet made their fortunes and as lawful in the rest as love of power or love of money can make it but as natural as pardonable and as lawful as this inclination is when it is not under check of the civil power or when a corrupt ministry joins in giving it too great a scope the consequence can be nothing less than infallible ruin and slavery to a state  after i had finished this paper the printer sent me two small pamphlets called the

thursday january 11 to thursday january 18 17102    parva momenta in spem metumque impellunt animos3  hopes are natural to most men especially to sanguine complexions and among the various changes that happen in the course of public affairs they are seldom without some grounds even in desperate cases where it is impossible they should have any foundation they are often affected to keep a countenance and make an enemy think we have some resource which they know nothing of this appears to have been for some months past the condition of those people whom i am forced for want of other phrases to called the ruined party they have taken up since their fall some real and some pretended hopes when the e of sunderland was discarded they hoped her majesty would proceed no farther in the change of her ministry and had the insolence to misrepresent her words to foreign states they hoped nobody durst advise the dissolution of the parliament when this was done and further alterations made at court they hoped and endeavoured to ruin the credit of the nation they likewise hoped that we should have some terrible loss abroad which would force us to unravel all and begin again upon their bottom but of all their hopes whether real or assumed there is none more extraordinary than that which they now would seem to place their whole confidence in that this great turn of affairs was only occasioned by a short madness of the people from which they will recover in a little time when their eyes are open and they grow cool and sober enough to consider the truth of things and how much they have been deceived it is not improbable that some few of the deepest sighted among these reasoners are well enough convinced how vain all such hopes must be but for the rest the wisest of them seem to have been very ill judges of the peoples dispositions the want of which knowledge was a principal occasion to hasten their ruin for surely had they suspected which way the popular current inclined they never would have run against it by that impeachment i therefore conclude they generally are so blind as to imagine some comfort from this fantastical opinion that the people of england are at present distracted but will shortly come to their senses again  for the service therefore of our adversaries and friends i shall briefly examine this point by shewing what are the causes and symptoms of a peoples madness and how it differs from their natural bent and inclination  it is machiavels observation that the people when left to their own judgment do seldom mistake their true interests and indeed they naturally love the constitution they are born under never desiring to change but under great oppressions however they are to be deceived by several means it has often happened in greece and sometimes in rome that those very men who have contributed to shake off a former tyranny have instead of restoring the old constitution deluded the people into a worse and more ignominious slavery besides all great changes have the same effect upon commonwealths that thunder has upon liquors making the dregs fly up to the top the lowest plebeians rise to the head of affairs and there preserve themselves by representing the nobles and other friends to the old government as enemies to the public the encouraging of new mysteries and new deities with the pretences of further purity in religion hath likewise been a frequent topic to mislead the people and not to mention more the promoting false reports of dangers from abroad hath often served to prevent them from fencing against real dangers at home by these and the like arts in conjunction with a great depravity of manners and a weak or corrupt administration the madness of the people hath risen to such a height as to break in pieces the whole frame of the best instituted governments but however such great frenzies being artificially raised are a perfect force and constraint upon human nature and under a wise steady prince will certainly decline of themselves settling like the sea after a storm and then the true bent and genius of the people will appear ancient and modern story are full of instances to illustrate what i say in our own island we had a great example of a long madness in the people kept up by a thousand artifices like intoxicating medicines till the constitution was destroyed yet the malignity being spent and the humour exhausted that served to foment it before the usurpers could fix upon a new scheme the people suddenly recovered and peaceably restored the old constitution  from what i have offered it will be easy to decide whether this late change in the dispositions of the people were a new madness or a recovery from an old one neither do i see how it can be proved that such a change had in any circumstance the least symptoms of madness whether my description of it be right or no it is agreed that the truest way of judging the dispositions of the people in the choice of their representatives is by computing the countyelections and in these it is manifest that five in six are entirely for the present measures although the court was so far from interposing its credit that there was no change in the admiralty not above one or two in the lieutenancy nor any other methods used to influence elections4 the free unextorted addresses5 sent some time before from every part of the kingdom plainly shewed what sort of bent the people had taken and from what motives the election of members for this great city6 carried contrary to all conjecture against the united interest of those two great bodies the bank and east india company was another convincing argument besides the whigs themselves have always confessed that the bulk of landed men in england was generally of tories so that this change must be allowed to be according to the natural genius and disposition of the people whether it were just and reasonable in itself or not  notwithstanding all which you shall frequently hear the partisans of the late men in power gravely and decisively pronounce that the present ministry cannot possibly stand7 now they who affirm this if they believe themselves must ground their opinion upon the iniquity of the last being so far established and deeply rooted that no endeavours of honest men will be able to restore things to their former state or else these reasoners have been so misled by twenty years mismanagement that they have forgot our constitution and talk as if our monarchy and revolution began together but the body of the people is wiser and by the choice they have made shew they do understand our constitution and would bring it back to the old form which if the new ministers take care to maintain they will and ought to stand otherwise they may fall like their predecessors but i think we may easily foresee what a parliament freely chosen without threatening or corruption is likely to do when no man shall be in any danger to lose his place by the freedom of his voice  but who are those advancers of this opinion that the present ministry cannot hold it must be either such as are afraid to be called to an account in case it should hold or those who keep offices from which others better qualified were removed and may reasonably apprehend to be turned out for worthier men to come in their places since perhaps it will be necessary to make some changes that the public business of the nation may go on or lastly stockjobbers who industriously spread such reports that actions may fall and their friends buy to advantage  yet these hopes thus freely expressed as they are more sincere so they are more supportable than when they appear under the disguise and pretence of fears some of these gentlemen are employed to shake their heads in proper companies to doubt where all this will end to be in mighty pain for the nation to shew how impossible it is that the public credit can be supported to pray that all may do well in whatever hands but very much to doubt that the pretender is at the bottom i know not any thing so nearly resembling this behaviour as what i have often seen among the friends of a sick man whose interest it is that he should die the physicians protest they see no danger the symptoms are good the medicines answer expectation yet still they are not to be comforted they whisper he is a gone man it is not possible he should hold out he has perfect death in his face they never liked this doctor at last the patient recovers and their joy is as false as their grief  i believe there is no man so sanguine who did not apprehend some ill consequences from the late change though not in any proportion to the good ones but it is manifest the former have proved much fewer and lighter than were expected either at home or abroad by the fears of our friends or the hopes of our enemies those remedies that stir the humours in a diseased body are at first more painful than the malady itself yet certain death is the consequence of deferring them too long actions have fallen and the loans are said to come in slowly but beside that something of this must have been whether there had been any change or no beside that the surprise of every change for the better as well as the worse is apt to affect credit for a while there is a further reason which is plain and scandalous when the late party was at the helm those who were called the tories never put their resentments in balance with the safety of the nation but cheerfully contributed to the common cause now the scene is changed the fallen party seems to act from very different motives they have given the word about they will keep their money and be passive and in this point stand upon the same foot with papists and nonjurors what would have become of the public if the present great majority had acted thus during the late administration had acted thus before the others were masters of that wealth they have squeezed out of the landed men and with the strength of that would now hold the kingdom at defiance  thus much i have thought fit to say without pointing reflections upon any particular person which i have hitherto but sparingly done and that only towards those whose characters are too profligate that the managing of them should be of any consequence besides as it is a talent i am not naturally fond of so in the subjects i treat it is generally needless if i display the effects of avarice and ambition of bribery and corruption of gross immorality and irreligion those who are the least conversant in things will easily know where to apply them not that i lay any weight upon the objections of such who charge me with this proceeding it is notorious enough that the writers of the other side were the first aggressors not to mention their scurrilous libels many years ago directly levelled at particular persons how many papers do now come out every week full of rude invectives against the present ministry with the first and last letters of their names to prevent mistakes it is good sometimes to let these people see that we neither want spirit nor materials to retaliate and therefore in this point alone i shall follow their example whenever i find myself sufficiently provoked only with one addition that whatever charges i bring either general or particular shall be religiously true either upon avowed facts which none can deny or such as i can prove from my own knowledge  being resolved publicly to acknowledge any mistakes i have been guilty of i do here humbly desire the readers pardon for one of mighty importance about a fact in one of my papers said to be done in the cathedral of gloucester8 a whole hydra of errors in two words for as i am since informed it was neither in the cathedral nor city nor county of gloucester but some other church of that diocese if i had ever met any other objection of equal weight though from the meanest hands i should certainly have answered it   footnote 1

i observed a knot of discontented gentlemen cursing the tories to hell for their uncharitableness in affirming that if the late ministry had continued to this time we should have had neither church nor monarchy left they are usually so candid as to call that the opinion of a party which they hear in a coffeehouse or over a bottle from some warm young people whom it is odds but they have provoked to say more than they believed by some positions as absurd and ridiculous of their own and so it proved in this very instance for asking one of these gentlemen what it was that provoked those he had been disputing with to advance such a paradox he assured me in a very calm manner it was nothing in the world but that himself and some others of the company had made it appear that the design of the present parliament and ministry was to bring in popery arbitrary power and the pretender which i take to be an opinion fifty times more improbable as well as more uncharitable than what is charged upon the whigs because i defy our adversaries to produce one single reason for suspecting such designs in the persons now at the helm whereas i can upon demand produce twenty to shew that some late men had strong views towards a commonwealth and the alteration of the church  it is natural indeed when a storm is over that has only untiled our houses and blown down some of our chimneys to consider what further mischiefs might have ensued if it had lasted longer however in the present case i am not of the opinion abovementioned i believe the church and state might have lasted somewhat longer though the late enemies to both had done their worst i can hardly conceive how things would have been so soon ripe for a new revolution i am convinced that if they had offered to make such large and sudden strides it must have come to blows and according to the computation we have now reason to think a right one i can partly guess what would have been the issue besides we are sure the queen would have interposed before they came to extremities and as little as they regarded the regal authority would have been a check in their career  but instead of this question what would have been the consequence if the late ministry had continued i will propose another which will be more useful for us to consider and that is what we may reasonably expect they will do if ever they come into power again this we know is the design and endeavour of all those scribbles that daily fly about in their favour of all the false insolent and scandalous libels against the present administration and of all those engines set at work to sink the actions and blow up the public credit as for those who shew their inclinations by writing there is one consideration which i wonder does not sometimes affect them for how can they forbear having a good opinion of the gentleness and innocence of those who permit them to employ their pens as they do it puts me in mind of an insolent pragmatical orator somewhere in greece who railing with great freedom at the chief men in the state was answered by one who had been very instrumental in recovering the liberty of the city that he thanked the gods they had now arrived to the condition he always wished them when every man in that city might securely say what they pleased i wish these gentlemen would however compare the liberty they take with what their masters used to give how many messengers and warrants would have gone out against any that durst have opened their lips or drawn their pens against the persons and proceedings of their juntoes and cabals how would their weekly writers have been calling out for prosecution and punishment we remember when a poor nickname3 borrowed from an old play of ben jonson and mentioned in a sermon without any particular application was made use of as a motive to spur an impeachment but after all it must be confessed they had reasons to be thus severe which their successors have not their faults would never endure the light and to have exposed them sooner would have raised the kingdom against the actors before the time  but to come to the subject i have now undertaken which is to examine what the consequences would be upon supposition that the whigs were now restored to their power i already imagine the present free parliament dissolved and another of a different epithet met by the force of money and management i read immediately a dozen or two stinging votes against the proceedings of the late ministry the bill now to be repealed would then be reenacted and the birthright of an englishman reduced again to the value of twelvepence4 but to give the reader a stronger imagination of such a scene let me represent the designs of some men lately endeavoured and projected in the form of a paper of votes  ordered that a bill be brought in for repealing the sacramental test  a petition of tindal collins clendon coward toland5 in behalf of themselves and many hundreds of their disciples some of which are members of this honourable house desiring that leave be given to bring in a bill for qualifying atheists deists and socinians to serve their country in any employment  ordered that leave be given to bring in a bill according to the prayer of the said petition and that mr lechmere6 do prepare and bring it in  ordered that a bill be brought in for removing the education of youth out of the hands of the clergy  another to forbid the clergy preaching certain duties in religion especially obedience to princes  another to take away the jurisdiction of bishops  another for constituting a general for life with instructions to the committee that care may be taken to make the war last as long as the life of the said general  a bill of attainder against charles duke of shrewsbury john duke of buckingham laurence earl of rochester sir simon harcourt knight robert harley henry st john7 esqs abigail masham spinster8 and others for high treason against the junto  resolved that sarah duchess of marlborough hath been a most dutiful just and grateful servant to her majesty  resolved that to advise the dissolution of a whig parliament or the removal of a whig ministry was in order to bring in popery and the pretender and that the said advice was high treason  resolved that by the original compact the government of this realm is by a junto and a king or queen but the administration solely in the junto  ordered that a bill be brought in for further limiting the prerogative  ordered that it be a standing order of this house that the merit of elections be not determined by the number of voices or right of electors but by weight and that one whig shall weigh down ten tories  a motion being made and the question being put that when a whig is detected of manifest bribery and his competitor being a tory has ten to one a majority there shall be a new election it passed in the negative  resolved that for a king or queen of this realm to read or examine a paper brought them to be signed by a junto minister is arbitrary and illegal and a violation of the liberties of the people                                       these and the like reformations would in all probability be the first fruits of the whigs resurrection and what structures such able artists might in a short time build upon such foundations i leave others to conjecture all hopes of a peace cut off the nation industriously involved in further debts to a degree that none would dare undertake the management of affairs but those whose interest lay in ruining the constitution i do not see how the wisest prince under such necessities could be able to extricate himself then as to the church the bishops would by degrees be dismissed first from the parliament next from their revenues and at last from their office and the clergy instead of their idle claim of independency on the state would be forced to depend for their daily bread on every individual but what system of future government was designed whether it were already digested or would have been left for time and incidents to mature i shall not now examine only upon this occasion i cannot help reflecting on a fact which it is probable the reader knows as well as myself there was a picture drawn some time ago representing five persons as large as the life sitting at council together like a pentarchy a void space was left for a sixth which was to have been the queen to whom they intended that honour but her majesty having since fallen under their displeasure they have made a shift to crowd in two better friends in her place which makes it a complete heptarchy9 this piece is now in the country reserved till better times and hangs in a hall among the pictures of cromwell bradshaw ireton and some other predecessors  i must now desire leave to say something to a gentleman who has been pleased to publish a discourse against a paper of mine relating to the convocation10 he promises to set me right without any undue reflections or undecent language i suppose he means in comparison with others who pretend to answer the examiner so far he is right but if he thinks he has behaved himself as becomes a candid antagonist i believe he is mistaken he says in his titlepage my representations are unfair and my reflections unjust and his conclusion is yet more severe11 where he doubts i and my friends are enraged against the dutch because they preserved us from popery and arbitrary power at the revolution and since that time from being overrun by the exorbitant power of france and becoming a prey to the pretender because this author seems in general to write with an honest meaning i would seriously put to him the question whether he thinks i and my friends are for popery arbitrary power france and the pretender i omit other instances of smaller moment which however do not suit in my opinion with due reflection or decent language the fact relating to the convocation came from a good hand and i do not find this author differs from me in any material circumstance about it my reflections were no more than what might be obvious to any other gentleman who had heard of their late proceedings if the notion be right which this author gives us of a lower house of convocation it is a very melancholy one12 and to me seems utterly inconsistent with that of a body of men whom he owns to have a negative and therefore since a great majority of the clergy differs from him in several points he advances i shall rather choose to be of their opinion than his i fancy when the whole synod met in one house as this writer affirms they were upon a better foot with their bishops and therefore whether this treatment so extremely de haut en bas since their exclusion be suitable to primitive custom or primitive humility towards brethren is not my business to enquire one may allow the divine or apostolic right of episcopacy and their great superiority over presbyters and yet dispute the methods of exercising the latter which being of human institution are subject to encroachments and usurpations i know every clergyman in a diocese has a good deal of dependence upon his bishop and owes him canonical obedience but i was apt to think when the whole representative of the clergy met in a synod they were considered in another light at least since they are allowed to have a negative if i am mistaken i desire to be excused as talking out of my trade only there is one thing wherein i entirely differ from this author since in the disputes about privileges one side must recede where so very few privileges remain it is a hundred to one odds the encroachments are not on the inferior clergys side and no man can blame them for insisting on the small number that is left there is one fact wherein i must take occasion to set this author right that the person who first moved the queen to remit the firstfruits and tenths to the clergy was an eminent instrument in the late turn of affairs13 and as i am told has lately prevailed to have the same favour granted for the clergy of ireland14  but i must beg leave to inform the author that this paper is not intended for the management of controversy which would be of very little import to most readers and only misspend time that i would gladly employ to better purposes for where it is a mans business to entertain a whole roomfull it is unmannerly to apply himself to a particular person and turn his back upon the rest of the company   footnote 1 no 25 in the reprint ts  footnote 2 they met

25 to thursday february 1 1710112  ea autem est gloria laus recte factorum magnorumque in rempublicam meritorum quae cum optimi cujusque tum etiam multitudinis testimonio comprobatur3  i am thinking what a mighty advantage it is to be entertained as a writer to a ruined cause i remember a fanatic preacher who was inclined to come into the church and take orders but upon mature thoughts was diverted from that design when he considered that the collections of the godly were a much heartier and readier penny than he could get by wrangling for tithes he certainly had reason and the two cases are parallel if you write in defence of a fallen party you are maintained by contribution as a necessary person you have little more to do than to carp and cavil at those who hold the pen on the other side you are sure to be celebrated and caressed by all your party to a man you may affirm and deny what you please without truth or probability since it is but loss of time to contradict you besides commiseration is often on your side and you have a pretence to be thought honest and disinterested for adhering to friends in distress after which if your party ever happens to turn up again you have a strong fund of merit towards making your fortune then you never fail to be well furnished with materials every one bringing in his quota and falsehood being naturally more plentiful than truth not to mention the wonderful delight of libelling men in power and hugging yourself in a corner with mighty satisfaction for what you have done  it is quite otherwise with us who engage as volunteers in the service of a flourishing ministry in full credit with the queen and beloved by the people because they have no sinister ends or dangerous designs but pursue with steadiness and resolution the true interests of both upon which account they little want or desire our assistance and we may write till the world is weary of reading without having our pretences allowed either to a place or a pension besides we are refused the common benefit of the party to have our works cried up of course the readers of our own side being as ungentle and hard to please as if we writ against them and our papers never make their way in the world but barely in proportion to their merit the design of their labours who write on the conquered side is likewise of greater importance than ours they are like cordials for dying men which must be repeated whereas ours are in the scripture phrase but meat for babes at least all i can pretend is to undeceive the ignorant and those at distance but their task is to keep up the sinking spirits of a whole party  after such reflections i cannot be angry with those gentlemen for perpetually writing against me it furnishes them largely with topics and is besides their proper business neither is it affectation or altogether scorn that i do not reply but as things are we both act suitable to our several provinces mine is by laying open some corruptions in the late management to set those who are ignorant right in their opinions of persons and things it is theirs to cover with figleaves all the faults of their friends as well as they can when i have produced my facts and offered my arguments i have nothing farther to advance it is their office to deny and disprove and then let the world decide if i were as they my chief endeavour should certainly be to batter down the examiner therefore i cannot but approve their design besides they have indeed another reason for barking incessantly at this paper they have in their prints openly taxed a most ingenious person as author of it4 one who is in great and very deserved reputation with the world both on account of his poetical works and his talents for public business they were wise enough to consider what a sanction it would give their performances to fall under the animadversion of such a pen and have therefore used all the forms of provocation commonly practised by little obscure pedants who are fond of distinguishing themselves by the fame of an adversary so nice a taste have these judicious critics in pretending to discover an author by his style and manner of thinking not to mention the justice and candour of exhausting all the stale topics of scurrility in reviling a paper and then flinging at a venture the whole load upon one who is entirely innocent and whose greatest fault perhaps is too much gentleness toward a party from whose leaders he has received quite contrary treatment  the concern i have for the ease and reputation of so deserving a gentleman hath at length forced me much against my interest and inclination to let these angry people know who is not the author of the examiner5 for i observed the opinion began to spread and i chose rather to sacrifice the honour i received by it than let injudicious people entitle him to a performance that perhaps he might have reason to be ashamed of still faithfully promising never to disturb those worthy advocates but suffer them in quiet to roar on at the examiner if they or their party find any ease in it as physicians say there is to people in torment such as men in the gout or women in labour  however i must acknowledge myself indebted to them for one hint which i shall now pursue though in a different manner since the fall of the late ministry i have seen many papers filled with their encomiums i conceive in imitation of those who write the lives of famous men where after their deaths immediately follow their characters when i saw the poor virtues thus dealt at random i thought the disposers had flung their names like valentines into a hat to be drawn as fortune pleased by the junto and their friends there crassus6 drew liberty and gratitude fulvia7 humility and gentleness clodius8 piety and justice gracchus9 loyalty to his prince cinna10 love of his country and constitution and so of the rest or to quit this allegory i have often seen of late the whole set of discarded statesmen celebrated by their judicious hirelings for those very qualities which their admirers owned they chiefly wanted did these heroes put off and lock up their virtues when they came into employment and have they now resumed them since their dismissions if they wore them i am sure it was under their greatness and without ever once convincing the world of their visibility or influence  but why should not the present ministry find a pen to praise them as well as the last this is what i shall now undertake and it may be more impartial in me from whom they have deserved so little i have without being called served them half a year in quality of champion11 and by help of the queen and a majority of nine in ten of the kingdom have been able to protect them against a routed cabal of hated politicians with a dozen of scribblers at their head yet so far have they been from rewarding me suitable to my deserts that to this day they never so much as sent to the printer to enquire who i was though i have known a time and a ministry where a person of half my merit and consideration would have had fifty promises and in the mean time a pension settled on him whereof the first quarter should be honestly paid therefore my resentments shall so far prevail that in praising those who are now at the head of affairs i shall at the same time take notice of their defects  was any man more eminent in his profession than the present lord keeper12 or more distinguished by his eloquence and great abilities in the house of commons and will not his enemies allow him to be fully equal to the great station he now adorns but then it must be granted that he is wholly ignorant in the speculative as well as practical part of polygamy he knows not how to metamorphose a sober man into a lunatic13 he is no freethinker in religion nor has courage to be patron of an atheistical book14 while he is guardian of the queens conscience though after all to speak my private opinion i cannot think these such mighty objections to his character as some would pretend  the person who now presides at the council15 is descended from a great and honourable father not from the dregs of the people he was at the head of the treasury for some years and rather chose to enrich his prince than himself in the height of favour and credit he sacrificed the greatest employment in the kingdom to his conscience and honour he has been always firm in his loyalty and religion zealous for supporting the prerogative of the crown and preserving the liberties of the people but then his best friends must own that he is neither deist nor socinian he has never conversed with toland to open and enlarge his thoughts and dispel the prejudices of education nor was he ever able to arrive at that perfection of gallantry to ruin and imprison the husband in order to keep the wife without disturbance16  the present lord steward17 has been always distinguished for his wit and knowledge is of consummate wisdom and experience in affairs has continued constant to the true interest of the nation which he espoused from the beginning and is every way qualified to support the dignity of his office but in point of oratory must give place to his predecessor18  the d of shrewsbury19 was highly instrumental in bringing about the revolution in which service he freely exposed his life and fortune he has ever been the favourite of the nation being possessed of all the amiable qualities that can accomplish a great man but in the agreeableness and fragrancy of his person and the profoundness of his politics must be allowed to fall very short of 20  mr harley had the honour of being chosen speaker successively to three parliaments21 he was the first of late years that ventured to restore the forgotten custom of treating his prince with duty and respect easy and disengaged in private conversation with such a weight of affairs upon his shoulders22 of great learning and as great a favourer and protector of it intrepid by nature as well as by the consciousness of his own integrity and a despiser of money pursuing the true interest of his prince and country against all obstacles sagacious to view into the remotest consequences of things by which all difficulties fly before him a firm friend and a placable enemy sacrificing his justest resentments not only to public good but to common intercession and acknowledgment yet with all these virtues it must be granted there is some mixture of human infirmity his greatest admirers must confess his skill at cards and dice to be very low and superficial in horseracing he is utterly ignorant23 then to save a few millions to the public he never regards how many worthy citizens he hinders from making up their plum and surely there is one thing never to be forgiven him that he delights to have his table filled with black coats whom he uses as if they were gentlemen  my lord dartmouth24 is a man of letters full of good sense good nature and honour of strict virtue and regularity in life but labours under one great defect that he treats his clerks with more civility and good manners than others in his station have done the queen25  omitting some others i will close this character of the present ministry with that of mr st john26 who from his youth applying those admirable talents of nature and improvements of art to public business grew eminent in court and parliament at an age when the generality of mankind is employed in trifles and folly it is to be lamented that he has not yet procured himself a busy important countenance nor learned that profound part of wisdom to be difficult of access besides he has clearly mistaken the true use of books which he has thumbed and spoiled with reading when he ought to have multiplied them on his shelves27 not like a great man of my acquaintance who knew a book by the back better than a friend by the face though he had never conversed with the former and

171011  caput est in omni procuratione negotii et muneris publici ut avaritiae pellatur etiam minima suspicio2   there is no vice which mankind carries to such wild extremes as that of avarice those two which seem to rival it in this point are lust and ambition but the former is checked by difficulties and diseases destroys itself by its own pursuits and usually declines with old age and the latter requiring courage conduct and fortune in a high degree and meeting with a thousand dangers and oppositions succeeds too seldom in an age to fall under common observation or is avarice perhaps the same passion with ambition only placed in more ignoble and dastardly minds by which the object is changed from power to money or it may be that one man pursues power in order to wealth and another wealth in order to power which last is the safer way though longer about and suiting with every period as well as condition of life is more generally followed  however it be the extremes of this passion are certainly more frequent than of any other and often to a degree so absurd and ridiculous that if it were not for their frequency they could hardly obtain belief the stage which carries other follies and vices beyond nature and probability falls very short in the representations of avarice nor are there any extravagances in this kind described by ancient or modern comedies which are not outdone by an hundred instances commonly told among ourselves  i am ready to conclude from hence that a vice which keeps so firm a hold upon human nature and governs it with so unlimited a tyranny since it cannot be wholly eradicated ought at least to be confined to particular objects to thrift and penury to private fraud and extortion and never suffered to prey upon the public and should certainly be rejected as the most unqualifying circumstance for any employment where bribery and corruption can possibly enter  if the mischiefs of this vice in a public station were confined to enriching only those particular persons employed the evil would be more supportable but it is usually quite otherwise when a steward defrauds his lord he must connive at the rest of the servants while they are following the same practice in their several spheres so that in some families you may observe a subordination of knaves in a link downwards to the very helper in the stables all cheating by concert and with impunity and even if this were all perhaps the master could bear it without being undone but it so happens that for every shilling the servant gets by his iniquity the master loses twenty the perquisites of servants being but small compositions for suffering shopkeepers to bring in what bills they please3 it is exactly the same thing in a state an avaricious man in office is in confederacy with the whole clan of his district or dependence which in modern terms of art is called to live and let live and yet their gains are the smallest part of the publics loss give a guinea to a knavish landwaiter and he shall connive at the merchant for cheating the queen of an hundred a brewer gives a bribe to have the privilege of selling drink to the navy but the fraud is ten times greater than the bribe and the public is at the whole loss4  moralists make two kinds of avarice that of catiline alieni appetens sui profusus5 and the other more generally understood by that name which is the endless desire of hoarding but i take the former to be more dangerous in a state because it mingles well with ambition which i think the latter cannot for though the same breast may be capable of admitting both it is not able to cultivate them and where the love of heaping wealth prevails there is not in my opinion much to be apprehended from ambition the disgrace of that sordid vice is sooner apt to spread than any other and is always attended with the hatred and scorn of the people so that whenever those two passions happen to meet in the same subject it is not unlikely that providence hath placed avarice to be a check upon ambition and i have reason to think some great ministers of state have been of my opinion  the divine authority of holy writ the precepts of philosophers the lashes and ridicule of satirical poets have been all employed in exploding this insatiable thirst of money and all equally controlled by the daily practice of mankind nothing new remains to be said upon the occasion and if there did i must remember my character that i am an examiner only and not a reformer  however in those cases where the frailties of particular men do nearly affect the public welfare such as a prime minister of state or a great general of an army methinks there should be some expedient contrived to let them know impartially what is the worlds opinion in the point encompassed with a crowd of depending flatterers they are many degrees blinder to their own faults than the common infirmities of human nature can plead in their excuse advice dares not be offered or is wholly lost or returned with hatred and whatever appears in public against their prevailing vice goes for nothing being either not applied or passing only for libel and slander proceeding from the malice and envy of a party  i have sometimes thought that if i had lived at rome in the time of the first triumvirate i should have been tempted to write a letter as from an unknown hand to those three great men who had then usurped the sovereign power wherein i would freely and sincerely tell each of them that fault which i conceived was most odious and of most consequence to the commonwealth that to crassus should have been sent to him after his conquests in mesopotamia and in the following terms6  to marcus crassus health  if you apply as you ought what i now write7 you will be more obliged to me than to all the world hardly excepting your parents or your country i intend to tell you without disguise or prejudice the opinion which the world has entertained of you and to let you see i write this without any sort of ill will you shall first hear the sentiments they have to your advantage no man disputes the gracefulness of your person you are allowed to have a good and clear understanding cultivated by the knowledge of men and manners though not by literature you are no ill orator in the senate you are said to excel in the art of bridling and subduing your anger and stifling or concealing your resentments you have been a most successful general of long experience great conduct and much personal courage you have gained many important victories for the commonwealth and forced the strongest towns in mesopotamia to surrender for which frequent supplications have been decreed by the senate yet with all these qualities and this merit give me leave to say you are neither beloved by the patricians or plebeians at home nor by the officers or private soldiers of your own army abroad and do you know crassus that this is owing to a fault of which you may cure yourself by one minutes reflection what shall i say you are the richest person in the commonwealth you have no male child your daughters are all married to wealthy patricians you are far in the decline of life and yet you are deeply stained with that odious and ignoble vice of covetousness8 it is affirmed that you descend even to the meanest and most scandalous degrees of it and while you possess so many millions while you are daily acquiring so many more you are solicitous how to save a single sesterce of which a hundred ignominious instances are produced and in all mens mouths i will only mention that passage of the buskins9 which after abundance of persuasion you would hardly suffer to be cut from your legs when they were so wet and cold that to have kept them on would have endangered your life  instead of using the common arguments to dissuade you from this weakness i will endeavour to convince you that you are really guilty of it and leave the cure to your own good sense for perhaps you are not yet persuaded that this is your crime you have probably never yet been reproached for it to your face and what you are now told comes from one unknown and it may be from an enemy you will allow yourself indeed to be prudent in the management of your fortune you are not a prodigal like clodius10 or catiline but surely that deserves not the name of avarice i will inform you how to be convinced disguise your person go among the common people in rome introduce discourses about yourself inquire your own character do the same in your camp walk about it in the evening hearken at every tent and if you do not hear every mouth censuring lamenting cursing this vice in you and even you for this vice conclude yourself innocent if you are not yet persuaded send for atticus11 servius sulpicius cato or brutus they are all your friends conjure them to tell you ingenuously which is your great fault and which they would chiefly wish you to correct if they do not all agree in their verdict in the name of all the gods you are acquitted  when your adversaries reflect how far you are gone in this vice they are tempted to talk as if we owed our success not to your courage or conduct but to those veteran troops you command who are able to conquer under any general with so many brave and experienced officers to lead them besides we know the consequences your avarice hath often occasioned the soldier hath been starving for bread surrounded with plenty and in an enemys country but all under safeguards and contributions which if you had sometimes pleased to have exchanged for provisions might at the expense of a few talents in a campaign have so endeared you to the army that they would have desired you to lead them to the utmost limits of asia but you rather chose to confine your conquests within the fruitful country of mesopotamia where plenty of money might be raised how far that fatal greediness of gold may have influenced you in breaking off the treaty12 with the old parthian king orodes13 you best can tell your enemies charge you with it your friends offer nothing material in your defence and all agree there is nothing so pernicious which the extremes of avarice may not be able to inspire  the moment you quit this vice you will be a truly great man and still there will imperfections enough remain to convince us you are not a god farewell  perhaps a letter of this nature sent to so reasonable a man as crassus might have put him upon examining into himself and correcting that little sordid appetite so utterly inconsistent with all pretences to a hero a youth in the heat of blood may plead with some shew of reason that he is not able to subdue his lusts an ambitious man may use the same arguments for his love of power or perhaps other arguments to justify it but excess of avarice hath neither of these pleas to offer it is not to be justified and cannot pretend temptation for excuse whence can the temptation come reason disclaims it altogether and it cannot be said to lodge in the blood or the animal spirits so that i conclude no man of true valour and true understanding upon whom this vice has stolen unawares when he is convinced he is guilty will suffer it to remain in his breast an hour  footnote 1 no 27 in the reprint ts  footnote 2 it is of the greatest importance in the discharge of every office of trade or of the public treasury that the least suspicion of avarice should be avoided ts  footnote 3 the commissioners for examining the public accounts reported to the house of

this report was contained the deposition of sir solomon medina charging the duke of marlborough and adam cardonell his secretary of various peculations with regard to the contracts for bread and breadwagons for the army in flanders the duke admitted the fact in a letter to the queen dated november 10th 1711 but said that the whole sum had been constantly employed for the service of the public

171011  inultus ut tu riseris cotyttia2  an answer to the letter to the examiner3   london feb 15 171011  sir  though i have wanted leisure to acknowledge the honour of a letter you were pleased to write to me about six months ago yet i have been very careful in obeying some of your commands and am going on as fast as i can with the rest i wish you had thought fit to have conveyed them to me by a more private hand than that of the printinghouse for though i was pleased with a pattern of style and spirit which i proposed to imitate yet i was sorry the world should be a witness how far i fell short in both  i am afraid you did not consider what an abundance of work you have cut out for me neither am i at all comforted by the promise you are so kind to make that when i have performed my task4 dolben shall blush in his grave among the dead walpole among the living and even volpone shall feel some remorse how the gentleman in his grave may have kept his countenance i cannot inform you having no acquaintance at all with the sexton but for the other two i take leave to assure you there have not yet appeared the least signs of blushing or remorse in either though some very good opportunities have offered if they had thought fit to accept them so that with your permission i had rather engage to continue this work till they are in their graves too which i am sure will happen much sooner than the other  you desire i would collect some of those indignities offered last year to her majesty i am ready to oblige you and have got a pretty tolerable collection by me which i am in doubt whether to publish by itself in a large volume in folio or scatter them here and there occasionally in my papers though indeed i am sometimes thinking to stifle them altogether because such a history will be apt to give foreigners a monstrous opinion of our country but since it is your absolute opinion the world should be informed i will with the first occasion pick out a few choice instances and let them take their chance in the ensuing papers i have likewise in my cabinet certain quires of paper filled with facts of corruption mismanagement cowardice treachery avarice ambition and the like with an alphabetical table to save trouble and perhaps you will not wonder at the care i take to be so well provided when you consider the vast expense i am at i feed weekly two or three witstarved writers who have no other visible support besides several others that live upon my offals in short i am like a nurse who suckles twins at one time and has likewise one or two whelps constantly to draw her breasts  i must needs confess and it is with grief i speak it that i have been the innocent cause of a great circulation of dullness at the same time i have often wondered how it has come to pass that these industrious people after poring so constantly upon the examiner5 a paper writ with plain sense and in a tolerable style have made so little improvement i am sure it would have fallen out quite otherwise with me for by what i have seen of their performances and i am credibly informed they are all of a piece if i had perused them till now i should have been fit for little but to make an advocate in the same cause  you sir perhaps will wonder as most others do what end these angry folks propose in writing perpetually against the examiner it is not to beget a better opinion of the late ministry or with any hope to convince the world that i am in the wrong in any one fact i relate they know all that to be lost labour and yet their design is important enough they would fain provoke me by all sort of methods within the length of their capacity to answer their papers which would render mine wholly useless to the public for if it once came to rejoinder and reply we should be all upon a level and then their work would be done  there is one gentleman indeed who has written three small pamphlets upon the management of the war and the treaty of peace6 these i had intended to have bestowed a paper in examining and could easily have made it appear that whatever he says of truth relates nothing at all to the evils we complain of or controls one syllable of what i have ever advanced nobody that i know of did ever dispute the duke of marlboroughs courage conduct or success they have been always unquestionable and will continue to be so in spite of the malice of his enemies or which is yet more the weakness of his advocates the nation only wished to see him taken out of ill hands and put into better but what is all this to the conduct of the late ministry the shameful mismanagements in spain or the wrong steps in the treaty of peace the secret of which will not bear the light and is consequently by this author very poorly defended these and many other things i would have shewn but upon second thoughts determined to have done it in a discourse by itself7 rather than take up room here and break into the design of this paper from whence i have resolved to banish controversy as much as possible but the postscript to his third pamphlet was enough to disgust me from having any dealings at all with such a writer unless that part was left to some footman8 he had picked up among the boys who follow the camp whose character it would suit much better than that of the supposed author9 at least the foul language the idle impotent menace and the gross perverting of an innocent expression in the 4th examiner10 joined to that respect i shall ever have for the function of a divine would incline me to believe so but when he turns off his footman and disclaims that postscript i will tear it out and see how far the rest deserves to be considered  but sir i labour under a much greater difficulty upon which i should be glad to hear your advice i am worried on one side by the whigs for being too severe and by the tories on the other for being too gentle i have formerly hinted a complaint of this but having lately received two peculiar letters among many others i thought nothing could better represent my condition or the opinion which the warm men of both sides have of my conduct than to send you a transcript of each the former is exactly in these words  to the examiner  mr examiner  by your continual reflecting upon the conduct of the late ministry and by your encomiums on the present it is as clear as the sun at noon day that your are a jesuit or nonjuror employed by the friends of the pretender to endeavour to introduce popery and slavery and arbitrary power and to infringe the sacred act of toleration of dissenters now sir since the most ingenious authors who write weekly against you are not able to teach you better manners i would have you to know that those great and excellent men as low as you think them at present do not want friends that will take the first proper occasion to cut your throat as all such enemies to moderation ought to be served it is well you have cleared another person11 from being author of your cursed libels though dmme perhaps after all that may be a bamboozle too however i hope we shall soon ferret you out therefore i advise you as a friend to let fall your pen and retire betimes for our patience is now at an end it is enough to lose our power and employments without setting the whole nation against us consider three years is the life of a party and dmme every dog has his day and it will be our turn next therefore take warning and learn to sleep in a whole skin or whenever we are uppermost by gd you shall find no mercy  the other letter was in the following terms  to the examiner  sir  i am a country member and constantly send a dozen of your papers down to my electors i have read them all but i confess not with the satisfaction i expected it is plain you know a great deal more than you write why will you not let us have it all out we are told that the queen has been a long time treated with insolence by those she has most obliged pray sir let us have a few good stories upon that head we have been cheated of several millions why will you not set a mark on the knaves who are guilty and shew us what ways they took to rob the public at such a rate inform us how we came to be disappointed of peace about two years ago in short turn the whole mystery of iniquity insideout that every body may have a view of it but above all explain to us what was at the bottom of that same impeachment i am sure i never liked it for at that very time a dissenting preacher in our neighbourhood came often to see our parson it could be for no good for he would walk about the barns and stables and desire to look into the church as who should say these will shortly be mine and we all believed he was then contriving some alterations against he got into possession and i shall never forget that a whig justice offered me then very high for my bishops lease i must be so bold to tell you sir that you are too favourable i am sure there was no living in quiet for us while they were in the saddle i was turned out of the commission and called a jacobite though it cost me a thousand pound in joining with the prince of orange at the revolution the discoveries i would have you make are of some facts for which they ought to be hanged not that i value their heads but i would see them exposed which may be done upon the owners shoulders as well as upon a pole c   these sir are the sentiments of a whole party on one side and of considerable numbers on the other however taking the medium between these extremes i think to go on as i have hitherto done though i am sensible my paper would be more popular if i did not lean too much to the favourable side for nothing delights the people more than to see their oppressors humbled and all their actions painted with proper colours set out in open view exactos tyrannos densum humeris bibit aure vulgus12  but as for the whigs i am in some doubt whether this mighty concern they shew for the honour of the late ministry may not be affected at least whether their masters will thank them for their zeal in such a cause it is i think a known story of a gentleman who fought another for calling him son of a whore but the lady desired her son to make no more quarrels upon that subject because it was true for pray sir does it not look like a jest that such a pernicious crew after draining our wealth and discovering the most destructive designs against our church and state instead of thanking fortune that they are got off safe in their persons and plunder should hire these bullies of the pen to defend their reputations i remember i thought it the hardest case in the world when a poor acquaintance of mine having fallen among sharpers where he lost all his money and then complaining he was cheated got a good beating into the bargain for offering to affront gentlemen i believe the only reason why these purloiners of the public cause such a clutter to be made about their reputations is to prevent inquisitions that might tend towards making them refund like those women they call shoplifters who when they are challenged for their thefts appear to be mighty angry and affronted for fear of being searched  i will dismiss you sir when i have taken notice of one particular perhaps you may have observed in the tolerated factious papers of the week that the earl of rochester13 is frequently reflected on for having been ecclesiastical commissioner and lord treasurer in the reign of the late king james the fact is true and it will not be denied to his immortal honour that because he could not comply with the measures then taking he resigned both those employments of which the latter was immediately supplied by a commission composed of two popish lords and the present earl of godolphin14   footnote 1 no 28

eminently distinguished himself by since he set up for a political writer tis true abel is the more modest of the two and it never entered into his head to say as my friend does of his paper tis writ with plain sense and in a tolerable style in no 23 march 5th he says there is indeed a great resemblance between his brother abel and himself and i find a great dispute among the party to which of them to give the preference they are both news writers as they utter things which no body ever heard of but from their papers  abel roper conducted the tory paper called the post boy see note on p 290

in 1709 considerd in a third letter to a torymember part the first dated december 22nd 1710 the fourth letter was dated january 10th 171011 ts  footnote 7 it may be that swifts intention was carried out in two pamphlets one entitled an examination of the management of the war in a letter to my lord    published march 3rd 17101 and the other styled an examination of the third and fourth letters to a tory member relating to the negociations for a treaty of peace in 1709 in a second letter to my lord    with a postscript to the medleys footman published march 15th of the same year ts  footnote 8 the postscript to an examination of the third and fourth letters mentions a pamphlet an answer to the examination of the management of the war by the medleys footman the medley no 21 february 19th remarks he could also prove there were wrong steps in the treaty of peace the allies would have all but he wont do it because he is treated like a footman ts  footnote 9 i e dr francis hare ts  footnote 10 dr hare in the postscript to his third pamphlet said the examiner is extremely mistaken if he thinks i shall enter the lists with so prostitute a writer who can neither speak truth nor knows when he hears it he calls the writer a mercenary scribbler and speaks of his paper as weekly libels he then quotes an expression from the fourth number published before swift undertook the examiner and concludes by saying that he had met more than his   match in the ingenious writer of the medley even were he much abler than he is  the fourth examiner had printed a letter from the country in which the following passage occurs can any wise people think it possible that the crown should be so mad as to choose ministers who would not support public credit  this is such a wildness as is never  to be met with in the roman story except in a devouring sejanus at home or an ambitious catiline at the head of a mercenary army  the writer of an examination of the third and fourth

abundantiam fortunae2  i am conscious to myself that i write this paper with no other intention but that of doing good i never received injury from the late ministry nor advantage from the present further than in common with every good subject there were among the former one or two who must be allowed to have possessed very valuable qualities but proceeding by a system of politics which our constitution could not suffer and discovering a contempt of all religion but especially of that which hath been so happily established among us ever since the reformation they seem to have been justly suspected of no very good inclinations to either  it is possible that a man may speculatively prefer the constitution of another country or an utopia of his own before that of the nation where he is born and lives yet from considering the dangers of innovation the corruptions of mankind and the frequent impossibility of reducing ideas to practice he may join heartily in preserving the present order of things and be a true friend to the government already settled so in religion a man may perhaps have little or none of it at heart yet if he conceals his opinions if he endeavours to make no proselytes advances no impious tenets in writing or discourse if according to the common atheistical notion he believes religion to be only a contrivance of politicians for keeping the vulgar in awe and that the present model is better adjusted than any other to so useful an end though the condition of such a man as to his own future state be very deplorable yet providence which often works good out of evil can make even such a man an instrument for contributing toward the preservation of the church  on the other side i take a state to be truly in danger both as to its religion and government when a set of ambitious politicians bred up in a hatred to the constitution and a contempt for all religion are forced upon exerting these qualities in order to keep or increase their power by widening their bottom and taking in like mahomet some principles from every party that is any way discontented at the present faith and settlement which was manifestly our case upon this occasion i remember to have asked some considerable whigs whether it did not bring a disreputation upon their body to have the whole herd of presbyterians independents atheists anabaptists deists quakers and socinians openly and universally listed under their banners they answered that all this was absolutely necessary in order to make a balance against the tories and all little enough for indeed it was as much as they could possibly do though assisted with the absolute power of disposing every employment while the bulk of english gentry kept firm to their old principles in church and state  but notwithstanding whatever i have hitherto said i am informed several among the whigs continue still so refractory that they will hardly allow the heads of their party to have entertained any designs of ruining the constitution or that they would have endeavoured it if they had continued in power i beg their pardon if i have discovered a secret but who could imagine they ever intended it should be one after those overt acts with which they thought fit to conclude their farce but perhaps they now find it convenient to deny vigorously that the question may remain why was the old ministry changed which they urge on without ceasing as if no occasion in the least had been given but that all were owing to the insinuations of crafty men practising upon the weakness of an easy prince i shall therefore offer among a hundred one reason for this change which i think would justify any monarch that ever reigned for the like proceeding  it is notorious enough how highly princes have been blamed in the histories of all countries particularly of our own upon the account of minions who have been ever justly odious to the people for their insolence and avarice and engrossing the favour of their masters whoever has been the least conversant in the english story cannot but have heard of gaveston3 the spencers4 and the earl of oxford5 who by the excess and abuse of their power cost the princes they served or rather governed their crowns and lives however in the case of minions it must at least be acknowledged that the prince is pleased and happy though his subjects be aggrieved and he has the plea of friendship to excuse him which is a disposition of generous minds besides a wise minion though he be haughty to others is humble and insinuating to his master and cultivates his favour by obedience and respect but our misfortune has been a great deal worse we have suffered for some years under the oppression the avarice and insolence of those for whom the queen had neither esteem nor friendship who rather seemed to snatch their own dues than receive the favour of their sovereign and were so far from returning respect that they forgot common good manners they imposed on their prince by urging the necessity of affairs of their own creating they first raised difficulties and then offered them as arguments to keep themselves in power they united themselves against nature and principle to a party they had always abhorred and which was now content to come in upon any terms leaving them and their creatures in full possession of the court then they urged the formidable strength of that party and the dangers which must follow by disobliging of it so that it seems almost a miracle how a prince thus besieged on all sides could alone have courage and prudence enough to extricate herself  and indeed there is a point of history relating to this matter which well deserves to be considered when her majesty came to the crown she took into favour and employment several persons who were esteemed the best friends of the old constitution among whom none were reckoned further gone in the high church principles as they are usually called than two or three who had at that time most credit and ever since till within these few months possessed all power at court so that the first umbrage given to the whigs and the pretences for clamouring against france and the pretender were derived from them and i believe nothing appeared then more unlikely than that such different opinions should ever incorporate that party having upon former occasions treated those very persons with enmity enough but some lords then about court and in the queens good graces not able to endure those growing impositions upon the prince and people presumed to interpose and were consequently soon removed and disgraced however when a most exorbitant grant was proposed6 antecedent to any visible merit it miscarried in parliament for want of being seconded by those who had most credit in the house and who having always opposed the like excesses in a former reign thought it their duty to do so still to shew the world that the dislike was not against persons but things but this was to cross the oligarchy in the tenderest point a point which outweighed all considerations of duty and gratitude to their prince or regard to the constitution and therefore after having in several private meetings concerted measures with their old enemies and granted as well as received conditions they began to change their style and their countenance and to put it as a maxim in the mouths of their emissaries that england must be saved by the whigs this unnatural league was afterwards cultivated by another incident i mean the act of security7 and the consequences of it which every body knows when to use the words of my correspondent8 the sovereign authority was parcelled out among a faction and made the purchase of indemnity for an offending minister thus the union of the two kingdoms improved that between the ministry and the junto which was afterwards cemented by their mutual danger in that storm they so narrowly escaped about three years ago9 but however was not quite perfected till the princes death10 and then they went lovingly on together both satisfied with their several shares at full liberty to gratify their predominant inclinations the first their avarice and ambition the other their models of innovation in church and state  therefore whoever thinks fit to revive that baffled question why was the late ministry changed may receive the following answer that it was become necessary by the insolence and avarice of some about the queen who in order to perpetuate their tyranny had made a monstrous alliance with those who profess principles destructive to our religion and government if this will not suffice let him make an abstract of all the abuses i have mentioned in my former papers and view them together after which if he still remains unsatisfied let him suspend his opinion a few weeks longer though after all i think the question as trifling as that of the papists when they ask us where was our religion before luther and indeed the ministry was changed for the same reason that religion was reformed because a thousand corruptions had crept into the discipline and doctrine of the state by the pride the avarice the fraud and the ambition of those who administered to us in secular affairs  i heard myself censured the other day in a coffeehouse for seeming to glance in the letter to crassus11 against a great man who is still in employment and likely to continue so what if i had really intended that such an application should be given it i cannot perceive how i could be justly blamed for so gentle a reproof if i saw a handsome young fellow going to a ball at court with a great smut upon his face could he take it ill in me to point out the place and desire him with abundance of good words to pull out his handkerchief and wipe it off or bring him to a glass where he might plainly see it with his own eyes does any man think i shall suffer my pen to inveigh against vices only because they are charged upon persons who are no longer in power every body knows that certain vices are more or less pernicious according to the stations of those who possess them for example lewdness and intemperance are not of so bad consequences in a town rake as a divine cowardice in a lawyer is more supportable than in an officer of the army if i should find fault with an admiral because he wanted politeness or an alderman for not understanding greek that indeed would be to go out of my way for an occasion of quarrelling but excessive avarice in a general is i think the greatest defect he can be liable to next to those of courage and conduct and may be attended with the most ruinous consequences as it was in crassus who to that vice alone owed the destruction of himself and his army12 it is the same thing in praising

quae tam firma civitas est quae non odiis atque discidiis funditus possit everti2  if we examine what societies of men are in closest union among themselves we shall find them either to be those who are engaged in some evil design or who labour under one common misfortune thus the troops of banditti in several countries abroad the knots of highwaymen in our own nation the several tribes of sharpers thieves and pickpockets with many others are so firmly knit together that nothing is more difficult than to break or dissolve their several gangs so likewise those who are fellowsufferers under any misfortune whether it be in reality or opinion are usually contracted into a very strict union as we may observe in the papists throughout this kingdom under those real difficulties which are justly put on them and in the several schisms of presbyterians and other sects under that grievous persecution of the modern kind called want of power and the reason why such confederacies are kept so sacred and inviolable is very plain because in each of those cases i have mentioned the whole body is moved by one common spirit in pursuit of one general end and the interest of individuals is not crossed by each other or by the whole  now both these motives are joined to unite the highflying whigs at present they have been always engaged in an evil design and of late they are faster rivetted by that terrible calamity the loss of power so that whatever designs a mischievous crew of dark confederates may possibly entertain who will stop at no means to compass them may be justly apprehended from these  on the other side those who wish well to the public and would gladly contribute to its service are apt to differ in their opinions about the methods of promoting it and when their party flourishes are sometimes envious at those in power ready to overvalue their own merit and be impatient till it is rewarded by the measure they have prescribed for themselves there is a further topic of contention which a ruling party is apt to fall into in relation to retrospections and enquiry into past miscarriages wherein some are thought too warm and zealous others too cool and remiss while in the meantime these divisions are industriously fomented by the discarded faction which though it be an old practice hath been much improved in the schools of the jesuits who when they despaired of perverting this nation to popery by arguments or plots against the state sent their emissaries to subdivide us into schisms3 and this expedient is now with great propriety taken up by our men of incensed moderation because they suppose themselves able to attack the strongest of our subdivisions and so subdue us one after another nothing better resembles this proceeding than that famous combat between the horatii and curiatii4 where two of the former being killed the third who remained entire and untouched was able to kill his three wounded adversaries after he had divided them by a stratagem i well know with how tender a hand all this should be touched yet at the same time i think it my duty to warn the friends as well as expose the enemies of the public weal and to begin preaching up union upon the first suspicion that any steps are made to disturb it  but the two chief subjects of discontent which in most great changes in the management of public affairs are apt to breed differences among those who are in possession are what i have just now mentioned a desire of punishing the corruptions of former managers and the rewarding merit among those who have been any way instrumental or consenting to the change the first of these is a point so nice that i shall purposely waive it but the latter i take to fall properly within my district by merit i here understand that value which every man puts upon his own deservings from the public and i believe there could not be a more difficult employment found out than that of paymaster general to this sort of merit or a more noisy crowded place than a court of judicature erected to settle and adjust every mans claim upon that article i imagine if this had fallen into the fancy of the ancient poets they would have dressed it up after their manner into an agreeable fiction and given us a genealogy and description of merit perhaps not very different from that which follows  a poetical genealogy and description of merit  that true merit was the son of virtue and honour but that there was likewise a spurious child who usurped the name and whose parents were vanity and impudence that at a distance there was a great resemblance between them and they were often mistaken for each other that the bastard issue had a loud shrill voice which was perpetually employed in cravings and complaints while the other never spoke louder than a whisper and was often so bashful that he could not speak at all that in all great assemblies the false merit would step before the true and stand just in his way was constantly at court or great mens levees or whispering in some ministers ear that the more you fed him the more hungry and importunate he grew that he often passed for the true son of virtue and honour and the genuine for an impostor that he was born distorted and a dwarf but by force of art appeared of a handsome shape and taller than the usual size and that none but those who were wise and good as well as vigilant could discover his littleness or deformity that the true merit had been often forced to the indignity of applying to the false for his credit with those in power and to keep himself from starving that he filled the antechambers with a crew of his dependants and creatures such as projectors schematises occasional converts to a party prostitute flatterers starveling writers buffoons shallow politicians empty orators and the like who all owned him for their patron and grew discontented if they were not immediately fed   this metaphorical description of false merit is i doubt calculated for most countries in christendom and as to our own i believe it may be said with a sufficient reserve of charity that we are fully able to reward every man among us according to his real deservings and i think i may add without suspicion of flattery that never any prince had a ministry with a better judgment to distinguish between false and real merit than that which is now at the helm or whose inclination as well as interest it is to encourage the latter and it ought to be observed that those great and excellent persons we see at the head of affairs are of the queens own personal voluntary choice not forced upon her by any insolent overgrown favourite or by the pretended necessity of complying with an unruly faction  yet these are the persons whom those scandals to the press in their daily pamphlets and papers openly revile at so ignominious a rate as i believe was never tolerated before under any government for surely no lawful power derived from a prince should be so far affronted as to leave those who are in authority exposed to every scurrilous libeller because in this point i make a mighty difference between those who are in and those who are out of power not upon any regard to their persons but the stations they are placed in by the sovereign and if my distinction be right i think i might appeal to any man whether if a stranger were to read the invectives which are daily published against the present ministry and the outrageous fury of the authors against me for censuring the last he would not conclude the whigs to be at this time in full possession of power and favour and the tories entirely at mercy but all this now ceases to be a wonder since the queen herself is no longer spared witness the libel published some days ago under the title of a letter to sir jacob banks5 where the reflections upon her sacred majesty are much more plain and direct than ever the examiner thought fit to publish against the most obnoxious persons in a ministry discarded for endeavouring the ruin of their prince and country caesar indeed threatened to hang the pirates for presuming to disturb him while he was their prisoner aboard their ship6 but it was caesar who did so and he did it to a crew of public robbers and it became the greatness of his spirit for he lived to execute what he had threatened had they been in his power and sent such a message it could be imputed to nothing but the extremes of impudence folly or madness  i had a letter last week relating to mr greenshields7 an episcopal clergyman of scotland and the writer seems to be a gentleman of that part of britain i remember formerly to have read a printed account of mr greenshieldss case who has been prosecuted and silenced for no other reason beside reading divine service after the manner of the church of england to his own congregation who desired it though as the gentleman who writes to me says there is no law in scotland against those meetings and he adds that the sentence pronounced against mr greenshields will soon be affirmed if some care be not taken to prevent it i am altogether uninformed in the particulars of this case and besides to treat it justly would not come within the compass of my paper therefore i could wish the gentleman would undertake it in a discourse by itself and i should be glad he would inform the public in one fact whether episcopal assemblies are freely allowed in scotland it is notorious that abundance of their clergy fled from thence some years ago into england and ireland as from a persecution but it was alleged by their enemies that they refused to take the oaths to the government which however none of them scrupled when they came among us it is somewhat extraordinary to see our whigs and fanatics keep such a stir about the sacred act of toleration while their brethren will not allow a connivance in so near a neighbourhood especially if what the gentleman insists on in his letter be true that nine parts in ten of the nobility and gentry and two in three of the commons be episcopal of which one argument he offers is the present choice of their representatives in both houses though opposed to the utmost by the preachings threatenings and anathemas of the kirk such usage to a majority may as he thinks be of dangerous consequence and i entirely agree with him if these be the principles of

last week sent me by an unknown hand a passage out of plato3 with some hints how to apply it that author puts a fable into the mouth of aristophanes with an account of the original of love that mankind was at first created with four arms and legs and all other parts double to what they are now till jupiter as a punishment for his sins cleft him in two with a thunderbolt since which time we are always looking for our other half and this is the cause of love but jupiter threatened that if they did not mend their manners he would give them tother slit and leave them to hop about in the shape of figures in basso relievo the effect of this last threatening my correspondent imagines is now come to pass and that as the first splitting was the original of love by inclining us to search for our tother half so the second was the cause of hatred by prompting us to fly from our other side and dividing the same body into two gave each slice the name of a party  i approve the fable and application with this refinement upon it for parties do not only split a nation but every individual among them leaving each but half their strength and wit and honesty and good nature but one eye and ear for their sight and hearing and equally lopping the rest of the senses where parties are pretty equal in a state no man can perceive one bad quality in his own or good one in his adversaries besides party being a dry disagreeable subject it renders conversation insipid or sour and confines invention i speak not here of the leaders but the insignificant crowd of followers in a party who have been the instruments of mixing it in every condition and circumstance of life as the zealots among the jews bound the law about their foreheads and wrists and hems of their garments so the women among us have got the distinguishing marks of party in their muffs their fans and their furbelows the whig ladies put on their patches in a different manner from the tories4 they have made schisms in the playhouse and each have their particular sides at the opera and when a man changes his party he must infallibly count upon the loss of his mistress i asked a gentleman the other day how he liked such a lady but he would not give me his opinion till i had answered him whether she were a whig or a tory mr5 since he is known to visit the present ministry and lay some time under a suspicion of writing the examiner is no longer a man of wit his very poems have contracted a stupidity many years after they were printed  having lately ventured upon a metaphorical genealogy of merit i thought it would be proper to add another of party or rather of faction to avoid mistake not telling the reader whether it be my own or a quotation till i know how it is approved but whether i read or dreamed it the fable is as follows  liberty the daughter of oppression after having brought forth several fair children as riches arts learning trade and many others was at last delivered of her youngest daughter called faction whom juno doing the office of the midwife distorted in its birth out of envy to the mother from whence it derived its peevishness and sickly constitution however as it is often the nature of parents to grow most fond of their youngest and disagreeablest children so it happened with liberty who doted on this daughter to such a degree that by her good will she would never suffer the girl to be out of her sight as miss faction grew up she became so termagant and froward that there was no enduring her any longer in heaven jupiter gave her warning to be gone and her mother rather than forsake her took the whole family down to earth she landed at first in greece was expelled by degrees through all the cities by her daughters illconduct fled afterwards to italy and being banished thence took shelter among the goths with whom she passed into most parts of europe but driven out every where she began to lose esteem and her daughters faults were imputed to herself so that at this time she has hardly a place in the world to retire to one would wonder what strange qualities this daughter must possess sufficient to blast the influence of so divine a mother and the rest of her children she always affected to keep mean and scandalous company valuing nobody but just as they agreed with her in every capricious opinion she thought fit to take up and rigorously exacting compliance though she changed her sentiments ever so often her great employment was to breed discord among friends and relations and make up monstrous alliances between those whose dispositions least resembled each other whoever offered to contradict her though in the most insignificant trifle she would be sure to distinguish by some ignominious appellation and allow them to have neither honour wit beauty learning honesty or common sense she intruded into all companies at the most unseasonable times mixed at balls assemblies and other parties of pleasure haunted every coffee house and booksellers shop and by her perpetual talking filled all places with disturbance and confusion she buzzed about the merchant in the exchange the divine in his pulpit and the shopkeeper behind his counter above all she frequented public assemblies where she sat in the shape of an obscene ominous bird ready to prompt her friends as they spoke  if i understand this fable of faction right it ought to be applied to those who set themselves up against the true interest and constitution of their country which i wish the undertakers for the late ministry would please to take notice of or tell us by what figure of speech they pretend to call so great and unforced a majority with the queen at the head by the name of the faction which is unlike the phrase of the nonjurors who dignifying one or two deprived bishops and half a score clergymen of the same stamp with the title of the church of england exclude all the rest as schismatics or like the presbyterians laying the same accusation with equal justice against the established religion  and here it may be worth inquiring what are the true characteristics of a faction or how it is to be distinguished from that great body of the people who are friends to the constitution the heads of a faction are usually a set of upstarts or men ruined in their fortunes whom some great change in a government did at first out of their obscurity produce upon the stage they associate themselves with those who dislike the old establishment religious and civil they are full of new schemes in politics and divinity they have an incurable hatred against the old nobility and strengthen their party by dependants raised from the lowest of the people they have several ways of working themselves into power but they are sure to be called when a corrupt administration wants to be supported against those who are endeavouring at a reformation and they firmly observe that celebrated maxim of preserving power by the same arts it is attained they act with the spirit of those who believe their time is but short and their first care is to heap up immense riches at the public expense in which they have two ends beside that common one of insatiable avarice which are to make themselves necessary and to keep the commonwealth in dependence thus they hope to compass their design which is instead of fitting their principles to the constitution to alter and adjust the constitution to their own pernicious principles  it is easy determining by this test to which side the name of faction most properly belongs but however i will give them any system of law or regal government from william the conqueror to this present time to try whether they can tally it with their late models excepting only that of cromwell whom perhaps they will reckon for a monarch  if the present ministry and so great a majority in the parliament and kingdom be only a faction it must appear by some actions which answers the idea we usually conceive from that word have they abused the prerogatives of the prince or invaded the rights and liberties of the subject have they offered at any dangerous innovations in church or state have they broached any doctrines of heresy rebellion or tyranny have any of them treated their sovereign with insolence engrossed and sold all her favours or deceived her by base gross misrepresentations of her most faithful servants these are the arts of a faction and whoever has practised them they and their followers must take up with the name  it is usually reckoned a whig principle to appeal to the people but that is only when they have been so wise as to poison their understandings beforehand will they now stand to this appeal and be determined by their vox populi to which side their title of faction belongs and that the people are now left to the natural freedom of their understanding and choice i believe our adversaries will hardly deny they will now refuse this appeal and it is reasonable they should and i will further add that if our people resembled the old grecians there might be danger in such a trial a pragmatical orator told a great man at athens that whenever the people were in their rage they would certainly tear him to pieces yes says the other and they will do the same to you whenever they are in their wits but god be thanked our populace is more merciful in their nature and at present under better direction and the orators among us have attempted to confound both prerogative and law in their sovereigns presence and before the highest court of

qui exsecant pestem aliquam tanquam strumam civitatis3  i am diverted from the general subject of my discourses to reflect upon an event of a very extraordinary and surprising nature a great minister in high confidence with the queen under whose management the weight of affairs at present is in a great measure supposed to lie sitting in council in a royal palace with a dozen of the chief officers of the state is stabbed at the very board4 in the execution of his office by the hand of a french papist then under examination for high treason the assassin redoubles his blow to make sure work and concluding the chancellor was dispatched goes on with the same rage to murder a principal secretary of state and that whole noble assembly are forced to rise and draw their swords in their own defence as if a wild beast had been let loose among them  this fact hath some circumstances of aggravation not to be paralleled by any of the like kind we meet with in history caesars murder being performed in the senate comes nearest to the case but that was an affair concerted by great numbers of the chief senators who were likewise the actors in it and not the work of a vile single ruffian harry the third of france was stabbed by an enthusiastic friar5 whom he suffered to approach his person while those who attended him stood at some distance his successor met the same fate in a coach where neither he nor his nobles in such a confinement were able to defend themselves in our own country we have i think but one instance of this sort which has made any noise i mean that of felton about fourscore years ago but he took the opportunity to stab the duke of buckingham in passing through a dark lobby from one room to another6 the blow was neither seen nor heard and the murderer might have escaped if his own concern and horror as it is usual in such cases had not betrayed him besides that act of felton will admit of some extenuation from the motives he is said to have had but this attempt of guiscard seems to have outdone them all in every heightening circumstance except the difference of persons between a king and a great minister for i give no allowance at all to the difference of success which however is yet uncertain and depending nor think it the least alleviation to the crime whatever it may be to the punishment  i am sensible it is ill arguing from particulars to generals and that we ought not to charge upon a nation the crimes of a few desperate villains it is so unfortunate to produce yet at the same time it must be avowed that the french have for these last centuries been somewhat too liberal of their daggers upon the persons of their greatest men such as the admiral de coligny7 the dukes of guise8 father and son and the two kings i last mentioned i have sometimes wondered how a people whose genius seems wholly turned to singing and dancing and prating to vanity and impertinence who lay so much weight upon modes and gestures whose essentialities are generally so very superficial who are usually so serious upon trifles and so trifling upon what is serious have been capable of committing such solid villanies more suitable to the gravity of a spaniard or silence and thoughtfulness of an italian unless it be that in a nation naturally so full of themselves and of so restless imaginations when any of them happen to be of a morose and gloomy constitution that huddle of confused thoughts for want of evaporating usually terminates in rage or despair davila9 observes that jacques clément was a sort of buffoon whom the rest of the friars used to make sport with but at last giving his folly a serious turn it ended in enthusiasm and qualified him for that desperate act of murdering his king  but in the marquis de guiscard there seems to have been a complication of ingredients for such an attempt he had committed several enormities in france was extremely prodigal and vicious of a dark melancholy complexion and cloudy countenance such as in vulgar physiognomy is called an ill look for the rest his talents were very mean having a sort of inferior cunning but very small abilities so that a great man of the late ministry by whom he was invited over10 and with much discretion raised at first step from a profligate popish priest to a lieutenantgeneral and colonel of a regiment of horse was forced at last to drop him for shame11  had such an accident happened12 under that ministry and to so considerable a member of it they would have immediately charged it upon the whole body of those they are pleased to call the faction this would have been styled a highchurch principle the clergy would have been accused as promoters and abettors of the fact committees would have been sent to promise the criminal his life provided they might have liberty to direct and dictate his confession and a black list would have been printed of all those who had been ever seen in the murderers company but the present men in power hate and despise all such detestable arts which they might now turn upon their adversaries with much more plausibility than ever these did their honourable negotiations with gregg13  and here it may be worth observing how unanimous a concurrence there is between some persons once in great power and a french papist both agreeing in the great end of taking away mr harleys life though differing in their methods the first proceeding by subornation the other by violence wherein guiscard seems to have the advantage as aiming no further than his life while the others designed to destroy at once both that and his reputation the malice of both against this gentleman seems to have risen from the same cause his discovering designs against the government it was mr harley who detected the treasonable correspondence of gregg and secured him betimes when a certain great man who shall be nameless had out of the depth of his politics sent him a caution to make his escape which would certainly have fixed the appearance of guilt14 upon mr harley but when that was prevented they would have enticed the condemned criminal with promise of a pardon to write and sign an accusation against the secretary but to use greggs own expression his death was nothing near so ignominious as would have been such a life that must be saved by prostituting his conscience the same gentleman lies now stabbed by his other enemy a popish spy whose treason he has discovered god preserve the rest of her majestys ministers from such protestants and from such papists  i shall take occasion to hint at some particularities in this surprising fact for the sake of those at distance or who may not be thoroughly informed15 the murderer confessed in newgate that his chief design was against mr secretary st john who happened to change seats with mr harley for more convenience of examining the criminal16 and being asked what provoked him to stab the chancellor he said that not being able to come at the secretary as he intended it was some satisfaction to murder the person whom he thought mr st john loved best17  and here if mr harley has still any enemies left whom his blood spilt in the public service cannot reconcile i hope they will at least admire his magnanimity which is a quality esteemed even in an enemy and i think there are few greater instances of it to be found in story after the wound was given he was observed neither to change his countenance nor discover any concern or disorder in his speech he rose up and walked along the room while he was able with the greatest tranquillity during the midst of the confusion when the surgeon came he took him aside and desired he would inform him freely whether the wound were mortal because in that case he said he had some affairs to settle relating to his family the blade of the penknife broken by the violence of the blow against a rib within a quarter of an inch of the handle was dropt out i know not whether from the wound or his clothes as the surgeon was going to dress him he ordered it to be taken up and wiping it himself gave it some body to keep saying he thought it now properly belonging to him he shewed no sort of resentment or spoke one violent word against guiscard but appeared all the while the least concerned of any in the companya state of mind which in such an exigency nothing but innocence can give and is truly worthy of a christian philosopher  if there be really so great a difference in principle between the highflying whigs and the friends of france i cannot but repeat the question how come they to join in the destruction of the same man can his death be possibly for the interest of both or have they both the same quarrel against him that he is perpetually discovering and preventing the treacherous designs of our enemies however it be this great minister may now say with st paul that he hath been in perils by his own countrymen and in perils by strangers  in the midst of so melancholy a subject i cannot but congratulate with our own country that such a savage monster as the marquis de guiscard is none of her production a wretch perhaps more detestable in his own nature than even this barbarous act has been yet able to represent him to the world for there are good reasons to believe from several circumstances that he had intentions of a deeper dye than those he happened to execute18 i mean such as every good subject must tremble to think on he hath of late been frequently seen going up the back stairs at court and walking alone in an outer room adjoining to her majestys bedchamber he has often and earnestly pressed for some time to have access to the queen even since his correspondence with france and he has now given such a proof of his disposition as leaves it easy to guess what was before in his thoughts and what he was capable of attempting  it is humbly to be hoped that the legislature19 will interpose on so extraordinary an occasion as this

most useful parts of their writings and to have done greatest service to the christian religion because they removed those misrepresentations which had done it most injury the methods these writers took was openly and freely to discover every point of their faith to detect the falsehood of their accusers and to charge nothing upon their adversaries but what they were sure to make good this example has been ill followed of later times the papists since the reformation using all arts to palliate the absurdities of their tenets and loading the reformers with a thousand calumnies the consequence of which has been only a more various wide and inveterate separation it is the same thing in civil schisms a whig forms an image of a tory just after the thing he most abhors and that image serves to represent the whole body  i am not sensible of any material difference there is between those who call themselves the old whigs and a great majority of the present tories at least by all i could ever find from examining several persons of each denomination but it must be confessed that the present body of whigs as they now constitute that party is a very odd mixture of mankind being forced to enlarge their bottom by taking in every heterodox professor either in religion or government whose opinions they were obliged to encourage for fear of lessening their number while the bulk of the landed men and people were entirely of the old sentiments however they still pretended a due regard to the monarchy and the church even at the time when they were making the largest steps towards the ruin of both but not being able to wipe off the many accusations laid to their charge they endeavoured by throwing of scandal to make the tories appear blacker than themselves that so the people might join with them as the smaller evil of the two  but among all the reproaches which the whigs have flung upon their adversaries there is none hath done them more service than that of passive obedience as they represent it with the consequences of nonresistance arbitrary power indefeasible right tyranny popery and what not there is no accusation which has passed with more plausibility than this nor any that is supported with less justice in order therefore to undeceive those who have been misled by false representations i thought it would be no improper undertaking to set this matter in a fair light which i think has not yet been done a whig asks whether you hold passive obedience you affirm it he then immediately cries out you are a jacobite a friend of france and the pretender because he makes you answerable for the definition he has formed of that term however different it be from what you understand i will therefore give two descriptions of passive obedience the first as it is falsely charged by the whigs the other as it is really professed by the tories at least by nineteen in twenty of all i ever conversed with  passive obedience as charged by the whigs  the doctrine of passive obedience is to believe that a king even in a limited monarchy holding his power only from god is only answerable to him that such a king is above all law that the cruellest tyrant must be submitted to in all things and if his commands be ever so unlawful you must neither fly nor resist nor use any other weapons than prayers and tears though he should force your wife or daughter murder your children before your face or cut off five hundred heads in a morning for his diversion you are still to wish him a long prosperous reign and to be patient under all his cruelties with the same resignation as under a plague or a famine because to resist him would be to resist god in the person of his vicegerent if a king of england should go through the streets of london in order to murder every man he met passive obedience commands them to submit all laws made to limit him signify nothing though passed by his own consent if he thinks fit to break them god will indeed call him to a severe account but the whole people united to a man cannot presume to hold his hands or offer him the least active disobedience the people were certainly created for him and not he for the people his next heir though worse than what i have described though a fool or a madman has a divine undefeasible right to succeed him which no law can disannul nay though he should kill his father upon the throne he is immediately king to all intents and purposes the possession of the crown wiping off all stains but whosoever sits on the throne without this title though never so peaceably and by consent of former kings and parliaments is an usurper while there is any where in the world another person who hath a nearer hereditary right and the whole kingdom lies under mortal sin till that heir be restored because he has a divine title which no human law can defeat  this and a great deal more hath in a thousand papers3 and pamphlets been laid to that doctrine of passive obedience which the whigs are pleased to charge upon us this is what they perpetually are instilling into the people to believe as the undoubted principles by which the present ministry and a great majority in parliament do at this time proceed this is what they accuse the clergy of delivering from the pulpits and of preaching up as doctrines absolutely necessary to salvation and whoever affirms in general that passive obedience is due to the supreme power he is presently loaden by our candid adversaries with such consequences as these let us therefore see what this doctrine is when stripped of such misrepresentations by describing it as really taught and practised by the tories and then it will appear what grounds our adversaries have to accuse us upon this article  passive obedience as professed and practised by the tories  they think that in every government whether monarchy or republic there is placed a supreme absolute unlimited power to which passive obedience is due that wherever is entrusted the power of making laws that power is without all bounds can repeal or enact at pleasure whatever laws it thinks fit and justly demands universal obedience and nonresistance that among us as every body knows this power is lodged in the king or queen together with the lords and commons of the kingdom and therefore all decrees whatsoever made by that power are to be actively or passively obeyed that the administration or executive part of this power is in england solely entrusted with the prince who in administering those laws ought to be no more resisted than the legislative power itself but they do not conceive the same absolute passive obedience to be due to a limited princes commands when they are directly contrary to the laws he has consented to and sworn to maintain the crown may be sued as well as a private person and if an arbitrary king of england should send his officers to seize my lands or goods against law i can lawfully resist them the ministers by whom he acts are liable to prosecution and impeachment though his own person be sacred but if he interposes his royal authority to support their insolence i see no remedy till it grows a general grievance or till the body of the people have reason to apprehend it will be so after which it becomes a case of necessity and then i suppose a free people may assert their own rights yet without any violation to the person or lawful power of the prince but although the tories allow all this and did justify it by the share they had in the revolution yet they see no reason for entering upon so ungrateful a subject or raising controversies upon it as if we were in daily apprehensions of tyranny under the reign of so excellent a princess and while we have so many laws4 of late years made to limit the prerogative when according to the judgment of those who know our constitution best things rather seem to lean to the other extreme which is equally to be avoided as to the succession the tories think an hereditary right to be the best in its own nature and most agreeable to our old constitution yet at the same time they allow it to be defeasible by act of parliament and so is magna charta too if the legislature thinks fit which is a truth so manifest that no man who understands the nature of government can be in doubt concerning it  these i take to be the sentiments of a great majority among the tories with respect to passive obedience and if the whigs insist from the writings or common talk of warm and ignorant men to form a judgment of the whole body according to the first account i have here given i will engage to produce as many of their side who are utterly against passive obedience even to the legislature who will assert the last resort of power to be in the people against those whom they have chosen and trusted as their representatives with the prince at the head and who will put wild improbable cases to shew the reasonableness and necessity of resisting the legislative power in such imaginary junctures than which however nothing can be more idle for i dare undertake in any system of government either speculative or practic that was ever yet in the world from platos republic to harringtons oceana5 to put such difficulties as cannot be answered  all the other calumnies raised by the whigs may be as easily wiped off and i have charity to wish they could as fully answer the just accusations we have against them dodwell hicks and lesley6 are gravely quoted to prove that the tories design to bring in the pretender and if i should quote them to prove that the same thing is intended by the whigs it would be full as reasonable since i am sure they have at least as much to do with nonjurors as we but our objections against the whigs are built upon their constant practice for many years whereof i have produced a hundred instances against any single one of which no answer hath yet been attempted though i have been curious enough to look into all the papers i could meet with that are writ against the examiner such a task as i hope no man thinks i would undergo for any other end but that of finding an opportunity to own and rectify my mistakes as i would be ready to do upon call of the meanest adversary upon which occasion i shall take leave to add a few words  i flattered myself last thursday from the nature of my subject and the inoffensive manner i handled it that i should have one weeks respite from those merciless pens whose severity will some time break my heart but i am deceived and find them more violent than ever they charge me with two lies and a blunder the first lie is a truth that guiscard was invited over7 but it is of no consequence i do not tax it as a fault such sort of men have often been serviceable i only blamed the indiscretion of raising a profligate abbot at the first step to a lieutenantgeneral and colonel of a regiment of horse without staying some reasonable time as is usual in such cases till he had given some proofs of his fidelity as well as of that interest and credit he pretended to have in his country but that is said to be another lie for he was a papist and could not have a regiment however this other lie is a truth too for a regiment he had and paid by us to his agent monsieur le bas for his use the third is a blunder that i say guiscards design was against mr secretary st john and yet my reasonings upon it are as if it were personal against mr harley but i say no such thing and my reasonings are just i relate only what guiscard said in newgate because it was a particularity the reader might be curious to know and accordingly it lies in a paragraph by itself after my reflections8 but i never meant to be answerable for what guiscard said or thought it of weight enough for me to draw conclusions from thence when i had the address of both houses to direct me better where it is expressly said9 that mr harleys fidelity to her majesty and zeal for her service have drawn upon him the hatred of all the abettors of popery and faction10 this is what i believe and what i shall stick to  but alas these are not the passages which have raised so much fury against me one or two mistakes in facts of no importance or a single blunder would not have provoked them they are not so tender of my reputation as a writer all their outrage is occasioned by those passages in that paper which they do not in the least pretend to answer and with the utmost reluctancy are forced to mention they take abundance of pains to clear guiscard from a design against mr harleys life but offer not one argument to clear their other friends who in the business of gregg were equally guilty of the same design against the same person whose tongues were very swords and

heartily weary of my employment as examiner which i wish the ministry would consider with half so much concern as i do and assign me some other with less pains and a larger pension there may soon be a vacancy either on the bench in the revenue or the army and i am equally qualified for each but this trade of examining i apprehend may at one time or other go near to sour my temper i did lately propose that some of those ingenious pens which are engaged on the other side might be employed to succeed me and i undertook to bring them over for tother crown but it was answered that those gentlemen do much better service in the stations where they are it was added that abundance of abuses yet remained to be laid open to the world which i had often promised to do but was too much diverted by other subjects that came into my head on the other side the advice of some friends and the threats of many enemies have put me upon considering what would become of me if times should alter this i have done very maturely and the result is that i am in no manner of pain i grant that what i have said upon occasion concerning the late men in power may be called satire by some unthinking people as long as that faction is down but if ever they come into play again i must give them warning beforehand that i shall expect to be a favourite and that those pretended advocates of theirs will be pilloried for libellers for i appeal to any man whether i ever charged that party or its leaders with one single action or design which if we may judge by their former practices they will not openly profess be proud of and score up for merit when they come again to the head of affairs i said they were insolent to the queen will they not value themselves upon that as an argument to prove them bold assertors of the peoples liberty i affirmed they were against a peace will they be angry with me for setting forth the refinements of their politics in pursuing the only method left to preserve them in power i said they had involved the nation in debts and engrossed much of its money they go beyond me and boast they have got it all and the credit too i have urged the probability of their intending great alterations in religion and government if they destroy both at their next coming will they not reckon my foretelling it rather as a panegyric than an affront i said3 they had formerly a design against mr harleys life if they were now in power would they not immediately cut off his head and thank me for justifying the sincerity of their intentions in short there is nothing i ever said of those worthy patriots which may not be as well excused therefore as soon as they resume their places i positively design to put in my claim and i think may do it with much better grace than many of that party who now make their court to the present ministry i know two or three great men at whose levees you may daily observe a score of the most forward faces which every body is ashamed of except those that wear them but i conceive my pretensions will be upon a very different foot let me offer a parallel case suppose king charles the first had entirely subdued the rebels at naseby and reduced the kingdom to his obedience whoever had gone about to reason from the former conduct of those saints that if the victory had fallen on their side they would have murdered their prince destroyed monarchy and the church and made the kings party compound for their estates as delinquents would have been called a false uncharitable libeller by those very persons who afterwards gloried in all this and called it the work of the lord when they happened to succeed i remember there was a person fined and imprisoned for scandalum magnatum because he said the duke of york was a papist but when that prince came to be king and made open profession of his religion he had the justice immediately to release his prisoner who in his opinion had put a compliment upon him and not a reproach and therefore colonel titus4 who had warmly asserted the same thing in parliament was made a privycouncillor  by this rule if that which for some politic reasons is now called scandal upon the late ministry proves one day to be only an abstract of such a character as they will assume and be proud of i think i may fairly offer my pretensions and hope for their favour and i am the more confirmed in this notion by what i have observed in those papers that come weekly out against the examiner the authors are perpetually telling me of my ingratitude to my masters that i blunder and betray the cause and write with more bitterness against those that hire me than against the whigs now i took all this at first only for so many strains of wit and pretty paradoxes to divert the reader but upon further thinking i find they are serious i imagined i had complimented the present ministry for their dutiful behaviour to the queen for their love of the old constitution in church and state for their generosity and justice and for their desire of a speedy honourable peace but it seems i am mistaken and they reckon all this for satire because it is directly contrary to the practice of all those whom they set up to defend and utterly against all their notions of a good ministry therefore i cannot but think they have reason on their side for suppose i should write the character of an honest a religious and a learned man and send the first to newgate the second to the grecian coffeehouse and the last to whites5 would they not all pass for satires and justly enough among the companies to whom they were sent  having therefore employed several papers in such sort of panegyrics and but very few on what they understand to be satires i shall henceforth upon occasion be more liberal of the latter of which they are like to have a taste in the remainder of this present paper  among all the advantages which the kingdom hath received by the late change of ministry the greatest must be allowed to be the calling of the present parliament upon the dissolution of the last it is acknowledged that this excellent assembly hath entirely recovered the honour of parliaments which had been unhappily prostituted for some years past by the factious proceedings of an unnatural majority in concert with a most corrupt administration it is plain by the present choice of members that the electors of england when left to themselves do rightly understand their true interest the moderate whigs begin to be convinced that we have been all this while in wrong hands and that things are now as they should be and as the present house of commons is the best representative of the nation that hath ever been summoned in our memories so they have taken care in their first session by that noble bill of qualification6 that future parliaments should be composed of landed men and our properties lie no more at mercy of those who have none themselves or at least only what is transient or imaginary if there be any gratitude in posterity the memory of this assembly will be always celebrated if otherwise at least we who share in the blessings they derive to us ought with grateful hearts to acknowledge them  i design in some following papers to draw up a list for i can do no more of the great things this parliament hath already performed the many abuses they have detected their justice in deciding elections without regard of party their cheerfulness and address in raising supplies for the war and at the same time providing for the nations debts their duty to the queen and their kindness to the church in the mean time i cannot forbear mentioning two particulars which in my opinion do discover in some measure the temper of the present parliament and bear analogy to those passages related by plutarch in the lives of certain great men which as himself observes though they be not of actions which make any great noise or figure in history yet give more light into the characters of persons than we could receive from an account of their most renowned achievements  something like this may be observed from two late instances of decency and good nature in that illustrious assembly i am speaking of the first was when after that inhuman attempt upon mr harley they were pleased to vote an address to the queen7 wherein they express their utmost detestation of the fact their high esteem and great concern for that able minister and justly impute his misfortunes to that zeal for her majestys service which had drawn upon him the hatred of all the abettors of popery and faction i dare affirm that so distinguishing a mark of honour and good will from such a parliament was more acceptable to a person of mr harleys generous nature than the most bountiful grant that was ever yet made to a subject as her majestys answer filled with gracious expressions in his favour adds more to his real glory than any titles she could bestow the prince and representatives of the whole kingdom join in their concern for so important a life these are the true rewards of virtue and this is the commerce between noble spirits in a coin which the giver knows where to bestow and the receiver how to value though neither avarice nor ambition would be able to comprehend its worth  the other instance i intended to produce of decency and good nature in the present house of commons relates to their most worthy speaker8 who having unfortunately lost his eldest son9 the assembly moved with a generous pity for so sensible an affliction adjourned themselves for a week that so good a servant of the public might have some interval to wipe away a fathers tears and indeed that gentleman has too just an occasion for his grief by the death of a son who had already acquired so great a reputation for every amiable quality and who might have lived to be so great an honour and an ornament to his ancient family  before i conclude i must desire one favour of the reader that when he thinks it worth his while to peruse any paper writ against the examiner he will not form his judgment by any mangled quotation out of it which he finds in such papers but be so just to read the paragraph referred to which i am confident will be found a sufficient answer to all that ever those papers can object at least i have seen above fifty of them and never yet observed

peccata demonstrare possint2  i have been considering the old constitution of this kingdom comparing it with the monarchies and republics whereof we meet so many accounts in ancient story and with those at present in most parts of europe i have considered our religion established here by the legislature soon after the reformation i have likewise examined the genius and disposition of the people under that reasonable freedom they possess then i have turned my reflections upon those two great divisions of whig and tory which some way or other take in the whole kingdom with the principles they both profess as well as those wherewith they reproach one another from all this i endeavour to determine from which side her present majesty may reasonably hope for most security to her person and government and to which she ought in prudence to trust the administration of her affairs if these two rivals were really no more than parties according to the common acceptation of the word i should agree with those politicians who think a prince descends from his dignity by putting himself at the head of either and that his wisest course is to keep them in a balance raising or depressing either as it best suited with his designs but when the visible interest of his crown and kingdom lies on one side and when the other is but a faction raised and strengthened by incidents and intrigues and by deceiving the people with false representations of things he ought in prudence to take the first opportunity of opening his subjects eyes and declaring himself in favour of those who are for preserving the civil and religious rights of the nation wherewith his own are so interwoven  this was certainly our case for i do not take the heads advocates and followers of the whigs to make up strictly speaking a national party being patched up of heterogeneous inconsistent parts whom nothing served to unite but the common interest of sharing in the spoil and plunder of the people the present dread of their adversaries by whom they apprehended to be called to an account and that general conspiracy of endeavouring to overturn the church and state which however if they could have compassed they would certainly have fallen out among themselves and broke in pieces as their predecessors did after they destroyed the monarchy and religion for how could a whig who is against all discipline agree with a presbyterian that carries it higher than the papists themselves how could a socinian adjust his models to either or how could any of these cement with a deist or freethinker when they came to consult upon settling points of faith neither would they have agreed better in their systems of government where some would have been for a king under the limitations of a duke of venice others for a dutch republic a third party for an aristocracy and most of them all for some new fabric of their own contriving  but however let us consider them as a party and under those general tenets wherein they agreed and which they publicly owned without charging them with any that they pretend to deny then let us examine those principles of the tories which their adversaries allow them to profess and do not pretend to tax them with any actions contrary to those professions after which let the reader judge from which of these two parties a prince hath most to fear and whether her majesty did not consider the ease the safety and dignity of her person the security of her crown and the transmission of monarchy to her protestant successors when she put her affairs into the present hands  suppose the matter were now entire the queen to make her choice and for that end should order the principles on both sides to be fairly laid before her first i conceive the whigs would grant that they have naturally no very great veneration for crowned heads that they allow the person of the prince may upon many occasions be resisted by arms and that they do not condemn the war raised against king charles the first or own it to be a rebellion though they would be thought to blame his murder they do not think the prerogative to be yet sufficiently limited and have therefore taken care as a particular mark of their veneration for the illustrious house of hanover to clip it closer against next reign which consequently they would be glad to see done in the present not to mention that the majority of them if it were put to the vote would allow that they prefer a commonwealth before a monarchy as to religion their universal undisputed maxim is that it ought to make no distinction at all among protestants and in the word protestant they include every body who is not a papist and who will by an oath give security to the government union in discipline and doctrine the offensive sin of schism the notion of a church and a hierarchy they laugh at as foppery cant and priestcraft they see no necessity at all that there should be a national faith and what we usually call by that name they only style the religion of the magistrate3 since the dissenters and we agree in the main why should the difference of a few speculative points or modes of dress incapacitate them from serving their prince and country in a juncture when we ought to have all hands up against the common enemy and why should they be forced to take the sacrament from our clergys hands and in our posture or indeed why compelled to receive it at all when they take an employment which has nothing to do with religion  these are the notions which most of that party avow and which they do not endeavour to disguise or set off with false colours or complain of being misrepresented about i have here placed them on purpose in the same light which themselves do in the very apologies they make for what we accuse them of and how inviting even these doctrines are for such a monarch to close with as our law both statute and common understands a king of england to be let others decide but then if to these we should add other opinions which most of their own writers justify and which their universal practice has given a sanction to they are no more than what a prince might reasonably expect as the natural consequence of those avowed principles for when such persons are at the head of affairs the low opinion they have of princes will certainly tempt them to violate that respect they ought to bear and at the same time their own want of duty to their sovereign is largely made up by exacting greater submissions to themselves from their fellowsubjects it being indisputably true that the same principle of pride and ambition makes a man treat his equals with insolence in the same proportion as he affronts his superiors as both prince and people have sufficiently felt from the late ministry  then from their confessed notions of religion as above related i see no reason to wonder why they countenanced not only all sorts of dissenters but the several gradations of freethinkers among us all which were openly enrolled in their party nor why they were so very averse from the present established form of worship which by prescribing obedience to princes from the topic of conscience would be sure to thwart all their schemes of innovation  one thing i might add as another acknowledged maxim in that party and in my opinion as dangerous to the constitution as any i have mentioned i mean that of preferring on all occasions the moneyed interest before the landed which they were so far from denying that they would gravely debate the reasonableness and justice of it and at the rate they went on might in a little time have found a majority of representatives fitly qualified to lay those heavy burthens on the rest of the nation which themselves would not touch with one of their fingers  however to deal impartially there are some motives which might compel a prince under the necessity of affairs to deliver himself over to that party they were said to possess the great bulk of cash and consequently of credit in the nation and the heads of them had the reputation of presiding over those societies who have the great direction of both4 so that all applications for loans to the public service upon any emergency must be made through them and it might prove highly dangerous to disoblige them because in that case it was not to be doubted that they would be obstinate and malicious ready to obstruct all affairs not only by shutting their own purses but by endeavouring to sink credit though with some present imaginary loss to themselves only to shew it was a creature of their own  from this summary of whigprinciples and dispositions we find what a prince may reasonably fear and hope from that party let us now very briefly consider the doctrines of the tories which their adversaries will not dispute as they prefer a wellregulated monarchy before all other forms of government so they think it next to impossible to alter that institution here without involving our whole island in blood and desolation they believe that the prerogative of a sovereign ought at least to be held as sacred and inviolable as the rights of his people if only for this reason because without a due share of power he will not be able to protect them they think that by many known laws of this realm both statute and common neither the person nor lawful authority of the prince ought upon any pretence whatsoever to be resisted or disobeyed their sentiments in relation to the church are known enough and will not be controverted being just the reverse to what i have delivered as the doctrine and practice of the whigs upon that article  but here i must likewise deal impartially too and add one principle as a characteristic of the tories which has much discouraged some princes from making use of them in affairs give the whigs but power enough to insult their sovereign engross his favours to themselves and to oppress and plunder their fellowsubjects they presently grow into good humour and good language towards the crown profess they will stand by it with their lives and fortunes and whatever rudenesses they may be guilty of in private yet they assure the world that there never was so gracious a monarch but to the shame of the tories it must be confessed that nothing of all this hath been ever observed in them in or out of favour you see no alteration further than a little cheerfulness or cloud in their countenances the highest employments can add nothing to their loyalty but their behaviour to their prince as well as their expressions of love and duty are in all conditions exactly the same  having thus impartially stated the avowed principles of whig and tory let the reader determine as he pleases to which of these two a wise prince may with most safety to himself and the public trust his person and his affairs and whether it were rashness or prudence in her majesty to make those changes in the ministry which have been so highly extolled by some and condemned by others   footnote 1 no 35 in the reprint ts  footnote 2 none are prevented by their own faults from

species tam dissimiles tria talia texta   una dies dedit exitio2   i write this paper for the sake of the dissenters whom i take to be the most spreading branch of the whig party that professeth christianity and the only one that seems to be zealous for any particular system of it the bulk of those we call the low church being generally indifferent and undetermined in that point and the other subdivisions having not yet taken either the old or new testament into their scheme by the dissenters therefore it will easily be understood that i mean the presbyterians as they include the sects of anabaptists independents and others which have been melted down into them since the restoration this sect in order to make itself national having gone so far as to raise a rebellion murder their king destroy monarchy and the church was afterwards broken in pieces by its own divisions which made way for the kings return from his exile however the zealous among them did still entertain hopes of recovering the dominion of grace whereof i have read a remarkable passage in a book published about the year 1661 and written by one of their own side as one of the regicides was going to his execution a friend asked him whether he thought the cause would revive he answered the cause is in the bosom of christ and as sure as christ rose from the dead so sure will the cause revive also3 and therefore the nonconformists were strictly watched and restrained by penal laws during the reign of king charles the second the court and kingdom looking on them as a faction ready to join in any design against the government in church or state and surely this was reasonable enough while so many continued alive who had voted and fought and preached against both and gave no proof that they had changed their principles the nonconformists were then exactly upon the same foot with our nonjurors now whom we double tax forbid their conventicles and keep under hatches without thinking ourselves possessed with a persecuting spirit because we know they want nothing but the power to ruin us this in my opinion should altogether silence the dissenters complaints of persecution under king charles the second or make them shew us wherein they differed at that time from what our jacobites are now  their inclinations to the church were soon discovered when king james the second succeeded to the crown with whom they unanimously joined in its ruin to revenge themselves for that restraint they had most justly suffered in the foregoing reign not from the persecuting temper of the clergy as their clamours would suggest but the prudence and caution of the legislature the same indulgence against law was made use of by them and the papists and they amicably employed their power as in defence of one common interest  but the revolution happening soon after served to wash away the memory of the rebellion upon which the run against popery was no doubt as just and seasonable as that of fanaticism after the restoration and the dread of popery being then our latest danger and consequently the most fresh upon our spirits all mouths were open against that the dissenters were rewarded with an indulgence by law the rebellion and kings murder were now no longer a reproach the former was only a civil war and whoever durst call it a rebellion was a jacobite and friend to france this was the more unexpected because the revolution being wholly brought about by church of england hands they hoped one good consequence of it would be the relieving us from the encroachments of dissenters as well as those of papists since both had equally confederated towards our ruin and therefore when the crown was new settled it was hoped at least that the rest of the constitution would be restored but this affair took a very different turn the dissenters had just made a shift to save a tide and joined with the prince of orange when they found all was desperate with their protector king james and observing a party then forming against the old principles in church and state under the name of whigs and lowchurchmen they listed themselves of it where they have ever since continued  it is therefore upon the foot they now are that i would apply myself to them and desire they would consider the different circumstances at present from what they were under when they began their designs against the church and monarchy about seventy years ago at that juncture they made up the body of the party and whosoever joined with them from principles of revenge discontent ambition or love of change were all forced to shelter under their denomination united heartily in the pretences of a further and purer reformation in religion and of advancing the great work as the cant was then that god was about to do in these nations received the systems of doctrine and discipline prescribed by the scots and readily took the covenant4 so that there appeared no division among them till after the common enemy was subdued  but now their case is quite otherwise and i can hardly think it worth being of a party upon the terms they have been received of late years for suppose the whole faction should at length succeed in their design of destroying the church are they so weak to imagine that the new modelling of religion would be put into their hands would their brethren the lowchurchmen and freethinkers submit to their discipline their synods or their classes and divide the lands of bishops or deans and chapters among them how can they help observing that their allies instead of pretending more sanctity than other men are some of them for levelling all religion and the rest for abolishing it is it not manifest that they have been treated by their confederates exactly after the same manner as they were by king james the second made instruments to ruin the church not for their sakes but under a pretended project of universal freedom in opinion to advance the dark designs of those who employ them for excepting the antimonarchical principle and a few false notions about liberty i see but little agreement betwixt them and even in these i believe it would be impossible to contrive a frame of government that would please them all if they had it now in their power to try but however to be sure the presbyterian institution would never obtain for suppose they should in imitation of their predecessors propose to have no king but our saviour christ the whole clan of freethinkers would immediately object and refuse his authority neither would their lowchurch brethren use them better as well knowing what enemies they are to that doctrine of unlimited toleration wherever they are suffered to preside so that upon the whole i do not see as their present circumstances stand where the dissenters can find better quarter than from the church of england  besides i leave it to their consideration whether with all their zeal against the church they ought not to shew a little decency and how far it consists with their reputation to act in concert with such confederates it was reckoned a very infamous proceeding in the present most christian king to assist the turk against the emperor policy and reasons of state were not allowed sufficient excuses for taking part with an infidel against a believer it is one of the dissenters quarrels against the church that she is not enough reformed from popery yet they boldly entered into a league with papists and a popish prince to destroy her they profess much sanctity and object against the wicked lives of some of our members yet they have been long and still continue in strict combination with libertines and atheists to contrive our ruin what if the jews should multiply and become a formidable party among us would the dissenters join in alliance with them likewise because they agree already in some general principles and because the jews are allowed to be a stiffnecked and rebellious people  it is the part of wise men to conceal their passions when they are not in circumstances of exerting them to purpose the arts of getting power and preserving indulgence are very different for the former the reasonable hopes of the dissenters seem to be at an end their comrades the whigs and freethinkers are just in a condition proper to be forsaken and the parliament as well as the body of the people will be deluded no longer besides it sometimes happens for a cause to be exhausted and worn out as that of the whigs in general seems at present to be the nation has had enough of it it is as vain to hope restoring that decayed interest as for a man of sixty to talk of entering on a new scene of life that is only proper for youth and vigour new circumstances and new men must arise as well as new occasions which are not like to happen in our time so that the dissenters have no game left at present but to secure their indulgence in order to which i will be so bold to offer them some advice  first that until some late proceedings are a little forgot they would take care not to provoke by any violence of tongue or pen so great a majority as there is now against them nor keep up any longer that combination with their broken allies but disperse themselves and lie dormant against some better opportunity i have shewn they could have got no advantage if the late party had prevailed and they will certainly lose none by its fall unless through their own fault they pretend a mighty veneration for the queen let them give proof of it by quitting the ruined interest of those who have used her so ill and by a due respect to the persons she is pleased to trust at present with her affairs when they can no longer hope to govern when struggling can do them no good and may possibly hurt them what is left but to be silent and passive  secondly though there be no law beside that of god almighty against occasional conformity5 it would be prudence in the dissenters to use it as tenderly as they can for besides the infamous hypocrisy of the thing itself too frequent practice would perhaps make a remedy necessary and after all they have said to justify themselves in this point it still continues hard to conceive how those consciences can pretend to be scrupulous upon which an employment has more power than the love of unity  in the last place i am humbly of opinion that the dissenters would do well to drop that lesson they have learned from their directors of affecting to be under horrible apprehensions that the tories are in the interests of the pretender and would be ready to embrace the first opportunity of inviting him over it is with the worst grace in the world that they offer to join in the cry upon this article as if those who alone stood in the gap against all the encroachments of popery and arbitrary power are not more likely to keep out both than a set of schismatics who to gratify their ambition and revenge did by the meanest compliances encourage and spirit up that unfortunate prince to fell upon such measures as must at last have ended in the ruin of our liberty and religion  i wish those who give themselves the trouble to write to the examiner would consider whether what they send be proper for such a paper to take notice of i had one letter last week written as i suppose by a divine to desire i would offer some reasons against a bill now before the parliament for ascertaining the tithe of hops6 from which the writer apprehends great damage to the clergy especially the poorer vicars if it be as he says and he seems to argue very reasonably upon it the convocation now sitting will no doubt upon due application represent the matter to the house of commons and he may expect all justice and favour from that great body who have already appeared so tender of their rights  a gentleman likewise who hath sent me several letters relating to personal hardships he received from some of the late ministry is advised to publish a

language of late the style is now among the reasonable part of them when they meet a man in business or a member of parliament well gentlemen if you go on as you have hitherto done we shall no longer have any pretence to complain they find it seems that there have been yet no overtures made to bring in the pretender nor any preparatory steps towards it they read no enslaving votes nor bills brought in to endanger the subject the indulgence to scrupulous consciences3 is again confirmed from the throne inviolably preserved and not the least whisper offered that may affect it all care is taken to support the war supplies cheerfully granted and funds readily subscribed to in spite of the little arts made use of to discredit them the just resentments of some which are laudable in themselves and which at another juncture it might be proper to give way to have been softened or diverted by the calmness of others so that upon the article of present management i do not see how any objection of weight can well be raised  however our adversaries still allege that this great success was wholly unexpected and out of all probable view that in public affairs we ought least of all others to judge by events that the attempt of changing a ministry during the difficulties of a long war was rash and inconsiderate that if the queen were disposed by her inclinations or from any personal dislike for such a change it might have been done with more safety in a time of peace that if it had miscarried by any of those incidents which in all appearance might have intervened the consequences would perhaps have ruined the whole confederacy and therefore however it hath now succeeded the experiment was too dangerous to try  but this is what we can by no means allow them we never will admit rashness or chance to have produced all this harmony and order it is visible to the world that the several steps towards this change were slowly taken and with the utmost caution the movers observed as they went on how matters would bear and advanced no farther at first than so as they might be able to stop or go back if circumstances were not mature things were grown to such a height that it was no longer the question whether a person who aimed at an employment were a whig or a tory much less whether he had merit or proper abilities for what he pretended to he must owe his preferment only to the favourites and the crown was so far from nominating that they would not allow it a negative this the queen was resolved no longer to endure and began to break into their prescription by bestowing one or two places of consequence4 without consulting her ephori after they had fixed them for others and concluded as usually that all their business was to signify their pleasure to her majesty but though the persons the queen had chosen were such as no objection could well be raised against upon the score of party yet the oligarchy took the alarm5 their sovereign authority was it seems called in question they grew into anger and discontent as if their undoubted rights were violated all former obligations to their sovereign now became cancelled and they put themselves upon the foot of people who were hardly used after the most eminent services  i believe all men who know any thing in politics will agree that a prince thus treated by those he has most confided in and perpetually loaded with his favours ought to extricate himself as soon as possible and is then only blamable in his choice of time when he defers one minute after it is in his power because from the monstrous encroachments of exorbitant avarice and ambition he cannot tell how long it may continue to be so and it will be found upon enquiring into history that most of those princes who have been ruined by favourites have owed their misfortune to the neglect of early remedies deferring to struggle till they were quite sunk  the whigs are every day cursing the ungovernable rage the haughty pride and unsatiable covetousness of a certain person6 as the cause of their fall and are apt to tell their thoughts that one single removal might have set all things right but the interests of that single person were found upon experience so complicated and woven with the rest by love by awe by marriage by alliance that they would rather confound heaven and earth than dissolve such an union  i have always heard and understood that a king of england possessed of his peoples hearts at the head of a free parliament and in full agreement with a great majority made the true figure in the world that such a monarch ought to do and pursued the real interest of himself and his kingdom will they allow her majesty to be in those circumstances at present and was it not plain by the addresses sent from all parts of the island7 and by the visible disposition of the people that such a parliament would undoubtedly be chosen and so it proved without the courts using any arts to influence elections  what people then are these in a corner to whom the constitution must truckle if the whole nations credit cannot supply funds for the war without humble application from the entire legislature to a few retailers of money it is high time we should sue for a peace what new maxims are these which neither we nor our forefathers ever heard of before and which no wise institution would ever allow must our laws from henceforward pass the bank and east india company or have their royal assent before they are in force  to hear some of those worthy reasoners talking of credit that she is so nice so squeamish so capricious you would think they were describing a lady troubled with vapours or the colick to be only removed by a course of steel and swallowing a bullet by the narrowness of their thoughts one would imagine they conceived the world to be no wider than exchange alley it is probable they may have such a sickly dame among them and it is well if she has no worse diseases considering what hands she passes through but the national credit is of another complexion of sound health and an even temper her life and existence being a quintessence drawn from the vitals of the whole kingdom and we find these moneypoliticians after all their noise to be of the same opinion by the court they paid her when she lately appeared to them in the form of a lottery8  as to that mighty error in politics they charge upon the queen for changing her ministry in the height of a war i suppose it is only looked upon as an error under a whiggish administration otherwise the late king has much to answer for who did it pretty frequently and it is well known that the late ministry of famous memory was brought in during this present war9 only with this circumstance that two or three of the chief did first change their own principles and then took in suitable companions  but however i see no reason why the tories should not value their wisdom by events as well as the whigs nothing was ever thought a more precipitate rash counsel than that of altering the coin at the juncture it was done10 yet the prudence of the undertaking was sufficiently justified by the success perhaps it will be said that the attempt was necessary because the whole species of money was so grievously clipped and counterfeit and is not her majestys authority as sacred as her coin and has not that been most scandalously clipped and mangled and often counterfeited too  it is another grievous complaint of the whigs that their late friends and the whole party are treated with abundance of severity in print and in particular by the examiner they think it hard that when they are wholly deprived of power hated by the people and out of all hope of reestablishing themselves their infirmities should be so often displayed in order to render them yet more odious to mankind this is what they employ their writers to set forth in their papers of the week and it is humoursome enough to observe one page taken up in railing at the examiner for his invectives against a discarded ministry and the other side filled with the falsest and vilest abuses against those who are now in the highest power and credit with their sovereign and whose least breath would scatter them into silence and obscurity however though i have indeed often wondered to see so much licentiousness taken and connived at and am sure it would not be suffered in any other country of christendom yet i never once invoked the assistance of the gaol or the pillory which upon the least provocation was the usual style during their tyranny there hath not passed a week these twenty years without some malicious paper scattered in every coffeehouse by the emissaries of that party whether it were down or up i believe they will not pretend to object the same thing to us nor do i remember any constant weekly paper with reflections on the late ministry or junto they have many weak defenceless parts they have not been used to a regular attack and therefore it is that they are so ill able to endure one when it comes to be their turn so that they complain more of a few months truths from us than we did of all their scandal and malice for twice as many years  i cannot forbear observing upon this occasion that those worthy authors i am speaking of seem to me not fairly to represent the sentiments of their party who in disputing with us do generally give up several of the late ministry and freely own many of their failings they confess the monstrous debt upon the navy to have been caused by most scandalous mismanagement they allow the insolence of some and the avarice of others to have been insupportable but these gentlemen are most liberal in their praises to those persons and upon those very articles where their wisest friends give up the point they gravely tell us that such a one was the most faithful servant that ever any prince had another the most dutiful a third the most generous and a fourth of the greatest integrity so that i look upon these champions rather as retained by a cabal than a party which i desire the reasonable men among them would please to consider

should always outgrow not only the prudence and caution of private persons but the continual expedients of the wisest laws contrived to prevent it i cannot imagine a knave to possess a greater share of natural wit or genius than an honest man i have known very notable sharpers at play who upon all other occasions were as great dunces as human shape can well allow and i believe the same might be observed among the other knots of thieves and pickpockets about this town the proposition however is certainly true and to be confirmed by an hundred instances a scrivener an attorney a stockjobber and many other retailers of fraud shall not only be able to overreach others much wiser than themselves but find out new inventions to elude the force of any law made against them i suppose the reason of this may be that as the aggressor is said to have generally the advantage of the defender so the makers of the law which is to defend our rights have usually not so much industry or vigour as those whose interest leads them to attack it besides it rarely happens that men are rewarded by the public for their justice and virtue neither do those who act upon such principles expect any recompense till the next world whereas fraud where it succeeds gives present pay and this is allowed the greatest spur imaginable both to labour and invention when a law is made to stop some growing evil the wits of those whose interest it is to break it with secrecy or impunity are immediately at work and even among those who pretend to fairer characters many would gladly find means to avoid what they would not be thought to violate they desire to reap the advantage if possible without the shame or at least without the danger this art is what i take that dexterous race of men sprung up soon after the revolution to have studied with great application ever since and to have arrived at great perfection in it according to the doctrine of some romish casuists they have found out quam propè ad peccatum sine peccato possint accedere3 they can tell how to go within an inch of an impeachment and yet come back untouched they know what degree of corruption will just forfeit an employment and whether the bribe you receive be sufficient to set you right and put something in your pocket besides how much to a penny you may safely cheat the queen whether forty fifty or sixty per cent according to the station you are in and the dispositions of the persons in office below and above you they have computed the price you may securely take or give for a place or what part of the salary you ought to reserve they can discreetly distribute five hundred pounds in a small borough without any danger from the statutes against bribing elections they can manage a bargain for an office by a third fourth or fifth hand so that you shall not know whom to accuse and win a thousand guineas at play in spite of the dice and send away the loser satisfied they can pass the most exorbitant accounts overpay the creditor with half his demands and sink the rest  it would be endless to relate or rather indeed impossible to discover the several arts which curious men have found out to enrich themselves by defrauding the public in defiance of the law the military men both by sea and land have equally cultivated this most useful science neither hath it been altogether neglected by the other sex of which on the contrary i could produce an instance that would make ours blush to be so far outdone  besides to confess the truth our laws themselves are extremely defective in many articles which i take to be one ill effect of our best possession liberty some years ago the ambassador of a great prince was arrested4 and outrages committed on his person in our streets without any possibility of redress from westminsterhall or the prerogative of the sovereign and the legislature was forced to provide a remedy against the like evils in times to come a commissioner of the stamped paper5 was lately discovered to have notoriously cheated the public of great sums for many years by counterfeiting the stamps which the law had made capital but the aggravation of his crime proved to be the cause that saved his life and that additional heightening circumstance of betraying his trust was found to be a legal defence i am assured that the notorious cheat of the brewers at portsmouth6 detected about two months ago in parliament cannot by any law now in force be punished in any degree equal to the guilt and infamy of it nay what is almost incredible had guiscard survived his detestable attempt upon mr harleys person all the inflaming circumstances of the fact would not have sufficed in the opinion of many lawyers to have punished him with death7 and the public must have lain under this dilemma either to condemn him by a law ex post facto which would have been of dangerous consequence and form an ignominious precedent or undergo the mortification to see the greatest villain upon earth escape unpunished to the infinite triumph and delight of popery and faction but even this is not to be wondered at when we consider that of all the insolences offered to the queen since the act of indemnity at least that ever came to my ears i can hardly instance above two or three which by the letter of the law could amount to high treason  from these defects in our laws and the want of some discretionary power safely lodged to exert upon emergencies as well as from the great acquirements of able men to elude the penalties of those laws they break it is no wonder the injuries done to the public are so seldom redressed but besides no individual suffers by any wrong he does to the commonwealth in proportion to the advantage he gains by doing it there are seven or eight millions who contribute to the loss while the whole gain is sunk among a few the damage suffered by the public is not so immediately or heavily felt by particular persons and the zeal of prosecution is apt to drop and be lost among numbers  but imagine a set of politicians for many years at the head of affairs the game visibly their own and by consequence acting with great security may not these be sometimes tempted to forget their caution by length of time by excess of avarice and ambition by the insolence or violence of their nature or perhaps by a mere contempt for their adversaries may not such motives as these put them often upon actions directly against the law such as no evasions can be found for and which will lay them fully open to the vengeance of a prevailing interest whenever they are out of power it is answered in the affirmative and here we cannot refuse the late ministry their due praises who foreseeing a storm provided for their own safety by two admirable expedients by which with great prudence they have escaped the punishments due to pernicious counsels and corrupt management the first was to procure under pretences hardly specious a general act of indemnity8 which cuts off all impeachments the second was yet more refined suppose for instance a counsel is to be pursued which is necessary to carry on the dangerous designs of a prevailing party to preserve them in power to gratify the immeasurable appetites of a few leaders civil and military though by hazarding the ruin of the whole nation this counsel desperate in itself unprecedented in the nature of it they procure a majority to form into an address9 which makes it look like the sense of the nation under that shelter they carry on their work and lie secure against afterreckonings  i must be so free to tell my meaning in this that among other things i understand it of the address made to the queen about three years ago to desire that her majesty would not consent to a peace without the entire restitution of spain10 a proceeding which to people abroad must look like the highest strain of temerity folly and gasconade but we at home who allow the promoters of that advice to be no fools can easily comprehend the depth and mystery of it they were assured by this means to pin down the war upon us consequently to increase their own power and wealth and multiply difficulties on the queen and kingdom till they had fixed their party too firmly to be shaken whenever they should find themselves disposed to reverse their address and give us leave to wish for a peace  if any man entertains a more favourable opinion of this monstrous step in politics i would ask him what we must do in case we find it impossible to recover spain those among the whigs who believe a god will confess that the events of war lie in his hands and the rest of them who acknowledge no such power will allow that fortune hath too great a share in the good or ill success of military actions to let a wise man reason upon them as if they were entirely in his power if providence shall think fit to refuse success to our arms with how ill a grace with what shame and confusion shall we be obliged to recant that precipitate address unless the world will be so charitable to consider that parliaments among us differ as much as princes and that by the fatal conjunction of many unhappy circumstances it is very possible for our island to be represented sometimes by those who have the least pretensions to it so little truth or justice there is in what some pretend to advance that the actions of former senates ought always to be treated with respect by the latter that those assemblies are all equally venerable and no one to be preferred before another by which argument the parliament that began the rebellion against king charles the first voted his trial and appointed his murderers ought to be remembered with respect  but to return from this digression it is very plain that considering the defectiveness of our laws the variety of cases the weakness of the prerogative the power or the cunning of illdesigning men it is possible that many great abuses may be visibly committed which cannot be legally punished especially if we add to this that some enquiries might probably involve those whom upon other accounts it is not thought convenient to disturb therefore it is very false reasoning especially in the management of public affairs to argue that men are innocent because the law hath not pronounced them guilty  i am apt to think it was to supply such defects as these that satire was first introduced into the world whereby those whom neither religion nor natural virtue nor fear of punishment were able to keep within the bounds of their duty might be withheld by the shame of having their crimes exposed to open view in the strongest colours and themselves rendered odious to mankind perhaps all this may be little regarded by such hardened and abandoned natures as i have to deal with but next to taming or binding a savage animal the best service you can do the neighbourhood is to give them warning either to arm themselves or not come in its way  could i have hoped for any signs of remorse from the leaders of that faction i should very gladly have changed my style and forgot or passed by their million of enormities but they are every day more fond of discovering their impotent zeal and malice witness their conduct in the city about a fortnight ago11 which had no other end imaginable beside that of perplexing our affairs and endeavouring to make things desperate that themselves may be thought necessary while they continue in this frantic mood i shall not forbear to treat them as they deserve

and tories upon each other we charge the former with a design of destroying the established church and introducing fanaticism and freethinking in its stead we accuse them as enemies to monarchy as endeavouring to undermine the present form of government and to build a commonwealth or some new scheme of their own upon its ruins on the other side their clamours against us may be summed up in those three formidable words popery arbitrary power and the pretender our accusations against them we endeavour to make good by certain overt acts such as their perpetually abusing the whole body of the clergy their declared contempt for the very order of priesthood their aversion for episcopacy the public encouragement and patronage they gave to tindall toland and other atheistical writers their appearing as professed advocates retained by the dissenters excusing their separation and laying the guilt of it to the obstinacy of the church their frequent endeavours to repeal the test and their setting up the indulgence to scrupulous consciences as a point of greater importance than the established worship the regard they bear to our monarchy hath appeared by their open ridiculing the martyrdom of king charles the first in their calveshead clubs3 their common discourses and their pamphlets their denying the unnatural war raised against that prince to have been a rebellion their justifying his murder in the allowed papers of the week their industry in publishing and spreading seditious and republican tracts such as ludlows memoirs sidney of government4 and many others their endless lopping of the prerogative and mincing into nothing her majestys titles to the crown  what proofs they bring for our endeavouring to introduce popery arbitrary power and the pretender i cannot readily tell and would be glad to hear however those important words having by dexterous management been found of mighty service to their cause though applied with little colour either of reason or justice i have been considering whether they may not be adapted to more proper objects  as to popery which is the first of these to deal plainly i can hardly think there is any set of men among us except the professors of it who have any direct intention to introduce it among us but the question is whether the principles and practices of us or the whigs be most likely to make way for it it is allowed on all hands that among the methods concerted at rome for bringing over england into the bosom of the catholic church one of the chief was to send jesuits and other emissaries in lay habits who personating tradesmen and mechanics should mix with the people and under the pretence of a further and purer reformation endeavour to divide us into as many sects as possible which would either put us under the necessity of returning to our old errors to preserve peace at home or by our divisions make way for some powerful neighbour with the assistance of the popes permission and a consecrated banner to convert and enslave us at once if this hath been reckoned good politics and it was the best the jesuit schools could invent i appeal to any man whether the whigs for many years past have not been employed in the very same work they professed on all occasions that they knew no reason why any one system of speculative opinions as they termed the doctrines of the church should be established by law more than another or why employments should be confined to the religion of the magistrate and that called the church established the grand maxim they laid down was that no man for the sake of a few notions and ceremonies under the names of doctrine and discipline should be denied the liberty of serving his country as if places would go a begging unless brownists familists sweetsingers quakers anabaptists and muggletonians would take them off our hands  i have been sometimes imagining this scheme brought to perfection and how diverting it would look to see half a dozen sweetsingers on the bench in their ermines and two or three quakers with their white staves at court i can only say this project is the very counterpart of the late king jamess design which he took up as the best method for introducing his own religion under the pretext of an universal liberty of conscience and that no difference in religion should make any in his favour accordingly to save appearances he dealt some employments among dissenters of most denominations and what he did was no doubt in pursuance of the best advice he could get at home or abroad and the church thought it the most dangerous step he could take for her destruction it is true king james admitted papists among the rest which the whigs would not but this is sufficiently made up by a material circumstance wherein they seem to have much outdone that prince and to have carried their liberty of conscience to a higher point having granted it to all the classes of freethinkers which the nice conscience of a popish prince would not give him leave to do and was therein mightily overseen because it is agreed by the learned that there is but a very narrow step from atheism to the other extreme superstition so that upon the whole whether the whigs had any real design of bringing in popery or no it is very plain that they took the most effectual step towards it and if the jesuits had been their immediate directors they could not have taught them better nor have found apter scholars  their second accusation is that we encourage and maintain arbitrary power in princes and promote enslaving doctrines among the people this they go about to prove by instances producing the particular opinions of certain divines in king charles the seconds reign a decree of oxford university5 and some few writers since the revolution what they mean is the principle of passive obedience and nonresistance which those who affirm did i believe never intend should include arbitrary power however though i am sensible that it is not reckoned prudent in a dispute to make any concessions without the last necessity yet i do agree that in my own private opinion some writers did carry that tenet of passive obedience to a height which seemed hardly consistent with the liberties of a country whose laws can be neither enacted nor repealed without the consent of the whole people i mean not those who affirm it due in general as it certainly is to the legislature but such as fix it entirely in the princes person this last has i believe been done by a very few but when the whigs quote authors to prove it upon us they bring in all who mention it as a duty in general without applying it to princes abstracted from their senate  by thus freely declaring my own sentiments of passive obedience it will at least appear that i do not write for a party neither do i upon any occasion pretend to speak their sentiments but my own the majority of the two houses and the present ministry if those be a party seem to me in all their proceedings to pursue the real interest of church and state and if i shall happen to differ from particular persons among them in a single notion about government i suppose they will not upon that account explode me and my paper however as an answer once for all to the tedious scurrilities of those idle people who affirm i am hired and directed what to write6 i must here inform them that their censure is an effect of their principles the present ministry are under no necessity of employing prostitute pens they have no dark designs to promote by advancing heterodox opinions  but to return suppose two or three private divines under king charles the second did a little overstrain the doctrine of passive obedience to princes some allowance might be given to the memory of that unnatural rebellion against his father and the dismal consequences of resistance it is plain by the proceedings of the churchmen before and at the revolution that this doctrine was never designed to introduce arbitrary power7  i look upon the whigs and dissenters to be exactly of the same political faith let us therefore see what share each of them had in advancing arbitrary power it is manifest that the fanatics made cromwell the most absolute tyrant in christendom8 the rump abolished the house of lords the army abolished the rump and by this army of saints he governed the dissenters took liberty of conscience and employments from the late king james as an acknowledgment of his dispensing power which makes a king of england as absolute as the turk the whigs under the late king perpetually declared for keeping up a standing army in times of peace which has in all ages been the first and great step to the ruin of liberty they were besides discovering every day their inclinations to destroy the rights of the church and declared their opinion in all companies against the bishops sitting in the house of peers which was exactly copying after their predecessors of fortyone i need not say their real intentions were to make the king absolute but whatever be the designs of innovating men they usually end in a tyranny as we may see by an hundred examples in greece and in the later commonwealths of italy mentioned by machiavel  in the third place the whigs accuse us of a design to bring in the pretender and to give it a greater air of probability they suppose the queen to be a party in this design which however is no very extraordinary supposition in those who have advanced such singular paradoxes concerning gregg and guiscard upon this article their charge is general without ever offering to produce an instance but i verily think and believe it will appear no paradox that if ever he be brought in the whigs are his men for first it is an undoubted truth that a year or two after the revolution several leaders of that party had their pardons sent them by the late king james9 and had entered upon measures to restore him on account of some disobligations they received from king william besides i would ask whether those who are under the greatest ties of gratitude to king james are not at this day become the most zealous whigs and of what party those are now who kept a long correspondence with st germains  it is likewise very observable of late that the whigs upon all occasions profess their belief of the pretenders being no impostor but a real prince born of the late queens body10 which whether it be true or false is very unseasonably advanced considering the weight such an opinion must have with the vulgar if they once thoroughly believe it neither is it at all improbable that the pretender himself puts his chief hopes in the friendship he expects from the dissenters and whigs by his choice to invade the kingdom when the latter were most in credit and he had reason to count upon the former from the gracious treatment they received from his supposed father and their joyful acceptance of it but further what could be more consistent with the whiggish notion of a revolutionprinciple than to bring in the pretender a revolutionprinciple as their writings and discourses have taught us to define it is a principle perpetually disposing men to revolutions and this is suitable to the famous saying of a great whig that the more revolutions the better which how odd a maxim soever in appearance i take to be the true characteristic of the party  a dog loves to turn round often yet after certain revolutions he lies down to rest but heads under the dominion of the moon are for perpetual changes and perpetual revolutions besides the whigs owe all their wealth to wars and revolutions like the girl at bartholomewfair who gets a penny by turning round a hundred times with swords in her hands11  to conclude the whigs have a natural faculty of bringing in pretenders and will therefore probably endeavour to bring in the great one at last how many pretenders to wit honour nobility politics have they brought in these last twenty years in short they have been sometimes able to procure a majority of pretenders in parliament and wanted nothing to render the work complete except a pretender at

i took up a paper4 some days ago in a coffeehouse and if the correctness of the style and a superior spirit in it had not immediately undeceived me i should have been apt to imagine i had been reading an examiner in this paper there were several important propositions advanced for instance that providence raised up mr harley to be an instrument of great good in a very critical juncture when it was much wanted that his very enemies acknowledge his eminent abilities and distinguishing merit by their unwearied and restless endeavours against his person and reputation that they have had an inveterate malice against both that he has been wonderfully preserved from some unparalleled attempts with more to the same purpose i immediately computed by rules of arithmetic that in the last cited words there was something more intended than the attempt of guiscard which i think can properly pass but for one of the some and though i dare not pretend to guess the authors meaning yet the expression allows such a latitude that i would venture to hold a wager most readers both whig and tory have agreed with me that this plural number must in all probability among other facts take in the business of gregg5  see now the difference of styles had i been to have told my thoughts on this occasion instead of saying how mr harley was treated by some persons and preserved from some unparalleled attempts i should with intolerable bluntness and ill manners have told a formal story of a committee6 sent to a condemned criminal in newgate to bribe him with a pardon on condition he would swear high treason against his master who discovered his correspondence and secured his person when a certain grave politician had given him warning to make his escape and by this means i should have drawn a whole swarm of hedgewriters to exhaust their catalogue of scurrilities against me as a liar and a slanderer but with submission to the author of that forementioned paper i think he has carried that expression to the utmost it will bear for after all this noise i know of but two attempts against mr harley that can really be called unparalleled which are those aforesaid of gregg and guiscard and as to the rest i will engage to parallel them from the story of catiline and others i could produce  however i cannot but observe with infinite pleasure that a great part of what i have charged upon the late prevailing faction and for affirming which i have been adorned with so many decent epithets hath been sufficiently confirmed at several times by the resolutions of one or the other house of parliament7 i may therefore now say i hope with good authority that there have been some unparalleled attempts against mr harley that the late ministry were justly to blame in some management which occasioned the unfortunate battle of almanza8 and the disappointment at toulon9 that the public has been grievously wronged by most notorious frauds during the whig administration that those who advised the bringing in the palatines10 were enemies to the kingdom that the late managers of the revenue have not duly passed their accounts11 for a great part of thirtyfive millions and ought not to be trusted in such employments any more perhaps in a little time i may venture to affirm some other paradoxes of this kind and produce the same vouchers and perhaps also if it had not been so busy a period instead of one examiner the late ministry might have had above four hundred each of whose little fingers would be heavier than my loins it makes me think of neptunes threat to the winds    quos egosed motos praestat componere fluctus12  thus when these sons of aeolus had almost sunk the ship with the tempests they raised it was necessary to smooth the ocean and secure the vessel instead of pursuing the offenders  but i observe the general expectation at present instead of dwelling any longer upon conjectures who is to be punished for past miscarriages seems bent upon the rewards intended to those who have been so highly instrumental in rescuing our constitution from its late dangers it is the observation of tacitus in the life of agricola that his eminent services had raised a general opinion of his being designed by the emperor for praetor of britain nullis in hoc suis sermonibus sed quia par videbatur and then he adds non semper errat fama aliquando et eligit13 the judgment of a wise prince and the general disposition of the people do often point at the same person and sometimes the popular wishes do even foretell the reward intended for some superior merit thus among several deserving persons there are two14 whom the public vogue hath in a peculiar manner singled out as designed very soon to receive the choicest marks of the royal favour one of them to be placed in a very high station and both to increase the number of our nobility this i say is the general conjecture for i pretend to none nor will be chargeable if it be not fulfilled since it is enough for their honour that the nation thinks them worthy of the greatest rewards  upon this occasion i cannot but take notice that of all the heresies in politics profusely scattered by the partisans of the late administration none ever displeased me more or seemed to have more dangerous consequences to monarchy than that pernicious talent so much affected of discovering a contempt for birth family and ancient nobility all the threadbare topics of poets and orators were displayed to discover to us that merit and virtue were the only nobility and that the advantages of blood could not make a knave or a fool either honest or wise most popular commotions we read of in histories of greece and rome took their rise from unjust quarrels to the nobles and in the latter the plebeians encroachments on the patricians were the first cause of their ruin  suppose there be nothing but opinion in the difference of blood every body knows that authority is very much founded on opinion but surely that difference is not wholly imaginary the advantages of a liberal education of choosing the best companions to converse with not being under the necessity of practising little mean tricks by a scanty allowance the enlarging of thought and acquiring the knowledge of men and things by travel the example of ancestors inciting to great and good actions these are usually some of the opportunities that fall in the way of those who are born of what we call the better families and allowing genius to be equal in them and the vulgar the odds are clearly on their side nay we may observe in some who by the appearance of merit or favour of fortune have risen to great stations from an obscure birth that they have still retained some sordid vices of their parentage or education either insatiable avarice or ignominious falsehood and corruption  to say the truth the great neglect of education in several noble families whose sons are suffered to pass the most improvable seasons of their youth in vice and idleness have too much lessened their reputation but even this misfortune we owe among all the rest to that whiggish practice of reviling the universities under the pretence of their instilling pedantry narrow principles and highchurch doctrines  i would not be thought to undervalue merit and virtue wherever they are to be found but will allow them capable of the highest dignities in a state when they are in a very great degree of eminence a pearl holds its value though it be found in a dunghill but however that is not the most probable place to search for it nay i will go farther and admit that a man of quality without merit is just so much the worse for his quality which at once sets his vices in a more public view and reproaches him for them but on the other side i doubt those who are always undervaluing the advantages of birth and celebrating personal merit have principally an eye to their own which they are fully satisfied with and which nobody will dispute with them about whereas they cannot without impudence and folly pretend to be nobly born because this is a secret too easily discovered for no mens parentage is so nicely inquired into as that of assuming upstarts especially when they affect to make it better than it is as they often do or behave themselves with insolence  but whatever may be the opinion of others upon this subject whose philosophical scorn for blood and families reaches even to those that are royal or perhaps took its rise from a whiggish contempt of the latter i am pleased to find two such instances of extraordinary merit as i have mentioned joined with ancient and honourable birth which whether it be of real or imaginary value hath been held in veneration by all wise polite states both ancient and modern and as much a foppery as men pretend to think it nothing is more observable in those who rise to great place or wealth from mean originals than their mighty solicitude to convince the world that they are not so low as is commonly believed they are glad to find it made out by some strained genealogy that they have some remote alliance with better families cromwell himself was pleased with the impudence of a flatterer who undertook to prove him descended from a branch of the royal stem i know a citizen15 who adds or alters a letter in his name with every plum he acquires he now wants but the change of a vowel to be allied to a sovereign prince in italy and that perhaps he may contrive to be done by a mistake of the graver upon his tombstone  when i am upon this subject of nobility i am sorry for the occasion given me to mention the loss of a person who was so great an ornament to it as the late lord president16 who began early to distinguish himself in the public service and passed through the highest employments of state in the most difficult times with great abilities and untainted honour as he was of a good old age his principles of religion and loyalty had received no mixture from late infusions but were instilled into him by his illustrious father and other noble spirits who had exposed their lives and fortunes for the royal martyr              pulcherrima proles   magnanimi heroes nati melioribus annis17  his first great action was like scipio to defend his father18 when oppressed by numbers and his filial piety was not only rewarded with long life but with a son who upon the like occasion would have shewn the same resolution no man ever preserved his dignity better when he was out of power nor shewed more affability while he was in to conclude his character which i do not here pretend to draw is such as his nearest friends may safely trust to the most impartial pen nor wants the least of that allowance which they say is required for those who are dead   footnote 1 no

of endeavouring to convince the world that i am not partial and to confound the idle reproach of my being hired or directed what to write in defence of the present ministry3 or for detecting the practices of the former when i first undertook this paper i firmly resolved that if ever i observed any gross neglect abuse or corruption in the public management which might give any just offence to reasonable people i would take notice of it with that innocent boldness which becomes an honest man and a true lover of his country at the same time preserving the respect due to persons so highly entrusted by so wise and excellent a queen i know not how such a liberty might have been resented but i thank god there has been no occasion given me to exercise it for i can safely affirm that i have with the utmost rigour examined all the actions of the present ministry as far as they fall under general cognizance without being able to accuse them of one ill or mistaken step observing indeed some time ago that seeds of dissension4 had been plentifully scattered from a certain corner and fearing they began to rise and spread i immediately writ a paper on the subject which i treated with that warmth i thought it required but the prudence of those at the helm soon prevented this growing evil and at present it seems likely to have no consequences  i have had indeed for some time a small occasion of quarrelling which i thought too inconsiderable for a formal subject of complaint though i have hinted at it more than once but it is grown at present to as great a height as a matter of that nature can possibly bear and therefore i conceive it high time that an effectual stop should be put to it i have been amazed at the flaming licentiousness of several weekly papers which for some months past have been chiefly employed in barefaced scurrilities against those who are in the greatest trust and favour with the queen with the first and last letters of their names frequently printed or some periphrasis describing their station or other innuendoes contrived too plain to be mistaken the consequence of which is and it is natural it should be so that their long impunity hath rendered them still more audacious  at this time i particularly intend a paper called the medley whose indefatigable incessant railings against me i never thought convenient to take notice of because it would have diverted my design which i thought was of public use5 besides i never yet observed that writer or those writers for it is every way a medley to argue against any one material point or fact that i had advanced or make one fair quotation and after all i knew very well how soon the world grow weary of controversy it is plain to me that three or four hands at least have been joined at times in that worthy composition but the outlines as well as the finishing seem to have been always the work of the same pen as it is visible from half a score beauties of style inseparable from it but who these meddlers are or where the judicious leaders have picked them up i shall never go about to conjecture factious rancour false wit abandoned scurrility impudent falsehood and servile pedantry having so many fathers and so few to own them that curiosity herself would not be at the pains to guess it is the first time i ever did myself the honour to mention that admirable paper nor could i imagine any occasion likely to happen that would make it necessary for me to engage with such an adversary this paper is weekly published and as appears by the number has been so for several months and is next to the observator6 allowed to be the best production of the party last week my printer brought me that of may 7 numb 32 where there are two paragraphs7 relating to the speaker of the house of commons and to mr harley which as little as i am inclined to engage with such an antagonist i cannot let pass without failing in my duty to the public and if those in power will suffer such infamous insinuations to pass with impunity they act without precedent from any age or country of the world  i desire to open this matter and leave the whigs themselves to determine upon it the house of commons resolved nemine contradicente that the speaker should congratulate mr harleys escape and recovery8 in the name of the house upon his first attendance on their service this is accordingly done and the speech together with the chancellor of the exchequers are printed by order of the house9 the author of the medley takes this speech to task the very next week after it is published telling us in the aforesaid paper that the speakers commending mr harley for being an instrument of great good to the nation was illchosen flattery because mr harley had brought the nation under great difficulties to say no more he says that when the speaker tells mr harley that providence has wonderfully preserved him from some unparalleled attempts for that the medley alludes to he only revives a false and groundless calumny upon other men which is an instance of impotent but inveterate malice10 that makes him the speaker still appear more vile and contemptible this is an extract from his first paragraph in the next this writer says that the speakers praying to god for the continuance of mr harleys life as an invaluable blessing11 was a fulsome piece of insincerity which exposes him to shame and derision because he is known to bear ill will to mr harley to have an extreme bad opinion of him and to think him an obstructor of those fine measures he would bring about  i now appeal to the whigs themselves whether a great minister of state in high favour with the queen and a speaker of the house of commons were ever publicly treated after so extraordinary a manner in the most licentious times for this is not a clandestine libel stolen into the world but openly printed and sold with the booksellers name and place of abode at the bottom and the juncture is admirable when mr harley is generally believed upon the very point to be made an earl and promoted to the most important station of the kingdom12 nay the very marks of esteem he hath so lately received from the whole representative body of the people are called illchosen flattery and a fulsome piece of insincerity exposing the donors to shame and derision  does this intrepid writer think he has sufficiently disguised the matter by that stale artifice of altering the story and putting it as a supposed case did any man who ever saw the congratulatory speech read either of those paragraphs in the medley without interpreting them just as i have done will the author declare upon his great sincerity that he never had any such meaning is it enough that a jury at westminsterhall would perhaps not find him guilty of defaming the speaker and mr harley in that paper which however i am much in doubt of too and must think the law very defective if the reputation of such persons must lie at the mercy of such pens i do not remember to have seen any libel supposed to be writ with caution and double meaning in order to prevent prosecution delivered under so thin a cover or so unartificially made up as this whether it were from an apprehension of his readers dullness or an effect of his own he hath transcribed the very phrases of the speaker and put them in a different character for fear they might pass unobserved and to prevent all possibility of being mistaken i shall be pleased to see him have recourse to the old evasion and say that i who make the application am chargeable with the abuse let any reader of either party be judge but i cannot forbear asserting as my opinion that for a ministry to endure such open calumny without calling the author to account is next to deserving it and this is an omission i venture to charge upon the present ministry who are too apt to despise little things which however have not always little consequences  when this paper was first undertaken one design among others was to examine some of those writings so frequently published with an evil tendency either to religion or government but i was long diverted by other enquiries which i thought more immediately necessary to animadvert upon mens actions rather than their speculations to shew the necessity there was of changing the ministry that our constitution in church and state might be preserved to expose some dangerous principles and practices under the former administration and prove by many instances that those who are now at the helm are entirely in the true interest of prince and people this i may modestly hope hath in some measure been already done sufficient to answer the end proposed which was to inform the ignorant and those at distance and to convince such as are not engaged in a party from other motives than that of conscience i know not whether i shall have any appetite to continue this work much longer if i do perhaps some time may be spent in exposing and overturning the false reasonings of those who engage their pens on the other side without losing time in vindicating myself against their scurrilities much less in retorting them of this sort there is a certain humble companion a french maître de langues13 who every month publishes an extract from votes newspapers speeches and proclamations larded with some insipid remarks of his own which he calls the political state of great britain14 this ingenious piece he tells us himself is constantly translated into french and printed in holland where the dutch no doubt conceive most noble sentiments of us conveyed through such a vehicle it is observable in his account for april that the vanity so predominant in many of his nation has made him more concerned for the honour of guiscard than the safety of mr harley and for fear we should think the worse of his country upon that assassins account15 he tells us there have been more murders parricides and villanies committed in england than any other part of the world i cannot imagine how an illiterate foreigner who is neither master of our language or indeed of common sense and who is devoted to a faction i suppose for no other reason but his having more whig customers than tories should take it into his head to write politic tracts of our affairs but i presume he builds upon the foundation of having being called to an account for his insolence in one of his former monthly productions16 which is a method that seldom fails of giving some vogue to the foolishest composition if such a work must be done i wish some tolerable hand would undertake it and that we would not suffer a little whiffling frenchman to neglect his trade of teaching his language to our children and presume to instruct foreigners in our politics   footnote 1 no

examiner to be well instructed in them he having no other business but to flatter the new ministry and abuse the old the first paragraph runs  in the first place whenever any body would praise another all he can say will have no weight or effect if it be not true or probable if therefore for example my friend should take it into his head to commend a man for having been an instrument of great good to a nation when in truth that very person had brought that same nation under great difficulties to say no more such illchosen flattery would be of no use or moment nor add the least credit to the person so commended or if he should take that occasion to revive any false and groundless calumny upon other men or another party of men such an instance of impotent but inveterate malice would make him still appear more vile and contemptible the reason of all which is that what he said was neither just proper nor real and therefore must needs want the force of true eloquence which consists in nothing else but in well representing things as they really are i advise therefore my friend before he praises any more of his heroes to learn the common rules of writing and particularly to read over and over a certain chapter in aristotles first book of rhetoric where are given very proper and necessary directions for praising a man who has done nothing that he ought to be praised for  there is no reference here to the speaker the reference is to the examiner nor is there any mention of providence having wonderfully preserved him from some unparalleled attempts  the second paragraph runs  but the ancients did not think it enough for men to speak what was true or probable they required further that their orators should be heartily in earnest and that they should have all those motions and affections in their own minds which they endeavoured to raise in others he that thinks says cicero to warm others with his eloquence must first be warm himself and quintilian says we must first be affected ourselves before we can move others this made plinys panegyric upon trajan so well received by his hearers because every body knew the wonderful esteem and affection which he had for the person he commended and therefore when he concluded with a prayer to jupiter that he would take care of the life and safety of that great and good man which he said contained in it all other blessings though the expression was so high it passed very well with those that heard him as being agreeable to the known sentiments and affection of the speaker whereas if my friend should be known to bear illwill to another person or to have an extreme bad opinion of him or to think him an abstractor of those fine measures he would bring about and should yet in one of his panegyrics pray to god for the continuance of that very persons life as an invaluable blessing such a fulsome piece of insincerity would only expose him to shame and derision ts  footnote 8 the house of commons resolved on april

refeceris       aedesque labentes deorum2    several letters have been lately sent me desiring i would make honourable mention of the pious design of building fifty churches in several parts of london and westminster where they are most wanted occasioned by an address of the convocation to the queen3 and recommended by her majesty to the house of commons who immediately promised they would enable her to accomplish so excellent a design and are now preparing a bill accordingly i thought to have deferred any notice of this important affair till the end of this session at which time i proposed to deliver a particular account of the great and useful things already performed by this present parliament but in compliance to those who give themselves the trouble of advising me and partly convinced by the reasons they offer i am content to bestow a paper upon a subject that indeed so well deserves it  the clergy and whoever else have a true concern for the constitution of the church cannot but be highly pleased with one prospect in this new scene of public affairs they may very well remember the time when every session of parliament was like a cloud hanging over their heads and if it happened to pass without bursting into some storm upon the church we thanked god and thought it an happy escape till the next meeting upon which we resumed our secret apprehensions though we were not allowed to believe any danger things are now altered the parliament takes the necessities of the church into consideration receives the proposals of the clergy met in convocation and amidst all the exigencies of a long expensive war and under the pressure of heavy debts finds a supply for erecting fifty edifices for the service of god and it appears by the address of the commons to her majesty upon this occasion wherein they discovered a true spirit of religion that the applying the money granted to accomplish so excellent a design4 would in their opinion be the most effectual way of carrying on the war that it would to use their own words be a means of drawing down blessings on her majestys undertakings as it adds to the number of those places where the prayers of her devout and faithful subjects will be daily offered up to god for the prosperity of her government at home and the success of her arms abroad  i am sometimes hoping that we are not naturally so bad a people as we have appeared for some years past faction in order to support itself is generally forced to make use of such abominable instruments that as long as it prevails the genius of a nation is overpressed and cannot appear to exert itself but when that is broke and suppressed when things return to the old course mankind will naturally fall to act from principles of reason and religion the romans upon a great victory or escape from public danger frequently built a temple in honour of some god to whose peculiar favour they imputed their success or delivery and sometimes the general did the like at his own expense to acquit himself of some pious vow he had made how little of any thing resembling this hath been done by us after all our victories and perhaps for that reason among others they have turned to so little account but what could we expect we acted all along as if we believed nothing of a god or his providence and therefore it was consistent to offer up our edifices only to those whom we looked upon as givers of all victory in his stead  i have computed that fifty churches may be built by a medium at six thousand pound for a church which is somewhat under the price of a subjects palace yet perhaps the care of above two hundred thousand souls with the benefit of their prayers for the prosperity of their queen and country may be almost put in the balance with the domestic convenience or even magnificence of any subject whatsoever  sir william petty who under the name of captain graunt published some observations upon bills of mortality about five years after the restoration5 tells us the parishes in london were even then so unequally divided that some were two hundred times larger than others since that time the increase of trade the frequency of parliaments the desire of living in the metropolis together with that genius for building which began after the fire and hath ever since continued have prodigiously enlarged this town on all sides where it was capable of increase and those tracts of land built into streets have generally continued of the same parish they belonged to while they lay in fields so that the care of above thirty thousand souls hath been sometimes committed to one minister whose church would hardly contain the twentieth part of his flock neither i think was any family in those parishes obliged to pay above a groat a year to their spiritual pastor some few of those parishes have been since divided in others were erected chapels of ease where a preacher is maintained by general contribution such poor shifts and expedients to the infinite shame and scandal of so vast and flourishing a city have been thought sufficient for the service of god and religion as if they were circumstances wholly indifferent  this defect among other consequences of it hath made schism a sort of necessary evil there being at least three hundred thousand inhabitants in this town whom the churches would not be able to contain if the people were ever so well disposed and in a city not overstocked with zeal the only way to preserve any degree of religion is to make all attendance upon the duties of it as easy and cheap as possible whereas on the contrary in the larger parishes the press is so great and the pewkeepers tax so exorbitant that those who love to save trouble and money either stay at home or retire to the conventicles i believe there are few examples in any christian country of so great a neglect for religion and the dissenting teachers have made their advantages largely by it sowing tares among the wheat while men slept being much more expert at procuring contributions which is a trade they are bred up in than men of a liberal education  and to say truth the way practised by several parishes in and about this town of maintaining their clergy by voluntary subscriptions is not only an indignity to the character but hath many pernicious consequences attending it such a precarious dependence subjecting a clergyman who hath not more than ordinary spirit and resolution to many inconveniences which are obvious to imagine but this defect will no doubt be remedied by the wisdom and piety of the present parliament and a tax laid upon every house in a parish for the support of their pastor neither indeed can it be conceived why a house whose purchase is not reckoned above onethird less than land of the same yearly rent should not pay a twentieth part annually which is half tithe to the support of the minister one thing i could wish that in fixing the maintenance to the several ministers in these new intended parishes no determinate sum of money may be named which in all perpetuities ought by any means to be avoided but rather a tax in proportion to the rent of each house though it be but a twentieth or even a thirtieth part the contrary of this i am told was done in several parishes of the city after the fire where the incumbent and his successors were to receive for ever a certain sum for example one or two hundred pounds a year but the lawgivers did not consider that what we call at present one hundred pounds will in process of time have not the intrinsic value of twenty as twenty pounds now are hardly equal to forty shillings three hundred years ago there are a thousand instances of this all over england in reserved rents applied to hospitals in old chiefries and even among the clergy themselves in those payments which i think they call a modus6  as no prince had ever better dispositions than her present majesty for the advancement of true religion so there was never any age that produced greater occasions to employ them on it is an unspeakable misfortune that any designs of so excellent a queen should be checked by the necessities of a long and ruinous war which the folly or corruption of modern politicians have involved us in against all the maxims whereby our country flourished so many hundred years else her majestys care of religion would certainly have reached even to her american plantations those noble countries stocked by numbers from hence whereof too many are in no very great reputation for faith or morals will be a perpetual reproach to us till some better care is taken for cultivating christianity among them if the governors of those several colonies were obliged at certain times to transmit an exact representation of the state of religion in their several districts and the legislature here would in a time of leisure take that affair under their consideration it might be perfected with little difficulty and be a great addition to the glories of her majestys reign  but to waive further speculations upon so remote a scene while we have subjects enough to employ them on at home it is to be hoped the clergy will not let slip any proper opportunity of improving the pious dispositions of the queen and kingdom for the advantage of the church when by the example of times past they consider how rarely such conjunctures are like to happen what if some method were thought on towards repairing of churches for which there is like to be too frequent occasions those ancient gothic structures throughout this kingdom going every year to decay that expedient of repairing or rebuilding them by charitable collections seems in my opinion not very suitable either to the dignity and usefulness of the work or to the honour of our country since it might be so easily done with very little charge to the public in a much more decent and honourable manner while parliaments are so frequently called but these and other regulations must be left to a time of peace which i shall humbly presume to wish may soon be our share however offensive it may be to any either abroad or at home who are gainers by the war   footnote

use the cantwords of whig and tory which have so often varied their significations for twenty years past i think it necessary to say something of the several changes those two terms have undergone since that period and then to tell the reader what i have always understood by each of them since i undertook this work i reckon that these sorts of conceited appellations are usually invented by the vulgar who not troubling themselves to examine through the merits of a cause are consequently the most violent partisans of what they espouse and in their quarrels usually proceed to their beloved argument of calling names till at length they light upon one which is sure to stick and in time each party grows proud of that appellation which their adversaries at first intended for a reproach of this kind were the prasini and veneti3 the guelfs and ghibellines4 huguenots and papists roundheads and cavaliers5 with many others of ancient and modern date among us of late there seems to have been a barrenness of invention in this point the words whig and tory6 though they are not much above thirty years old having been pressed to the service of many successions of parties with very different ideas fastened to them this distinction i think began towards the latter part of king charles the seconds reign was dropped during that of his successor and then revived at the revolution since which it has perpetually flourished though applied to very different kinds of principles and persons in that convention of lords and commons7 some of both houses were for a regency to the prince of orange with a reservation of style and title to the absent king which should be made use of in all public acts others when they were brought to allow the throne vacant thought the succession should immediately go to the next heir according to the fundamental laws of the kingdom as if the last king were actually dead and though the dissenting lords in whose house the chief opposition was did at last yield both those points took the oaths to the new king and many of them employments yet they were looked upon with an evil eye by the warm zealots of the other side neither did the court ever heartily favour any of them though some were of the most eminent for abilities and virtue and served that prince both in his councils and his army with untainted faith it was apprehended at the same time and perhaps it might have been true that many of the clergy would have been better pleased with that scheme of a regency or at least an uninterrupted lineal succession for the sake of those whose consciences were truly scrupulous and they thought there were some circumstances in the case of the deprived bishops8 that looked a little hard or at least deserved commiseration  these and other the like reflections did as i conceive revive the denominations of whig and tory  some time after the revolution the distinction of high and lowchurch came in which was raised by the dissenters in order to break the church party by dividing the members into high and low and the opinions raised that the high joined with the papists inclined the low to fall in with the dissenters  and here i shall take leave to produce some principles which in the several periods of the late reign served to denote a man of one or the other party to be against a standing army in time of peace was all highchurch tory and tantivy9 to differ from a majority of bishops was the same to raise the prerogative above law for serving a turn was lowchurch and whig the opinion of the majority in the house of commons especially of the countryparty or landed interest was highflying10 and rank tory to exalt the kings supremacy beyond all precedent was lowchurch whiggish and moderate to make the least doubt of the pretended prince being supposititious and a tilers son was in their phrase top and topgallant and perfect jacobitism to resume the most exorbitant grants that were ever given to a set of profligate favourites and apply them to the public was the very quintessence of toryism notwithstanding those grants were known to be acquired by sacrificing the honour and the wealth of england  in most of these principles the two parties seem to have shifted opinions since their institution under king charles the second and indeed to have gone very different from what was expected from each even at the time of the revolution but as to that concerning the pretender the whigs have so far renounced it that they are grown the great advocates for his legitimacy which gives me the opportunity of vindicating a noble duke who was accused of a blunder in the house when upon a certain lords mentioning the pretended prince his grace told the lords he must be plain with them and call that person not the pretended prince but the pretended impostor which was so far from a blunder in that polite lord as his illwillers give out that it was only a refined way of delivering the avowed sentiments of his whole party  but to return this was the state of principles when the queen came to the crown some time after which it pleased certain great persons who had been all their lives in the altitude of toryprofession to enter into a treaty with the whigs from whom they could get better terms than from their old friends who began to be resty and would not allow monopolies of power and favour nor consent to carry on the war entirely at the expense of this nation that they might have pensions from abroad while another people more immediately concerned in the war traded with the enemy as in times of peace whereas the other party whose case appeared then as desperate was ready to yield to any conditions that would bring them into play and i cannot help affirming that this nation was made a sacrifice to the immeasurable appetite of power and wealth in a very few that shall be nameless who in every step they made acted directly against what they had always professed and if his royal highness the prince11 had died some years sooner who was a perpetual check in their career it is dreadful to think how far they might have proceeded  since that time the bulk of the whigs appears rather to be linked to a certain set of persons than any certain set of principles so that if i were to define a member of that party i would say he was one who believed in the late ministry and therefore whatever i have affirmed of whigs in any of these papers or objected against them ought to be understood either of those who were partisans of the late men in power and privy to their designs or such who joined with them from a hatred to our monarchy and church as unbelievers and dissenters of all sizes or men in office who had been guilty of much corruption and dreaded a change which would not only put a stop to further abuses for the future but might perhaps introduce examinations of what was past or those who had been too highly obliged to quit their supporters with any common decency or lastly the moneytraders who could never hope to make their markets so well of premiums and exorbitant interest and high remittances under any other administration  under these heads may be reduced the whole body of those whom i have all along understood for whigs for i do not include within this number any of those who have been misled by ignorance or seduced by plausible pretences to think better of that sort of men than they deserve and to apprehend mighty danger from their disgrace because i believe the greatest part of such wellmeaning people are now thoroughly converted  and indeed it must be allowed that those two fantastic names of whig and tory have at present very little relation to those opinions which were at first thought to distinguish them whoever formerly professed himself to approve the revolution to be against the pretender to justify the succession in the house of hanover to think the british monarchy not absolute but limited by laws which the executive power could not dispense with and to allow an indulgence to scrupulous consciences such a man was content to be called a whig on the other side whoever asserted the queens hereditary right that the persons of princes were sacred their lawful authority not to be resisted on any pretence nor even their usurpations without the most extreme necessity that breaches in the succession were highly dangerous that schism was a great evil both in itself and its consequences that the ruin of the church would probably be attended with that of the state that no power should be trusted with those who are not of the established religion such a man was usually called a tory now though the opinions of both these are very consistent and i really think are maintained at present by a great majority of the kingdom yet according as men apprehend the danger greater either from the pretender and his party or from the violence and cunning of other enemies to the constitution so their common discourses and reasonings turn either to the first or second set of these opinions i have mentioned and are consequently styled either whigs or tories which is as if two brothers apprehended their house would be set upon but disagreed about the place from whence they thought the robbers would come and therefore would go on different sides to defend it they must needs weaken and expose themselves by such a separation and so did we only our case was worse for in order to keep off a weak remote enemy from whom we could not suddenly apprehend any danger we took a nearer and a stronger one into the house i make no comparison at all between the two enemies popery and slavery are without doubt the greatest and most dreadful of any but i may venture to affirm that the fear of these have not at least since the revolution been so close and pressing upon us as that from another faction excepting only one short period when the leaders of that very faction invited the abdicating king to return of which i have formerly taken notice  having thus declared what sort of persons i have always meant under the denomination of whigs it will be easy to shew whom i understand by tories such whose principles in church and state are what i have above related whose actions are derived from thence and who have no attachment to any set of ministers further than as these are friends to the constitution in all its parts but will do their utmost to save their prince and country whoever be at the helm  by these descriptions of whig and tory i am sensible those names are given to several persons very undeservedly and that many a man is called by one or the other who has not the least title to the blame or praise i have bestowed on each of them throughout my papers   footnote 1 no 43

scotland from then using the words frequently in driving strings of horses hence as connected with calvinistical principles in religion and republican doctrines in policy it was given as a term of reproach to the opposition party in the latter years of charles ii these retorted upon the courtiers the word tory signifying an irish freebooter and particularly applicable to the roman catholic followers of the duke of york s  macaulays explanation of the origin of these two terms is somewhat different from that given by scott in scotland he says some of the persecuted covenanters driven mad by oppression had lately murdered the primate had taken aims against the government etc these zealots were most numerous among the rustics of the western lowlands who were vulgarly called whigs thus the appellation of whig was fastened on the presbyterian zealots of scotland and was transferred to those english politicians who showed a disposition to oppose the court and to treat protestant nonconformists with indulgence the bogs of ireland at the same time afforded a refuge to popish outlaws much resembling those who were afterwards known as whiteboys these men were then called tories

persons and of things that were raised and spread by the leaders and instruments of a certain party upon the change of the last ministry and dissolution of parliament if he be a true lover of his country must feel a mighty pleasure though mixed with some indignation to see the wishes the conjectures the endeavours of an inveterate faction entirely disappointed and this important period wholly spent in restoring the prerogative to the prince liberty to the subject in reforming past abuses preventing future supplying old deficiencies providing for debts restoring the clergy to their rights and taking care of the necessities of the church and all this unattended with any of those misfortunes which some men hoped for while they pretended to fear  for my own part i must confess the difficulties appeared so great to me from such a noise and shew of opposition that i thought nothing but the absolute necessity of affairs could ever justify so daring an attempt but a wise and good prince at the head of an able ministry and of a senate freely chosen all united to pursue the true interest of their country is a power against which the little inferior politics of any faction will be able to make no long resistance to this we may add one additional strength which in the opinion of our adversaries is the greatest and justest of any i mean the vox populi so indisputably declarative on the same side i am apt to think when these discarded politicians begin seriously to consider all this they will think it proper to give out and reserve their wisdom for some more convenient juncture  it was pleasant enough to observe that those who were the chief instruments of raising the noise who started fears bespoke dangers and formed ominous prognostics in order scare the allies to spirit the french and fright ignorant people at home made use of those very opinions themselves had broached for arguments to prove that the change of ministers was dangerous and unseasonable but if a house be swept the more occasion there is for such a work the more dust it will raise if it be going to ruin the repairs however necessary will make a noise and disturb the neighbourhood a while and as to the rejoicings made in france4 if it be true that they had any upon the news of those alterations among us their joy was grounded upon the same hopes with that of the whigs who comforted themselves that a change of ministry and parliament would infallibly put us all into confusion increase our divisions and destroy our credit wherein i suppose by this time they are equally undeceived  but this long session being in a manner ended5 which several circumstances and one accident altogether unforeseen have drawn out beyond the usual time it may be some small piece of justice to so excellent an assembly barely to mention a few of those great things they have done for the service of their queen and country which i shall take notice of just as they come to my memory  the credit of the nation began mightily to suffer by a discount upon exchequer bills which have been generally reckoned the surest and most sacred of all securities the present lord treasurer then a member of the house of commons proposed a method which was immediately complied with of raising them to a par with specie6 and so they have ever since continued  the british colonies of nevis and st christophers7 had been miserably plundered by the french their houses burnt their plantations destroyed and many of the inhabitants carried away prisoners they had often for some years past applied in vain for relief from hence till the present parliament considering their condition as a case of justice and mercy voted them one hundred thousand pound by way of recompense in some manner for their sufferings  some persons whom the voice of the nation authorizes me to call her enemies taking advantage of the general naturalization act had invited over a great number of foreigners of all religions under the name of palatines8 who understood no trade or handicraft yet rather chose to beg than labour9 who besides infesting our streets bred contagious diseases by which we lost in natives thrice the number of what we gained in foreigners the house of commons as a remedy against this evil brought in a bill for repealing that act of general naturalization which to the surprise of most people was rejected by the lords10 and upon this occasion i must allow myself to have been justly rebuked by one of my weekly monitors for pretending in a former paper to hope that law would be repealed wherein the commons being disappointed took care however to send many of the palatines away and to represent their being invited over as a pernicious counsel11  the qualification bill12 incapacitating all men to serve in parliament who have not some estate in land either in possession or certain reversion is perhaps the greatest security that ever was contrived for preserving the constitution which otherwise might in a little time lie wholly at the mercy of the moneyed interest and since much the greatest part of the taxes is paid either immediately from land or from the productions of it it is but common justice that those who are the proprietors should appoint what portion of it ought to go to the support of the public otherwise the engrossers of money would be apt to lay heavy loads on others which themselves never touch with one of their fingers  the public debts were so prodigiously increased by the negligence and corruption of those who had been managers of the revenue that the late ministers like careless men who run out their fortunes were so far from any thoughts of payment as they had not the courage to state or compute them the parliament found that thirtyfive millions had never been accounted for and that the debt on the navy wholly unprovided for amounted to nine millions13 the late chancellor of the exchequer suitable to his transcendent genius for public affairs proposed a fund to be security for that immense debt which is now confirmed by a law and is likely to prove the greatest restoration and establishment of the kingdoms credit14 nor content with this the legislature hath appointed commissioners of accompts to inspect into past mismanagements of the public money and prevent them for the future15  i have in a former paper mentioned the act for building fifty new churches in london and westminster16 with a fund appropriated for that pious and noble work but while i am mentioning acts of piety it would be unjust to conceal my lord high treasurers concern for religion which have extended even to another kingdom his lordship having some months ago obtained of her majesty a remission of the firstfruits and tenths to the clergy of ireland17 as he is known to have formerly done for that reverend body in this kingdom  the act for carrying on a trade to the southsea18 proposed by the same great person whose thoughts are perpetually employed and always with success on the good of his country will in all probability if duly executed be of mighty advantage to the kingdom and an everlasting honour to the present parliament19  i might go on further and mention that seasonable law against excessive gaming20 the putting a stop to that scandalous fraud of false musters in the guards21 the diligent and effectual enquiry made by the commons into several gross abuses22 i might produce many instances of their impartial justice in deciding controverted election against former example and great provocations to retaliate23 i might shew their cheerful readiness in granting such vast supplies their great unanimity not to be broken by all the arts of a malicious and cunning faction their unfeigned duty to the queen and lastly that representation made to her majesty from the house of commons discovering such a spirit and disposition in that noble assembly to redress all those evils which a long maladministration had brought upon us24  it is probable that trusting only to my memory i may have omitted many things of great importance neither do i pretend further in the compass of this paper than to give the world some general however imperfect idea how worthily this great assembly hath discharged the trust of those who so freely chose them and what we may reasonably hope and expect from the piety courage wisdom and loyalty of such excellent patriots in a time so fruitful of occasions to exert the greatest abilities  and now i conceive the main design i had in writing these papers is fully executed a great majority of the nation is at length thoroughly convinced that the queen proceeded with the highest wisdom in changing her ministry and parliament that under a former administration the greatest abuses of all kinds were committed and the most dangerous attempts against the constitution for some time intended the whole kingdom finds the present persons in power directly and openly pursuing the true service of their queen and country and to be such whom their most bitter enemies cannot tax with bribery covetousness ambition pride insolence or any pernicious principles in religion or government  for my own particular those little barking pens which have so constantly pursued me i take to be of no further consequence to what i have writ than the scoffing slaves of old placed behind the chariot to put the general in mind of his mortality25 which was but a thing of form and made no stop or disturbance in the shew however if those perpetual snarlers against me had the same design i must own they have effectually compassed it since nothing can well be more mortifying than to reflect that i am of the same species with creatures capable of uttering so much scurrility dullness falsehood and impertinence to the scandal and disgrace of human nature   footnote 1 no 44 in the reprint ts  footnote 2 to stella about this time swift wrote

of all descriptions and professions who came into holland with a view of emigrating to british america it was never accurately ascertained with what view or by whose persuasions their course was changed but by direction from the english ministers they were furnished with shipping to come to england in the settlements they would have been a valuable colony but in the vicinity of london this huge accession to the poor of the metropolis was a burthen and a nuisance they were encamped on blackheath near greenwich where so soon as their countrymen heard that they were supported by british charity the number of the fugitives began to increase by recruits from the continent till government prohibited further importation a general naturalization act passed in favour of the french protestants greatly encouraged this influx of strangers this matter was inquired into by the tory parliament who voted that the bringing over the palatines was an oppression on the nation and a waste of the public money and that he who advised it was an enemy to his country the unfortunate fugitives had been already dispersed some of them to north america some to ireland and some through britain the pretence alleged for the vote against them was the apprehension expressed by the guardians of the poor in several parishes that they might introduce contagious diseases but the real reason was a

least till they appear with new reinforcements i shall reckon them as such and therefore do now find myself at leisure to examine inferior abuses the business i have left is to fall on those wretches

sincerity of these their factors to shew how little those writers for the whigs were guided by conscience or honour their business being only to gratify a prevailing interest   to the right honourable

defence of the whigs against the church of england and the christian religion and her majestys prerogative and her title to the crown that since the late change of ministry and meeting of this parliament the said trade is mightily fallen off and the call for the said pamphlets and papers much less than formerly and it is feared to our further prejudice that the examiner may discontinue writing whereby some of your petitioners will be brought to utter distress forasmuch as through false quotations noted absurdities and other legal abuses many of your petitioners to their great comfort and support were enabled to pick up a weekly subsistence out of the said examiner  that your said poor petitioners did humbly offer your honours to write in defence of the late change of ministry and parliament much cheaper than they did for your predecessors which your honours were pleased to refuse  notwithstanding which offer your petitioners are under daily apprehension that your honours will forbid them to follow the said trade any longer by which your petitioners to the number of fourscore with their wives and families will inevitably starve having been bound to no other calling  your petitioners desire your honours will tenderly consider the premisses and suffer your said petitioners to continue their trade those who set them at work being still willing to employ them though at lower rates and your said petitioners will give security to make use of the same stuff and dress it in the same manner as they always did and no other and your petitioners c   footnote

i often mixed with the rabble and followed them a whole day together being wonderfully struck with the sight of everything that is new or uncommon i have since their departure employed a friend to make many enquiries of their landlord the upholsterer4 relating to their manners and conversation as also concerning the remarks which they made in this country for next to the forming a right notion of such strangers i should be desirous of learning what ideas they have conceived of us  the upholsterer finding my friend very inquisitive about these his lodgers brought him some time since a little bundle of papers which he assured him were written by king sa ga yean qua rash tow and as he supposes left behind by some mistake these papers are now translated and contain abundance of very odd observations which i find this little fraternity of kings made during their stay in the isle of great britain i shall present my reader with a short specimen of them in this paper and may perhaps communicate more to him hereafter in the article of london are the following words which without doubt are meant of the church of st paul  on the most rising part of the town there stands a huge house big enough to contain the whole nation of which i am king our good brother e tow o koam king of the rivers is of opinion it was made by the hands of that great god to whom it is consecrated the kings of granajah and of the six nations believe that it was created with the earth and produced on the same day with the sun and moon but for my own part by the best information that i could get of this matter i am apt to think that this prodigious pile was fashioned into the shape it now bears by several tools and instruments of which they have a wonderful variety in this country it was probably at first an huge misshapen rock that grew upon the top of the hill which the natives of the country after having cut it into a kind of regular figure bored and hollowed with incredible pains and industry till they had wrought in it all those beautiful vaults and caverns into which it is divided at this day as soon as this rock was thus curiously scooped to their liking a prodigious number of hands must have been employed in chipping the outside of it which is now as smooth as polished marble5 and is in several places hewn out into pillars that stand like the trunks of so many trees bound about the top with garlands of leaves it is probable that when this great work was begun which must have been many hundred years ago there was some religion among this people for they give it the name of a temple and have a tradition that it was designed for men to pay their devotions in and indeed there are several reasons which make us think that the natives of this country had formerly among them some sort of worship for they set apart every seventh day as sacred but upon my going into one of those holy houses on that day i could not observe any circumstance of devotion in their behaviour there was indeed a man in black who was mounted above the rest and seemed to utter something with a great deal of vehemence but as for those underneath him instead of paying their worship to the deity of the place they were most of them bowing and curtsying to one another and a considerable number of them fast asleep  the queen of the country appointed two men to attend us that had enough of our language to make themselves understood in some few particulars but we soon perceived these two were great enemies to one another and did not always agree in the same story we could make a shift to gather out of one of them that this island was very much infested with a monstrous kind of animals in the shape of men called whigs and he often told us that he hoped we should meet with none of them in our way for that if we did they would be apt to knock us down for being kings  our other interpreter used to talk very much of a kind of animal called a tory that was as great a monster as the whig and would treat us as ill for being foreigners6 these two creatures it seems are born with a secret antipathy to one another and engage when they meet as naturally as the elephant and the rhinoceros but as we saw none of either of these species we are apt to think that our guides deceived us with misrepresentations and fictions and amused us with an account of such monsters as are not really in their country  these particulars we made a shift to pick out from the discourse of our interpreters which we put together as well as we could being able to understand but here and there a word of what they said and afterwards making up the meaning of it among ourselves the men of the country are very cunning and ingenious in handicraft works but withal so very idle that we often saw young lusty rawboned fellows carried up and down the streets in little covered rooms by a couple of porters who are hired for that service their dress is likewise very barbarous for they almost strangle themselves about the neck and bind their bodies with many ligatures that we are apt to think are the occasion of several distempers among them which our country is entirely free from instead of those beautiful feathers with which we adorn our heads they often buy up a monstrous bush of hair which covers their heads and falls down in a large fleece below the middle of their backs with which they walk up and down the streets and are as proud of it as if it was of their own growth  we were invited to one of their public diversions where we hoped to have seen the great men of their country running down a stag or pitching a bar that we might have discovered who were the men of the greatest perfections in their country7 but instead of that they conveyed us into an huge room lighted up with abundance of candles where this lazy people sat still above three hours to see several feats of ingenuity performed by others who it seems were paid for it  as for the women of the country not being able to talk with them we could only make our remarks upon them at a distance they let the hair of their heads grow to a great length but as the men make a great show with heads of hair that are none of their own the women who they say have very fine heads of hair tie it up in a knot and cover it from being seen the women look like angels and would be more beautiful than the sun were it not for little black spots8 that are apt to break out in their faces and sometimes rise in very odd figures i have observed that those little blemishes wear off very soon but when they disappear in one part of the face they are very apt to break out in another insomuch that i have seen a spot upon the forehead in the afternoon which was upon the chin in the morning  the author then proceeds to shew the absurdity of breeches and petticoats with many other curious observations which i shall reserve for another occasion i cannot however conclude this paper without taking notice that amidst these wild remarks there now and then appears something very reasonable i cannot likewise forbear observing that we are all guilty in some measure of the same narrow way of thinking which we meet with in this abstract of the indian journal when we fancy the customs dresses and manners of other countries are ridiculous and extravagant if they do not resemble those of our own9   footnote 1 on march 16th

was consuming by this slow method till there was not a grain of it left on condition you were to be miserable for ever after or supposing that you might be happy for ever after on condition you would

of writing he did for it two or three of us had a fancy three years ago to write a weekly paper and call it an intelligencer but it continued not long for the whole volume it was reprinted in london and i find you have seen it was the work only of two myself and dr sheridan if we could have got some ingenious young man to have been the manager who should have published all that might be sent him it might have continued longer for there were hints enough but the printer here could not afford such a young man one farthing for his trouble the sale being so small and the price one halfpenny and

and sold by a moor in st pauls churchyard monck mason never saw a copy of the london reprint referred to by swift he had in his possession the original papers they are twenty in number he says the

esteemed of all the wise and good   the guardian genius of the wood etc  the poem was written by swifts friend dr delany the titlepage of this second edition ascribes the authorship by the author of a tale of a tub  the intelligencer in the words of w monck mason served as a vehicle of satire against the deans political and literary enemies of these the chief were richard tighe sir thomas prendergast and jonathan smedley dean of clogher hist and antiq of st patricks pp 3767 ts    the intelligencer numb 11  saturday may 11 to be continued weekly   it may be said without offence to other cities of much greater consequence in the world that our town of dublin doth not want its due proportion of folly and vice both native and imported and as to those imported we have the advantage to receive them last and consequently after our happy manner to improve and refine upon them  but because there are many effects of folly and vice among us whereof some are general others confined to smaller numbers and others again perhaps to a few individuals there is a society lately established who at great expense have erected an office of intelligence from which they are to receive weekly information of all important events and singularities which this famous metropolis can furnish strict injunctions are given to have the truest information in order to which certain qualified persons are employed to attend upon duty in their several posts some at the playhouse others in churches some at balls assemblies coffeehouses and meetings for quadrille2 some at the several courts of justice both spiritual and temporal some at the college some upon my lord mayor and aldermen in their public affairs lastly some to converse with favourite chambermaids and to frequent those alehouses and brandyshops where the footmen of great families meet in a morning only the barracks and parliamenthouse are excepted because we have yet found no enfans perdus bold enough to venture their persons at either out of these and some other storehouses we hope to gather materials enough to inform or divert or correct or vex the town  but as facts passages and adventures of all kinds are like to have the greatest share in our paper whereof we cannot always answer for the truth due care shall be taken to have them applied to feigned names whereby all just offence will be removed for if none be guilty none will have cause to blush or be angry if otherwise then the guilty person is safe for the future upon his present amendment and safe for the present from all but his own conscience  there is another resolution taken among us which i fear will give a greater and more general discontent and is of so singular a nature that i have hardly confidence enough to mention it although it be absolutely necessary by way of apology for so bold and unpopular an attempt but so it is that we have taken a desperate counsel to produce into the world every distinguished action either of justice prudence generosity charity friendship or public spirit which comes well attested to us and although we shall neither here be so daring as to assign names yet we shall hardly forbear to give some hints that perhaps to the great displeasure of such deserving persons may endanger a discovery for we think that even virtue itself should submit to such a mortification as by its visibility and example will render it more useful to the world but however the readers of these papers need not be in pain of being overcharged with so dull and ungrateful a subject and yet who knows but such an occasion may be offered to us once in a year or two after we shall have settled a correspondence round the kingdom  but after all our boasts of materials sent us by our several emissaries we may probably soon fall short if the town will not be pleased to lend us further assistance toward entertaining itself the world best knows its own faults and virtues and whatever is sent shall be faithfully returned back only a little embellished according to the custom of authors we do therefore demand and expect continual advertisements in great numbers to be sent to the printer of this paper who hath employed a judicious secretary to collect such as may be most useful for the public  and although we do not intend to expose our own persons by mentioning names yet we are so far from requiring the same caution in our correspondents that on the contrary we expressly charge and command them in all the facts they send us to set down the names titles and places of abode at length together with a very particular description of the persons dresses and dispositions of the several lords ladies squires madams lawyers gamesters toupees sots wits rakes and informers whom they shall have occasion to mention otherwise it will not be possible for us to adjust our style to the different qualities and capacities of the persons concerned and treat them with the respect or familiarity that may be due to their stations and characters which we are determined to observe with the utmost strictness that none may have cause to complain   footnote 1 in the contents to both the editions of

players having now almost done with the comedy called the beggars opera3 for this season it may be no unpleasant speculation to reflect a little upon this dramatic piece so singular in the subject and the manner so much an original and which hath frequently given so very agreeable an entertainment4  although an evil taste be very apt to prevail both here and in london yet there is a point which whoever can rightly touch will never fail of pleasing a very great majority so great that the dislikers out of dullness or affectation will be silent and forced to fall in with the herd the point i mean is what we call humour which in its perfection is allowed to be much preferable to wit if it be not rather the most useful and agreeable species of it  i agree with sir william temple that the word is peculiar to our english tongue but i differ from him in the opinion that the thing itself is peculiar to the english nation5 because the contrary may be found in many spanish italian and french productions and particularly whoever hath a taste for true humour will find a hundred instances of it in those volumes printed in france under the name of le théâtre italien6 to say nothing of rabelais cervantes and many others  now i take the comedy or farce or whatever name the critics will allow it called the beggars opera to excel in this article of humour and upon that merit to have met with such prodigious success both here and in england  as to poetry eloquence and music which are said to have most power over the minds of men it is certain that very few have a taste or judgment of the excellencies of the two former and if a man succeeds in either it is upon the authority of those few judges that lend their taste to the bulk of readers who have none of their own i am told there are as few good judges in music and that among those who crowd the operas nine in ten go thither merely out of curiosity fashion or affectation  but a taste for humour is in some manner fixed to the very nature of man and generally obvious to the vulgar except upon subjects too refined and superior to their understanding  and as this taste of humour is purely natural so is humour itself neither is it a talent confined to men of wit or learning for we observe it sometimes among common servants and the meanest of the people while the very owners are often ignorant of the gift they possess  i know very well that this happy talent is contemptibly treated by critics under the name of low humour or low comedy but i know likewise that the spaniards and italians who are allowed to have the most wit of any nation in europe do most excel in it and do most esteem it  by what disposition of the mind what influence of the stars or what situation of the climate this endowment is bestowed upon mankind may be a question fit for philosophers to discuss it is certainly the best ingredient toward that kind of satire which is most useful and gives the least offence which instead of lashing laughs men out of their follies and vices and is the character which gives horace the preference to juvenal  and although some things are too serious solemn or sacred to be turned into ridicule yet the abuses of them are certainly not since it is allowed that corruption in religion politics and law may be proper topics for this kind of satire  there are two ends that men propose in writing satire one of them less noble than the other as regarding nothing further than personal satisfaction and pleasure of the writer but without any view towards personal malice the other is a public spirit prompting men of genius and virtue to mend the world as far as they are able and as both these ends are innocent so the latter is highly commendable with regard to the former i demand whether i have not as good a title to laugh as men have to be ridiculous and to expose vice as another hath to be vicious if i ridicule the follies and corruptions of a court a ministry or a senate are they not amply paid by pensions titles and power while i expect and desire no other reward than that of laughing with a few friends in a corner yet if those who take offence think me in the wrong i am ready to change the scene with them whenever they please  but if my design be to make mankind better then i think it is my duty at least i am sure it is the interest of those very courts and ministers whose follies or vices i ridicule to reward me for my good intentions for if it be reckoned a high point of wisdom to get the laughers on our side it is much more easy as well as wise to get those on our side who can make millions laugh when they please  my reason for mentioning courts and ministers whom i never think on but with the most profound veneration is because an opinion obtains that in the beggars opera there appears to be some reflection upon courtiers and statesmen whereof i am by no means a judge7  it is true indeed that mr gay the author of this piece hath been somewhat singular in the course of his fortunes for it hath happened that after fourteen years attending the court with a large stock of real merit a modest and agreeable conversation a hundred promises and five hundred friends he hath failed of preferment and upon a very weighty reason he lay under the suspicion of having written a libel or lampoon against a great minister8 it is true that great minister was demonstratively convinced and publicly owned his conviction that mr gay was not the author but having lain under the suspicion it seemed very just that he should suffer the punishment because in this most reformed age the virtues of a great minister are no more to be suspected than the chastity of caesars wife  it must be allowed that the beggars opera is not the first of mr gays works wherein he hath been faulty with regard to courtiers and statesmen for to omit his other pieces even in his fables published within two years past and dedicated to the duke of cumberland for which he was promised a reward9 he hath been thought somewhat too bold upon courtiers and although it is highly probable he meant only the courtiers of former times yet he acted unwarily by not considering that the malignity of some people might misinterpret what he said to the disadvantage of present persons and affairs  but i have now done with mr gay as a politician and shall consider him henceforward only as author of the beggars opera wherein he hath by a turn of humour entirely new placed vices of all kinds in the strongest and most odious light and thereby done eminent service both to religion and morality this appears from the unparalleled success he hath met with all ranks parties and denominations of men either crowding to see his opera or reading it with delight in their closets even ministers of state whom he is thought to have most offended next to those whom the actors more immediately represent appearing frequently at the theatre from a consciousness of their own innocence and to convince the world how unjust a parallel malice envy and disaffection to the government have made  i am assured that several worthy clergymen in this city went privately to see the beggars opera represented and that the fleering coxcombs in the pit amused themselves with making discoveries and spreading the names of those gentlemen round the audience  i shall not pretend to vindicate a clergyman who would appear openly in his habit at a theatre among such a vicious crew as would probably stand round him and at such lewd comedies and profane tragedies as are often represented besides i know very well that persons of their function are bound to avoid the appearance of evil or of giving cause of offence but when the lords chancellors who are keepers of the kings conscience when the judges of the land whose title is reverend when ladies who are bound by the rules of their sex to the strictest decency appear in the theatre without censure i cannot understand why a young clergyman who goes concealed out of curiosity to see an innocent and moral play should be so highly condemned nor do i much approve the rigour of a great prelate who said he hoped none of his clergy were there i am glad to hear there are no weightier objections against that reverend body planted in this city and i wish there never may but i should be very sorry that any of them should be so weak as to imitate a court chaplain in england who preached against the beggars opera which will probably do more good than a thousand sermons of so stupid so injudicious and so prostitute a divine10  in this happy performance of mr gay all the characters are just and none of them carried beyond nature or hardly beyond practice it discovers the whole system of that commonwealth or that imperium in imperio of iniquity established among us by which neither our lives nor our properties are secure either in the highways or in public assemblies or even in our own houses it shews the miserable lives and the constant fate of those abandoned wretches for how little they sell their lives and souls betrayed by their whores their comrades and the receivers and purchasers of these thefts and robberies this comedy contains likewise a satire which although it doth by no means affect the present age yet might have been useful in the former and may possibly be so in ages to come i mean where the author takes occasion of comparing those common robbers to robbers of the public11 and their several stratagems of betraying undermining and hanging each other12 to the several arts of politicians in times of corruption  this comedy likewise exposeth with great justice that unnatural taste for italian music among us13 which is wholly unsuitable to our northern climate and the genius of the people whereby we are overrun with italian effeminacy and italian nonsense an old gentleman said to me that many years ago when the practice of an unnatural vice grew so frequent in london that many were prosecuted for it he was sure it would be a forerunner14 of italian operas and singers and then we should want nothing but stabbing or poisoning to make us perfect italians  upon the whole i deliver my judgment that nothing but servile attachment to a party affectation of singularity lamentable dullness mistaken zeal or studied hypocrisy can have the least reasonable objection against this excellent moral performance of the celebrated mr gay   footnote 1 see title in note above p 313 ts  footnote 2 he will go among the people and will draw a crowd together ts  footnote 3 gays the

october last received a letter signed andrew dealer and patrick pennyless i believe the following paper just come to my hands will be a sufficient answer to it2    sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves   vlrg3  sir  i am a country gentleman and a member of parliament with an estate of about 1400l a year which as a northern landlord i receive from above two hundred tenants and my lands having been let near twenty years ago the rents till very lately were esteemed to be not above half value yet by the intolerable scarcity of silver4 i lie under the greatest difficulties in receiving them as well as in paying my labourers or buying any thing necessary for my family from tradesmen who are not able to be long out of their money but the sufferings of me and those of my rank are trifles in comparison of what the meaner sort undergo such as the buyers and sellers at fairs and markets the shopkeepers in every town the farmers in general all those who travel with fish poultry pedlaryware and other conveniencies to sell but more especially handicraftsmen who work for us by the day and common labourers whom i have already mentioned both these kinds of people i am forced to employ till their wages amount to a double pistole5 or a moidore for we hardly have any gold of lower value left among us to divide it among themselves as they can and this is generally done at an alehouse or brandy shop where besides the cost of getting drunk which is usually the case they must pay tenpence or a shilling for changing their piece into silver to some huckstering fellow who follows that trade but what is infinitely worse those poor men for want of due payment are forced to take up their oatmeal and other necessaries of life at almost double value and consequently are not able to discharge half their score especially under the scarceness of corn for two years past and the melancholy disappointment of the present crop  the causes of this and a thousand other evils are clear and manifest to you and all other thinking men though hidden from the vulgar these indeed complain of hard times the dearth of corn the want of money the badness of seasons that their goods bear no price and the poor cannot find work but their weak reasonings never carry them to the hatred and contempt borne us by our neighbours and brethren without the least grounds of provocation who rejoice at our sufferings although sometimes to their own disadvantage of the dead weight upon every beneficial branch of our trade6 of half our revenues sent annually to england and many other grievances peculiar to this unhappy kingdom excepted for our sins which keep us from enjoying the common benefits of mankind as you and some other lovers of their country have so often observed with such good inclinations and so little effect  it is true indeed that under our circumstances in general this complaint for the want of silver may appear as ridiculous as for a man to be impatient about a cut finger when he is struck with the plague and yet a poor fellow going to the gallows may be allowed to feel the smart of wasps while he is upon tyburn road this misfortune is too urging7 and vexatious in every kind of small traffic and so hourly pressing upon all persons in the country whatsoever that a hundred inconveniences of perhaps greater moment in themselves have been timely8 submitted to with far less disquietude and murmurs and the case seems yet the harder if it be true what many skilful men assert that nothing is more easy than a remedy and that the want of silver in proportion to the little gold remaining among us is altogether as unnecessary as it is inconvenient a person of distinction assured me very lately that in discoursing with the lord lieutenant9 before his last return to england his excellency said he had pressed the matter often in proper time and place and to proper persons and could not see any difficulty of the least moment that could prevent us from being easy upon that article10  whoever carries to england twentyseven english shillings and brings back one moidore of full weight is a gainer of ninepence irish in a guinea the advantage is threepence and twopence in a pistole the bankers who are generally masters of all our gold and silver with this advantage have sent over as much of the latter as came into their hands the value of one thousand moidores in silver would thus amount in clear profit to 37l 10s the shopkeepers and other traders who go to london to buy goods followed the same practice by which we have been driven into this insupportable distress  to a common thinker it should seem that nothing would be more easy than for the government to redress this evil at any time they shall please when the value of guineas was lowered in england from 21s 6d to only 21s11 the consequences to this kingdom were obvious and manifest to us all and a sober man may be allowed at least to wonder though he dare not complain why a new regulation of coin among us was not then made much more why it hath never been since it would surely require no very profound skill in algebra to reduce the difference of ninepence in thirty shillings or threepence in a guinea to less than a farthing and so small a fraction could be no temptation either to bankers to hazard their silver at sea or tradesmen to load themselves with it in their journeys to england in my humble opinion it would be no unseasonable condescension if the government would graciously please to signify to the poor loyal protestant subjects of ireland either that this miserable want of silver is not possible to be remedied in any degree by the nicest skill in arithmetic or else that it doth not stand with the good pleasure of england to suffer any silver at all among us in the former case it would be madness to expect impossibilities and in the other we must submit for lives and fortunes are always at the mercy of the conqueror  the question hath been often put in printed papers by the drapier12 and others or perhaps by the same writer under different styles why this kingdom should not be permitted to have a mint of its own for the coinage of gold silver and copper which is a power exercised by many bishops and every petty prince in germany but this question hath never been answered nor the least application that i have heard of made to the crown from hence for the grant of a public mint although it stands upon record that several cities and corporations here had the liberty of coining silver i can see no reasons why we alone of all nations are thus restrained but such as i dare not mention only thus far i may venture that ireland is the first imperial kingdom since nimrod which ever wanted power to coin their own money  i know very well that in england it is lawful for any subject to petition either the prince or the parliament provided it be done in a dutiful and regular manner but what is lawful for a subject of ireland i profess i cannot determine nor will undertake that your printer shall not be prosecuted in a court of justice for publishing my wishes that a poor shopkeeper might be able to change a guinea or a moidore when a customer comes for a crowns worth of goods i have known less crimes punished with the utmost severity under the title of disaffection and i cannot but approve the wisdom of the ancients who after astraea had fled from the earth13 at least took care to provide three upright judges for hell mens ears among us are indeed grown so nice that whoever happens to think out of fashion in what relates to the welfare of this kingdom dare not so much as complain of the toothache lest our weak and busy dabblers in politic should be ready to swear against him for disaffection  there was a method practised by sir ambrose crawley14 the great dealer in ironworks which i wonder the gentlemen o£ our country under this great exigence have not thought fit to imitate in the several towns and villages where he dealt and many miles round he gave notes instead of money from twopence to twenty shillings which passed current in all shops and markets as well as in houses where meat or drink was sold i see no reason why the like practice may not be introduced among us with some degree of success or at least may not serve as a poor expedient in this our blessed age of paper which as it dischargeth all our greatest payments may be equally useful in the smaller and may just keep us alive till an english act of parliament shall forbid it  i have been told that among some of our poorest american colonies upon the continent the people enjoy the liberty of cutting the little money among them into halves and quarters for the conveniences of small traffic how happy should we be in comparison of our present condition if the like privilege were granted to us of employing the shears for want of a mint upon our foreign gold by clipping it into halfcrowns and shillings and even lower denominations for beggars must be content to live upon scraps and it would be our felicity that these scraps would never15 be exported to other countries while any thing better was left  if neither of these projects will avail i see nothing left us but to truck and barter our goods like the wild indians with each other or with our too powerful neighbours only with this disadvantage on our side that the indians enjoy the product of their own land whereas the better half of ours is sent away without so much as a recompense in bugles or glass in return  it must needs be a very comfortable circumstance in the present juncture that some thousand families are gone or going or preparing to go from hence and settle themselves in america the poorer sort for want of work the farmers whose beneficial bargains are now become a rackrent too hard to be borne and those who have any ready money or can purchase any by the sale of their goods or leases because they find their fortunes hourly decaying that their goods will bear no price and that few or none have any money to buy the very necessaries of life are hastening to follow their departed neighbours it is true corn among us carries a very high price but it is for the same reason that rats and cats and dead horses have been often bought for gold in a town besieged  there is a person of quality in my neighbourhood who twenty years ago when he was just come to age being unexperienced and of a generous temper let his lands even as times went then at a low rate to able tenants and consequently by the rise of land since that time looked upon his estate to be set at half value but numbers of these tenants or their descendants are now offering to sell their leases by cant even those which were for lives some of them renewable for ever and some feefarms which the landlord himself hath bought in at half the price they would have yielded seven years ago and some leases let at the same time for lives have been given up to him without any consideration at all  this is the most favourable face of things at present among us i say among us of the north who are esteemed the only thriving people of the kingdom and how far and how soon this misery and desolation may spread is easy to foresee  the vast sums of money daily carried off by our numerous adventurers to america have deprived us of our gold in these parts almost as much as of our silver  and the good wives who came16 to our houses offer us their pieces of linen upon which their whole dependence lies for so little profit that it can neither half pay their rents nor half support their families  it is remarkable that this enthusiasm spread among our northern people of sheltering themselves in the continent of america hath no other foundation than their present insupportable condition at home i have made all possible inquiries to learn what encouragement our people have met with by any intelligence from those plantations sufficient to make them undertake so tedious and hazardous a voyage in all seasons of the year and so ill accommodated in their ships that many of them have died miserably in their passage but could never get one satisfactory answer somebody they know not who had written a letter to his friend or cousin from thence inviting him by all means to come over that it was a fine fruitful country and to be held for ever at a penny an acre but the truth of the fact is this the english established in those colonies are in great want of men to inhabit that tract of ground which lies between them and the wild indians who are not reduced under their dominion we read of some barbarous people whom the romans placed in their armies for no other service than to blunt their enemies swords and afterwards to fill up trenches with their dead bodies and thus our people who transport themselves are settled in those interjacent tracts as a screen against the insults of the savages and many have as much land as they can clear from the woods at a very reasonable rate if they can afford to pay about a hundred years purchase by their labour now beside the foxs reasons which inclines all those who have already ventured thither to represent everything in a false light as well for justifying their own conduct as for getting companions in their misery so the governing people in those plantations have wisely provided17 that no letters shall be suffered to pass from thence hither without being first viewed by the council by which our people here are wholly deceived in the opinions they have of the happy condition of their friends gone before them this was accidentally discovered some months ago by an honest man who having transported himself and family thither and finding all things directly contrary to his hope had the luck to convey a private note by a faithful hand to his relation here entreating him not to think of such a voyage and to discourage all his friends from attempting it yet this although it be a truth well known hath produced very little effects which is no manner of wonder for as it is natural to a man in a fever to turn often although without any hope of ease or when he is pursued to leap down a precipice to avoid an enemy just at his back so men in the extremest degree of misery and want will naturally fly to the first appearance of relief let it be ever so vain or visionary  you may observe that i have very superficially touched the subject i began with and with the utmost caution for i know how criminal the least complaint hath been thought however seasonable or just or honestly intended which hath forced me to offer up my daily prayers that it may never at least in my time be interpreted by innuendoes as a false scandalous seditious and disaffected action for a man to roar under an acute fit of the gout which beside the loss and the danger would be very inconvenient to one of my age so severely afflicted with that distemper  i wish you good success but i can promise you little in an ungrateful office you have taken up without the least view either to reputation or profit perhaps your comfort is that none but villains and betrayers of their country can be your enemies upon which i have little to say having not the honour to be acquainted with many of that sort and therefore as you easily may believe am compelled to lead a very retired life  i am
