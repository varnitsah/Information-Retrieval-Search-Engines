note   the small room at the canadian hotel was hot and smelt of cigarsmoke and liquor stannard put down his cards shrugged resignedly and opened the window deering smiled and pulled a pile of paper money across the table he was strongly built and belonged to a mountaineering club but he was fat and his american dinner jacket looked uncomfortably tight  deerings habit was to smile and jimmy leyland had liked his knowing twinkle somehow it hinted that you could not cheat deering but if you were his friend you could trust him and he would see you out now however jimmy thought he grinned jimmy had reckoned on winning the pool but deering had picked up the money he imagined was his  jackson wiped a spot of liquor from his white shirt and gave the boy a sympathetic glance jackson was thin darkskinned and grave and although he did not talk much about himself jimmy understood he was rather an important gentleman in carolina stannard had indicated something like this stannard and jimmy were frankly english but jimmy was young and the others hair was touched by white  yet stannard was athletic and at parisian clubs and swiss hotels men talked about his fencing and his exploits on the rocks he was not a big man but now his thin jacket was open the moulding of his chest and the curve to his black silk belt were greek all the same one rather got a sense of cultivation than strength stannard looked thoroughbred and jimmy was proud he was his friend  jimmy was not cultivated he was a careless frank and muscular english lad but he was not altogether raw because he knew london and paris and had for some time enjoyed stannards society his manufacturing relations in lancashire thought him an extravagant fool and perhaps had grounds for doing so for since jimmy had broken their firm control his prudence was not marked  i must brace up lets stop for a few minutes he said and went to the window  the room was on the second floor and the window opening on top of the veranda commanded the valley across the terrace in front of the hotel dark pines rolled down to the river and the water sparkled in the moon on the other side a belt of mist floated about the mountain slope and dark rocks went up and melted in the snow the broken white line ran far north and was lost in the distance one smelt the sweet resinous scents the soft chinook wind blew across the wilderness  jimmys glance rested on the river and the vague bluewhite field of ice from which the green flood sprang now the electric elevators had stopped the angry currents measured throb rolled across the pines but for this all was very quiet and the other windows opening on the veranda were blank jimmy remembered the hotel manager himself had some time since firmly put out the billiardroom lights when jimmy was about ten dollars up at pool he had afterwards won a much larger sum at cards but his luck had begun to turn  by and by stannard came out and jumped on the high top rail the light from the window touched his face and his profile cutting against the dark was good and firmly lined his balance on the narrow rail was like a boys  if you carried my weight you wouldnt get up like that two hundred pounds wants some moving deering remarked with a noisy laugh  ive known you move about an icy slope pretty fast said stannard and taking his hands from the rail pulled out his watch two oclock he resumed and gave jimmy a smile i rather think you ought to go to bed you have not got deerings steadiness and still are a few dollars up to stop when your luck is good is a useful plan  my legs are steadier than my head deering rejoined when i played the tenspot jimmy saw my game cost me five dollars i reckon i ought to go to bed  jimmy frowned he was persuaded he was sober and although stannard was a very good sort sometimes his fatherly admonition jarred then he had won a good sum from stannard and must not be shabby the strange thing was he could not remember how much he had won  to stop as soon as my luck turns is not my plan he said i feel i owe you a chance to get your own back  oh well if you feel like that we had better go on but your fastidiousness may cost you something stannard remarked and deering hit jimmys back  youre a sport i like you play up and play straights your rule  jimmy was flattered although he doubted deerings soberness he did play straight and when he won he did not go off with a walletful of his friends money all the same jacksons bored look annoyed him since it rather indicated that he was willing to indulge jimmy than that he noted his scrupulous fairness jimmy resolved to banish the fellows languor and when they went back to the card table demanded that they put up the stakes jackson agreed resignedly and they resumed the game  the room got hotter and the cigarsmoke was thick sometimes stannard went to the icepail and mixed a cooling drink jimmy meant to use caution but his luck had turned and excitement parched his mouth by and by stannard who was dealing stopped  your play is wild jimmy he remarked i think you have had enough  jimmy turned to the others his face was red and his gesture boyishly theatrical  i play for sport not for dollars i dont want your money and now youre getting something back well put up the bets again  then since your wad is nearly gone somebody must keep the score said jackson and stannard pulled out his notebook  jimmy took another drink and tried to brace up his luck like his roll of bills was obviously gone but when he was winning the others had not stopped and he did not want them so to speak to let him off when he lost he could pay but this was not important and he must concentrate on his cards the cards got worse and as a rule the ace he thought one antagonist had was played by another at length stannard pushed back his chair from the table  three oclock and i have had enough he said and turned to jimmy do you know how much you are down  jimmy did not know but he imagined the sum was large and when stannard began to reckon he went to the window day was breaking and mist rolled about the pines the snow was gray and the high rocks were blurred and dark jimmy heard the river and the wind in the trees the cold braced him and he vaguely felt the landscapes austerity his head was getting steadier and perhaps it was the contrast but when he turned and looked about the room he was conscious of something like disgust stannard occupied with his pencil knitted his brows and now his graceful carelessness was not marked jimmy thought his look hard and calculating yet stannard was his friend and model he admitted he was highly strung and perhaps his imagination cheated him  he was not cheated about the others now a reaction from the excitement had begun he saw deering and jackson as he had not seen them before deerings grin was sottish the fellow was grossly fat and he fixed his greedy glance on stannards notebook jackson standing behind stannard studied the calculations as if he meant to satisfy himself the sum was correct jimmy thought them impatient to know their share and their keenness annoyed him then stannard put up his book  it looks as if your resolve to play up was rash he remarked and stated the sum jimmy owed can you meet the reckoning  you know im broke youre my banker and must fix it for me  stannard nodded very well what about your bet in the billiardroom  nothing about it i made the stroke  deering grinned indulgently and when jackson shrugged jimmys face got red  if theyre not satisfied give them the lot i dont dispute about things like that he said haughtily write an acknowledgment for all i owe and ill sign the note  stannard wrote and tore the leaf from his notebook but he now used a fountain pen jimmy took the pen signed the acknowledgment and went off when he had gone deering looked at stannard and laughed  your touch is light but if the boy begins to feel your hand hell kick anyhow ill take my wad  stannard gave him a roll of paper money and turned to jackson  ill take mine said jackson in the morning i pull out  you stated you meant to stop for a time  theres nothing in the game for me and i dont see what deering expects to get said jackson in a languid voice i doubt if youll keep him long the boys in his home section on the coast reckon he puts up a square deal anyhow you cant have my help  stannard gave him a searching glance and deering straightened his big body jacksons glance was quietly scornful  a hundred dollars is a useful sum but my marks higher and i play with men maybe ill meet up with some rich tourists at the banff hotels he resumed and giving the others a careless nod went off  a queer fellow but sometimes his mood is nasty said deering i felt id like to throw him over the rails  as a rule his sort carry a gun stannard remarked  deering wiped some liquor from the table picked up jimmys glass which was on the floor and put away the cards  in the morning you had better give the china boy two dollars he said in a meaning voice and when he went to the door stannard put out the light     ii  jimmys apology   in the morning jimmy leaned rather moodily against the terrace wall there was no garden for the hotel occupied a narrow shelf on the hillside and from the terrace one looked down on the tops of dusky pines the building was new and so far the guests were not numerous but the manager claimed that when the charm of the neighborhood was known summer tourists and mountaineers would have no use for banff  perhaps his hopefulness was justified for all round the hotel primeval forest met untrodden snow and at the head of the valley a glacier dropped to a calm green lake a few miles south was a small flagstation and sometimes one heard a heavy freight train rumble in the woods when the distant noise died away all was very quiet but for the throb of falling water  jimmy had not enjoyed his breakfast and when he lighted a cigarette the tobacco did not taste good he admitted that he had been carried away and now he was cool he reflected that his rashness had cost him a large sum and he had given stannard another note he was young and had for a year or two indulged his youthful craving for excitement but he began to doubt if he could keep it up after all he had inherited more than he knew from his sternly businesslike and rather parsimonious ancestors although the leyland cotton mills were now famous in lancashire jimmys grandfather had earned day wages at the spinning frame  jimmy felt dull and thought a day on the rocks would brace him up since his object for the canadian excursion was to shoot a mountainsheep and climb a peak in the rockies he ought to get into trim stannard could play cards all night and start fresh in the morning on an adventure that tried ones nerve and muscle but jimmy admitted he could not when he loafed about hotel rotundas and consumed iced drinks he got soft  after a time laura stannard crossed the veranda and went along the terrace her white dress was fashionable and she wore a big white hat her hair and eyes were black her figure was gracefully slender and her carriage was good jimmy thought her strangely attractive but did not altogether know if she was his friend and admitted that he was not lauras sort it was not that she was proud something about her indicated that her proper background was an oldfashioned english country house jimmy felt his was a lancashire cotton mill laura did not live with stannard but she joined him and jimmy in switzerland not long before they started for canada stannard was jealous about his daughter and had indicated that his friends were not necessarily hers jimmy had grounds to think stannards caution justified  for a minute or two jimmy left the girl alone he imagined if laura were willing to talk to him she would let him know she went to the end of the terrace and then turning opposite a bench looked up and smiled jimmy advanced and when he joined her leaned against the low wall laura studied him quietly and he got embarrassed somehow he felt she disapproved he imagined he did not altogether look as if he had got up after a nights refreshing sleep  you got breakfast early she remarked  that is so jimmy agreed a fellow at my table argues about our slowness in the old country and sometimes one would sooner be quiet then i thought id go off and see if i could reach the icefall on the glacier after the sun gets hot the snow is treacherous anyhow you have come down as soon as me  i mean to go on the lake and try to catch a trout  then i hope youll let me come youll want somebody to row the boat and use the landingnet  the hotel guide will row and i doubt if well need the landingnet laura replied and gave him a level glance besides i shall return for lunch and i rather think you ought to go for a long climb when i came out you looked moody and slack  jimmy colored although he was embarrassed to know laura had bothered to remark his moodiness was flattering the strange thing was when she crossed the veranda he had not thought she saw him jimmy was raw but not altogether a fool he knew laura did not mean him to go with her to the lake  oh well he said when one loafs about one does get slack  you are young and ought not to loaf  i imagine im a little older than you jimmy rejoined with a twinkle  laura let it go as a rule she did not take the obvious line and although she knew much jimmy did not she said are you old enough to play cards with jackson and deering  one must pay for all one gets and in a sense i get much from men like that jimmy replied theres something one likes about jackson and deerings a very good sort  are you ambitious to be deerings sort laura asked  jimmy pondered it was obvious she knew the men were stannards friends and she no doubt knew stannard was a keen gambler the ground was awkward and he must use some caution  mr stannards my model he said  lauras glance was inscrutable since her mother died she had not lived with stannard and he puzzled her sometimes she was disturbed about him and sometimes she was jarred when she joined him for a few weeks he was kind but he did not ask for her confidence and did not give her his  it looks as if my fathers attraction for you was strong she said thoughtfully  that is so jimmy declared with a touch of enthusiasm laura saw was sincere mr stannard has all the qualities id like to cultivate my habit so to speak is to shove along laboriously he gets where he wants without an effort on the trains and steamers he gets for nothing things another couldnt buy and at the hotel the waiters serve him first people trust him and are keen about his society hes urbane and polished but when you go with him on the rocks you note his steely pluck when im stuck and daunted he smiles and somehow i get up the awkward slab besides he stands for much i wanted but couldnt get until he helped  what did you want  excitement adventure and the friendship of clever people something like that said jimmy awkwardly to begin with id better tell you about my life in lancashire but i expect youre bored  laura was not bored in fact her curiosity was excited stannards young friends were numerous but when he opened his london flat to them she stopped with her aunts now she wondered whether it was important he had allowed her to join his canadian excursion  i am not at all bored she said  very well my father died long since and i went to my uncles house id like to draw ardshaw for you but i cannot inside its overcrowded by clumsy victorian furniture outside is a desolation of industrial ugliness smoky fields fenced by old colliery ropes a black canal and coalpit winding towers i went to school on board a steam tram along a road bordered all the way by miners cottages  the pictures not attractive laura remarked was your uncle satisfied with his house  jimmy smiled i think he was altogether satisfied the leylands are a utilitarian lot and rather like ugliness our interests are business and religion of a stern puritanical sort from my relations point of view grace and beauty are snares besides dick leyland got ardshaw cheap and i expect this accounts for much when he went there the leyland mills were small my grandfather had not long started on his lucky speculation  but after a time you went away to schoola public school  i did not i imagined it was obvious said jimmy with a touch of dryness i went to the mill office and sat under a gaslamp writing entries in the stockbooks from nine oclock until six dick leyland had no use for university cultivation and my aunt was persuaded oxford was a haunt of profligates well because i was forced i held out until i was twentyone then id had enough and i went to london  were your relations willing for you to go  they were not at all willing but i inherit a thirdpart of the leyland mills for all that unless my trustees approve i cannot for another two or three years use control and the sum i may spend is fixed well perhaps you can picture my launching out in town i had no rules to go by i wore the stamp of the cotton mill and a secondclass school for five years id earned a small clerks pay and now by contrast i was rich  laura could picture it the boys reaction from his uncles firm and parsimonious guardianship was natural and she studied him with fresh curiosity he was tall but rather loosely built and his look was apologetic as if he had not yet got a mans strength and confidence one noted the stamp of the cotton mill as a rule jimmy was generous and extravagant but sometimes he was strangely businesslike  were you satisfied with your experiment she asked  i expect youre tired if you were not kind youd have sent me off  not at all said laura i like to study people and your story has a human touch in a way its the revolt of youth  oh well i expect one does not often get all one thinks to get i wanted the cultivation oxford might have given me i wanted to know people of your sort who dont bother about business but hunt and fish and shoot well i can throw a dryfly and hold a gun straight but after all im jimmy leyland from the mills in lancashire  laura liked his honesty but his voice was now not apologetic she rather thought it proud  you met my father in switzerland she said  at chamonix about a year ago when i met mr stannard my luck was good id got into the wrong lot they used me and laughed well your father showed me where i was going and sent the others off perhaps you know how he does things like that hes urban but very firm anyhow the others went and ive had numerous grounds to trust mr stannard since  jimmy lighted a cigarette perhaps he ought to go but lauras interest was flattering and she had not allowed him to talk like this before in fact he rather wondered why she had done so in the meantime laura pondered his artless narrative his liking her father was not strange for stannards charm was strong but laura imagined to enjoy his society cost his young friends something perhaps it had cost jimmy something for he had stated that one must pay for all one got he was obviously willing to pay but laura was puzzled if his uncles portrait was accurate she imagined the sum jimmy was allowed to spend was not large  one ought to have an object and know where one means to go she remarked when you look ahead are you satisfied  in the meantime ill let mr stannard indicate the way said jimmy with a smile on the whole i expect dick leyland would sooner i didnt meddle at the office but after a year or two ill probably go back you see dick has no children and jims not married to carry on leylands is my job  who is jim  sir james leyland knight in lancashire we have not much use for titles the head of the house is jim and im jimmy perhaps the diminutive is important  but suppose your uncles did not approve your carrying on the house  then i imagine they could for a time force me to leave the mills alone however although dick is very like a machine ive some grounds to think jim human all the same i hardly know him hes at bombay the house transacts much business in india but i must have bored you and you havent got breakfast i suppose you really wont let me row the boat  laura pondered her curiosity was not altogether satisfied and she now was willing for jimmy to join her on the lake yet she had refused and after his frank statement she had better not agree  i have engaged the hotel guide miss grant is going and the boat is small she said besides when one means to catch trout one must concentrate  jimmy went off and laura knitted her brows she knew jimmys habit was not to boast and if she had understood him properly he would by and by control the fortunes of the famous manufacturing house her fathers plan was rather obvious and the blood came to lauras skin she knew something about poverty and admitted that when she married her marriage must be good but she was not an adventuress yet jimmy was rather a handsome fellow and had some attractive qualities     iii  the cayuse pony   the afternoon was hot the little wineberry bushes were soft and jimmy lay in a big hemlocks shade a few yards in front a falling pine had broken the row of straight red trunks and in the gap shining snow peaks cut the serene sky below the trees rolled down the hillside and at the bottom a river sparkled rivers however were numerous the bush on the hillbench jimmy had crossed was thick and he frankly did not know where he had come down if the hotel was in the valley he need not bother but he doubted and was not keen about climbing another mountain spur in the meantime he smoked his pipe and mused  he owed stannard rather a large sum they went about to shooting parties at country houses and lodges by scottish salmon rivers visiting with stannards sporting friends was expensive and he allowed jimmy to bear the cost jimmy was willing and made stannard his banker now and then they reckoned up and jimmy gave him an acknowledgment for the debt although stannard stated he was poor his habits were extravagant and somehow he got money  yet jimmy did not think stannard exploited him he had found his advice good and stannard had saved him from some awkward entanglements in fact stannard was his friend and although his friendship was perhaps expensive in a year or two jimmy would be rich since his parsimonious uncle had not let him go to a university his spending a good sum was justified and to go about with stannard was a liberal education perhaps for a careless young fellow jimmys argument was strangely commercial but he was the son of a keen and frugal business man  then he began to muse about laura her beauty and refinement attracted him but he imagined laura knew his drawbacks and to imagine stannard had planned for him to marry her was ridiculous stannard was not like that and when laura was with him saw that jimmy did not get much of her society in fact had she not come down for breakfast before the other guests jimmy imagined he would not have enjoyed a confidential talk with her all the same to loaf in the shade and dwell on lauras charm was soothing  in the meantime he was hungry and he had not bothered to carry his lunch when he got breakfast he had not much appetite since morning he had scrambled about the rocks and he thought the hotel was some distance off getting up with something of an effort he plunged down hill through the underbrush at the bottom he stopped and frowned he ought not to have lost his breath but he had done so and his heart beat it looked as if he must cut out strong cigars and iced liquor  a few yards off a trail went up the valley and slanted sunbeams crossed the narrow opening jimmy thought he heard a horses feet and resolved to wait and ask about the hotel he was in the shade but for a short distance the spot commanded the trail  the beat of horses feet got louder and a girl rode out from the gap in the dark pine branches a sunbeam touched her and her hair and the steel buckle in her soft felt hat shone she rode astride and wore fringed leggings and a jacket of soft deerskin her figure was graceful and she swung easily with the horses stride her hair was like gold and her eyes were deep blue jimmy afterwards thought it strange he noted so much but she so to speak sprang from the gloom like a picture on a film and the picture held him  he did not know if the girl was beautiful but in the tangled woods her charm was keen her dress harmonized with the moss on the tall red trunks and the ripening fern something primitive and strong marked her easy confident pose the horse an indian cayuse tossed its head and glanced about nervously as if its habit was to scent danger in the bush jimmy sprang from primitive stock and he knew half instinctively the girls type was his he must however inquire about the hotel and he pushed through the raspberries by the trail  the horse startled by the noise stopped and tried to turn the girl pulled the bridle and braced herself back the cayuse jumped like a cat plunged forward and feeling the bit bucked savagely jimmy wondered how long the girl would stick to the saddle but after a moment or two the cayuse started for the bush jimmy thought he knew the trick for when a cayuse cannot buck off its rider it goes for a tree and if one keeps ones foot in the stirrup one risks a broken leg he jumped for its head and seized the links at the bit  the girl ordered him to let go but he did not he had frightened her horse and must not allow the savage brute to jamb her against a tree its ears were pressed back and he saw its teeth but so long as he stuck to the bit it could not seize his hand then it went round in a semicircle the link twisted and pinched his fingers and he knew he could not hold on the animals head went up jimmy got a heavy blow and fell across the trail a few moments afterwards he heard a beat of hoofs some distance off and knew the cayuse was gone the girl breathing rather hard leaned against a trunk  are you hurt she asked  i dont know yet jimmy gasped ill find out when i get up  he got up and forced a smile anyhow nothings broken are you hurt  no she said im not hurt but im angry when you butted in i couldnt use the bridle  im sorry i wanted to help however it looks as if your horse had run away have you far to go  the ranch is three miles off  how fars the hotel  if you go by the trail about eight miles perhaps four miles if you cross the range  jimmy studied the thick timber and the steep rocky slopes pushing through tangled underbrush has drawbacks particularly where devilsclub thorns are numerous besides he had got a nasty knock and his leg began to hurt then he noted a cotton flour bag with straps attached lying in the trail  i think i wont cross the range i suppose that bag is yours  it is mine they put our groceries off the train i reckon the bag weighs about forty pounds i carried the thing on the front of the saddle but when you  jimmy nodded when i butted in you were forced to let it go well since i frightened your horse i ought to carry your bag if i take it to the ranch do you think your folks would give me supper  its possible can you carry the bag  ill try said jimmy have you some grounds to doubt  packing a load over a rough trail is not as easy as it looks the girl rejoined with a twinkle then i expect youre a tourist tenderfoot  jimmy liked her smile and he liked her voice her western accent was not marked and her glance was frank he thought if he had not meddled she would have mastered the frightened horse her strength and pluck were obvious in the meantime his leg hurt and he could not examine the injury  i am a tourist he agreed since im going to your house perhaps i ought to state that im jimmy leyland from lancashire in the old country  i am margaret jardine  then youre a scot  my father is a scot said margaret im canadian  ah said jimmy ive heard something like that before and begin to see what it implies well it looks as if you were an independent lot is one allowed to state that in the old country we are rather proud of you  since id like to make kelshope before dark perhaps you had better get going margaret remarked  jimmy picked up the bag and fastened the deerskin straps by which it hung from his shoulders like a rucksack they started and for a time he kept up with margaret but he did not talk the pack was heavy he had not had much breakfast and had gone without his lunch besides his leg was getting very sore at length he stopped and began to loose the straps  do you mind if i take a smoke he asked  margaret looked at him rather hard but said she did not mind and jimmy indicating a cedar log pulled out his cigarette case  do you smoke  i do not in the bush we havent yet copied the girls at the hotels  now i think about it the girls who smoked at the montreal hotel were not numerous jimmy remarked when i went to the fishing lodge in scotland all smoked but then stannards friends are very much uptodate the strange thing is were thought antiquated in the old country  he stopped and tried to brace up what he wanted to state eluded him he felt cold and the pines across the trail got indistinct  you see in some of our circles we rather feel our duty is to be modern he resumed with an effort i think youre not like that canadas a new country but in a way one feels youre really older than we are we have got artificial you are flesh and blood  dont talk said margaret firmly but jimmy thought her voice was faint and for a few moments the tall pines melted altogether  when he looked up margaret asked have you got a tobacco pouch  jimmy gave her the pouch and she went off he was puzzled and rather annoyed but somehow he could not get on his feet by and by margaret came back carrying the pouch opened like a double cup jimmy drank some water and the numbness began to go  youre very kind i expect im ridiculous he said  i was not kind i let you carry the pack although the cayuse knocked you down  perhaps the knock accounts for something jimmy remarked in a languid voice  he had got a nasty knock but he imagined stannards cigars and deerings iced drinks were really accountable in the meantime he noted that margaret was wiping his tobacco pouch  you mustnt bother he resumed give me the thing  but when its wet you cannot put in the tobacco  i thought you threw away the stuff i can get another lot at the hotel  margaret brushed the tobacco from a flake of bark and filled the pouch  in the woods one doesnt throw away expensive tobacco  thanks said jimmy some time since i lived with people like you  poor and frugal people  no said jimmy with a twinkle dick and his wife were rather rich in fact in england i think you begin to use economy when you get rich anyhow its not important and you neednt bother about me as a rule philosophizing doesnt knock me out the cayuse kicked pretty hard well suppose we start  he got up and when margaret tried to take the pack he pulled it away  the jobs mine i undertook to carry the load  but youre tired and i think youre lame  we wont dispute said jimmy you oughtnt to dispute perhaps its strange but one feels your word ought to go  it looks as if my word did not go  oh well said jimmy when you command people you have got to use some caution much depends on whom you command and in lancashire were an obstinate lot anyhow ill take the bag  he pushed his arms through the straps and margaret said nothing she might have taken the bag from him but to use force was not dignified and she knew to let her carry the load would jar when they set off she noted that his face was rather white and his step was not even he had obviously got a nasty kick but his pluck was good  the sun went down behind the woods the pines got dim and sweet resinous scents floated about the trail the hum of insects came out of the shadow and jimmy was forced to rub the mosquitoes from his neck to put up his hands was awkward for the ground was uneven and he must balance his load he could not talk the important thing was to reach the ranch before it got dark and setting his mouth he pushed ahead  at length margaret stopped at a fence and when she began to pull down the rails jimmy leaned against a post the rails were rudely split and the zigzag fence was locked by crossed supports and not fastened by nails on the other side where timothy grass and oats had grown was stubble dotted by tall stumps and fern a belt of chopped trees surrounded the clearing and behind the tangled belt the forest rose like a dark wall an indistinct log house and barns occupied the other end an owl swooped noiselessly across the fence and jimmy heard the distant howl of a timber wolf  kelshope ranch said margaret the path goes to the house i must put up the rails  jimmy went through the gap perhaps it was soothing quietness but he felt he liked kelshope and his curiosity was excited he knew the big canadian hotels the pullmans and observationcars so far money had supplied him as in london with much that made life smooth now he was to see something of the canada in which man must labor for all he gets the strange thing was he felt this was the canada he really ought to know     iv  kelshope ranch   breakfast was over at kelshope ranch and jimmy occupied a log at the edge of the clearing although his muscles were sore he felt strangely fresh and somehow satisfied at the hotel as a rule he had not felt like that his leg hurt but his host had doctored the cut with some american liniment and jimmy was content to rest in the shade and look about he thought he saw the whole process of clearing a ranch  in the background was virgin forest pine spruce and hemlock locking their dark branches then one noted the slashing where chopped trees had fallen in tangled rows and an inner belt of ashes and blackened stumps other stumps surrounded by fern checkered the oblong of cultivated soil and the dew sparkled on the short oat stubble the oats were not grown for milling the heads were small and jardine cut the crop for hay the gardenlot and house occupied a gentle slope the walls were built of logs notched and crossed at the corners cedar shingles split by hand on the spot covered the roof behind the house one saw fruit trees and log barns nothing was factorymade and jimmy thought all indicated strenuous labor  a yard or two off jardine rubbed his doublebitted axe with a small round hone he wore a gray shirt overalls and long boots and his skin was very brown he was not a big man but he looked hard and muscular and his glance was keen  ye need to get the edge good it pays to keep her sharp he said and tried the blade with his thumb  i expect that is so jimmy agreed did you yourself clear the ranch  i chopped every tree burned the slashing and put up the house and barns noo im getting things in trim and run a small bunch of stock  jimmy thought it a tremendous undertaking the logs stacked ready to burn were two or three feet across the butt  how long were you occupied he asked  twelve years said jardine rather drily when the country doon the fraser began to open up i sold my other ranch bought two or three building lots in a new town and started for the bush i liked this location and i stopped  but can you get your stuff to a market  cows can walk but when ye clear a bush ranch ye dinna bother much about selling truck ye sit tight until the government cuts a wagon trail or maybe a railroads built and the settlements spring up  and then you expect to sell for a good price all the stuff you grow  jardine smiled then i expect to sell the ranch and push on again the oldtime bushman has no use for gamewardens city sports storekeepers and realestate boomers  he stopped and his look got scornful jimmy found out afterwards that the pioneer hates the business man and jardine sprang from scottish border stock perhaps he had inherited his pride and independence from salmonpoaching ancestors what he wanted he labored for to traffic was not his plan  weel he resumed id better get busy after dinner ill drive ye to the hotel  he went off and although jimmy had expected to lunch at the hotel he was satisfied to wait he mused about his host jardine was not young but he carried himself well and jimmy had known young men who did not move like him then the ranch indicated his talent for labor yet muscular strength was obviously not all one needed to front and remove daunting obstacles one must have pluck and imagination the job was a mans job but in a sense the qualities it demanded were primitive and jimmy began to see why the ranch attracted him his grandfather had labored in anothers mill the house of leylands was founded on stubborn effort and stern frugality  jimmy began to wonder where jardine fed his cattle because he saw none in the clearing but by and by a distant clash of bells rolled across the trees jimmy had heard the noise before when he went to sleep and again at daybreak a faint elusive chime had broken the quietness that brooded over kelshope ranch it was the clash of cowbells ringing as the stock pushed through the underbrush when he heard a sharper note he got up and for his leg hurt went cautiously into the woods  by and by he stopped in the tall fern not far off margaret holding out a bunch of corn occupied the middle of an opening in which little red wineberries grew her pose was graceful she did not wear a hat and the sun was on her hair her neck was very white and then her skin was delicate pink that deepened to brown her dress was dull blue and the yellow corn forced up the soft color  oh bright oh buck she called and jimmy thought her voice musical like the chiming bells  where the sunbeams pierced the shade long horns gleamed the bells rang louder and a big brown ox looked out fixed its quiet eyes on the girl and vanished noiselessly margaret did not move at all she was still as the trees in the background and jimmy approved her quietness he got a hint of balance strength and calm  oh bright she called and a brawny redandwhite animal pushed out from the fern shook its massive head and advanced to smell the corn  jimmy now saw margaret carried a rope in her other hand but she let the ox eat the corn and stroked its white forehead before she threw the rope round its horns although she was very quick her movements were gentle and the animal stood still then she looked up and smiled  you can come out mr leyland  you knew i was in the fern  sure said margaret i was born in the woods all the same you were quiet i reckon you can be quiet in the bush thats something  you imply that i was quiet for a tenderfoot  why yes margaret agreed smiling as a rule a man from the cities cant keep still he must talk and move about you didnt feel you ought to come and help  jimmy wondered whether she knew he had wanted to study her but thought she did not anyhow he was satisfied she so to speak had not posed for him  not at all he said i saw you knew your job and i reflected that the ox did not know me but shall i hold him until you catch the other  buck will follow his mate margaret replied and when they started a cowbell clashed and buck stole out of the shade  jimmy thought stole the proper word he had expected to hear branches crack and underbrush rustle but the powerful oxen moved almost silently through the wood  now i see why you give them bells he remarked but doesnt the jangling bother the animals  they like the bells at night i think they toss their heads to hear the chime then they know the bells are useful sometimes when all is quiet the cattle scatter but when the timber wolves are about or a cinnamon bear comes down the rocks the herd rolls up bush cattle are clever now bright feels the rope hes resigned to go to work  you know the woods have you always lived at a ranch  for a time i was at toronto margaret replied when i was needed at kelshope i came back  jimmy felt she baffled him margaret had not stated her occupation at toronto but he had remarked that her english was better than the english one used at the cotton mills after all he was not entitled to satisfy his curiosity  one can understand mr jardines needing you he said i expect a bush rancher is forced to hustle  a bush rancher must hustle all the time margaret agreed still work one likes goes easily have you tried  i have tried work i did not like and admit ive had enough jimmy said and laughed when i started for canada my notion was id be content to play about  margaret nodded we know your sort you are not like our tourists merchants and manufacturers you have no use for business all you think about is sport and your sports extravagant you stop at our big hotels and when you go off to hunt and fish you hire a gang of packers to carry your camp truck  i doubt if i really am that sort jimmy rejoined after all my people are pretty keen business men and i begin to see that to cultivate the habits of the other lot is harder than i thought in fact i rather think id like to own a ranch  for a game said margaret and laughed a frank laugh you must cut it out mr leyland one cant play at ranching and you dont know all the bushman is up against  its possible jimmy admitted well i expect i am a loafer but i did not altogether joke about the ranch the strange thing is after a time loafing gets monotonous  margaret stopped him i must get busy and you ought not to walk about sit down in the shade and ill give you the colonist  jimmy sat down but declared he did not want the newspaper he thought he would study ranching particularly margarets part of the job she put a heavy wooden yoke on the oxens necks fastened a rope to the hook and drove the animals to a belt of burned slashing where big charred logs lay about jardine hitched the rope to a log and the team hauled it slowly to a pile jimmy wondered how two people would get the heavy trunk on top but when margaret led the oxen round the pile and urged them ahead the log went up in a loop of the rope for all that jardine was forced to use a handspike and jimmy saw that to build a logpile demanded strength and skill  resting in the shade he felt the pictures quiet charm the oxens movements were slow and rhythmical jardines muscular figure bent got tense and relaxed the girl finely posed guided the plodding animals behind were stiff dark branches and rows of straight red trunks a woodpecker tapped a hollow tree and in the distance cowbells chimed the dominant note was effort but the effort was smooth and measured one felt that all went as it ought to go and jimmy thought about the big shining flywheel that spun with a steady throb at the leyland cotton mill then his head began to nod and his eyes shut and when he looked up margaret called him to dinner  after dinner jardine got out his cloverleaf wagon and drove jimmy to the hotel when they arrived jimmy took him to his room on the first floor and meeting stannard on the stairs was rather moved to note his relief stannard declared that he and some others had searched the woods since daybreak and were about to start for the ranch by and by deering joined them and made an iced drink jardine with tranquil enjoyment drained his long glass and lighting a cigar began to talk about hunting in the bush his clothes were old and his hat was battered but his calm was marked and jimmy thought he studied the others with quiet curiosity after a time they went off and jardine gave jimmy a thoughtful smile  your friends are polite and mr deering can mix a drink better than a barkeep  is that all jimmy inquired  jardines eyes twinkled weel if i was wanting somebody to see me out maybe id trust the big fellow  jimmy thought his remark strange stannard was a cultivated gentleman and deering was frankly a gambler yet jimmy had grounds to imagine the old rancher was not a fool he was puzzled and rather annoyed but jardine said he must not stay and jimmy let him go     v  jimmy holds fast   the sun had sunk behind the range and the sky was green in places the high white peaks were touched by fading pink the snow that rolled down to the timberline was blue mist floated about the pines by the river but did not reach the hotel terrace and the evening was warm looking down at the dark valley one got a sense of space and height  at the end of the terrace a small table carried a coffee service and laura occupied a basket chair she smoked a cigarette and her look was thoughtful jimmy sitting opposite liked her fashionable dinner dress he had met laura in switzerland but he felt as if he had not known her until she went with stannard to the canadian hotel in fact he imagined she had very recently begun to allow him to know her stannard had gone off a few minutes since and deering was playing pool with a young american  since you came back from the ranch ive thought you preoccupied laura remarked  i expect you thought me dull said jimmy with an apologetic smile well for some days ive been pondering things and im not much used to the exercise in a way youre accountable you inquired not long since if i knew where i went  then you got some illumination at the ranch  youre keen i got disturbed  does to stop at a ranch disturb one laura asked in a careless voice  i expect it depends on your temperament jimmy replied and knitted his brows kelshope is a model ranch you feel all goes as it ought to go when you leave things alone they dont go like that at jardines you get a sense of plan and effort the old fellow and his daughter are keenly occupied and their occupation so to speak is fruitful the trouble is mine is not  laura saw that when he some time since apologized for his loafing her remarks had carried weight jimmy had begun to ponder where he went and she wondered whether he would see he ought to return to the cotton mill still she did not mean to talk about this  you stopped miss jardines horse she said  i did not stop the horse i tried but thats another thing if i had not meddled i expect miss jardine would have conquered the nervous brute and i would not have got a nasty kick  oh well said laura sometimes to meddle is rash but your object was good  then stannard came to the veranda steps and looked about the terrace  hello jimmy deering has beaten frank and we must arrange about our excursion tomorrow  jimmy frowned and hesitated when he had talked to laura before stannard had called him away but he thought she did not mean him to stay and he went off when he had gone laura mused  she knew stannard was jealous for her he did not allow her to join him when his young friends were about and she did not want to do so for the most part she lived with her mothers relations who did not approve of stannard and were not satisfied about her going to canada  to some extent laura imagined their doubts were justified she knew stannard had squandered much of her mothers fortune and now that her trustees guarded the small sum she had inherited he was poor yet he belonged to good clubs and went to race meeting and shooting parties it looked as if sport and gambling paid and laura saw what this implied yet her father was kind and when she was with him he indulged her  she had remarked his calling jimmy away as a rule his touch was very light and she wondered whether he had meant to incite the young fellow by a hint of disapproval but perhaps it was not his object and she speculated about jimmy he was now not the raw lad she had known in switzerland although he was losing something that at the beginning had attracted her she thought he ought not to stay with stannard and particularly with deering and she had tried to indicate the proper line for him to take well suppose he resolved to go back to lancashire laura knew her charm and imagined if she were willing she might go with jimmy although he could not yet use his fortune he was rich and after a time would control the famous manufacturing house besides he was marked by some qualities she liked laura got up with an impatient shrug and blushed she would not think about it yet she was poor but she was not an adventuress  in the morning stannard deering and jimmy started for the rocks their object was to follow the range and look for a line to the top of a peak they meant to climb another day they lunched on the mountain and in the afternoon stopped at the side of a gully that ran down to the glacier the back of the gully was smooth and the pitch was steep but hardly steep enough to bother an athletic man in places banks of small gravel rested although it looked as if a disturbing foot would send down the stones  some distance above the spot the top of another pitch cut a background of broken rocks streaked by veins of snow the sun was on the rocks and some shone like polished steel but the gully was in shadow and jimmy had felt the gloom daunting deering pulled out his cigarcase his face was red his shirt was open and his sunburned neck was like a bulls  my loads two hundred pounds and we have shoved along pretty fast since lunch he said anyhow im going to stop and take a smoke  to lean against a slippery rock wont rest you much stannard remarked well get on to the shelf at the top of the slab  then somebodys got to boost me up deering declared and when stannard went to help put his boot on the others head and crushed his soft hat down to his ears  next moment he was on the shelf and shouted with laughter sometimes deerings humor was boyishly rude but his friends were not cheated and jimmy thought the big man keen and resolute stannard went up lightly as if it did not bother him he was cool and by contrast with deering looked fastidiously refined jimmy imagined he had an object for leaving the gully stannard knew the mountains in fact he knew all a sporting gentleman ought to know and jimmy was satisfied with his guide  since you reckon we ought to get from under whyd you fix on this line down deering inquired  the lines good but we were longer than i thought and the sun has been for some time on the snow  sure said deering the blamed trough looks like a rubbish shoot  jimmy had trusted stannards judgment but now he saw a light for one thing the back of the gully was smooth the mountain fronted rather north of west and so long as the frost at the summit held the party did not run much risk but when the thaw began snow and broken rocks might roll down when deering had nearly smoked his cigar he looked up  somethings coming  jimmy heard a rumble and a crash a big stone leaped down the gully struck a rock and vanished a bank of gravel began to slip away and then a gray and white mass swept across the top of the pitch snow and stones poured down tumultuously and when the avalanche was gone confused echoes rolled about the rocks  that fixes it said deering im going the other way had we shoved along a little faster we might have made it but i was soft and couldnt hit up the pace he laughed his boisterous laugh and resumed the trouble is i played cards with jimmy when i ought to have gone to bed well since we didnt bring a rope what are you going to do about it  if we can reach the top i think we can get down along the edge stannard replied  after something of a struggle they got up and for a time to follow the top of the gully was not hard then they stopped on an awkward pitch where a big bulging stone jambed in a crack cut their view  ill try the stone but perhaps you had better traverse out across the face and look for another line deering said to stannard  jimmy went with deering and when they reached the stone saw a broken shelf three or four yards below on one side the rocks dropped straight to the gully in front the slope beyond the shelf was steep for a few moments deering studied the ground  a rope would be useful but if we can reach the shelf we ought to get down he said ill try to make it lie across the stone and give me your hands  jimmy nodded at an awkward spot the second man helps the leader who afterwards steadies him the rock was rough and a small knob and the deep crack promised some support still caution was indicated because the shelf on which one must drop was inclined and narrow jimmy lay across the stone and deering slipping over the edge seized his hands he was a big fellow and jimmy thought the stone moved but he heard deerings boots scrape the rock and the strain on his arms was less  then he heard another noise and snow and rocks and a broken pine rolled down the gully the avalanche vanished the uproar sank and deering gasped hold fast  the load on jimmys arms got insupportable he imagined the noise had startled deering and his foot had slipped from the knob it looked as if he must hold the fellow until he found the crack jimmy meant to try although the stone rocked and he knew he could not long bear the horrible strain if deering fell he would not stop at the shelf he might not stop for three or four hundred feet jimmy set his mouth and tried to brace his knees against the rock the stone was moving and if it moved much deering would pull him over yet in a moment or two deering might get his boot in the crack and to let him fall was unthinkable  jimmy held on until deering shouted and let go he had obviously found some support and jimmy tried to get back but could not his chest was across the edge and the stone rocked he was slipping off and saw halfconsciously that since he must fall he must not fall down the rock front pushing himself from the edge he plunged into the gully struck the rock some way down and knew no more deering on the shelf saw him reach the bottom roll for a distance and stop he lay face downwards with his arms spread out  a few moments afterwards stannard reached the spot and looked down deerings big chest heaved his mouth was slack and his face was white when he indicated jimmy his hand shook  i pulled him over he said in a hoarse voice  stannard gave him a keen rather scornful glance traverse across the front for about twenty yards and youll see a good line down when you get down start for the hotel and bring the two guides our rope a blanket and two poles send somebody to telegraph for a doctor  not at all im going to jimmy i pulled the kid over  stannard frowned you are going to the hotel for one thing i doubt if you could reach jimmy youre badly jarred and your nerves gone then unless you get help we cant carry jimmy out  you mustnt leave him in the gully deering rejoined suppose a fresh lot of stones comes along  go for help said stannard pulling out his watch come back up the gully if you have a flask give it to me im going down  but if theres another snowslide you and jimmy will get smashed besides the job is mine  the snow and stones come down the middle and theyll stop by and by dont talk start  deering hesitated he was big and muscular but he admitted that on the rocks stannard was the better man moreover to know he was accountable for jimmys plunge had shaken him and he saw stannard was very cool  take the flask he said and went off at a reckless speed     vi  deering owns a debt   jimmy saw a pale star and veins of snow streaking high shadowy rocks he thought when he looked up not long before the sun was on the mountain but perhaps it was not his brain was dull and he was numbed by cold he shivered and shut his eyes but after a few minutes he smelt cigarsmoke and looked about again although it was getting dark he saw somebody sitting in the gloom at the bottom of the rocks  wheres deering he asked did i let him go  you did not take a drink the other replied and pushed a flask into jimmys hand  jimmy drank gasped and tried to get up but found he could not move  where is deering he insisted  i expect hes crossing the glacier with the guides from the hotel said the man who took the flask from him and jimmy knew stannards voice  then where am i  you are in the gully you held on to deering until he got support for his foot then you slipped off the big stone something like that anyhow do you feel pain at any particular spot  i dont know if one spot hurts worse than another all hurt i doubt if i can get up  you mustnt try said stannard firmly when deering arrives well help you up  jimmy pondered since the evening was very cold he thought it strange stannard had pulled off his coat then he saw somebody had put over him a coat that was not his  why have you given me your clothes he asked  for one thing i didnt fall about forty feet  if i had fallen forty feet id have got smashed its obvious  perhaps you hit the side of the gully and rolled down but its not important when one gets a jolt like yours the shocks as bad as the local injury are you cold  im horribly cold but although i heard stones not long since i dont think i got hit  the stones run down the middle and i pulled you against the rock  youre a good sort jimmy remarked deerings a good sort to know hes not hurt is some relief  stannard said nothing and jimmy asked for a cigarette stannard gave him a cigarette and a light but after a few moments he let it drop  the tobaccos not good he said dully and began to muse  he was strangely slack and his body was numb perhaps to feel no local pain was ominous he knew a man who fell on the rocks and had not afterwards used his legs to be wheeled about for all ones life was horrible when a doctor arrived he would know his luck and in the meantime he dared not dwell on things like that he studied the rocks stannard had obviously come down by the slanting crack jimmy thought he himself could not have done so then stannard risking his getting hit by rebounding stones had remained with him for some hours when jimmy helped deering the sun shone and now the stars were out the gully was high on the mountain and after the sun went the cold was keen but stannard had given him his coat stannard was like that  i expect you sent deering to the hotel jimmy resumed after a time  yes i was firm deering wanted to go down to you but i doubted if he could get down and the important thing was to fetch help you must be moved as soon as possible  jimmy nodded deering was the man he had thought all the same stannards was the finer type jimmy had long known his pluck but he had other qualities when one must front a crisis he was cool he saw and carried out the proper plan but jimmys brain was very dull and stannards figure melted and the rocks got indistinct  after a time he heard a noise a shout echoed in the gully nailed boots rattled on stones and it looked as if men were coming up deering breathless and gasping arrived before the others and motioned to stannard  not much grounds to be disturbed i think said stannard in a quiet voice he was talking sensibly not long since  deering came to jimmy and touched his arm youre not broke up partner you havent got it against me that i pulled you off the rocks  certainly not i slipped off jimmy declared anyhow youre my friend  sure thing said deering quietly take a drink of hot soup well soon pack you out he put a vacuum flask in jimmys hand and turned to the others lets get busy boys  jimmy did not know much about their journey down the gully and across the glacier but at length he was vaguely conscious of bright lights and the tramp of feet along an echoing passage people gently moved him about he felt he was in a soft warm bed and with languid satisfaction he went to sleep  when the others saw jimmy was asleep they went off quietly but at the end of the passage deering stopped stannard  lets get a drink he said for four or five hours ive hustled some and i need a pickmeup  stannard gave him a keen glance deering had hustled to carry jimmy down the rocks and across the glacier in the dark was a strenuous undertaking and where strength was needed the big man had nobly used his yet stannard imagined the strain that had bothered him was not physical  oh well he said ill go to the bar with you waiting for you in the gully was not a soothing job  you knew id get back deering rejoined if id had to haul out the cook and bellboys id have brought help  i didnt know how long youd be and speed was important  youre a blamed cool fellow deering remarked if you had not taken control i expect wed have jolted jimmy off the stretcher and maybe have gone through the snowbridge the guide didnt spot then you stayed with him pulled him out of the way of the snowslides and kept him warm i expect you saved his life  to some extent perhaps that is so stannard agreed that somebody must pull jimmy against the rock was obvious all the same i knew the stones wouldnt bother us after it got cold  deering was puzzled stannards habit was not to boast but it looked as if he were willing to admit he had saved jimmys life deering speculated about his object  well he said i own i was badly rattled you see if the kid had not held fast id have gone right down the rock face and dont know where id have stopped perhaps its strange but i remembered id got five hundred dollars of his and the thing bothered me to know id played a straight game didnt comfort me much  youre a sentimentalist stannard rejoined with a smile i dont know that a crooked game was indicated but lets get our drinks  they went to the bar and when deering picked up his glass he said good luck to the kid and a quick recovery he drained the glass and looked at stannard hard when jimmy needs a help out im his man  stannard said nothing but lighted a cigarette  in the morning a young doctor arrived from calgary and was some time in jimmys room  i reckon your luck was pretty good he remarked after three or four days you can get up and go about he paused and added meaningly but you want to go slow  jimmys face was white but the blood came to his skin  id begun to think something like that he said in a languid voice  the doctor nodded since you could stand for the knock you got your bodys pretty sound but i get a hint of strain and the cures moral you want to cut out hard drinks strong cigars and playing cards all night  do the symptoms indicate that i do play cards all night  i own i was helped by inquiries about your habits said the doctor smiling if you like a game try pool with boys like yourself and bet fifty cents i dont know about your bankroll but your heart and nerve wont stand for hundreddollar pots when your antagonists are men  one antagonist risked his life to save mine jimmy declared with an angry flush for he thought he saw where the others remarks led  i understand that is so the doctor agreed my jobs not to talk about your friends but to give you good advice cut out unhealthy excitement and go steady if you like it go up on the rocks mountaineerings dangerous but sometimes one runs worse risks  he went off and by and by deering came in  the doctor allows you are making pretty good progress the man who means to put you out must use a gun he said with a jolly laugh anyhow we were bothered and when we got the bulletin we rushed the bar for drinks  my friends are stanch  oh shucks said deering youre the sort whose friends are stanch say your holding on until i pulled you over was great  you didnt pull me over the stone rocked and i came off  one mustnt dispute with a sick man deering remarked all the same i want to state i owe you much and i pay my debts id like you to get that  jimmy smiled if its some comfort im willing to be your creditor i know youd meet my bill  sure thing said deering who did not smile when you send your bill along ill try to make good thats all i guess well let it go  very well i dont see how you were able to stick to the slab  my foot slipped from the knob but for a few moments you held me up and bracing my knee against the stone i swung across for the crack then i was on the shelf and you went over my head thats all i knew until stannard joined me and took control  he sent you off  deering nodded i wasnt keen to go but he saw help was wanted and he thought about wiring for a doctor when i got back with the boys our plan was to rush you down to the hotel but it wasnt stannards i allow we were rattled he was cool we must go slow and not jolt you at awkward spots somebody must look for the smoothest line crossing the glacier he went ahead with the lantern and located a soft snowbridge the guide was going to cross  stannard is like that said jimmy his coolness is very fine  deering agreed but jimmy thought he hesitated before he resumed in some ways the fellows the standard type of highbrow englishman hes urbane and wont dispute he smiles and lets you down he wears the proper clothes and uses the proper talk if youre his friend hes charming but thats not all the man stannard doesnt plunge he calculates he knows just where he wants to go and gets there i guess if i was an obstacle id pull out of his way the mans fine like tempered steel and about as hard well the doctor stated you wanted quiet and ill quit talking  he went away and jimmy mused deering talked much but jimmy imagined he sometimes had an object although he frankly approved stannard jimmy felt he struck a warning note since jimmy owed much to stannards coolness he was rather annoyed but the talk had tired him and he went to sleep     vii  an insurable interest   the sun was hot and jimmy loafed in an easy chair at the shady end of the terrace laura occupied a chair opposite the small table between them carried some new books and flowers and fruit from the pacific coast in the background a shining white peak cut the serene sky  three or four young men and women were on the veranda steps not far off a few minutes since they had bantered jimmy but when laura arrived they went jimmy rather thought she had meant them to go and he gave her a smile  i expect you have inherited some of mr stannards talents he remarked  for example  jimmy indicated the rather noisy group it looks as if you knew my head ached and i couldnt stand for stevens jokes when you joined me he and his friends went off your father arranges things like that without much obvious effort  i knew the doctor stated you must not be bothered laura admitted besides i engaged to go fishing with stevens and some others and before i get back expect ill have enough  is dillon going  frank planned the excursion said laura and jimmy was satisfied  dillon was a young american whom jimmy rather liked but to think laura liked frank annoyed him now however she had admitted that his society had not much charm  anyhow youre very kind he remarked and indicated the fruit and flowers these things dont grow in the mountains  the station is not far off and to send a telegram is not much bother  to send up things from vancouver is expensive  sometimes you talk like a cotton manufacturer laura rejoined  jimmy colored but gave her a steady glance its possible my people are manufacturers my grandfather was a workman not long since i meant to cultivate out all that marked me as belonging to the cotton mill now i dont know perhaps i inherited something useful from my grandfather but in the meantime its not important you are kind  oh well said laura you were moody and the doctor declared you had got a very nasty jolt  i was thoughtful to some extent youre accountable when one is forced to loaf one has time to ponder and when you inquired if i knew where i went  he stopped for a guide carrying fishing rods and landing nets went down the steps and stannard came out of the hotel  your partys waiting for you stannard remarked to laura who got up and gave jimmy a smile  get well and then ponder she said and joined the others  jimmy frowned the others of course ought not to wait for laura but stannard had sent her off like that before all the same he was her father and jimmy owned he must not dispute his rule when the party had gone stannard sat down opposite jimmy and lighted a cigarette  im glad to note you make good progress  in a day or two ill go about as usual in fact if the others go fishing tomorrow ill try to join them i think i could reach the lake  some cautions necessary stannard remarked you got a very nasty shake and ran worse risks than you knew when you stopped in the bank of gravel your luck was remarkably good i did not expect you to stop until you reached the glacier then had i not had a thick coat that helped to keep you warm you might not have survived the shock afterwards much depended on deerings speed and his getting men who knew the rocks indeed when we started i hardly thought we could carry you down in useful time  jimmy was puzzled because he did not think stannard meant to imply that his help was important the risk jimmy had run however was obvious and stannards talking about it led him to dwell on something he had recently weighed  since i was forced to stay in bed ive tried to reckon up and find out where i am he said you are my banker how does the account stand  i imagine lauras advice was good wait until you get better stannard said carelessly  when i start to go about ill be occupied by something else how much do i owe  for a few minutes stannard studied his notebook and when he replied jimmy set his mouth he knew he had been extravagant but his extravagance was worse than he had thought  until i get my inheritance its impossible for me to pay you he said with some embarrassment i so to speak have pawned my allowance for a long time in advance  something like that is obvious  very well what am i going to do about it  my plan was to wait until you did get your inheritance but i see some disadvantages said stannard in a thoughtful voice  the trouble is i might not inherit jimmy agreed one must front things and climbings a risky hobby we mean to shoot a mountain sheep and i understand the bighorn keep the high rocks then we have undertaken to get up a very awkward peak well suppose i did not come back  you dont expect a fresh accident havent you had enough however if your gloomy forebodings were justified i expect your relations would meet my claim  after all mountaineering accidents are numerous and you dont know dick leyland you have got a bundle of acknowledgments but the notes are not stamped and dick hates gambling its possible hed dispute my debts and hes a remarkably keen business man  if that is so it might be awkward stannard agreed but what about the other trustee  sir james is in india i expect hed support dick during their lifetime my share is a third of the houses profit but unless theyre satisfied i cannot for some time use much control in fact they have power to fix my allowance  stannards look was thoughtful as if he had not known but since laura knew jimmy wondered why she had not enlightened her father  very well said stannard my plan might not work have you another  the other plan was obvious jimmy was surprised because stannard did not see it  you trusted me and i mustnt let you down he said with a friendly smile if we insure my life youll guard against all risk  my interest is insurable stannard remarked and stopped then he resumed in a careless voice your cautions ridiculous but if you are resolved i suppose i must agree in order to satisfy you well look up an insurance office at vancouver  somehow jimmy was jarred stannards remark about his insurable interest indicated that he had weighed the plan before and jimmy thought his pause significant then although he had agreed as if he wanted to indulge jimmy his agreement was prompt for all that the plan was jimmys and stannards approval was justified  then deering came along the terrace and said to stannard hello i thought you had gone to write some letters and jimmys look is strangely sober have you been weighing something important  the glance stannard gave jimmy was careless but jimmy thought he meant deering was not to know  sometimes jimmys rash but sometimes hes keener than one thinks anyhow hes obstinate and we were disputing about a suggestion of his i did not at first approve i wrote the letters i meant to write sit down and take a smoke  deering sat down and they talked about the peaks they had planned to climb  a week or two afterwards stannard and jimmy went to vancouver and when he had seen the insurance companys doctor jimmy walked about the streets he liked vancouver when one fronted an opening in the rows of ambitious office blocks one saw the broad inlet and anchored ships across the shining water mountains rolled back to the snow in the north on the other side streets of new wooden houses pushed out to meet the dark pine forest the citys surroundings were beautiful but jimmy felt that beauty was not its peculiar charm  at montreal for example one got a hint of cultivation and to some extent of leisure built on longestablished prosperity notre dame was rather like notre dame at paris and st jamess was a glorious cathedral quiet green squares checkered the city and the streets at the bottom of the mountain were bordered by fine shade trees vancouver was frankly raw and new one felt it had not yet reached its proper growth all was bustle and keen activity the clang of locomotive bells and the rattle of steamboat winches echoed about the streets huge sawmills and stacks of lumber occupied the waterfront giant trunks carried electric wires across the high roofs and until jimmy saw the firs in stanley park he had not thought logs like that grew  then he thought the citizens typically western their look was keen and optimistic they pushed and jostled along the sidewalks jimmy saw an opera house and numerous poolrooms but in the daytime nobody seemed to loaf all struck a throbbing note of strenuous business jimmy studied the wharfs and mills and railroad yard but for the most part he stopped opposite the landagents windows  the large maps of freshlyopened country called up there in the wilds hard men drove back the forest and broke virgin soil their job was a mans job and jimmy pictured the struggle he had loafed and indulged his youthful love for pleasure but the satisfaction he had got was gone after all he had inherited some constructive talent and he vaguely realized that his business was to build and not to squander then laura and the doctor had worked on him laura had bidden him study where he went the other hinted that he went too fast  at one office he saw a map of the country behind the hotel and he picked out the valley in which was kelshope ranch there was not another homestead for some distance and a notice stated that the land was cheap jimmy pondered for a few minutes and then went in  the agent stated his willingness to supply land of whatever sort jimmy needed but he thought for an ambitious young man the proper investment was a city building lot in fact he had a number of useful lots on a firstclass frontage jimmy studied the map and remarked that the town had not got there yet the agent declared the town would get there soon and to wait until the streets were graded and prices went up was a fools plan jimmy stated he would not speculate if the price were suitable he might buy land in the kelshope valley on the other map  the agent said the valley was not altogether in his hands kelshope was in alberta but for a split commission he could negotiate a sale with the calgary broker if one bought a block and paid a small deposit he imagined a good sum might stand on mortgage jimmy replied that he would think about it and went off it was not for nothing he had studied business methods at the leyland mill  in the evening he and stannard occupied a bench in the hotel rotunda cigarsmoke floated about the pillars the revolving glass doors went steadily round and noisy groups pushed in and out but stannard had got a quiet corner and by and by jimmy asked have you agreed with the insurance office  they have not sent the agreement i expect to get it  then id like you to go back in the morning and insure for a larger sum ill give you a note for five hundred pounds  i havent five hundred pounds said stannard with surprise why do you want the sum  im going to buy a ranch near jardines jimmy replied the agent wants a deposit and i must buy tools can you help  stannard looked at him hard and hesitated but he saw jimmy was resolved  i might get the money in three or four weeks it will cost you something  thats understood jimmy agreed i dont of course expect the sum for which youll hold my note will you get to work  i rather think your plan ridiculous  you thought another plan of mine ridiculous but you helped me carry it out jimmy said quietly  stannard looked up with a frown for deering crossed the floor  ive trailed you he shouted theres not much use in your stealing off  i didnt know you had business to transact in vancouver stannard rejoined  dillon had some business and brought me along said deering with a noisy laugh looks as if my job was to guide adventurous youth  jimmy smiled for he imagined the young men deering guided paid expensive fees he did not know if deerings occupation was altogether gambling but he did gamble and his habit was to win yet jimmy liked the fellow  jimmys mood is rashly adventurous he wants to buy a ranch stannard resumed i understand he has interviewed a plausible landagent  all landagents are plausible said deering tell us about the speculation jimmy  jimmy did so stannards ironical amusement had hurt and he tried to justify his experiment  looks like a joke but i dont know said deering if you can stand for holding down a bush block until the neighborhood develops you ought to sell for a good price all the same the job is dreary have you got the money  i was trying to persuade stannard to finance me he doesnt approve but thinks he could get the sum  that plans expensive deering observed what deposit does the agent want  jimmy told him and he pondered stannard said nothing but jimmy thought him annoyed by deerings meddling moreover jimmy thought deering knew after a few moments deering looked up  if you mean to buy the block ill lend you the deposit and you can pay me current interest i expect the agent will take a longdate mortgage for the rest but you ought to ask your trustees in england for the money  have you got the sum stannard inquired  sure said deering with a jolly laugh dillon and i met up with two or three sporting lumber men who have just put over a big deal my luck was pretty good and id have stuffed my wallet had not a sort of puritan vigilante blown in he got after the hotel boss who stated his was not a red light house  jimmy studied the others and although stannard smiled was somehow conscious of a puzzling antagonism on the whole he liked deerings plan he did not think dick leyland would agree but sir jim might do so  thank you but stannards my banker he replied all the same in the morning ill write to my trustees  oh well said deering if you want the money im your man but lets get a drink     viii  jimmy gets to work   on the evening jimmy returned from vancouver he went to the diningroom as soon as the bell rang and waited by stannards table the table occupied a corner by a window and commanded the room and a noble view of rocks and distant snow other guests had wanted the corner but stannard had got it for his party although he was not rich stannards habit was to get things like that  the room was spacious and paneled with cedar and maple slender wooden pillars supported the decorated beams the tables were furnished with good china and nickel the windows were open and the keen smell of the pines floated in  after a few moments jimmy heard deerings laugh and stannards party crossed the floor frank dillon talked to laura whom jimmy had not seen since he returned frank was rather a handsome athletic young fellow laura wore a fashionable black dinner dress and her skin by contrast was very white her movements were languidly graceful and jimmy got a sense of high cultivation he was young and to know he belonged to lauras party flattered him yet he was half embarrassed because he waited for other guests and did not know if laura would like his friends when she gave jimmy her hand stannard indicated two extra chairs  hallo he said i must see the head waiter this tables ours  two friends of mine are coming jimmy replied and turned to laura apologetically perhaps i ought to have told you but i wrote to jardine from vancouver and when i returned and got his letter you were not about  was it not miss jardine you helped when her horse ran away  i doubt if i did help much but after the horse knocked me down i went to the homestead and jardine was kind now i want to talk to him hes a good rancher  then ranching really interests you  jimmy has bought a ranch and im going to stay with him said deering with a noisy laugh perhaps to hunt and live the simple life will help me keep down my weight  laura gave jimmy a keen glance and he thought she frowned you a rancher its ridiculous but deering likes to joke  it is not at all a joke deering rejoined jimmy has bought a ranch and stannard and i disputed who should lend him the money as a rule ones friends dont dispute about that sort of privilege but one trusts jimmy perhaps his trusting you accounts for it  i suppose miss jardine comes with her father laura remarked  jimmy agreed and looked at stannard who had picked up the bill of fare  we must wait for your friends he said carelessly but jimmy thought him annoyed  then jimmy turned and saw margaret and jardine the ranchers clothes were obviously bought at a small settlement store but his figure was good and his glance was keen and cool somehow jimmy imagined him ironically amused margarets blue dress was not fashionable but she carried herself like an indian and was marked by something of the indians calm in the sunset her hair was red her eyes were blue and her skin was brown when jimmy advanced to meet her she gave him a frank smile he presented her to laura and noted dillons admiring glance  stannard called a waiter and when dinner was served began to talk laura supported him but jimmy rather thought her support too obvious this was strange because laura was clever and knew where to stop now it looked as if she did not the jardines were his friends but nothing indicated that for them to dine at a fashionable hotel was embarrassing he imagined margaret studied laura and sometimes lauras glance rested on the other for a moment and was gone when deering had satisfied his appetite however he firmly took the lead and jimmy let him do so sometimes deerings humor was rude but it was kind  when they went to the terrace others joined them and soon a party surrounded stannards table after a time the people moved their chairs about and jimmy saw jardine was with deering and dillon had joined margaret he fancied laura had remarked this but she lighted a cigarette and gave him a friendly smile  your friends dont want you just now when you started for vancouver i think you ought to have told me about your ranching experiment  i didnt know said jimmy in an apologetic voice i saw a map in a landagents window and something called i hesitated for a few minutes and then went in  then you didnt go to vancouver in order to buy a ranch  not at all said jimmy and stopped because he did not want to state why he did go of course it looks like a rash plunge he resumed still i doubt if it really is rash and i imagined you would approve  laura smiled i dont know much about ranching  not long ago you declared i ought to have an occupation  then you felt you must get to work because i thought you ought said laura and gave jimmy a gentle glance  jimmys heart beat but he knitted his brows he was sincere and laura was not altogether accountable for his resolve  well he said in a thoughtful voice i was getting slack and loafing along the easy way until you pulled me up i owe you much for that you forced me to ponder and i began to see loafing was dangerous one must have an object and i looked about  he stopped with some embarrassment and laura saw he was moved jimmy did owe her something for she had meddled at a moment when he was vaguely dissatisfied and looking for a lead at the beginning she was not selfish she wanted him to stop and ponder but he had started off again and was not going where she wanted him to go  you imply you have found an object she remarked after all ones object ought to be worth while and to chop trees on a ranch will not carry you far perhaps your proper occupation is at the cotton mill  i think not anyhow not yet until im twentyfive dick leyland has control dick is a good mill manager but his school is the old school he holds down our workpeople and they grumble the machinerys crowded and some is not safe the operatives have not the space and light that makes work easier then the office is dark and cold one cant persuade dick that harshness and parsimony no longer pay well when i go back i must have power to put things straight the house is famous my father built its fortune and after all im its head  laura mused she was poor and hating poverty had begun to weigh jimmys advantages to marry the head of the famous house was a sound ambition and she thought if she used her charm jimmy would marry her he was young and in some respects argued like a boy laura was young but she argued like a calculating woman yet she hesitated  but you have some power she said and smiled besides youre obstinate  its possible all the same i havent tried my power and dont trust myself dick and i would jar and when i couldnt move him i expect id get savage and turn down the job when i have done some useful work for example cleared a ranch got confidence and know my strength ill go back and try to take my proper part  does one get the qualities you feel you want at a bush ranch  jardine has got a number at kelshope all is properly planned and stubbornly carried out his labors rewarded and the important thing is he is satisfied im not and i admit i havent much ground to be satisfied  oh well said laura in a few days we start on our excursion to puget sound i think you agreed to join us  jimmy knitted his brows he wanted to join the party but saw some obstacles  we talked about it if i agreed of course ill go  because you agreed  not altogether id like to go  then why do you hesitate we want you to join us  for one thing i really dont think i did agree anyhow youll have dillon his homes on puget sound and i expect hes going  frank is rather a good sort but sometimes he bores one laura remarked carelessly besides after a time hes going to some friends in colorado  jimmys heart beat although he was not yet lauras lover her charm was strong still he ought to get to work and if he went to puget sound with laura he might not afterwards bother about the ranch well perhaps the ranch was not important if he wanted he could no doubt sell the land  the clash of a locomotive bell softened by the distance echoed across the bush a freight train had started from the water tank for the long climb to the pass and jimmy felt the faint notes carried a message canada was a land of bells at montreal the locomotive bells rang all night their tolling rolled across wide belts of wheat and broke the silence that broods over the rocks when all was quiet in the bush the cowbells rang sweet chimes perhaps jimmy was romantic but he felt the bells stood for useful effort and now they called the strange thing was he thought he heard pine branches crack and margarets voice oh buck oh bright  im sorry but i cant go he said i have bought the ranch and must get to work  laura gave him a keen glance and got a jar he frowned and his mouth was tight she had thought she could move jimmy but now she doubted and because she was proud she dared not try  oh well she said we have talked for some time and deering has left jardine  she sent jimmy off and looked about dillon talked to margaret and although laura imagined a smile would detach him from the group she did not smile after all if frank joined her jimmy might occupy the chair he left laura crossed the terrace and joined a young canadian  jimmy sat down by the rancher and inquired do you know the land i bought  the soil is pretty good but the timbers thick and until ye work oot the turpentine yell no get much crop yell need to chop and burn off the trees grub the stumps and then plow for oats and timothy for some years the oats will no grow milling heads ye cut them for hay  looks like a long job suppose i wanted to sell the block after a time  it depends said jardine dryly ye might get your money back  you imply it depends on the labor one uses jimmy remarked well i know nothing about chopping and i havent pulled a crosscut saw do you think i can make good  jardine looked about the terrace and his eyes twinkled he noted the mens dinner jackets and the womens fashionable clothes people talked and laughed and smoked  im thinking your friends would not make good ye canna play at ranching  my objects not to play said jimmy in a quiet voice anyhow before you start to work you must get proper tools suppose you tell me what i need  jardine did so and added proper tools and stock are a sound investment but ye canna get them cheap can ye put up the money  i must borrow some jimmy admitted and thought jardine studied stannard who talked to two or three young men not far off  then maybe ye had better borrow from mr deering  jardine had said something like this before but jimmy let it go and the rancher indicated margaret dillon leaned against a post opposite the girl and a group of young men and women occupied the surrounding chairs a touch of color had come to margarets skin her look was alert and happy jimmy had known her undertake a mans job at the ranch but on the hotel veranda she was not at all exotic  i must thank ye mr leyland sometimes its lonesome at the ranch jardine remarked  jimmy said he hoped his guests would stay for some days but jardine refused  at kelshope works aye waiting and well start the morn if ye come back wi us well look ower the block ye bought and i might advise ye aboot layin t oot in the meantime well reckon up the tools and stock yell need  they began to talk about the ranch and stannard joined laura who sent off her companion  what do you think about jimmys experiment stannard asked  laura studied him on the whole his look was careless but she doubted  i dont know do you think him rash  stannard shrugged my notion is the things a rather expensive caprice but after all jimmys rich hes easily moved and perhaps his bush friends have persuaded him  its possible laura agreed all the same jimmys keen he really means to ranch  you have some grounds to know him keen  lauras grounds were good and she wondered whether stannard knew her father was clever and she saw his look was thoughtful  for one thing he declares he cannot go with us to puget sound she said  you imply he would sooner start for the bush with the jardines stannard suggested with a smile  after all its not important and i expect jimmy will go where he wants said laura and went up the veranda steps  she thought she had baffled stannard but she was hurt at the beginning she knew her advice to jimmy was good when he was going the wrong way she had stopped him now however it looked as if her power was gone she could see herself jimmys guide in lancashire but to guide him in the lonely bush was another thing     ix  the quiet woods   a warm chinook wind blowing from the pacific carried the smell of the pines the dark branches tossed and a languid murmur like distant surf rolled up the valley jimmy had pulled off his coat and his gray workmans shirt was open at the neck for he liked to feel the breeze on his hot skin he was splitting cedar for roof shingles but had stopped in order to sharpen his ax since he had not yet cut his leg he thought his luck was good  a few maples beginning to turn crimson broke the rows of somber pines in the foreground were chopped trunks blackened by fire ashes and white chips a tent and a halfbuilt house of notched logs occupied the middle of the small clearing in the background one saw high rocks streaked at their dark tops by snow some of the snow was fresh and jimmy imagined the speed he had used was justified yet so long as the chinook blew gentle indian summer would brood over the valley  jimmys skin was brown his mouth was firm and his look alert his hands were blistered and his back was sore but this was not important he could now pull a big saw through gummy logs and as a rule drive the shining axhead where he wanted it to go a belt held his overalls tight at his waist when he tilted back his head to get his breath his balance and pose were good  a plume of aromatic smoke floated across the clearing and okanagan bob squatted by the fire bobs hair was black and straight and his eyes were narrow his crouching pose was significant because a white man sits bobs skin was white but it looked as if some indian blood ran in his veins he was an accurate shot and a clever fisherman now he fried trout for breakfast and jimmy wondered whether he would leave the fish long enough in the pan as a rule bob did not cook things much  somebodys coming he remarked and began to eat take your fish when you want ive got to pull out  for a minute or two jimmy heard nothing and then a faint beat of horses feet stole across the woods the noise got louder and by and by margaret rode into the clearing when jimmy jumped for his jacket she smiled and the nervous cayuse plunged in the bush all goes quietly and abrupt movement means danger  margaret rode astride her dress was dull yellow and her leggings were fringed deerskin at the hotel jimmy had approved her blue clothes but he thought he liked her better in the bush somehow she harmonized with the straight trunks it was not that she was finely built and beautiful one got a hint of primitive calm and strength  shall i hold the bridle jimmy asked  i think not said margaret and soothed the horse another time when you took the bridle i was forced to walk home and you got a kick  on the whole i think my luck was good jimmy rejoined when i went to kelshope things so to speak began to move  margaret got down took a pack from the saddle and tied the horse to a tree bob got up from the fire seized his rifle and looked at margaret  im going to get a deer he said and vanished in the wood the underbrush was thick but they did not hear him go  when i was at the station the agent gave me your mail and some groceries said margaret my father allowed you were busy and id better take the truck along  jimmy said thank you and gave her a thoughtful look margarets voice was cultivated but she talked like a bush girl at the hotel she had not  i didnt order a fruit pie and a number of bannocks he said when he opened the pack  oh well i was baking and i reckoned if bob was cook you wouldnt get much dessert but have you eaten yet  jimmy said he imagined breakfast was ready and margaret went to the fire glanced at the halfraw trout and threw a black doughy cake from a plate  a white man cooks his food she said meaningly take a smoke while i fix something fit to eat  jimmy pushed two or three letters into his pocket and sat down on a cedar log if margaret meant to cook his breakfast he imagined she would do so and he was satisfied to watch her for one thing she knew her job and jimmy liked to see all done properly she did not bother him for things she seemed to know where they were after a time she put the trout and some thin light cakes on a slab of bark and jimmy remarked that the fish were an appetizing golden brown  i expect you have not got breakfast and ill bring you a plate he said  at a bush ranch the woman gets the plates  theres not much use in pretending the bush rules are yours jimmy rejoined anyhow ill bring you all you want  wash the plate please said margaret id sooner you did not rub it with the towel  jimmy laughed you take things for granted im not a complete bushman yet  he cleaned the plates and knives and margaret studied him something of his carelessness and the hint of indulgence she had noted were gone his face had got thin and his frank glance was steady although he laughed his laugh was quiet the bush was hardening him and when she looked about she saw the progress he had made was good well she knew jimmy was not a loafer after the cayuse kicked his leg he carried her heavy pack to the ranch  now we can get to work he said  margaret allowed him to put a trout and some hot flapjacks on her plate  after all i like it when people bring me things she remarked at kelshope when one wants a thing one goes for it i reckon your friends ring a bell  perhaps both plans have some drawbacks still i dont see why you bother to indicate that you do not ring bells  it looks as if youre pretty keen said margaret  keener than you thought well not long since id have admitted i was something of a fool anyhow i rather think you know the canadian cities  at toronto i stopped at a cheap boardinghouse they rang bells for you if you were not in right on time for meals you went without you didnt ask for the menu you took what the waitress brought now you ought to be satisfied im not curious about your job in the old country  im not at all reserved jimmy rejoined i occupied a desk at a cotton mill office and wrote up lists of goods in a big book until i couldnt stand for it then i quit  margaret weighed his statement and imagined he had used some reserve for a clerk at a cotton mill to tour about canada with rich people was strange  you talk about the old country although you stated you were altogether canadian jimmy resumed  my fathers a scot he came from the border  your name indicates it the jardines and two or three other clans ruled the western border but were themselves a stubborn unruly lot your ancestors were famous i know their haunts in annandale  i reckon my father was a poacher margaret observed  jimmy laughed its possible the others were something like that anyhow their main occupation was to drive off english cattle but we wont bother  he stopped and mused sometimes when he was at the cotton mill he had gone for a holiday to the bleak scottish moors the country was romantic but rather bleak than beautiful and he had thought a touch of the old mosstroopers spirit marked their descendants the men were big and their scottish soberness hid a vein of reckless humor they were keen sportsmen and bold poachers when one studied them one noted their stubbornness and something jimmy thought was quiet pride margaret had got the puzzling quality one marked her calm level glance and her rather haughty carriage although she was a bush ranchers daughter jimmy did not think he exaggerated much  your house is going up and you have cleared some ground she said it looks as if you had not slouched  oh well said jimmy modestly your father reckoned i must push ahead before the frost began but if we have made some progress i imagine bob is mainly accountable  do you like okanagan  i dont know jimmy replied in a thoughtful voice he stays with his job and puts it over but he doesnt talk unless hes chopping and you hear his ax you dont know where he is he steals about in fact the fellow puzzles me whats his proper business  bobs a trapper to get valuable skins you must go far north but the black bear are pretty numerous and sometimes a cinnamon comes down the rocks then tourists give a good price for a bighorns head i reckon bobs wad was getting big until the politicians resolved to see the game laws were carried out now you must buy a license before you shoot large animals and you may only shoot one or two then reserves are fixed where you may not shoot at all the belt across the range is a reserve and the gamewarden made some trouble for bob perhaps this accounts for his hiring up with you  do you like the fellow  margaret hesitated she did not like bob but she did not mean to enlighten jimmy sometimes bob came to kelshope and when he fixed his strange glance on her she got disturbed  well she said if i wanted a loghouse put up or the timber wolves cleared off id send for okanagan but id stop there hes not the sort id want for a friend  you imply if you were a rancher you wouldnt want him for a friend  margarets eyes twinkled why of course i implied something like that  but bob goes to kelshope and mr jardine suggested my hiring him  my fathers a bushman said margaret rather dryly his habits not to get stung but well let it go what about your chickens  jimmy had sent for some poultry and so long as margaret was willing to stop he was satisfied to talk about his flock sometimes the bush was lonely and to sit opposite margaret had charm she banished the loneliness and gave his rude fireside a homely touch by and by however she got up  i have stopped some time and you ought to get busy  she would not take his help to mount she seized the bridle stroked the cayuse and was in the saddle the horse plunged into the fern margaret waved her hand and vanished but for a few minutes jimmy smoked and pondered  he thought margaret harmonized with the quiet austere woods but although she talked like a bush girl he wondered whether she had not done so in order to baffle him anyhow he hoped she would come back and cook his breakfast another time he could not see laura stannard beating up dough for flapjacks by his fire lauras proper background was an english drawingroom she had grace and charm and on the hotel terrace jimmy was keen about her society then laura was a good sort and he owed her much the strange thing was although she had stated he ought to follow a useful occupation she did not approve his ranching experiment in fact she had urged him to go back to the cotton mill jimmy admitted he was rather hurt because she was willing for him to go now however her picture began to get indistinct the bush called and laura did not harmonize with the woods  then jimmy remembered margaret had brought him some letters and when he pulled out an envelope with an indian stamp his look was anxious sir james however stated that his london agents would send a check on a canadian bank and when jimmy wanted to stock his ranch his bills would be met sir james remarked that to buy cattle was better than to bet on horses that did not win and chopping trees was not by contrast with some other amusements very expensive moreover if jimmy got tired he could sell the ranch he added that he was presently going to japan and afterwards to england by the canadian pacific line when he crossed canada he would stop and look his nephew up  jimmy liked his uncles rather dry humor and admitted that some of his remarks were justified for when jimmy went to the races his luck was bad but he put the letter in his pocket and picked up his ax for some time he had talked and smoked and unless he hustled the shingles he wanted would not be split by dark     x  lauras refusal   smoke rolled about the clearing and dry branches snapped in the flames a keen wind fanned the blaze and in places the fire leaped up the trees and resinous needles fell in sparkling showers okanagan bob went about with a coaloil can and jimmy drove the red oxen that hauled loads of brush jimmys face was black his hand was burned and his shirt was marked by darkedged holes but his mood was buoyant the fire had got firm hold and advanced steadily across the belt of chopped trunks and branches bushmen call the slashing when it burned out jimmy thought only halfconsumed logs would be left a good burn ought to save him much labor  perhaps his keenness was strange to clear a ranch is a long and arduous job that he was not forced to undertake but he was keen his occupation so to speak had got hold of him moreover he felt rather vaguely it was a test of his endurance and pluck since he left the cotton mill he had loafed and squandered now he had got a mans job and when the job was carried out he would know himself a man  by and by he stopped the oxen in front of the house a few yards off deering notched the end of a log he wore long boots overall trousers and a torn shirt his face was red but his big body followed the sweep of the ax with a measured swing and the shining blade went deep into the log deering had arrived a few days before to arrange about a hunting excursion  you have put up a fresh log since i came along you chop like a bushman jimmy remarked  two logs said deering and dropped his ax i reckon i am a bushman anyhow i was born at a small ontario ranch and hired up at another in michigan  jimmy was surprised although deering was not at all like stannard his habits were extravagant and nothing indicated that he had engaged in bodily labor he saw jimmys surprise and laughed  for a few minutes ill cool off and take a smoke he resumed choppings a healthy occupation but i soon had enough i was out for money and wasnt satisfied to earn twoandahalf a day then in canada and i reckon in michigan you dont get two generations to stay on the land you clear a ranch but your son weighs all youre up against and resolves to quit he reckons keeping store at a settlement is a softer job  did you keep a store  i ran a pool room after a time a womens reform guild got busy and the town reeve hinted id better get out  jimmy laughed he liked deerings frankness but he said i suppose dillon left stannard at puget sound he talked about going to colorado  when we had stopped a week or two at the dillon house frank reckoned hed come back with us deering replied with some dryness frank has not bought a ranch but hes steadying up and i imagine miss laura has got after him anyhow hes cut out cards and bets with me looks as if miss laura had some talent for steering young men into the proper track  the blood came to jimmys skin but deerings humorous twinkle did not account for all jimmy did not like to think about lauras steering dillon he felt laura was his guide and not the others  if you go back to the hotel in the afternoon ill come along he said perhaps i ought to see stannard about our hunting trip  he stated he wanted to see you deering replied with a careless nod and resumed his chopping  when the fire had burned out they started for the hotel but they arrived after dinner and laura was engaged with other guests in the morning she went off to the lake with dillon and one or two more whom jimmy did not know and since she did not suggest his joining the party he loafed about the hotel it looked as if she was satisfied with dillons society and did not want his  jimmy was hurt and sitting on the terrace he smoked and pondered from the beginning he had felt lauras charm although he had not thought himself her lover for one thing he knew his drawbacks yet laura liked dillon whose drawbacks were as obvious as his somehow jimmy had taken it for granted he had a particular claim to her friendship but if the friendship must be shared with frank its charm was gone  after an hour or two his resolution began to harden perhaps his asking laura to marry him was not as ridiculous as he had thought at all events he would take the plunge she knew he had stopped loafing and started on a fresh line and his having done so because she urged it was a useful argument jimmy admitted he did not see laura helping at the ranch but this was not important so long as she engaged to marry him when he made good he would be resigned if she hesitated he must try to indicate something like that  in the evening laura returned from the lake but for some time after dinner she was engaged with her party and left jimmy alone jimmy did not join the group for the suspense bothered him and the others light banter jarred he thought it strange but he felt he had nothing to do with the careless people whose society laura enjoyed when he had talked to laura he was going back to the quiet woods  at length laura came along the terrace and jimmy braced himself she wore a black dinner dress and when a beam from the window touched her jimmy thought her skin shone like the snow on the rocks then she turned her head and looked back the tranquil movement was strangely graceful but jimmy frowned dillon had obviously meant to go with laura and although she motioned him back jimmy knew she smiled he fetched a chair and leaned against the terrace wall  well jimmy she said in a careless voice you dont look very bright  its possible you havent talked to me for five minutes since i arrived  i was on the terrace had you wanted to join us you could have done so  if you had wanted me i expect youd have indicated it  sometimes youre rather keen laura remarked still sometimes you are obstinate i have known you do things i would sooner you did not  i expect im dull for i dont know if you imply that my obstinacy would not have annoyed you anyhow i left the ranch because i wanted to see you i didnt want to stand about with the others and laugh at their poor jokes theyre a slack and careless lot  laura looked up jimmys mouth was firm and she thought him highly strung he was thin and hard and his pose was good in fact she felt he was not altogether the raw lad she had known  not long since you rather cultivated people like that and tried to use their rules she said i think you made some progress  oh well i own i was a fool and i owe you something because you helped me see my folly to take the proper line at a ball and a dinner party to shoot straight and play a useful game at cards is perhaps a sound ambition but i begin to doubt if its worth the effort it costs in the woods one gets another ambition  laura smiled youre impulsive when one indicates the way for you to go you go much faster than one thinks but we wont philosophize did it not cost you something to leave your ranch  i wanted to see you said jimmy in a quiet voice id better state my object because in a minute or two i expect your friends will come along  laura thought not the end of the terrace was not lighted she and jimmy were in the gloom and the others were not very dull  well she said  i wanted to ask if you will marry me  for a few moments laura said nothing and jimmy noted that her pose was very quiet then she looked up  you are very young jimmy  im not younger than you besides i dont see what my youth has to do with it  your youth is a drawback said laura thoughtfully you will inherit a large fortune but i am poor and if i married you your trustees would imagine i and my father had planned to capture you  now you are ridiculous jimmy declared you have talent beauty and cultivation im raw and know nothing but the cotton mill you ought to see if i can persuade you the gain is altogether mine  laura gently shook her head i dont see it jimmy and others would not  dick leyland might grumble jimmy admitted with a frown for all that he has nothing to do with my marrying and sir jim is another type hed fall in love with you  he stopped and laura pondered she must make a good marriage and the marriage jimmy urged was good but she saw some obstacles for one thing she did not love jimmy ambition called but she calculated if he would take the line she thought he ought to take she might agree  if you were at the cotton mill and claimed your proper post all would be easier she said your uncles could not then dispute your right to marry whom you liked  jimmys laugh was scornful my uncles control my fortune for a year or two thats all however if you hesitate i wont urge you to marry me yet if you engage to do so when i get my inheritance ill be satisfied  the blood came to lauras skin jimmys keenness was not remarkable but she knew his sincerity and she forced a smile  you are philosophical  oh well said jimmy with some embarrassment i feel i ought not to urge you now i wanted to know you belonged to me and then i neednt bother when im at the ranch the trouble is if i waited somebody might carry you off so long as you agree  lauras look got rather hard when she wanted him to go back to england she was not altogether selfish although she did not love him she liked jimmy and felt he ought not to stay in canada with stannard and deering  then you mean to go on at the ranch she said  of course you declare im young i feel i must take a useful job and so to speak make good besides i cant go back to lancashire to be ruled by uncle dick when i take my inheritance it will be another thing then when you own a ranch theres something about the woods that calls you get keen to plan and work is not a bother  but is the reward for your labor worth while  in money the reward is not worth while but thats not important somehow i know dick leyland is not carrying on the houses business as it ought to be carried on we are getting rich but we cannot much longer use his oldfashioned parsimonious rules jims at bombay and theres no use in my making plans for dick to oppose you see i have nothing to go upon for five years i was a clerk like our other clerks afterwards i was a careless slacker and dick would sternly put me down but ive stated something like this before you ought to see  laura saw he had some grounds for his resolve to remain still she did not see herself helping at the ranch and to wait for perhaps three or four years while he carried out his rash experiment was not her plan she imagined his trustees would not approve his marrying her and they controlled his fortune and were clever business men yet had she loved jimmy she might have agreed in the meantime he studied her with keen suspense and getting up she gave him a quiet resolute look  you must let me go she said i like you jimmy but i am not the girl for you  jimmy tried to brace himself and advanced as if he meant to touch her but she stopped him  i ought not to return to lancashire yet but if thats the obstacle ill start when you like he said in rather a hoarse voice  laura was moved in fact she was moved to generosity now she had conquered the strange thing was she knew she must not use her triumph although jimmy was beaten she admitted his firmness at the beginning was justified and she thought he would after a time repent  i see some other obstacles she replied since you are satisfied that your proper job is in canada you must carry it out there is no use in talking jimmy i am not at all the girl for you  her resolution was obvious and jimmy stepped back laura gave him a friendly smile and went off jimmy frowned for although he had doubted if he could persuade her he had got a nasty knock at the other end of the terrace stannard joined laura and indicated jimmy  well he said  jimmy wanted me to marry him i refused  ah said stannard i suppose you had some grounds for your refusal  i imagine he does not love me laura replied in a quiet voice  stannard studied her her color was rather high but she was calm in some respects she was like her mother and not like him stannard was satisfied it was so  yet he asked you to marry him  perhaps i am attractive but now i think about it he did not urge me much for all that jimmy is a good sort  for a few moments stannard said nothing laura imagined he had meant her to marry jimmy and her refusal bothered him yet his look rather indicated resignation than anger she really did not know her father but he was kind  jimmy is a good sort he remarked he has some other advantages  his advantages are obvious hes sincere and frank and generous laura agreed with a touch of emotion had he not been like that i might have risked it  stannard shrugged perhaps youre not altogether logical but its done with  im sorry father said laura in a gentle voice and went up the steps  stannard stopped and his look was sternly thoughtful he was an adventurer and his scruples were not numerous but he had not used his daughters beauty as he might have used it now he knew he ran some risks and for her sake he had wanted her to marry jimmy well she had refused and jimmy owed him much but for some time could not pay stannard lighted a cigar and knitted his brows     xi  the game reserve   at the end of the small open glade the packhorses dragged about their ropes a short distance in front the thick timber stopped and a mountain spur went up to the dim white peaks the sun had gone and the sky was calm and green one heard a river brawl and a faint wind in the trees deering lay in the pine needles and rubbed his neck  the mosquitoes are fierce throw some green stuff on the fire and make a smoke he said i dont want to get up  jimmy sitting on a log pushed green branches into the flames and then turned his head and looked about two indians were cutting poles and putting up a tent in the gaps between the trunks the gloom got deep and although the sharp top of the spur was distinct jimmy only saw a few small pines and junipers stannard and okanagan bob who had gone up in the afternoon to look for a line to the high rocks were not coming yet the horses could not go farther and in the morning the hunting party would leave them behind  they recently let me join a highbrow mountain club but when i start for the rocks i hesitate deering resumed to boost two hundred pounds up crags and glaciers is a strenuous job and i allow id sooner stannard had brought the hotel guides when i camp i like two blankets and a square meal a good guide can carry a lot of useful truck  their charges are high and okanagan claims he knows the bighorns haunts  somehow i reckon bob knows too much deering rejoined well i allow to let you break your neck wouldnt pay stannard  in one sense it wouldnt cost him much said jimmy with a laugh you see i insured my life in his favor some time since  ah said deering thoughtfully that was when he took you down to vancouver  i went down the plan was mine after i fell into the gully i saw stannard ran some risk  deering grinned i like you jimmy youre sure an honest kid then his glance got keen and he resumed say are you going to marry laura  miss stannard refused to marry me jimmy replied in a quiet voice but we were talking about the insurance i rather urged stannard  exactly stannards a highbrow englishman said deering but somehow jimmy thought his remark ironical well you urged and since stannard is not rich he agreed perhaps the strange thing is he was able to lend you a pretty good sum do you know where he gets the money  i dont know its not important  oh well you have insured your life and miss laura has refused you shes a charming girl but since i dont see her helping you run a bush ranch perhaps her refusal was justified however i think somebodys coming down the ridge  not long afterwards stannard and bob reached the camp and stannard said we have found a line and well start at daybreak bob now declares he expects a reward for each good head we get  you can promise him his bonus if we shoot a bighorn were lucky the tourist sports have scared them back to the north deering remarked  they got supper and went to bed the spruce twigs were soft and the hudsons bay blankets were warm but for a time jimmy did not sleep the tent door was hooked back and the night was not dark he saw the smoke go up and the mist creep about the trunks sometimes a horse broke a branch and sometimes the rivers turmoil got louder but this was all and jimmy missed the cowbells that chimed at kelshope ranch  perhaps it was strange but lauras refusal had not hurt him very much in fact he began to feel that so long as she did not marry dillon he would be resigned now jimmy came to think about it deerings hint that she attracted frank to some extent accounted for his resolve to marry laura anyhow laura was his friend and stannard had used tact he was quietly sympathetic and soon banished jimmys embarrassment then the noise of the river got indistinct and jimmy thought he heard cowbells ring branches cracked and somebody called oh buck oh bright  at daybreak bob sent off two indians to wait for the party at another spot he and an indian carried heavy loads but all carried as much as possible because bob declared the party was rather large for good hunting and refused to take another man when they stopped at noon deerings face was very red and jimmy was satisfied to lie in the stones while bob brewed some tea  after lunch they pushed through a belt of timber the trees were small but some had fallen and blocked the way others broken by the wind had not reached the ground and the locked branches held up the slanted trunks where the underbrush below was thick one must crawl along the logs  on the other side of the timber an avalanche had swept the slope carrying down soil and stones and the party was forced to cross steep rock slabs jimmy carried a rifle a blanket and a small bag of flour and admitted that he had got enough to pitch camp at sunset behind a few halfdead spruce was a keen relief  they had not a tent and the cold was keen but where one can find wood one can build a shelter supper was soon cooked and when they had satisfied their appetite all were glad to lie about the fire some distance above them untrodden snow touched with faint pink by the sunset glimmered against the green sky below rocks and gravel went down to the forest across which blue mist rolled sometimes a belt of vapor melted and one saw a vast dim gulf and a winding line that was a river the austere landscape rather braced than daunted jimmy he knew the swiss rocks and the high snows called  two days afterwards jimmy one afternoon got his first shot at a mountainsheep until the bighorn moved it looked like a small gray stone but it did move and when it vanished they studied the ground there was no use in trying a direct approach but the rocky slope was broken and bob imagined they could climb a gully and come down near the animal farther on they must however take their loads because he had not yet found a spot to pitch camp  to climb the gully embarrassed by a heavy pack and a rifle was hard and for some time afterwards they crawled across the top of a big buttress when they reached another gully the sun was gone but bob thought they would find the sheep not far from the bottom he said two might go and when they had spun a coin stannard and jimmy took off their packs  the gully was very steep and they used some caution near the bottom jimmy slipped and might have gone down had not stannard steadied him bob carrying the glasses went a short distance in front at the bottom he got behind a stone and presently waved his hand  when jimmy reached the spot he saw a horseshoe slope of rock and gravel that fell sharply for five or six hundred feet and then stopped as if at the edge of a precipice he thought if the bighorn went down there they must let it go then bob touched his arm and indicated a spot level with them but some distance off something moved and jimmy taking the glasses saw it was a sheep  your shot use a full sight its farther than you think said stannard in a low voice and when jimmy had pulled up the slide he rested the rifle barrel on the rock  his arm was on the stone he knew he ought to hold straight but the shot was long and the hole in the telescopic sight was small perhaps he was too keen for although stannard had got a noble head he himself had not yet fired a shot but when he began to pull the trigger his hand shook he stopped and drew his breath and the sheep moved  hes going said bob and jimmy crooked his finger  the rifle jerked in the distance a small shower of dust leaped up and the sheep jumped on a stone in a moment it would vanish and jimmy savagely snapped out the cartridge then he saw a pale flash and knew the report of stannards english rifle the sheep plunged from the stone struck the ground and began to roll down the incline its speed got faster and jimmy thought it went down like a ball in a few moments it would reach the top of the precipice and if it plunged across they would not find its broken body then it struck a rock and stopped so far as one could see a few yards from the edge stannard gave bob his rifle and picked up the glasses  a fine head call deering jimmy i think we can get down  jimmy thought not but he shouted and deering arrived and studied the ground  looks awkward but perhaps we can make it  you have got to make it you dont want to leave a sheep like that about said bob  stannard gave him a keen glance but deering said lets try ive brought the rope if youll lead stannard ill tie on at the top well leave jimmy  since i missed my shot i ought to go jimmy objected  my weights a useful anchor and youre not up to stannards form deering rejoined and they put on the rope  they started and jimmy lighted his pipe he had wanted the noble head and stannard had got another but jimmy was not jealous although stannard had hardly had a moment before the sheep went off he had seized the moment to shoot and hit in the meantime however the others were getting down the slope and jimmy used the glasses  the job was awkward sometimes the stones ran down and stannard hesitated deering stopped and braced himself ready to hold up his companions bob was at the middle of the rope and so far as one could see was satisfied to follow stannard they reached the sheep and bob got on his knees by the animal his knife shone and after a few minutes he gave stannard the head  then it looked as if they disputed but bob got up and began to drag the sheep to the edge jimmy was puzzled for stones were plunging down and it was plain the fellow ran some risk one could not see his object for resolving to get rid of the headless body after a minute or two he pushed the sheep over the edge and the party began to climb the slope  they got to the top and going up the gully after a time found a corner in the rocks and pitched camp bob and the indian had carried up a small quantity of wood and when they cooked supper stannard remarked i expect youre satisfied nobody in the valley could see our fire  nobodys in the valley anyhow said bob  then my seeing smoke was strange stannard rejoined  but suppose somebody had camped in the trees why shouldnt the fellow see our fire jimmy inquired  perhaps bob will enlighten you said stannard coolly  ah said deering he didnt mean to leave the sheep around and although i didnt get his object for pushing the body off the rocks i reckon it went down a thousand feet into the timber he stopped and looking hard at bob resumed what was your object  bobs dark face was inscrutable  i saw smoke when we got busy i calculated the gamewarden had located at the other end of the range  you greedy swine said stannard and deering began to laugh  jimmy doesnt get it well bob meant to earn his bonus and since he took us shooting on a government game reserve i admit his nerve is pretty good anyhow i wont grumble because i havent killed a bighorn stannards may cost him two or three hundred dollars  why did you play us this shabby trick bob jimmy asked in a stern voice  bob gave him a rather strange look  i sure wanted the bonus and the reserve is new i allowed id beat the warden and you wouldnt know he got after me another time and i had to quit and leave a pile of skins  you wanted to get even deering remarked and turned to stannard what are you going to do about it in a way the things a joke but our dutys obvious we ought to give up the heads and take bob along to the police  stannard said nothing but jimmy imagined he did not mean to give up the heads bobs calm was not at all disturbed  shucks he said youre pretty big mr deering but i reckon the city man who could take me where i didnt want to go isnt born why you cant get off the mountains unless i help you fix camp and pack your truck  i dont like packing a heavy load deering admitted well talk about it again and in the meantime you had better take the fryingpan from the fire i hate my bannocks burned     xii  stannard fronts a crisis   at kelshope ranch fodder was scarce and so long as the underbrush was green jardine let his cattle roam about the plan had some drawbacks and jardine needing his plow oxen one afternoon was forced to search the tangled woods sometimes he heard cowbells but when he reached the spot the animals were gone a plow ox is cunning and in thick timber moves much faster than a man  jardine however was obstinate and for an hour or two he pushed across soft muskegs and through tangled brushwood when at length he stopped he saw he had torn his new overalls and broken an old long boot besides he hated to be baffled and since he could not catch the oxen he could not move some logs  when he got near the ranch he stopped somebody was quietly moving about the house as if he wanted to find out who was at home and jardine advancing noiselessly saw it was bob he admitted he had expected something like that for bobs habits were not altogether a white mans jardine imagined he did not know margaret had gone to the railroad  had he found his team he might have given bob supper and sent him off before margaret arrived but he had not found the team and bobs creeping about the house annoyed him in the old country jardine was a poacher but he sprang from good scottish stock and he hated to think bob bothered margaret moving out of the shadow he went up the path  he did not make a noise but bob turned and jardine thought had the fellow been altogether a white man he would have started bob did not start his look was calm like an indians and his pose was quiet  hello he said i reckoned youd gone after your plow team  ye didna reckon id come back just yet  bob smiled but his eyes got narrower and his mouth went straight he was a big man and carried himself like an athlete  well he said i allowed miss margaret was around and id wait a while  jardine wondered whether bob meant to annoy him as a rule the fellow was not frank and now his frankness was insolent  if ye come another time yell come when im aboot what have ye in yon pack  berries said bob opening a cotton flour bag i reckoned miss margaret wanted some then i brought a pelt looked the sort of thing to go round her winter cap  in the woods the indians dry the large yellow raspberries and bob had brought a quantity to the ranch before now he pulled out a small dark skin that jardine imagined was worth fifty dollars the value of the present was significant  ye can tak them back we have a the berries we want  anyhow i guess miss margaret would like the skin  she would not margaret has nae use for ony pelts ye bring  for a few moments bob was quiet then he said sometimes i blew in for supper and you let me stay and smoke when you put up the barn you sent for me to help you raise the logs the english tenderfoot hadnt located in the valley then  the blood came to jardines skin to some extent bobs rejoinder was justified but jardine had not until recently imagined margaret accounted for the fellows coming to the ranch  when we put up the barn ye got stanard pay i allow yere a useful man to handle logs but im no hiring help the noo  you reckoned me your hired man said bob in an ominously quiet voice that was all the use you had for me  just that jardine agreed margaret has nae use for ye ava  then if you reckon youre going to get my highbrow english boss for her youre surely not very bright his sort dont marry  tak your pack and quit said jardine sternly get off the ranch ye blasted halfbreed  bob was very quiet but his pose was alert and somehow like a hunting animals perhaps instinctively he felt for his knife jardines ax leaned against a neighboring post if he jumped he could reach the tool but he did not move for a moment or two they waited and then bob picked up the flour bag and went down the path jardine went to the kitchen and lighted his pipe bob was gone and jardine hardly thought he would come back but he was not altogether satisfied he had taken the proper line indian blood ran in bobs veins an indian waits long and does not forget for all that jardine did not see himself warning leyland and enlightening margaret  a week afterwards stannard one evening occupied a chair at his table on the terrace he had returned from the mountains with two good bighorn heads and nothing indicated that the gamewarden knew the party had poached on the reserve stannard however was not thinking about the hunting excursion the english mail had arrived and sometimes he studied a letter and sometimes looked moodily about  laura dillon and two or three young men were on the steps that went down to the woods laura wore her black dinner dress and stannard thought she had not another that so harmonized with her beauty dillon obviously felt her charm he was next to laura and since it looked as if the others were ready to dispute his claim to the spot stannard imagined frank would not have occupied it unless laura meant him to remain  after a time stannard pushed the letter into his pocket and gave himself to gloomy thought until deering came along the terrace and asked him for a match  you look as if you were bothered deering remarked  sometimes one is bothered when ones mail arrives  that is so said deering with a sympathetic nod opening your mail is like dipping in a lucky bag your lucks not always good i got some bills in my lot  i got a demand for a sum i cannot pay i expect you havent two thousand dollars you dont particularly need  deering laughed search me all ive got above five hundred dollars you can have for keeps looks as if you must put the fellow off  hes obstinate and unless i can satisfy him it might be awkward for me  then you had better try dillon the kids rich and sometimes generous deering remarked in a sense hes mine but since youre up against it ill lend him to you  he went off and stannard frowned for him to be fastidious was ridiculous but deerings frankness jarred still he needed a large sum and although he could borrow for jimmy he could not borrow for himself the fellow who supplied him was a keen business man stannard lived extravagantly but the money he used was not his and unless he justified the speculation supplies would stop so far the speculation had paid and he owned he ought not to be embarrassed the trouble was he squandered all he got  he weighed deerings plan dillons father was rich and indulged the lad stannard had stopped at his ambitious house on puget sound and imagined the old lumber man approved laura in fact the drawback to deerings plan was there stannard had not bothered much about laura and was willing for his wifes relations to undertake his duty but he did not mean to put an obstacle in her way she must make a good marriage after all her aunts were poor  by and by the group on the steps broke up and laura came to stannards table he noted that her eyes sparkled and her color was rather high it looked as if she had triumphed over another girl stannard admitted the others were attractive but none had lauras charm  you have soon forgotten jimmy he remarked  no said laura i have not forgotten jimmy although i did not want him for a lover hes my friend but he really was not my lover that accounts for much  yet i imagine if he had been persuaded to go back to the cotton mill  laura blushed but she gave stannard a steady look i liked jimmy father and i was not altogether selfish i felt he ought to go back  to lead a young man where he ought to go is rather an attractive part stannard remarked jimmy wanted to marry you what about frank dillon  ah said laura frank is not as rash as jimmy jimmy doesnt ponder he plunges ahead  you imply that frank uses caution  oh well said laura smiling perhaps i use some reserve  stannard thought her voice was gentle and turning his head he studied dillon the young fellow stood at the top of the steps as if he wanted to follow laura but waited for her to indicate that he might stannard reflected with dry amusement that laura kept her lovers in firm control frank was rather a handsome fellow and stannard knew him sincere and generous perhaps it was strange but a number of the young men he admitted to his circle were a pretty good type although stannard was not bothered by scruples he was fastidious  but i want to know its important he said suppose frank is as rash as jimmy will you refuse him  laura blushed but after a moment or two she looked up and fronted her father  why is it important for you to know  stannard hesitated he had not used his daughter for an innocent accomplice and had she married jimmy he would have tried to free the lad from his entanglements now if she loved frank he must not embarrass her  well he said i rather think i must give you my confidence i need money and its possible frank would help  oh father you mustnt use franks money laura exclaimed and since her disturbance was obvious stannards curiosity was satisfied hes your friend and trusts you she resumed i think you ought to force deering to leave him alone  for a few moments stannard was quiet laura loved frank at all events she was willing to marry him and it looked as if she knew more about her father than he had thought well laura was not a fool  sometimes your tact is rather marked he said i wonder whether you really think deering a worse friend for frank than me however well let it go if you marry the young fellow he of course ought not to be my creditor  laura gave him a grateful look and when she replied her voice was apologetic perhaps i wasnt justified but i felt i was forced i mean i didnt want you to bother frank and one cannot trust deering  i imagine i see stannard rejoined well perhaps deerings a better sort than you think he stated rather generously that he would lend me frank but if its some comfort ill engage not to bother the young fellow  youre a dear said laura with a touch of emotion  stannard shrugged i have not carried out my duty and you do not owe me much but after all it was for your sake i sent you to your aunts since your father was a bad model i hoped your mothers sisters would help you to grow up like her well since i long neglected you i must not now put an obstacle in your way  you are kind said laura perhaps im cold and calculating i know my shabbiness but i did not love jimmy and i think i do love frank  she touched stannards arm gently and went into the hotel a few moments afterwards dillon crossed the terrace and went up the steps stannard smiled but by and by threw away his cigar and knitted his brows he thought he need not bother about laura but he saw no plan for meeting his importunate creditors demands     xiii  the deserted homestead   stannard and a party from the hotel were in the mountains and laura and mrs dillon one morning occupied a bench on the terrace mrs dillon had arrived a few days since and when stannard returned laura was going back with her to puget sound dillon sitting on the steps tranquilly smoked a cigarette laura had engaged to marry him and he had refused to join stannards rather ambitious excursion to a snow peak that had recently interested the canadian alpine club so far as dillon knew nobody had yet got up the mountain and if its exploration occupied stannard and jimmy for some time he would be resigned jimmy was his friend but on the whole frank would sooner he was not about  two strangers went into the clerks office some time since laura said presently one wore a sort of cavalry uniform do you know who they are  ones a subaltern officer of the royal northwest mounted police dillon replied i expect the others a small boss in the canada forestry department or something like that perhaps a careless tourist has started a bush fire  they are coming out said laura and added with surprise i think they want to see us  the men crossed the terrace and the young officer gave laura an envelope  i understand you are miss stannard and this is your fathers  laura nodded agreement and studied the envelope the address was stannards and at the top was printed sports service taxidermy  perhaps you had better open the envelope the officer resumed  laura did so and pulled out a bill to preserving and mounting two bighorn heads to packing for shipment  the other man took the bill he was a big brownskinned fellow and his steady quiet glance indicated that he knew the woods  sure he said the charge for packing is pretty steep but when you mean to beat the exportprohibition well i guess this fixes it  what has mr stannards bill to do with you laura asked in a haughty voice  to begin with he cant ship those heads out of canada then it looks as if he killed the bighorn on a government game reserve  your statements ridiculous said laura angrily my father is an english sportsman not a poacher  anyhow he killed two mountain sheep not long since  you cannot force miss stannard to admit it dillon interrupted  not at all the young officer agreed politely still i think some frankness might pay my companion is warden douglas from the reserve and the game laws are strict but its possible some allowance would be made for tourists who did not know the rules if miss stannard does reply it might help  very well said laura my father and a party went shooting and he brought back two bighorn heads but im satisfied he did not know he trespassed on a game reserve  his partners were leyland and deering warden douglas remarked i expect they took a guide although they didnt hire up the men at the hotel  mr leylands man okanagan went  douglas looked at the officer and smiled meaningly now i get it i reckon bob played them fellers  mr stannard is again in the mountains the officer said to laura i dont urge you to reply but although my dutys to find out all i can i dont think your frankness will hurt your father  laura said stannard had gone to climb a famous peak and admitted that he had taken okanagan  theyll hit the range near the head of the reserve and a hefty gang could get down the wolf creek gulch douglas observed looks as if bob had gone back for another lot i guess an english sport would put up fifty dollars for a good head  thank you miss stannard said the officer the department will claim the heads and perhaps demand a fine but the sum will depend upon mr stannards statements this however is not my business  he bowed and went off but he stopped douglas on the veranda  if you want to go after the party ill give you trooper simpson  im going after okanagan and i mean to get him said douglas grimly i reckon he fooled the tourists but theyve got to pay the fine cant you give me a bushman trooper okanagans a tough proposition and he doesnt like me  the officer said he had not another man and must go off to make inquiries about a forest fire he sent for his horse and the group on the terrace saw him ride down the trail  im sorry for father and know hell hate to give up the heads but i think the men were satisfied jimmys helper cheated him laura remarked  a few days afterwards stannards party stopped one evening at a small empty homestead thin forest surrounded the clearing but on one side the trees were burned and the bare rampikes shone in the sun in places the crooked fence had fallen down tall fern grew among the stumps and willows had run across the cultivated ground for all that the loghouse was good and since the horses could not go much farther stannard resolved to use the ranch for a supply depot on the rocks the climbing party could not carry heavy loads  when the sun got low they sat on the veranda and smoked they did not talk much and jimmy felt the brooding calm was melancholy somebody perhaps with high hope had cleared the ground the forest now was taking back labor and patience had gone for nothing the grass was already smothered by young trees it looked as if the wilderness triumphed over human effort  how long do you think its owner was chopping out the ranch and why did he let it go jimmy asked  i reckon nine or ten years deering replied maybe he speculated on somebodys starting a sawmill or a mine maybe the block carried a mortgage and he pulled out to earn the interest as a rule the small homesteader takes any job he can get and when his wallets full comes back to chop but a railroad construction gangs the usual stunt and some dont come back i expect the fellow was blown up by dynamite or a rock fell on him anyhow when you hit a deserted ranch the owners story is something like that canadas not the getrich country land boomers state  then deering turned to stannard did you find a good line to the ridge from which we reckon to make the peak  i found a line i think will go you follow the ridge until a big buttress breaks the top some distance above the snow level a col goes down to a glacier and one might get across to another ridge that would help us up the peak still i doubt if our maps accurate and my notion is to climb the buttress  deering took the map good maps of the back country are not numerous but if the cols where you locate it i reckon the oldtime miners shoved up the glacier when they came in from the plains some made the caribou diggings from alberta long before the railroad was built  their road was rough said stannard and lighted his pipe  he was not keen to talk for one thing he was tired and he did not yet know where to get the sum he needed the sum however must be got so long as he belonged to one or two good clubs and visited at fashionable country houses the allowance on which he lived would be paid but if he did not satisfy his creditor he must give up his clubs and would not be wanted at shooting parties  by and by deering turned to bob who was cleaning a rifle  we have guns have you got a pitlight  bob grinned you cant use a pitlight some cranks at ottawa allow theyre going to carry out the law  it depends said deering dryly i wouldnt go stillhunting if i thought a gamewarden was about but we oughtnt to run up against a warden in this neighborhood anyhow i see the deer come down to feed on the fresh brush and some venison would help out our salt pork say have you got a light  ive got one bob admitted we brought some candles and i guess i could cut two or three shields from a meat can  then you can get to work said deering and turned to the others the sports pretty good you hook a small miners lamp in your hat and pull out the brim but you can use a candle and a bit of tin since the lamps above the tin shield the deer cant see you they see a light some distance from the ground and if youre quiet they come up to find out what its doing there when their eyes reflect the beam you shoot  i dont suppose wed run much risk but a stillhunt is poaching and i doubt if its worth the bother stannard replied carelessly  when you start poaching you dont know where to stop not long since we shot two bighorn on a game reserve said deering with a laugh the strange thing is although i quit ranching for the cities i want to get back and play in the woods give me an ax and a gun and im a boy again say lets try the stillhunt  the others agreed and after supper the party waited for dark the green sky faded and the trees were very black then their sawedged tops got indistinct and gray mist floated about the clearing in belts that sometimes melted and sometimes got thick the resinous smell of the pines was keen and all was very quiet but for the turmoil of the river an owl swooped by the house shrieked mournfully and vanished in the gloom  at length jimmy fixed his candle in a rude tin shield felt that his rifle magazine was full and waited for bob to take the others to their posts so long as they went away from him all he saw was a faint glimmer but sometimes one turned at an obstacle and a small bright flame shone in the mist it looked as if the light floated without support and jimmy could picture its exciting the deers curiosity one could not use a pitlamp in the tangled bush but the clearing was some distance across and the deer came to feed on the tender undergrowth that had sprung up since the trees were chopped  after a time bob returned but now jimmy must go to his post he admitted he would sooner go to bed he was tired and stillhunting with a light was forbidden besides they had not long since poached on a game reserve had not deering bothered them jimmy thought stannard would not have gone but in the woods deerings mood was a boys the packers and the horses were in a barn some distance back among the trees and they had not got a light at the house somehow the quiet and gloom were daunting but to hesitate was ridiculous and jimmy went off with bob  in north america trees are not cut off at the ground level and the clearing was dotted by tall stumps fern grew about the roots and tangled vines and young willows occupied the open spaces at a boggy patch the grass was high and a ditch went up the middle and into the bush the ditch was deep and jimmy knew something about the labor it had cost to see useful effort thrown away disturbed him and he speculated about the lonely ranchers stubborn fight the man was gone perhaps he knew himself beaten before he went and the forest reclaimed the clearing  they crossed the ditch and bob stationed jimmy behind a big stump at the edge of the trees he said quietness was important and if jimmy left his post and did not take his light he might get shot moreover he must not shoot unless he saw a deers eyes shine he must wait until he thought the animal near enough and then aim between the two bright spots he might soon get a shot but he might wait until daybreak and see nothing  then bob went off and jimmy was sorry he could not light his pipe the night was cold and waiting behind the stump soon got dreary sometimes the mist was thick and sometimes it melted but one could not see across the clearing and nothing indicated that the others were about jimmy did not know their posts he imagined bob had put them where they would not see each others lights he wondered whether the deer would soon arrive if he did not see one before his candle burned out he would lie down at the bottom of the stump and go to sleep     xiv  a shot in the dark   jimmy imagined he did for a few minutes go to sleep because he did not know when the noise began branches cracked as if a deer pushed through the brush a short distance off jimmy was not excited in fact he was cold and dull and he used some effort to wake up  the noise stopped and then began again it now looked as if a large animal plunged across the clearing jimmy did not think a deer went through the brush like that but for a moment he saw a luminous spot in the dark something reflected the beam from his candle and he threw the rifle to his shoulder  his hand shook and he tried to steady the barrel he felt a jerk and was dully conscious of the report as a rule when one concentrates on a moving target one does not hear the gun the strange thing was jimmy imagined he heard his a second before the trigger yielded  the deer did not stop and he pumped in another cartridge he heard nothing but red sparks leaped from the rifle and then all was dark a heavy object rolled in the young willows and somebody shouted lights tossed and it looked as if people ran about  jimmy shouted to warn the others and left the stump when he jumped across the ditch his candle went out and on the other side his foot struck something soft stooping down he felt about and then got up and gasped his heart beat for he knew the object he had touched was not a deer  after a moment or two stannard joined him and took a miners lamp from his hat jimmy shivered for the light touched a man who lay in the willows his arms were thrown out and as much of his face as jimmy saw was very white the other side was buried in the wet grass  is he dead jimmy gasped  not yet i think said stannard and deering running up pushed him back and got on his knees  using some effort he lifted the mans head and partly turned him over the others saw a few drops of blood about a very small hole in the breast of his deerskin jacket  a blamed awkward spot deering remarked and gave jimmy a sympathetic glance your lucks surely bad but get hold we must carry him to the house  stannard got down he was cooler than jimmy but they heard an angry shout and deering jumped for the lamp when he ran forward the others saw a young policetrooper crawl from the ditch stopping on the bank he looked down into the mud and bob a few yards off studied him with a grim smile jimmy remarked that okanagan had not a rifle  if you try to get your blasted gun ill sock my knife to you said bob shove on in front and stop where the light is  the trooper advanced awkwardly his stetson hat was gone and his head was cut when he saw the man on the ground he stopped  youve killed him he said put up your hands youre my prisoners  bob laughed  cut it out that talk may go at regina weve no use for it in the bush  an order from the royal northwest goes everywhere quit fooling with that knife my duty is  oh shucks said bob and turned to the others the kid fell on his head and is rattled bad  hes hurt give him a drink stannard said deering we must help the other fellow lift his feet ill watch out for his head get hold bob  they carried the man to the house when they put him down he did not move but jimmy thought he breathed deering pushed a folded coat under his neck and held stannards flask to his mouth his lips were tight and the liquor ran down his skin  a bad job said deering who opened the mans jacket all the same his heart has not stopped  the packers from the barn were now pushing about the door and he beckoned one  take the best horse and start for the hotel get the clerk to wire for a doctor and bring him along as quick as you can make it  the packer went off and deering asked the policeman whos your pal  hes douglas the gamewarden looks as if youd killed him  hes not dead yet deering rejoined and pulled out some cigarettes he may die i dont know but well give him all the chances we can in the meantime take a smoke and tell us what you were doing at the clearing  the trooper lighted a cigarette and leaned against the wall somebody had fixed two candles on the logs and the light touched the faces of the group all were quiet but deering and jimmy noted with surprise that stannard let him take control stannards look was very thoughtful bobs was keen and grim the trooper had obviously got a nasty knock at the door the packers were half seen in the gloom but jimmy felt the unconscious man on the boards so to speak dominated the picture although jimmy himself was highly strung he was cool  my officer sent me to help the warden round you up for poaching on the reserve said the trooper when we hit the clearing we saw you were out with the pitlight and douglas reckoned wed get okanagan first the rest of you were tourists and wouldnt bother us douglas calculated okanagan knew the best stand for a shot and would go right there his plan was to steal up and get him i was to watch out and butt in when i was wanted  it didnt go like that bob remarked when you saw me by the ditch had i a gun  so far as i could see you had not you began to pull your knife  stannard motioned bob to be quiet and the other resumed i heard douglas shout and i got on a move in the dark i ran up against a stump pitched over and went into the ditch i heard a shot  you heard one shot said deering  i dont knowid hit my head and was trying to find my rifle well i guess thats all  i shot twice said jimmy in a quiet voice i dont think bob used a gun all the same when i pulled the trigger i imagined i heard another report but perhaps it was my rifle i really dont know  the number of shots is important stannard observed  deering looked up sharply to find out is the polices job ours is not to help  we ought to help jimmy rejoined i thought a deer was coming i had no object for shooting the warden but if my bullet hit him the police must not blame bob he turned to the others how many shots did you hear  perhaps it was strange but nobody knew a packer thought he heard three shots although he admitted he might have been cheated because the reports echoed in the woods after a few moments they let it go and deering glanced at the man on the floor  maybe he knows i doubt if he will tell  the trooper advanced awkwardly give me a light im going across the clearing i want to see your stands  for the most part the others went with him their curiosity was keen and it looked as if nobody reflected that the lad was their antagonist in fact since they carried in the warden all antagonism had vanished jimmy however remained behind he was on the floor and did not want to get up after the strain he was bothered by a dull reaction and felt slack by and by stannard returned and sat down on the boards  well said jimmy have you found out much  the trooper found your two cartridges and the posts bob gave us you were at a big stump bob a short distance on your left although he declares he had not a gun my stand was on your other side the wardens track across the brush was plain he was going nearly straight for the stump and the bullet mark is at the middle of his chest  it looks as if i shot him jimmy said and shivered  then you must brace up and think about the consequences  somehow i dont want to bother about this yet besides its plain i thought i aimed at a deer  i doubt stannard remarked with some dryness for one thing the police know we killed the bighorn on the reserve and since we took bob again to state he cheated us would not help the fellows a notorious poacher and when the warden arrived he found us using the pitlight which the game laws dont allow on the whole i think the police have grounds to claim douglas was not shot by accident  but he may get better  its possible i think thats all but suppose he does get better do you imagine his narrative would clear you  jimmy pondered until stannard began to argue all he had thought about was that he had shot the warden but now he weighed the consequences he was young and freedom was good moreover he had seen men chained by the leg to a heavy iron ball engaged making a road a warden with a shotgun superintended their labor and jimmy had thought the indignity horrible he could not see himself grading roads perhaps for all his life with a gang like that  what must i do about it he asked  id put up some food and start for the rocks take a rifle and the indian packer and try to get down the east side of the range by the neck below the buttress then you might perhaps push across to the foothills and the plains the police will no doubt reckon on your going west for the pacific coast and if you tried would stop you as far as revelstoke the railroad follows the only break in the mountains and orders will be telegraphed to watch the stations no i think you must steer for the alberta plains  jimmy knitted his brows if he could reach the coast he might get into the united states or on board a ship but he must cross british columbia and for the most part the province was a rugged mountainous wilderness the northern railroads were not yet built the settlements were along the c p r track and the lake steamboat routes he dared not use the railroad but when he thought about the rocks and broken mountains he must cross to reach the plains he shrank  i could not carry the food id need he said  you have a rifle and must take the packer so long as deer and grouse are in the woods an indian will not starve stannard replied and gave jimmy his wallet offer the fellow a large sum and hell see you out but you must start  thank you ill risk it said jimmy and giving stannard his hand went off  not long afterwards the others returned and deering looked about the room  wheres jimmy he asked  he went out a few minutes since stannard replied in a careless voice and deering turned to the trooper  somebody must watch douglas but youre knocked out and mr stannard and i will undertake the job until sunup its obvious our interest is to keep him alive  the lad agreed his head was cut and he had not found his rifle to imagine he could control a party of athletic men was ridiculous and since they were friendly he must be resigned  not long before daybreak deering woke up and looked about bobs pitlamp hanging from a beam gave a dim light  hello jimmys not back  stannard looked at the others and thought them asleep motioning to deering to follow he went to the door he had pulled off his boots and deering trod like a cat  jimmy will not come back he started for the plains across the neck  you sent the kid across the hardest country in alberta  i dont know that i did send him but well let it go jimmys a mountaineer and he took the indian  shucks said deering the indians a coast siwash and not much use on the rocks jimmys an english tenderfoot and has no chinook he cant talk to the indian i doubt if hes got a compass or a map  he has my map and i imagine an indian does not need a compass stannard rejoined at all events i didnt see another plan  deering looked at him hard well perhaps jimmys lucky because i was born and raised in the bush fix up a plausible tale for the policeman when he wakes ill be hitting jimmys trail  he turned and his bulky figure melted in the dark stannard knew he was going to the barn to get food and for a few moments knitted his brows then he shrugged philosophically and went back to the house     xv  trooper simpsons prisoners   day broke drearily across the clearing mist rolled about the dark pines and when the wind got stronger the dark branches tossed the loghouse was cold and trooper simpson turning over on the hard boards shivered then he remarked that although the pitlamp had gone out the room was not dark and he was dully conscious that he had slept longer than he ought after a few moments his glance rested on an object covered by blankets at the other end of the room and he got up with a jerk  his head hurt and he was dizzy he now remembered that he had run against a stump and fallen into the ditch but he must brace up and with something of an effort he crossed the floor so far as he could see the wardens eyes were shut and his face was pinched all the same simpson thought he breathed and when he touched him his skin was not cold  hello he said and stannard sitting by douglas turned  hes very sick simpson resumed what are we going to do about it  we must try to keep him warm and when he can swallow give him a little weak liquor and perhaps some hot soup i expect thats all but i have sent for a doctor  i see you have given him good blankets said simpson who looked about leylands not back you allowed he had gone out for a few minutes then wheres the big man  i stated leyland went out a few minutes before deering inquired for him stannard said dryly some time after leyland went deering started for the bush  then ive got stung you knew id lost my rifle and you helped my prisoners get off  stannard smiled to talk about your prisoners is ridiculous i imagine we are rather your hosts i am not a policeman and when my friends resolved to leave the camp i had no grounds to meddle however if it will give you some satisfaction ill lend you a rifle  im going to get mine said simpson and started across the clearing  he came back before long carrying a wet rifle his clothes were muddy and his mouth was tight  i found her in two or three minutes but when i was in the ditch last night i felt all about  to find an object in the dark is awkward stannard remarked  simpson gave him an angry glance the magazines broke and the ejectors jambed i dont see how she got broke i didnt hit the stump with my gun i hit it with my head  the thing is rather obvious the cut ought to satisfy your officer said stannard soothingly  if you hadnt let your partners go i wouldnt have had to satisfy my officer now i sure dont see where i am  the situation is embarrassing stannard agreed my friends have been gone some time and are pretty good mountaineers its possible they could go where you could not then if you went after deering and leyland i might go off another way i dont want to persuade you but perhaps you ought to stop and take care of douglas  simpson frowned and put down his damaged rifle  looks as if you had got me beat and ive no use for talking now the lights good ill take a proper look at your partys tracks  stannard let him go and soon afterwards bob came in sitting down on the boards he struck a pungent sulphur match and lighted his pipe stannards glance got hard he knew the western hired mans independence but he thought bob truculent  the wardens very ill and your tobaccos rank he said  hes sick all right i doubt if hell get better bob agreed in a meaning voice although he did not put away his pipe  for a few moments stannard pondered to baffle the young trooper had rather amused him but to dispute with bob was another thing  if douglas does not get better it will be awkward stannard said  it will sure be awkward for mr leyland  or for you  shucks you know i was sort of superintending and hadnt a gun  i dont know said stannard you stated you had not a gun in the meantime i imagine simpson is measuring distances and fixing angles or something like that i cant judge if he knows his job perhaps you can  bobs glance was a little keener huh he said scornfully the kids from the cities and cant read tracks all the same somebody shot douglas and if the police cant fix it on leyland theyll get after me  i dont see where i can help for one thing mr leyland is my friend then all i can state is i didnt see you carry a gun on the whole i dont think the police have much grounds to bother you  well i dont take no chances the police would sooner i was for it they cant claim leyland meant to kill the warden but they might claim i did gimme a hundred dollars and ill quit  stannard smiled i have not got ten dollars i gave jimmy my wallet hes your employer  then if i run up against mr leyland ill know he carries a wad and i guess i can persuade him to see me out said bob now im going to take all the grub i want so long  he went off and stannard shrugged but a few moments afterwards he rested his back against the wall and shut his eyes as if he were tired by and by simpson returned and met bob near the door bob carried a big pack a cartridge belt and a rifle  hello said simpson another for the woods well you got to drop that pack youre not going  you make me tired my guns not broke bob rejoined and shoved the muzzle against simpsons chest get inside sonny get in quick  the royal northwest police do not enlist slacknerved men and simpsons pluck was good for all that he was lightly built and was hurt while bob was big and muscular when simpson seized the rifle barrel bob pushed hard on the butt the trooper staggered back struck the doorpost and plunged into the house bob laughed  your jobs to help cure your partner maybe he knows who shot him he remarked and started across the clearing  simpson leaned against the wall and gasped when he got his breath he turned to stannard savagely wheres your rifle  in the corner behind you stannard replied and simpson seizing the rifle jerked open the breech  my cartridge shells wont fit  its possible said stannard i didnt engage to lend you ammunition but if you go to the barn youll find a brown valise bring me the valise and i may find you a box of cartridges  do you reckon bob is going to wait until i get all fixed  thats another thing said stannard pleasantly  simpson put down the rifle in about a minute the fellowll hit the timber and his sort dont leave much trail then you have not pulled out yet  you imagine if you went after bob and did not find him you might not find me when you came back  thats so simpson agreed not long since i reckoned id got the gang now youre all thats left the packers dont count  oh well said stannard smiling ill agree to remain i expect to pay a fine for poaching although i didnt know i was on the reserve since im resigned it doesnt look as if my friends had an object for shooting douglas you see i killed the bighorn  all the same three have lit out  theres the puzzle the warden was hit by one bullet i own i dont see much light but i think you sketched the clearing  simpson pulled out a notebook and stannard remarked that the plan of the ground was carefully drawn he thought the spots the sportsmen had occupied were accurately marked distances and the lines of the wardens and simpsons advance were indicated  the things like a map he said how did you fix the positions  i carry a compass and can step off a measurement nearly right at regina they teach us to study tracks but i was at a surveyors office before i joined up  then you are a surveyor said stannard with keen interest for he saw the accuracy of the plan was important  simpson smiled surveyings a close profession i was a clerk but i copied plans and sometimes the boss took me out to help pull the measuring chain well i guess that plan will stand  when stannard gave back the book his look was thoughtful but he said until the doctor arrives we must concentrate on keeping douglas alive to begin with well get the packers to make a branch bed and light a fire  douglas lived but so far as the others could see this was all he hardly moved and he did not talk but sometimes at night his skin got hot and he raved in a faint broken voice a packer shot some willow grouse and they made broth and stannard put away the partys small stock of liquor and canned delicacies for his use sometimes he swallowed a little food but for the most part he lay like a log in blank unconsciousness  simpson stannard and a packer watched and before long stannard knew the trooper was his man he had qualities that attracted trustful youth and used his talent cleverly for all that when the doctor and an officer of the mounted police arrived stannards look was worn and simpsons relief was keen the officer sent stannard from the room but ordered him to wait at the barn  after some time simpson came to the barn and stannard returning to the house saw the officers brows were knit the doctor put some instruments into a case and then turned his head and looked at his companion stannard imagined they had not heard his step and for the moment had forgotten about him  he was obviously hit in front the bullet marks near the middle of his body and indicates he was going for the man who shot him the officer remarked  the wound at the back does not altogether support your argument the doctor replied it is not at the middle and the fellow is lucky because it is not the marks so to speak obliquely behind the other  the mark where a bullet leaves the body is generally larger  to reckon on its being larger is a pretty safe rule the doctor agreed  stannards interest was keen but the officer saw him and looked at the doctor who signed to stannard to advance  i imagine you have used some thought for the sick man he said sit down i want to know  in a few minutes stannard satisfied his curiosity and the officer then took him to another room he used reserve but he was polite and stannard thought he had examined simpson and the troopers narrative had carried some weight  the doctor states douglas must not be moved the officer presently remarked in the morning i must start for the railroad and you will go with me ill try to make things as easy as i can but if you tried to get away you would run some risk the royal northwest have powers the government does not give municipal police  had i wanted to get away i would have gone some time since stannard replied  the other nodded simpson admits your help was worth much well you will certainly be made accountable for poaching but this may satisfy my chiefsi dont know yet i expect theres no use in my trying to get some light about your friends plans  there is not much use stannard agreed for one thing my friends did not altogether enlighten me  very well said the officer smiling so long as you do not go off the ranch you can go where you like after breakfast in the morning we start for the railroad     xvi  the neck   mist floated about the rocks and the evening was dark to push on was rash but jimmy hoped he might get down to the trees below the snowline anyhow he must if possible get off the broken crest of the range since noon until the sun went west and shadow crept across the mountain he and the indian had crouched behind a shelf and watched snow and stones plunge to the valley now all was quiet and the snow was firm but the mist was puzzling and jimmy could not see where he went all he knew was he followed the neck to lower ground  jimmy was tired in the wilds if one can shoot straight fresh meat may sometimes be got but one must carry a rifle flour and groceries moreover he now felt the reaction after the strain and the journey on which he had started daunted him he must push across a wilderness of high rocks and snow in the mountains one cannot travel fast and when he reached the plains the distance to the american frontier was long he dared not stop at the settlements and until he crossed the boundary must camp in the grass although the days got short and the nights were cold  the indian heavily loaded went a few yards in front but he came from the warm coast and his part was to supply them with game and fish jimmy got some comfort from reflecting that he himself knew the swiss rocks because he rather thought all mountains whose tops were above the snowline so to speak approximated to a type  frost split their ragged pinnacles and great blocks plunged down avalanches ground their shoulders to precipitous slopes from which battered crags stuck out as a rule the top of the long ridges was narrow like a rough sawedge but sometimes a bulging snowcornice followed the crest where the snowfields dropped to a hollow a glacier generally went down in flowing curves one could follow a glacier but at some places the surface wrinkled and broke in tremendous cracks  by and by the indian stopped and jimmy looked about the neck had got very steep and the mist was thick the pitch at the top of the glacier is awkward and jimmy knitted his brows if he balanced properly pushed off and trailed his rifle butt he would go down like a toboggan the trouble was he might go over a perpendicular fall and into the bergschrund crack to climb down and slip meant a furious plunge like the other and if there was not a bergschrund he might hit a rock yet if he meant to go east he must get down and for a few minutes he sat moodily in the snow  the strange thing was stannard had told him to try the neck stannard knew much about rocks and glaciers but perhaps he had not explored far then to some extent jimmy had started because stannard urged him now he thought about it to run away was to admit his guilt stannard ought to have seen this but obviously had not all however had got a nasty jolt and when one was jolted one was not logical in the meantime he must concentrate on getting down  by and by he heard a shout and steps flat lumps of snow like plates rolled down and jimmy thrilled somebody was coming and he thought he knew deerings voice then an indistinct object pierced the mist slid for some distance and stopped  hello jimmy you havent got far ahead deering shouted and his strong voice echoed in the rocks  jimmy was moved and comforted deering looked very big and his heartiness was bracing  i was forced to stop at the buttress in the afternoon  sure said deering i reckoned on your getting held up i was on the ridge and shoved right along but im going to stop for a few minutes now get off the snow well sit on my pack  what about the warden jimmy asked  when i started he wasnt conscious shock collapse i guess but you could hear his breath and a little color was coming to his skin on the whole i think if they get a doctor quick hell pull douglas through the trouble is we wont know but well talk about this again the ground ahead is blamed steep looks as if we might hit an awkward schrund at the top of the glacier anyhow well wait a bit i think the moons coming out  jimmy agreed he knew that where a snowfield comes down nearly perpendicularly to a glacier one generally finds a tremendous crack by and by the mist rolled off and a small dim moon came out deering got up and when he strapped on his pack they started down the slope they used caution and after a time deering stopped  the mist was thinner and one could see for a short distance black and white rock bordered the narrowing neck and in front the snow fell away plunging down rather like a frozen wave shreds of mist floated up from the cloud that filled the valley and jimmy looking down on the vapors level top got a sense of profound depth all the same the mist did not interest him much fifty yards off an uneven dark streak marked the bottom of the snowy wave the streak was broad its opposite edge sparkled in the moon and then melted into shadow that got deeper until it was black jimmy studied the yawning gap and shivered had deering not arrived and the moon shone out he thought he would have gone across the edge  ive no use for fooling around a schrund in the mist and we cant wait for daybreak deering remarked we must get back and make the timber line on the other side before we freeze  jimmy doubted if he could get back and shrank from the effort he thought the buttress five or six hundred feet above him and for a fresh athletic man to get up in an hour was good climbing but he was not fresh his body was exhausted and he had borne a heavy nervous strain all the same to wait in the snow for daybreak was unthinkable  they fronted the long climb and jimmy breathing hard and sometimes stumbling made slow progress he doubted if he could have got up the steepest pitch had not deering helped him and at another the indian took his pack they reached the top and deering studied the white slope that went down the other side the moon had gone and thick cloud rolled about the heights  this lot peters out in a gravel bank near the snowline i guess well slide it he said and vanished in the mist  jimmy braced his legs pushed off and let himself go in switzerland he had studied the glissade but when one carries a heavy load to balance on a precipitous slope is difficult it looked as if deering could not balance because after a few moments jimmy shot past an object that rolled in the snow then he himself lost control his pack pulled him over and he went headforemost down hill when he stopped the pitch was easier and looking back he saw a belt of cloud three or four hundred feet above he had gone through the cloud and when he turned his head he saw dark forest roll up from the valley in front for all that the highest trees were some distance off  by and by the indian and deering arrived and soon afterwards the snow got thin stones covered the mountainside and now and then a bank their feet disturbed slipped away and carried them down at length deering smashing through some juniper scrub seized a small dead pine and when jimmy breathless and rather battered arrived declared they had gone far enough they had got fuel and water ran in the stones  half an hour afterwards jimmy sat down on thin branches in a hollow behind a rock in front a fire snapped and the rock kept off the wind the smell of coffee floated about the camp and the indian was occupied with a fryingpan  when jimmy had satisfied his appetite he lighted his pipe he was warm and the daunting sense of loneliness had gone by and by deering began to talk  when stannard stated you had pulled out for the foothills i thought id better come along he talked about your shoving across for the boundary but i doubted if you could make it perhaps an alpine club party starting from a base camp with packers to relay supplies could cross the rocks but when your outfits a little flour and a slab of pork it sure cant be done my notion is well get back from the railroad pitch camp in a snug valley and hunt  but you have no grounds to hide from the police  im pretty keen on hunting and i like it in the mountains deering replied with a laugh to start with horses and packers is expensive but our hunting wont cost much then id a sort of notion i ought to see you out well let it go at that for a time the police will watch the railroad but theyll get tired  youre a very good sort jimmy declared and resumed the royal northwest boast they have never let a man they really wanted get away  police talk said deering reckon it up they put two troopers to watch a hundred miles of wilderness in broken timbered country a horse cant go and a man can hardly shove along i allow the boys are smart but they cant do more thans possible for flesh and blood when weve put them off our track well fix up a scheme  now i think about it i dont know if i ought to have run away stannard rather persuaded me to start  perhaps he was justified the forestry department bosses cant allow their wardens to be shot then you belong to a gang that had killed bighorn on a reserve and engaged a notorious poacher for guide when douglas was shot he was getting after your man on the whole i reckon id have pulled out but i dont see why stannard suggested your going for the plains he ought to know you couldnt make it  he didnt know jimmy declared  very well i reckon he knew you could not get down the neck anyhow he knew the ground he was up on the range  jimmy was vaguely disturbed deerings remarks indicated that he was not satisfied and he thought the fellow studied him  stannard reached the neck but its obvious he did not go far enough to see the icefall  i didnt see the icefall but i expected to get up against something of the sort stannards a famous climber  after all we might have got down  its possible deering agreed with some dryness if wed had two good fresh men a proper rope and icepicks i might have tried after sunup but we hadnt got the proper truck and i own i wasnt fresh  i was exhausted said jimmy still an exploit we thought daunting might not daunt stannard i expect that accounts for it  deering gave him a keen glance and smiled  oh well hes sure a good man on the rocks  jimmy knocked out his pipe so long as he had persuaded deering that stannard had not carelessly allowed him to run a risk he was content he did not want to dispute about it he liked deering and to see him across the fire was some comfort deering had not stannards qualities but jimmy began to see he himself was rather deerings sort than the others then in the mountains cultivation had not the importance it had for example at an english country house jimmy liked deerings raw human force his big muscular body and his rather noisy laugh anyhow deering had joined him and meant to see him out he put away his pipe pulled up his thick blue blanket and went to sleep     xvii  dillon meditates   when stannard reached the settlements he was again examined by the police he knew where frankness paid and was frank but he owed something to trooper simpsons narrative and something to his personal charm a magistrate ordered him to pay a rather heavy fine and give up the bighorn heads and then let him go but stannard doubted if the police were altogether satisfied the officer who examined him was remarkably keen  on the evening stannard returned to the hotel laura and dillon occupied chairs at the table on the terrace electric lights burned on the veranda for the days got short but the sunset was not altogether gone dillon saw lauras face in profile against the fading reflections she looked away from him to the north where pines and rocks and snow were all deep soft blue her arm was on the table her body was partly turned and dillon thought her strangely beautiful all the same he wanted her to look round  you are quiet he remarked  im thinking about jimmy in the wilds do you mind  not at all dillon declared when jimmy was around the hotel i had no use for the fellow now hes in the mountains im bothered about him somehow one likes jimmy and if i knew how i could help id start  laura turned her head and gave him a curious glance  why do you like jimmy hes english and youre frankly american  that is so to begin with ive no pick on jimmy because he loved you if he had not loved you id have known his blood wasnt red then although hes english in a sense hes our type hes sincere we are sincere you know and perhaps from your point of view we dont use much reserve you can move us and when were moved we talk and get busy well jimmys like that hes marked by something generously human but i doubt if he got it at london clubs maybe its his inheritance from the folks who built the cotton mill  laura said nothing she doubted if franks willingness to state his grounds for liking jimmy altogether accounted for his rather unusual effort indeed she imagined he labored to get a light on a subject that puzzled him  well he resumed to know deering went after jimmy is some comfort if jimmy gets up against it in the rocks deering will see him through  your trust in deering is remarkable  hes a white man said dillon with a smile to be his friend cost me high but now ive cut out bets and cards id sooner hed got my money than another you see i got something back the fellows big  laura was annoyed she wanted to feel deering was her antagonist and had exploited franks trust the trouble was she could not altogether do so but she dared not admit that stannard shared his guilt and perhaps his reward to chastise deering so to speak exculpated her father  he is certainly muscular and rather gross she remarked  hes flesh and blood i doubt if you quite get us yet in the west we havent cultivated out rude emotions we like a fellow who plunges at an obstacle sweats and laughs and sometimes gets mad were up against savage nature and our job is a mans first job to satisfy human needs well you know my father hes a pretty good western type when he started in his food was frugal and his clothes were overalls now hes moving forests and architects come to study the office block he built but if things go wrong in the woods his superintendents know he can use their talk and handle a cantpole his power springs from the primitive streak  well let it go said laura and indicated the long rows of pines melting into the gloom dark now comes soon  before long the frost will come and in the mountains the cold is pretty fierce on puget sound the soft chinook blows and the white olympians stand between you and the winds from the rockies the old mans keen for me to bring you back what about our starting  laura blushed for she had agreed to marry dillon soon but she said my father cannot go yet so long as jimmy is in the mountains and the warden cannot tell his story i think he will remain in canada perhaps he ought to remain  oh well you can reckon on mr stannards taking the proper line dillon agreed rather moodily you feel the things mechanical mr stannard is like that  mechanical said laura lifting her brows  his taking the proper lines mechanical he doesnt bother about it in the west his correctness is somehow exotic  if my father is exotic i expect i am exotic  sure you are like a bird of paradise or a flower from the tropics we are a rude lot of hustlers and your grace and beauty carry us away  youre romantic but sometimes youre rather nice laura remarked with a smile all the same if my father resolves to remain in canada it is not a mechanical resolve but because he feels he ought  i expect that is so dillon agreed and lighted a cigarette  he thought stannard ought to stay and since he meant to do so to doubt him was not logical yet dillon did doubt for one thing the fellow was jimmys friend but when jimmy started for the rocks deering not the other went after him then stannards narrative was puzzling jimmy had run away and his going indicated that he was accountable for the wardens getting shot if jimmy imagined he had shot at a deer he ought to have stayed moreover bob had run away and if he had hit the warden it was obvious that jimmy had not stannards tale was not plausible and since stannard was clever dillon imagined he had not told all he knew  but dillon began to see his vague antagonism had another foundation he was frankly western and stannards type was new although some people in downeast cities cultivated his qualities on the pacific slope men were highlystrung optimistic and rather boyishly keen they plunged into big risky undertakings sweated and fought in fact where nature was not yet conquered their part was protagonist dillon owned that he himself was loafing but he had not loafed long and would soon return to his proper occupation  stannard had not an occupation and dillon thought the grounds for his distrust were there moreover he had not a bankroll although he lived extravagantly and indulged his fastidiousness his habit was to strike exactly the proper note but sometimes its monotonous accuracy jarred fastidious cultivation was for women yet stannard was not at all womanly dillon began to sense in him a hard calculating vein for all that he must not exaggerate and laura was not like her father  you could of course join my folk although mr stannard would sooner wait he said  i think not my father planned the excursion to the mountains and led the party until people are satisfied about the shooting accident i must not go to your house  now you are ridiculous dillon declared  all the same i will not go said laura firmly  then im going to stay with you id like to stay but if jimmy wants me im his man  i dont expect jimmy will need you father imagines hes a long way off and will soon reach the plains said laura and began to talk about something else  jimmy was not steering for the plains he had in fact known for some time that he could not get there the morning after deering joined him was calm and cold the sun touched the high rocks and in places a pine branch sparkled with dew but a thousand feet below the camp the mist was like a level floor one could not see the valley and the turmoil of a river came up with a faint hoarse throb as if from a long way off jimmys fatigue and gloom were gone he felt fresh and to see deering fry pork was comforting he got a rather frugal breakfast and lighted his pipe  what are our plans for today he asked  we must try to get a deer fresh venisons most as tough as rawhide but if you put the roasted meat in a bag with salt after a week or two you can eat the stuff how many cartridges have you got  six said jimmy and deering smiled  you started for the plains with six shells well ive got a box of twentyfive but somebody has taken out ten or twelve looks as if we want to shoot straight the pork wont hold up long  where do we go when we have got a deer  i reckon well go north said deering thoughtfully they talk about new railroads but so far the only line of communication between the rockies and the sea is the c p r track the settlements follow the line and when you pull out of the narrow belt youre in the wilderness the police will no doubt reckon on your trying to make vancouver well stop in the wilds and let them watch the railroad until they get tired  but if they find i havent gone to vancouver wont they try the bush  look at stannards map said deering with a smile note the row of ranges and valleys running north and south but the big ridges and furrows are not even theyre broken by high bench country and cut up by crossspurs pretty awkward ground to search for two fellows tracks our troubles not to hide but to get supplies all the food they use in british columbia comes in by the c p r  jimmy studied the map and agreed moreover he was young and the wilds called to plunge into the great desolation was something of an adventure and deering claimed to know the bush  what about your hired man did you trust the fellow deering resumed  i had no grounds to doubt him jimmy replied in a thoughtful voice bob was rather inscrutable and didnt attract me but he could chop and this was all i wanted  so far as you can calculate he hadnt a pick on you  not at all i think he was satisfied with his pay and since i generally let him plan the work we did not dispute all the same sometimes i imagined he gave me a queer moody look  do you think he was in any sense stannards man  certainly not said jimmy with some surprise anyhow i dont see  i dont see deering admitted im looking for a light but dont get much yet well when you have smoked your pipe well hit the trail  they got off a few minutes afterwards and at noon reached the bottom of the hill a high spur blocked the valley behind them and the echoes of small avalanches rolled across the rocks deering declared the sliding snow would cover their tracks at the neck but their line was to some extent obvious and until they could break it they must push on as fast as possible  to push on fast was hard fallen trees and tangled brush blocked the gaps in the rows of trunks but by and by jimmy looking through an opening saw the woods shine with reflected light the trees were like silver trees they sparkled as if touched by frost and for a few moments jimmy was puzzled then he said rampikes  deering nodded a big burn i expect it has cleared some ground for us  a short distance farther on the brushwood vanished underfoot was a soft carpet of ashes from which the trunks rose like columns their branches were gone and the smooth round logs reflected the light for a time to get free from entangling vines and thorns was a relief but the ash was soft and when one disturbed it went up in clouds the black dust stuck to jimmys hot skin and he labored across the clogging stuff then the desolation began to react on him the birds were gone and the feathery ash was not broken by the tracks of animals it was obvious they would not find a deer all was dead and but for the noise of falling water the silence was daunting at length jimmy stopped and leaned against a trunk  come off said deering sit down if you like although id sooner keep on my feet you dont want to lean against a rampike  jimmy was tired and sat in the ashes  how do the fires start he asked  its puzzling the forestry people claim theyre not spontaneous deering replied around the settlements a fire sometimes starts from a burned slashing and the police get after the homesteader all the same you hit brûlés in country the indians and prospectors leave alone anyhow i guess were lucky because theres not much wind and while our luck is good well push along  they set off and some time afterwards the roar of an avalanche broke the brooding calm the noise swelled and rolled about the valley as if great rocks were coming down and then jimmy heard a near sharp crash he jumped mechanically and looking back saw a pillar of dust float up like smoke from a blasting shot in the dust a big rampike slanted broke and plunged another went and deering pushed jimmy  well pull out he shouted and they began to run  when jimmy stopped to get his breath the echoes had died away and all was quiet but he felt he had had enough of the burned forest after studying the rocks and gravel on the hillside he turned to deering  you talked about breaking our line and i expect we could get over the spur in front he said lets try     xviii  the cartridge belt   jimmys clothes were torn and he was bothered about his boots he rather thought clothes and boots that would long bear the strain of a journey across the rocks were not made at all events one could not buy them at a canadian settlement store then the things were wet and the morning was cold  for all that he must not grumble the deer did not like the heavy dew and their habit was to come out on the rocks and get the sun the indian thought he had found a spot they haunted and after breakfast led the others across a small tableland by and by he stopped and jimmy got down in the fern in front the timber was thin and a short distance off was a smooth rock jimmy saw the rock and the trees on the other side but for a few moments this was all a deers soft color harmonizes with stones and trunks and when its outline is broken to distinguish the animal is hard  the indian frowned and signed and jimmy imagined the small patch of light color cutting a pine trunk was a head for one thing it moved and the crooked line below it looked like a leg jimmy did not see the deers back but the top of the leg indicated where its shoulder was and he rested his rifle on a branch he got the sights where he wanted braced his muscles held his breath and steadily pulled the trigger  the deer jumped and a thin streak of smoke floated in front of jimmys eyes the animal was not on the rock but after a moment or two he saw it rise from a thicket and go over some tangled branches a mans height from the ground yet he thought the leap awkward and the deer came down in the fern before it ought his heart beat and he waited for another shot until he saw deering a few yards off and remembered that their cartridges were not numerous deerings body was firmly poised his head was bent forward and he balanced his rifle halfway to his shoulder as if it were a gun jimmy knew he could use it like a gun  when the deer broke from the fern at the edge of the tableland jimmy did not shoot the animals leap carried it across a clump of tall raspberries but it would vanish in a moment and the brush in front was thick deerings rifle jerked and the graceful body carried by its speed plunged into the brush jimmy heard a crash and the deer was gone he thought it had gone over a rock and putting down his rifle he ran  a minute or two afterwards he stopped at the top of a precipitous slope a stream however cut the mountainside and in places small trees were rooted in the stones a hundred feet below the deer lay on a shelf by a waterfall  i think i can reach it said jimmy and went cautiously down  they needed the venison but when he had got down a short distance he knew he was rash for it looked as if the rocks on the other side of the waterfall were perpendicular then although he might perhaps reach the shelf to carry the deer back was another thing  using the small trees for support he got to a slab above the shelf the slab was wet and dotted by greasy moss but a few cracks and small stones broke its surface and jimmy trusted his luck when he came down the ground shook and he saw the shelf was not as he imagined a solid block but two or three large stones embedded in boggy soil at one end the cascade had scooped out a small basin and the deers hind quarters were in the pool jimmy seized its fore legs and bracing his feet against a stone began to pull he pulled hard but although he felt he moved the deer did not then his foot went down and letting go the animal he threw himself back  the deer rolled over and vanished water splashed and jimmy saw the stones plunge down the face of the cliff for a moment or two he was rather angry than alarmed they wanted the meat but the deer was gone then he saw he ran some risk of going down the cliff and he began to study the ground scratches on the stone indicated how he had reached the spot but he had let himself go because the shelf was in front the pitch was very steep and the rock was mossy not far off a small tree grew in a crack but he could not reach the trunk and rather thought to try would send him over the precipice  he heard a shout and nailed boots rattled deering was coming down although he was not yet in jimmys line of view after a time jimmy lying against the rock turned his head and saw deering had got hold of the tree  im anchored said deering can you reach my hand  the effort was risky but jimmy tried and deering seized his wrist deering pulled him up for a foot or two and then stopped and gasped  jamb yourself against the slab ive got to let go  jimmys boots slipped on the smooth stone and his hands were wet he could not get a proper hold and the moss was slimy under his knees spreading out his arms he let himself go slack and trusted his limp body would not slip back he could not now see deering and did not know what he did after a moment or two he felt him seize his cartridge belt  use your knees when i lift grab the tree  the cartridge belt got tight and jimmy using its support reached the trunk his jacket felt slack as if something were gone but this was not important and he heard deerings labored breath  thanks he said rather dully we have lost the deer  we have used two shells said deering lets get up  they got up and at the top jimmy put his hand to his waist  hello wheres my belt  now i think about it when i held you up i felt something give i guess the buckle was pulling out well we ought to see the brown leather  they did not see it and jimmy said all the cartridges i had are gone how many have you got  twelve said deering rather grimly anyhow im not going down again  jimmy nodded he thought the belt had gone over the cliff  i brought about six pounds of pork from the camp  my loads flour desiccated fruit and a few cans of meat looks as if we had got to eat salmon  in the old country one doesnt grumble about eating salmon jimmy remarked  oh well said deering i was raised in the bush and am not fastidious but if we cant get salmon ill be resigned the trouble is since foods short we cant push back too far from the settlements well we must try to hit a creek  in the evening they came down to a small river and pitched camp on the bank the indian cut and trimmed a straight fir branch but left a fork at the thinner end then he pulled out two cleverlycarved bone barbs which he fitted on the forks and fastened by sinews to the staff  you could carry the business part of his outfit in your pocket deering remarked i expect his folks have used barbs like that for a thousand years an indians tools are standardized but when he thinks them good enough he stops all the same i reckon he gets most as far as a man can get alone hes an artist but we beat him by cooperating to make machines anyhow the fellow doesnt want you take a smoke and let him spear a fish  jimmy lighted his pipe and looked about a few yards off the current splashed against the stones the water was green and the line of driftwood and dead leaves on the bank indicated that the frost was stopping the muddy streams from the glaciers some distance down the river the indian balanced on a rock in a pool at the tail of a rapid for a time he did not move and jimmy thought his quietness statuesque the fellow was like the herons he had studied with his glasses by a pool on the scottish border then his body bent and the spear went down the thrust and recovery were strangely quick and jimmy rather doubted if the man had moved  it looks as if he missed his stroke he said  hes using a fir branch an indian spear is beautifully modeled deering replied  a few minutes afterwards the indian bent backwards and a shining object struck the bank coming to the fire he put down the fish and jimmys appetite was blunted the salmon was lean and battered its color was dull and its tail was broken rows of scales were rubbed off the fins were worn from the supporting ribs  im not as hungry as i was are all like that he said  it depends on when you get them deering replied a june steelhead fresh from the sea is pretty good but a salmon that has pushed through to head waters in the fall is another thing when you think about it the salmons journey inland is remarkable they bore against the autumn floods when the melted snow comes down they force tremendous rapids whirlpools and roaring falls where the waters calm in the valleys eagles and fishhawks harry them and the mink hunts them in the shallows but they cant be stopped they follow natures urge and shove on across all obstacles for the distant gravel banks then they spawn where they were hatched and the bears eat their spent carcasses the trouble is im not a bear but ive got to eat salmon  when the indian had fried two or three thick steaks jimmy sympathized with deering the flesh was soft and its taste was rank for all that he thought if he had not seen the salmon he might have had a better appetite at the hotel he had eaten because his food tempted him now he ate because he must by and by he threw down his tin plate  ive had enough if we can find a deer we must risk another cartridge we have got twelve  you cant reckon on getting a deer for every shot and although as a rule the deer are pretty numerous about the small clearings in some belts of back country you cant find one i expect theyre attracted by the crops in fact the wild animals and large birds arent much afraid of the ranchers they quit when the automobiles and city sports arrive  but if we stop in the neighborhood of a settlement the police may get on our trail jimmy rejoined  the police are smart and i allow theyre obstinate all the same to search the rocks from banff to revelstoke is a big job you can give yourself away by two things shooting and smoke but we can fix the smoke and were not going to shoot much as soon as we hit a proper spot well build a shack  by and by our supplies will run out  that is so deering agreed in the meantime were baffling the police just now i expect theyre busy looking for our tracks but they have got other jobs and cant keep it up well when we think theyre forced to quit well find a plan  he stopped and the indian turned his head a faint hoarse bark came from the distance and echoed across the valley jimmy jumped up and looked about the light was going and the pines were blurred  a dog he said  a timber wolf said deering hes not alone i hear another  a howl pitched on a high mournful note pierced the gloom and jimmy shivered the noise was strangely dreary  will the wolves bother us  i think not said deering and talked in chinook to the indian who nodded the fellow agrees he resumed in north ontario we watch out for wolves when the snow is on the ground but as a rule in british columbia they leave the ranchers alone sometimes they take a sheep i reckon thats all the trouble is they kill deer and when the wolves start hunting the deer pull out  jimmy got down on his blanket by the fire he felt the wilds were daunting and to see the flame leap about the branches was some comfort now and then a wolf howled in the distance but by and by all was quiet and he went to sleep     xix  useful friends   breakfast was over and although jimmy would have liked another bannock he got up and strapped on his pack deering needed the bannock for flour was running out a fire burned on the stone hearth and the little shack in a corner of the rocks was warm jimmy did not want to leave it but he knew he must and the indian waited for him to start  they had not killed a deer and although they had shot two or three blue grouse a blue grouse is not large sometimes one can knock down a little willow grouse with a stick but the willow grouse had recently vanished and the indian had caught nothing in his snares in fact it looked as if all the birds and animals had gone south jimmy had eaten salmon until he loathed the battered fish but the salmon had begun to die  your loads not big said deering have you put up all the food you need  ive got all the food im going to take jimmy rejoined i can load up at kelshope but you must wait until i get back  oh well but since i know the bush and might make better time you ought to let me go  youre obstinate said jimmy i know jardine and we want his help  that is so said deering and gave him his hand anyhow you have got the indian and i expect hell hit the shortest line i wish you luck  jimmy pulled up his pack and set off speed was important for he imagined he had left deering a larger supply of food than the other knew since he was going to kelshope he could get fresh supplies but deering could not yet if he was longer than he calculated it would be awkward jimmy felt lonely and rather daunted the shack was small and rude but the bark walls kept out the wind and in the cold evenings he had liked to sit by the snapping fire  now the trackless wilderness was in front and he must get across before his food was gone he did get across but he imagined the indians inherited talents accounted for his doing so jimmy himself did not know much about the journey when he thought about it afterwards he dully pictured the fatigue and strain the sharpening pinch of hunger and the stern effort to push on  at length they came down the rocks one morning and saw his clearing in the distance jimmy gave the indian all the food he had and telling him to camp at the ranch started for jardines he was hungry and for a day or two his side had hurt sometimes he was faint and when he crossed a stony belt he stumbled awkwardly for all that in the evening he reached the splitrail fence at kelshope  jimmy knew how one pulled out the bars but they baffled him and he knocked down the crossed supports in front of the house he stopped for a flickering light shone from the window and he saw margaret sewing by the fire his broken boots and torn clothes embarrassed him but he braced up and went to the door  margaret put down her sewing and her look was rather strained jimmy leaned against the table and gave her an apologetic smile his hair was long his beard had begun to grow and his face was pinched his ragged clothes looked slack and although he had given the indian his blanket his shoulders were bent from weariness  oh mr leyland margaret exclaimed in a pitiful voice  to my friends im jimmy he rejoined to know you and your father are my friends is some comfort because im going to use your friendship besides i rather think i dont look like mr leyland  margarets voice was gentle and she said very well jimmy but where have you come from  i started about a week since from our bark shack across the range but i dont know much about it the indians at my ranch and can hold out until the morning i want to borrow some cartridges and food  why of course said margaret and indicated a chair ill get supper ready fathers at the depot but we wont wait for him  jimmy got into the chair for he imagined he did not sit down gracefully the deerskin was soft and his head went back against the rail now he was not forced to keep going he knew he was very tired margaret began to move about and by and by he asked cant i help  margaret looked up with a smile no jimmy i have not much use for the help you could give  jimmy was satisfied to rest he was dull but he liked to see margaret break up the fire and carry about the plates she was very graceful and he knew her sympathetic but this was not all after the lonely bush the ranch kitchen lighted by the snapping flames was like home when supper was ready it cost him something of an effort to pull around his chair and then for a time he tried to conquer his savage appetite when one was opposite an attractive girl one did not eat like a wolf margaret knew the bush and smiled  isnt the food good i really think i can cook  my notion is the best hotel cook in canada could not serve a supper like yours  very well said margaret if you are polite you will annoy me what did you eat in the bush  salmon when i see a river i want to go the other way  oh said margaret you ate salmon now  when they began to float up on the stones we stopped jimmy replied  margaret was moved she knew the trackless bush sometimes was cruel and all who felt its lure did not return sometimes one crossing a creek lost a load of food and sometimes ones rifle jambed then if the march to the settlements were long one starved jimmy had not starved but he was worn and thin  the coffees very good may i have some more he resumed we used green tea because its light and goes far but i mustnt bother you about our housekeeping do you know if the police have brought back the game warden  they arrived some time since and put douglas on the cars a doctor went with him  then hes alive said jimmy with keen relief  he was badly hurt but that is all i know margaret replied nobody was allowed to see him she stopped and resumed with some hesitation mr stannards packers stated  jimmy gave her a steady glance it looks as if i shot douglas in the dark i thought him a deer you did not imagine i meant to hurt the man  i know you did not said margaret in a quiet voice  very well i must tell you all i know but ill wait until your father arrives perhaps hell see a fresh light sometimes im puzzled  you mustnt bother to talk said margaret turn your chair to the fire and take a smoke  jimmy pulled out his tobacco pouch and frowned margaret saw the pouch was flat and took a plug of tobacco from a shelf  wait a moment dont get up she said and began to cut the plug  for a few moments jimmy watched her with dull satisfaction she cut the tobacco in thin even slices jimmy had remarked before that all margaret did was properly done although it was nearly dark she had not got a light and red and yellow reflections from the logs played about the room sometimes her eyes and hair shone and her face stood out against a background of shadow jimmy thought the picture charming and when it melted he waited for the flames to leap again but by and by it got indistinct  give me your pouch said margaret and he tried to push it across  the pouch fell from the table and his pipe went down his head leaned to one side and found the chair rail and he knew nothing more  margaret heard his sigh and was quiet now sleep smoothed out the marks of strain and fatigue jimmys look was boyishly calm he moved her to pity but he moved her to trust margaret was not a raw romantic girl she knew the canadian cities and she had studied men if jimmy had indeed shot the agent a strange blunder accounted for his doing so but margaret doubted she had some grounds to think the shot anothers then she got up quietly and carried off the plates  some time afterwards jardine came in and seeing jimmy stopped and turned to margaret it was typical that he said nothing but his glance was keen margaret smiled and in a low voice narrated all she knew jardine nodded and sitting down waited until jimmys head slipped from the chair rail and the jerk woke him up he looked about as if he were puzzled and then said hello mr jardine i didnt understand your sitting opposite me i expect i was asleep  sure thing jardine agreed with a twinkle we have sortit the bit back room for ye and ye had better go to bed  im not going yet said jimmy i want a smoke but my tobaccos run out  margaret gave him his pouch and he smiled the tobaccos yours sir miss jardine is very kind well i reckoned on her kindness because i want to borrow a quantity of truck but well talk about this again do you know where stannard is  stannard and his daughter are at the hotel jardine replied and looked at jimmy rather hard maybe he feels he ought to stay until the police have settled who shot warden douglas  but stannard had nothing to do with it jimmy replied  he was leader o your party and in a way accountable maybe ye ken okanagan started for the bush soon after ye went  i didnt know said jimmy with some surprise bob claimed he hadnt a gun and i think he had not sometimes im puzzled but i really think the unlucky shot was mine  the packers allood it was yours although they werena sure how many shots they heard can ye locate the others stands  i tried afterwards in the evenings when we camped in the woods i speculated about the accident said jimmy and pulling out a few small objects arranged them to indicate the spots the sportsmen had occupied if you will imagine the tables the clearing bob posted us something like this well i expect the warden was going straight for my stand behind the stump  yere thinking aboot the bullet mark in front said jardine the packers telt me aboot it did ye see the other mark  i did not said jimmy with a shiver when we carried douglas to the house id had enough but i dont see where you lead  if the mark at the back was at the middle he was going straight for you weel ill take a smoke  he knitted his brows and for some minutes quietly studied jimmys plan of the clearing then he said its no as plain as it looks but the packers reckoned two o the police who went in with the doctor were pretty good bushmen we dinna ken what they think anyhow yere going to sleep and ought to go to bed  jimmy went and jardine resumed his study margaret left him alone in scotland her father was a poacher in the canadian woods his rifle supplied the ranch with meat one could trust his judgment about shooting by and by he looked up  if jimmy has fixed their stands right its possible he shot douglas and he reckons he did so thats something but he has a kind o notion he heard another shot weel the lads a tenderfoot maybe he was excited and did not hold straight  bob would not get excited and he can hit a jumping deer said margaret  jardine nodded meaningly ive thought aboot bob the warden was after him and he lit oot theres the puzzle for the police three o the party quit  mr deering went because he is jimmys friend said margaret  just that ye can trust the big fellow jardine agreed then if he was where jimmy puts him he didna shoot stannard stopped and it looks as if he had nothing to do wi it but i dinna ken stannards no a man ye can reckon up and a line from his stand would cut the wardens track  but the bullet mark  jardine smiled jimmy and maybe the trooper lad would think that fixed it but he didna look where the bullet cam oot i wonder if stannard looked  bob is accountable said margaret obstinately  verra weel bobs in the rocks are ye for tracking the man  by and by he must come down for food when he does come down well try to find him  bobs a good bushman jardine remarked i alloo the police will not hit his trail but maybe he will not bother to watch out for us he stopped and gave margaret a thoughtful look when he resumed bob would reckon to find out who shot douglas is no our job  the job is ours said margaret quietly but jardine thought the blood came to her skin she however got up and when she had put out the plates for breakfast went to bed  in the morning jardine gave jimmy boots and clothes and two days afterwards loaded him with all the supplies he would carry after breakfast jimmy strapped on his pack but when he was ready to go he hesitated the loghouse was warm and homelike and for two days he had rested and enjoyed margarets society now he must plunge into the wilds he frowned the snow was creeping down the rocks and a cold wind wailed in the dark pinetops then jimmy turned to his hosts and forced a smile  you have given me all i needed i knew you would see me out  sure thing said jardine in the bush your friends job is to see ye oot  you are useful friends jimmy replied with a touch of emotion all the same i feel i ought not to bother you i ought to start for the railroad and give myself up to the police if douglas was hurt by my carelessness i ought to pay  you mustnt go yet said margaret firmly you dont altogether know the carelessness was yours and perhaps it was not somehow i think we will find out  ah said jimmy if you do find out the shot wasnt mine but i doubt and the doubt weighs on me  margaret smiled and gave him her hand brace up and trust your luck stop in the mountains until we send for you perhaps we will send for you sooner than you think  jimmy went down the path and joined the waiting indian he was comforted and when he plunged into the woods his moodiness was gone margaret went back into the house and jardine said in a thoughtful voice ye kind o engaged yed send for the lad but until ye satisfy the police hes no their man he canna come back  that is so the thing is rather obvious margaret agreed and smiled however since i did engage to send for jimmy i must try to make good     xx  bobs denial   not long after jimmys visit to kelshope margaret one evening rode up the trail from the station her cayuse carried a load of groceries but when she set off her object was not altogether to bring home supplies wakening before daybreak she imagined she heard the fencerails rattle at the corner farthest from the house sometimes a deer jumped the fence and when margaret got up she went to the spot she saw no tracks but some time afterwards found a footmark where the trail left the clearing the mark was fresh and she thought it was not made by her fathers boot  margaret said nothing to jardine had a stranger come down the valley he would have kept the smooth path because in the dark the belt of slashing that generally surrounds a forest ranch is an awkward obstacle moreover to account for a strangers coming from the mountains was hard had jimmy returned he would have stopped at the house but bob would not and margaret had undertaken to find bob  when the vancouver train rolled into the station nobody got on board but a police trooper came from the agents office and going along the line looked into the cars margaret had not remarked him before the train stopped and thought his curiosity ominous if bob had stolen past the ranch he however had not tried to get on board and was hiding somewhere about margaret was puzzled and resolved to stop at the hotel and see stannard she admitted that her resolve was perhaps not logical because if stannard knew more about the shooting than others he would not enlighten her all the same she meant to see him  getting down where the wagon road went round to the front of the hotel she tied her horse to a tree and took a path across the hill the trees were thick but the moon was bright and in places its beams pierced the wood in front and some distance above her she saw illuminated windows at the top of the hotel then the terrace wall cut the reflection from the drawingroom and rotunda the high wall was in the gloom but at the bottom pools of silver light broke the dark shadow of the trees margaret knew the steps to the terrace had she gone to the front door she must have waited at the office until a page brought stannard and she thought she would sooner find him in the rotunda before he knew she was about  she heard music in the drawingroom and somebody on the terrace talking but the wall was high and when the music stopped all was quiet in the woods one lifts ones feet with mechanical caution and margaret was a ranchers daughter her advance was noiseless but at a bend of the path she stopped  a few yards off a man stood under a tree his back was to margaret but the dark object across his shoulder was a slung rifle and she thought she knew him stannard leaned against a trunk opposite he wore dinner dress and a loose light coat he was in the moonlight and when he shook his head margaret thought his smile ironical the others pose was stiff and his fist was clenched margaret put her hand in the pocket of her deerskin coat and then moved a branch the man turned and his hand went to his rifle margaret heard the sling rattle  you dont want your gun bob i know you besides ive got a pistol she said  bob swore softly and stannard lifted his hat  arent you rather theatrical miss jardine i imagined gun pulling was out of date  bobs theatrical but hes slow margaret rejoined and although her heart beat her voice was steady i havent yet pulled my gun  it looks as if you had better leave yours alone stannard remarked to bob  bobs face got very dark but stannard smiled  did you want to see me or the other miss jardine  i want to see bob first but you may remain said margaret and gave bob a searching glance who shot warden douglas  i did not anyhow bob replied fiercely i hadnt a gun and when id fixed the others i put out my lamp id no use for using the pitlight the fool plan was deerings  all the same you quit  i sure quit somebody shot douglas and the police knew hed got a pick on me theyd got to put the shooting on one of the gang  perhaps its important the police knew you had a pick on douglas stannard remarked  for all that i didnt use my gun bob rejoined  margaret pondered as a rule bob was marked by a rather sinister quietness but now he talked with something like passion he had stepped forward and a moonbeam touched his face margaret thought he knew but he did not move out of the light somehow she felt she must believe his statement then stannard turned to her  perhaps its strange but i rather think he speaks the truth  if you did not use your gun who did shoot douglas margaret resumed looking at bob i want to know a troopers watching the station and if i shout the hotel clerk will call him on the phone  bobs passion vanished and margaret thought his calm ominous  thats another thing looks as if jimmy plugged the fellow he sort of allowed he done it and he started for the rocks  i imagine bob doesnt know said stannard before you arrived he implied that i was accountable and demanded a hundred dollars in fact when he didnt get the sum he was much annoyed  i was mad all right bob agreed my flour and teas gone and i cant hire up about the settlements but if id a hundred dollars id try to make the coast he looked hard at stannard and resumed are you going to help me get off  certainly not said stannard in a careless voice i am not as rich as you think and to give you money would be rash particularly when miss jardine is about  margaret pulled out her wallet i can give you ten dollars bob but i can shout to the people at the hotel you know mr leyland did not shoot douglas  i sure dont know said bob and gave margaret a haughty glance put up your wad ive no use for your money if you like shout for them to phone the police  for a moment or two margaret hesitated she was persuaded bob himself was not accountable but she thought this was all she would know she was hurt and humiliated for now she had found bob she had not helped jimmy much  shall i shout she asked stannard  to choose is your part i rather think dillon is on the terrace and two or three athletic young sportsmen are at the hotel but unless you are willing to use your gun i doubt if bob would wait until the others arrive then although i dont know where jimmy is perhaps for the police to search the neighborhood would have some drawbacks  margaret turned to bob get off if you come back ill send the troopers after you  bob went and when he vanished in the gloom stannard laughed i expect your arrival disturbed the fellow at the beginning he tried to force me to give him my wallet then he took another line and hinted that leyland was the guilty man well he has gone will you come back with me and talk to laura  margaret noted that he was not curious about her object for stopping at the hotel but she said i wanted to see you what do you know about the accident  i really dont know much although i am persuaded accident is the proper word jimmy thought the unlucky shot was his and when he resolved to go off i agreed  but you knew what the police would think about his running away  that is so said stannard coolly all the same jimmy was with me when i killed the bighorn and when douglas found us at the old ranch we were using pitlights one of our party shot him and since we were again poaching it hardly looked as if the shot were accidental jimmy is young and when he saw the risk he ran he was afraid i thought he did run some risk but if he could cheat the police for a time we might find a clue to the puzzle  margaret remarked his frankness although she thought he did not know jimmy had stopped at the ranch his arguments were the arguments jimmy stated he had used moreover she admitted the arguments carried some weight  we have not yet found a clue she said drearily still if the warden gets better do you know where he is  for a moment or two stannard was quiet then he said we can get no news about douglas and perhaps we ought not to expect much from his narrative when you use a pitlamp your hatbrim shades your face and i imagine all douglas saw was the light yet the polices reserve is strange  perhaps they know something we do not said margaret well my father is waiting and i must not stop  she went off and stannard went up the steps to the hotel in a corner of the veranda dillon talked to laura and stannard remarked the smile she gave the young man stannard knitted his brows and did not stop in some respects the marriage would be good but it was not the marriage he had wanted laura to make all the same jimmy was obviously satisfied with the bush girl and stannard thought she loved him well he had done with jimmy  when margaret got down at the ranch she went to the kitchen and sat by the fire for a time she said nothing and jardine quietly smoked his pipe then she looked up with a frown  i found bob she said he was talking to mr stannard outside the hotel  in the trees im thinking did he tell ye much  he declared when they used the pitlights he had not a gun and somehow i think he hadnt  maybe said jardine with some dryness was it all ye got  that was all im not as clever as i thought bob wanted mr stannard to give him a hundred dollars  ah said jardine weel i expect ye see  stannard laughed it was plain he was not at all afraid of bob  stannards no a fool jardine remarked  i thought his carelessness sincere besides bob soon afterwards implied that jimmy hit douglas i imagine bob really doesnt know who did use his gun  its possible jardine agreed my notion is jimmy had better keep the woods in the meantime ive no use for bobs hanging round the ranch  bob will not bother us i dont think hell bother mr stannard again said margaret and got some sewing     xxi  deerings excursion   rain beat the bark roof and heavy drops splashed on the floor sometimes a gust of wind swept the window opening and smoke blew about but on the whole the shack was dry and warm jimmy thought they had made a good job and sitting by the fire he tranquilly smoked his pipe the indian opposite him plaited a snare deering studied a card problem in an old newspaper  the games pretty good but i soon got on to it he said when you locate the bower come across and ill show you  no thanks said jimmy smiling to know where the bower is is useful but sometimes you dont know and a tenspot knocks you out things are like that anyhow ive not much use for cards  you were keen i reckon your keenness cost you something  jimmy nodded that is so but i really think i wanted to satisfy my curiosity i wanted the thrills others seemed to get and i experimented with cards and two or three expensive sports now i feel id sooner build a shack than win a pot of money on a firstclass race the strange thing is when i was at the cotton mill and dick wanted me to study the machinery i was bored  i expect he tried to force you deering remarked when one is young one doesnt study the things others think one ought he frowned and jerked his head another blamed big drop on the back of my neck  when the rain stops ill mend the roof said jimmy the shacks a pretty good shack and two or three slabs of bark will cure the leak then i must get some green clay and flat stones for the chimney  you talk as if you meant to remain in the rocks  it looks as if i might have to stay for some time  deering shook his head in a proper cold snap you want double windows but we have got a hole then ive not much use for a blanket door when the frost begins we have got to quit  but where can we go  i dont know yet i have thought about your ranch jardine stated the police had searched it and i reckon they wont come back however well talk about this again i think miss jardine gave you a needle and thread  jimmy said margaret had done so and inquired why deering wanted the thread  we cant get out and i guess ill sew my clothes for you in the morning im going to use jardines  but why jimmy began  deering indicated his torn shootingjacket ragged knickerbockers and soilstained puttees  i must start for vancouver to look up a fellow who has got some money of mine then i want to find out if the police have cured douglas and what they are doing if i wore my clothes people would speculate about the deadbroke sporting guy  jardines clothes are not very good ive worn them for some time in the bush then i expect youll find them tight  theyre a ranchers clothes and i dont mind looking like a bushman in fact until i make vancouver the part will go all right  jimmy knitted his brows perhaps he had thought too much for himself but he owned he did not want deering to leave him  well he said i mustnt grumble but will you be long  when ive fixed my business and found out something useful ill come right back deering replied and threading the needle began to sew i was raised in the bush and the small homesteaders are a pretty frugal lot they dont throw away their old clothes  when you reach the settlements wont you run some risk jimmy inquired  i expect the risk will not be altogether mine so far as i know the police are not looking for me the trouble is i might put them on your track but so long as im steering for the coast this neednt bother us i dont want them to hit my trail when im coming back well im pretty big to hide but if they are after me theyll watch out for a city sport not a bushman  in the morning deering started and after a strenuous journey reached a small station some distance from the hotel he did not buy his ticket from the agent the conductor would supply him and when the long train rolled in he got aboard the porter was making up the secondclass berths and when deering got his he went to bed so far his luck was good but after he had slept for five or six hours he began to doubt  a savage jolt threw him against the curtain and the thin material tore from the rings deering went through but came down like a cat on the floor the brakes jarred and startled passengers ran about for the most part they did not wear their proper clothes but when deering went to bed he wore all his and he pushed through a group that blocked the vestibule the train stopped and from the platform he saw a leaping pillar of flame and reflections on rocks and trees the white beam from the locomotive headlamp melted in the strong illumination and moving figures cut the dark background the picture was distinct and vivid like a scene from a film until a cloud of steam rolled across the light and all was blurred  deering heard hammers and the clang of rails a construction gang was obviously at work and he imagined a trestle had broken or perhaps another train had jumped the track when he waited at the station he had not tried to hide himself to do so was risky since he imagined the police had warned the agent to study the passengers if the agent had remarked him the delay would be awkward and he wondered whether the telegraph wires were broken  jumping down he went along the track and stopped in the strong light a blastlamp threw across a gap the roadbed was gone and a great bank of stones and snow rested on the hillside bent rails slanted into the hole and a broken telegraph pole hung by the tangled wires shovels rattled and a gang of men threw down soil and stones deering stopped one  how long is it since the landslide cut the track  about two hours since we got the call  then they rushed you up pretty quick i expect you got the call by wire  the other indicated the broken post wires went when the track went the section man came for us on a trolley were grading for a new bridge a few miles down the line  are you going to be long filling her up  three or four hours i reckon the boys are loading up the gravel train but if the boss spots me talking ill get fired  deering pondered if the agent had been warned to look out for him the fellow had had time to telegraph before the wires broke and the police could arrange to watch the stations or put a trooper on board the train deering did not think they had a warrant for his arrest but they would try to use him in order to get on jimmys track there was not much use in leaving the train because he would be spotted when he boarded another he resolved to go back to his berth and soon after he did so he went to sleep  in the morning the train started deering got a good breakfast at a meal station and afterwards occupied a corner of a smoking compartment sleep and food had refreshed him and his mood was cheerful he admitted he was perhaps ridiculous but he had begun to enjoy his excursion deering was marked by a vein of rather boyish humor and to cheat the police amused him by and by he speculated about his object for going after jimmy when the warden was shot  jimmy had plunged into the gully sooner than let him go but perhaps this did not account for all stannard had urged jimmy to push for the plains although stannard ought to know the lad could not cross the mountains then he had indicated a line over the neck and deering had stopped jimmy at the top of a pitch that dropped to a horrible crevasse the thing was strange and sinister but jimmy trusted stannard deering did not he was intrigued and felt he ought to see jimmy out  after a time a police trooper came from the vestibule and stopped for a moment at the door of the smoking compartment his glance rested carelessly on deering and then he went through into the car at the next station the policeman got down and went to the office when the train started deering did not see him get on board but people moved about and the end cars were behind the water tank  in the afternoon when he leaned back half asleep in his corner the trooper came in again deering did not move but his eyes were not altogether shut and he saw the fellows glance was keen and fixed in a moment or two the trooper turned his head and going into the vestibule did not shut the door quietly deerings curiosity was satisfied the police knew he was on board  lighting his pipe he looked out of the window the train was speeding down the lower fraser valley orchards fields with white snakefences and wooden homesteads rolled by the sun was near the hilltops and the shadows of the pines were long when they reached vancouver it would be dark and the troopers duties would be undertaken by the municipal police the royal northwest had nothing to do with the britishcolumbian cities their business was in the wilds  deering pulled out his watch a short distance from vancouver they would stop at a junction where a line for washington state branched off but his business was not in washington  fast steamers sailed from vancouver for the ports on puget sound and since the police would expect him to go on board he thought he saw a plan some time after dark he went to the platform in front of the car a halfmoon shone between slowmoving clouds and he saw vague hills and sparkling water then the lights of anchored steamers began to twinkle and sawmill chimney stacks cut the sky lights in rows and clusters marked the front of a low hill the cars rolled along the waterside and presently stacks of lumber blocked the view then the whistle screamed the brakes jarred and the passengers began to push out from the vestibule  deering jumped down and looked about freight cars occupied the tracks and the dazzling beam from a locomotives headlamp touched piles of goods and hurrying people round the tall electric standards were pools of light but smoke and steam blew about the wharf and where the strong illumination was cut off all was dark bells tolled wheels rattled and the clang of the steamers winches pierced the din her double row of passenger decks towered above the wharf and deering joined the crowd at the slanted gangway he was willing for the city police to see him board the steamer  at the top of the gangway a steward indicated the way to the secondclass deck but deering pushed by and went to the saloon since he was playing a bush ranchers part the police would expect him to travel second class and he must for a few minutes put them off his track as soon as the luggage was on board the boat would start  for the most part the people were on deck and the spacious saloon was quiet deering thought he did not look like a firstclass passenger his hair was long his hat was battered and jardines rather ragged clothes were tight on his big body searching the room with a keen glance he stopped for a group of three people occupied a seat at the other end he wondered whether he ought to steal off but dillon jumped up  why its deering he exclaimed  laura started and her companion turned deering imagined the lady was mrs dillon and he crossed the floor dillons surprise was obvious but he gave deering his hand  we have been bothered about you for some time and it looks as if you had got up against it but wheres jimmy  jimmys at the shack we built in the rocks what about the warden  we can get no news i imagine the police are hiding the fellow  why did you leave jimmy laura interrupted and deering saw she did not altogether trust him has he food and proper clothes if he is in trouble we must try to help  that is so said dillon if jimmy wants me ill get off the boat  jimmys clothes are worse than mine but he doesnt particularly want your help i pulled out because i must transact some business and ive pretty good grounds to imagine the police are on my track  i expect well sail in a few minutes said dillon do you think the police know you got on board  deering glanced at the others he thought laura imagined he had meant to join them and she was not yet satisfied mrs dillon was frankly annoyed  so long as they dont know i got off again its not important he replied  are you going to get off  certainly said deering and turned to laura with a twinkle the trick is not remarkably fresh but since the police reckon im bound for the united states it ought to work you see jimmys my friend and when ive put across my business im going back  laura gave him her hand i didnt knowi wish you luck when you think we can help you must send us a letter  the whistle blew a bell rang and people began to enter the saloon  thank you miss stannard said deering and crossed the floor  he went along an alley and through the secondclass saloon to the deck in front the steamers bows were in the gloom and a number of wharfhands hurried down a plank deering joined the row and followed the men to a cargo shed the shed was dark but the sliding doors on the other side were open and he crawled under a freight car and crossed the track a minute or two afterwards he stopped so far as he could see nobody but a few trainhands were about the steamer had swung away from the wharf and was steering for the narrows deering laughed and went up the hill behind the waterfront     xxii  deering takes counsel   a canadian hotel is something of an inexpensive club people who sleep elsewhere come for meals and a number come to smoke and talk in western towns their manners and clothes are marked by sharp contrasts but so long as they observe a few primitive rules nobody inquires if they are customers of the house  in consequence when deering stopped in front of an ambitious building he was not at all embarrassed the noise he heard indicated that the rotunda was occupied but while some of its occupants were no doubt important citizens he expected to find lumbermen and miners from the bush whose clothes were like his pushing round the revolving doors he went in waited until he saw the clerk was engaged and then went upstairs a noisy electric elevator was running but deering thought he would not bother the boy  on the second landing he opened a door an electric lamp threw a strong light about the room and a gentleman leaned back in a hardwood chair and rested his feet on the ornamental radiator he was dressed like a prosperous citizen and he gave deering a keen glance  hello he said have you been in the woods  looks like that said deering i want a razor and a bath then i want a suit of clothes the biggest standard size i doubt if the clerk and bellboys saw a bushman come up but if they did so id sooner they didnt see him come down  i can fix you said the other smiling all the same i expect you must get a barber to finish the job  when deering used a glass he admitted that his friends remark was justified but so long as he looked like a wild man from the woods to recline wrapped in a white sheet in a barbers front window had obvious drawbacks as a rule a north american barber carries on his occupation as publicly as possible he got a bath and when he returned to his friends room neilson gave him a cigar and they began to talk  very well said neilson i can get the money for you and will soon fix up the other matters i have sent for some clothes and booked your room but you look as if youd hit some adventures in the woods and id rather like to know  perhaps you noted something in the newspapers about a gamewardens getting shot  the colonist printed a short paragraph i imagined the police edited the story old man salter knows his job although the shooting was on the royal northwests ground anyhow the tale left you to guess but were you in it  sure thing said deering dryly ill tell you  when he finished his narrative neilson knitted his brows he was frankly an adventurer but he had his code and deering trusted the fellow moreover neilson knew men and particularly men who lived by exploiting others weaknesses  im not a hunter well cut out the shooting and concentrate on the gang he said i want to get stannard right his occupations ours  something like ours deering agreed we play a straight game because we know a straight game pays ive spotted stannard using a crooks cheap trick but he doesnt bet high at cards his lines financing extravagant young suckers  then hes rich  i think not not long since he wanted money my notion is hes got a partner in the old country who supplies him stannards something of a highbrow and a smart clubman he has qualities i rather like the fellow although i know him  what about the girl does stannard use her  not at all said deering miss lauras straight i doubt if she really knows her fathers occupation maybe shes ambitious and calculating but shes not his sort  is leyland much in stannards debt  stannards an expensive friend but i guess he wanted jimmy for laura and didnt take all he might still i expect jimmy owes a useful sum and lauras going to marry dillon  ah said neilson perhaps thats important i reckon stannard has got leyland insured  deering nodded he saw where neilsons remarks led and on the whole agreed he had given the fellow his confidence because he wanted to see the arguments another would use  well resumed neilson what about dillon and your guide  dillon was not in the woods i dont know much about the guide bobs a queer fellow and is not all white then he has a pick on jimmy i reckon he took a shine to the ranchers daughter who is now jimmys girl  jealousy bites hard and i wouldnt trust a breed neilson remarked well perhaps we have got bobs object lets study stannards leylands wanting the ranch girl wasnt in his plan and when he knew miss stannard meant to marry dillon hed make another leyland owes him much cant pay yet and is insured let it go in the meantime and weigh another thing leyland doesnt altogether know if he shot the warden but if he did shoot him he thought him a deer all the same he pulled out is the boy a fool is his nerve weak  jimmys clean grit said deering still he is a boy  then its possible he got rattled suppose when he was rattled an older man he trusted put it up to him that he ought to light out the kid wouldnt ponder hed start  that is so said deering stannard did talk like that  neilson shrugged meaningly very well im through with my argument if we could find warden douglas he might tell us something useful ill try  deering thought the plan good neilson was a gambler but his word went in fact deering imagined it sometimes went with the police neilson knew the halfworld and now that he had undertaken an awkward job strange helpers would be put to work  when he had lighted a fresh cigar he resumed i dont see your object for hiding in the woods  sometimes im romantic you dont know me yet deering said and laughed jimmys my pal when i came near getting a fall that would have knocked me out he held me up then i was born a bushman and the bush calls i like it in the woods and im keen about the detective game he stopped and went on in a thoughtful voice the strange thing is when jimmy went over the rocks stannard went after him snow and stones were coming down but he stayed with the kid  that was when it looked as if miss stannard would marry your pal said neilson meaningly well i wouldnt bother about the police watch out for stannard  somebody knocked at the door and neilson getting up came back with a parcel  your clothes he said  deering put on the clothes and packed up jardines to be thrown into the harbor for a few days he stopped at the hotel and then neilson admitted that his inquiries about douglas had not carried him far  we know where he is and hes very sick but thats all he said the police mean to use him and he cant be got at  then ill start for the woods said deering the trouble is to hit the proper line its possible the police are willing to leave me alone but i mustnt help them get on to jimmy  in the morning he started for new westminster although this was not the line to the mountains at westminster he vanished in the meadows along the fraser and after a time turned north into the woods in order to rejoin jimmy he must follow the great river gorge and at mission he risked getting on board the cars nobody bothered him and at length he labored one evening up the rugged valley in which was the shack he had bought a skin coat and carried a heavy pack but he was not warm the sky was dark and threatening the ground was hard and a bitter wind shook the tops of the stiff pines deering thought snow was coming and pushed on as fast as possible until he saw a gleam of light  a big fire threw a cheerful glow about the shack and jimmy occupied a pile of branches by the snapping logs he had pulled a blanket over his shoulders but when he heard deerings step he jumped up deering dropped his load straightened his back and looked about  wheres the indian  hes gone said jimmy i expect he had enough in fact id begun to feel id had enough and when i heard your step my relief was pretty keen  oh well said deering lets get supper and then well talk  when he had satisfied his appetite he narrated his adventures and his meeting laura and dillon  if you want frank hes your man and he might be useful he remarked then i reckon miss lauras willing for him to help your friends are good  that is so said jimmy looking at deering hard my friends are better than i deserve but what about douglas did you find out much  deering admitted that he did not but when he talked about neilson he used some caution since jimmy trusted stannard there was no use in trying to warn him some time he would get enlightenment  on the whole i think the police knew i was at vancouver he said their plan was to hit my trail when i started back i dont expect they did so but its possible anyhow now the indians gone and a cold snap threatens we have got to quit my plans to start for your ranch  the ranch is not far from the railroad  its being near the track has some advantages since the police searched the spot i guess theyre satisfied then we want food and packing supplies for a long distance is a strenuous job the indian could move a useful load but to carry fifty pounds across rocks and fallen trees makes me tired  a rifle a blanket and twenty pounds is my load said jimmy and resumed in a thoughtful voice yet i started for the plains  deering used some control and let jimmys remark go  you could not have made it he said quietly but what about our jumping off  well talk about it again jimmy replied i suppose we must go but now youre back i dont want to bother you brace me up until i heard your step i felt down and out  he threw fresh wood on the fire and soon afterwards they went to sleep jimmys sleep was broken and when he woke at daybreak he shivered he did not want to get up but he must fetch water the kettle handle stung his skin the pools on the creek were frozen and he saw the snow had moved five or six hundred feet down the rocks rosepink light touched the high peaks and hoar frost sparkled on the pines but the stern beauty of the wilds was daunting jimmy wanted the deep valleys up which the soft chinook blew  when he went back deering was occupied at the fire he looked up and remarked with a twinkle the cold is pretty fierce if were going to stay youll want a skin coat and another blanket  when we have got breakfast well start for the ranch jimmy replied     xxiii  margaret takes a plunge   for a time jimmy was not disturbed at the ranch on the high rocks the frost was keen but in the deep valley a gentle wind from the pacific melted the snow jimmy dared not order sawed lumber but jardine got him a door and windows and the house was warm sometimes he went shooting and sometimes he went to kelshope jardine was friendly but when the rancher had gone to look after his stock jimmy was resigned to sit by the fire and talk to margaret was a delightful occupation  at the beginning he had remarked her beauty but now he knew beauty was not all her charm margaret was clever she saw his point of view and when she did not agree her argument was logical and keen then she was proud and fearless and he sensed in her something primitive margaret was his sort and sprang from stock like his yet he felt her physical charm her eyes were seablue and in the firelight her hair was like red california gold she had a bushmans balance and her unconscious pose was greek although she was frank with something of a great ladys frankness jimmy soon knew her fastidious  but for his part in the shooting accident his satisfaction would have been complete it looked as if the police had resolved to leave him alone and deering had made one or two excursions to the cities but jimmy doubted he knew the royal northwest do not forget moreover somebody shot douglas and on the whole he thought he had done so sometimes he wondered whether he ought to go to kelshope but all the same he went  when deering was at calgary margaret one afternoon rode home from the station as fast as possible at the ranch she took down the load of groceries but left the horse tied to a post jardine was by the fire and had pulled off his boot in the morning he had cut his foot with his ax he gave margaret a keen glance and saw she had ridden fast  weel he said is something bothering ye  two troopers and their horses came in on the freight train i expect theyre looking for mr leyland  ah said jardine somebody has given the lad away  bob said margaret and her eyes sparkled  jardine knitted his brows maybe but i dinna ken bob hasna been around for long did the troopers saddle up  when i left they were cinching on their camp truck i thought theyd soon start mr leyland cant come down the valley and deerings not with him where is he to go  if he could make green lake peter would put him on the mission trail  he cannot make green lake margaret rejoined he doesnt know the bench country and must start in the dark  jimmy must start soon if he stays the troopers will get him jardine agreed and indicated his cut foot somebody must warn the lad but i canna gang  margaret tried to brace up for she had not reckoned on her fathers lameness the strange thing was jardine had walked some distance to round up his cattle she must however weigh this again speed was important and jimmy was her friend in fact she had begun to think him her lover  you could ride the cayuse and carry the packs if mr leyland was not loaded he could make a good pace  the cayuse wouldna carry a weight like mine across the bench belt and green lakes a twodays hike i canna walk i doubt if i could get on my boot jardine replied and added with philosophical resignation its a pity o the lad i expect the police are noo on the ranch trail but i dinna see how we can help  margaret clenched her hands somebody must warn jimmy and her father declared he could not she looked at him hard and knew he could not be moved he gave her an apologetic glance and began to fill his pipe as if the thing was done with yet it was not done with margaret saw rather vaguely because she refused to think about it all her going to warn jimmy implied since if her help was to be useful she must go with him to green lake for a few moments she hesitated but she was generous and her pluck was good then she turned to jardine who had begun to smoke  the police shall not get mr leyland i will go  verra weel said jardine if ye mean to gang ye had better start yell need to take some food ill get the saddle bag  he crossed the floor and margaret remarked that for a few steps he went lightly as if his foot did not hurt then he limped and when he got to the door he stopped and leaned against the post all the same it was not important and margaret began to pack some food and clothes ten minutes afterwards she untied the horse and gave jardine her hand  goodbye she said in a quiet voice i dont know when i shall get back  jardine held the stirrup she seized the bridle set her mouth and started the horse when she vanished in the woods jardine went back to the house rested his foot on a chair and knitted his brows he saw he ran some risk but he knew his daughter and thought he knew jimmy jimmy was a white man jardine so to speak bet all he had on that  some time afterwards jimmy cooking his supper heard a horses feet and went to the door he smiled because he thought he knew the horse but margaret was obviously riding fast and snapping branches indicated that she had cut out a bend of the trail when she got down her color was high and the horses coat was white  roll up your blanket and put the sling on your rifle she said then ill help you pack some food  jimmy studied her with surprise her look was resolute but he got a hint of embarrassment then he saw a light  ah he said the police are on my track  two troopers are riding up the valley they may stop at kelshope for a few minutes where do you keep your groceries  jimmy opened a box and margaret picked out a number of articles now make a pack because you must start at once for my cousins at green lake i expect peter will help you south  but i dont know the trail and it will soon be dark  make your pack the police will arrive in a few minutes margaret rejoined impatiently and turned her head there is not a trail i am going with you  no said jimmy with some embarrassment youre kind of course but you ought to see if you start me off i expect i can find my way  margaret turned and fronted him the blood came to her skin and her look was strained  you cant find the way and i cant go back the police know im not at the ranch and if i start for home ill meet them in the valley but we mustnt talk we must get off  jimmy leaned against the table and frowned although his heart beat he hesitated he knew margarets pluck and he loved her but she must not pay for her rash generosity one must think for the girl one loved  suppose the police do know you warned me its awkward but perhaps thats all anyhow ill go down and meet them since i expect i shot warden douglas i must bear the consequences  oh but you are obstinate margaret exclaimed and used stannards argument it looks as if one of your party meant to shoot douglas and the police have not caught the man they must catch somebody and theyll try to fix the shooting on you to join the chaingang would be horrible  the thing has not much charm jimmy agreed and was rather surprised by his coolness but he was cool i dont know much about the police code but i rather think theyd stop at  he heard a noise and margaret turned  i put up the rails she said in a sharp voice  jimmy went to the window and saw a mounted policeman pull down the sliprails at the fence and ride through the gap then he heard a quick step and looked round margaret had got his rifle the butt was at her shoulder and the barrel rested against the doorpost jimmy saw her face in profile her mouth was set tight her glance was fixed and hard he jumped for the door but struck a chair and the collision stopped him the rifle jerked and a little smoke floated about the girl  when jimmy reached the door he saw the policemans horse stumble the trooper leaned back tried to pull his foot from the stirrup and fell with the animal jimmy thought it rolled on him but after a few moments he crawled away from its hoofs the horse was quiet and the man got up his movements were awkward and he looked dully at the house  margaret pushed jimmy back and put the rifle to her shoulder a sharp report rolled across the clearing twigs fell from a quivering pine branch and the trooper vanished in the woods jimmys hands shook but his relief was keen  i expect his rifles in the bucket under the horse and the horse is dead margaret remarked i was forced to shoot  ah said jimmy hoarsely i thought you had hit the man  margarets pose was stiff as if she braced herself but she smiled  he knows i shoot straight until his partner comes and helps him get his rifle hell stop in the woods  but perhaps the others not far off  hes at the ranch said margaret hed stop to see if you were about and try to find out something from father father would keep him as long as possible she stopped and turning her head resumed but the first fellow knows a woman shot his horse when i put up the rifle he was riding for the door  i expect that is so said jimmy after all you must go to your cousins lets start  margaret said nothing when jimmy brought her horse she got up and he ran by her stirrup for a time she went up the valley and then turning back obliquely through thin timber pushed up a steep hill near the top she stopped and jimmy got his breath and looked down across the trees dusk was falling and all was very quiet gloom had invaded the clearing but he saw a small dark object he knew was the policemans horse a thin plume of smoke went up from his house his fire was burning and he wondered when it would burn again for a few moments he was moved by a strange melancholy and then his heart beat  i hate to go away if you were not with me i think id stay and risk it all he said i was happy at the ranch in fact i soon began to see i hadnt known real happiness before at the beginning i was puzzled but now i can account for it you were at kelshope  not long since you didnt want me to go with you margaret remarked  oh well said jimmy with some awkwardness you hadnt yet shot the policemans horse  margaret said nothing and he seized the bridle pulled round the cayuse and forced her to look down  will you marry me at the mission margaret  she met his glance and hers was proud i think not jimmy you are a white man and mean to take the proper line but i will not marry you because i stopped the trooper  jimmy threw back his head and she liked his frank scornful laugh now youre altogether ridiculous your stopping the fellow does not account for my wanting to marry you soon after i got to work at the ranch i knew i loved you but i went to the mountains with stannard and the trouble began so long as the police were hunting for me i dared not urge you  but now you urge me it looks as if your scruples had vanished  jimmy let go the bridle and bent his head i suppose it does look like that all the same i love you  margaret leaned down and touched him gently you keep your rules and your rules are good perhaps its strange but i think a woman will break conventions where a man will not still you see im proud  you are very hard jimmy rejoined yet you ran some risk to warn me i know your pluck but if you had not loved me i think youd have stayed at kelshope  well let it go said margaret in a quiet voice theres another thing ranching is a game for you but its my proper work yours is at the cotton mill youre rich and your wife must be clever and cultivated  i havent known a girl with talents grace and beauty like yours jimmy declared then im not rich yet the police are on my track and i may soon be a prisoner he looked up and added in a dreary voice i admit its not much of an argument for your marrying me  margaret smiled perhaps you were not logical but well talk about it again when we get to green lake you mustnt talk now i dont know if the trooper would stop long at the ranch and we must cross the hill before the moon is up  she started her horse and they pushed on an hour afterwards the moon rose from behind a broken range and silver light touched the stiff dark pines the high peaks sparkled a glacier glimmered in the rocks and the mists curling up from the valley were faintly luminous jimmy smelt sweet resinous smells and heard a distant river throb the landscape was strangely beautiful but its beauty was austere all was keen and cold and bracing and jimmy walking by margarets bridle thought her charm was the charm of the stern and quiet north     xxiv  jimmy resigns himself   the morning was calm and jimmy walking by margarets horse turned his head faint sweet notes stole across the rocks and he knew the distant chime of cowbells as a rule the elfin music moved him where the cowbells rang cornfields and orchards advanced up the valleys and man drove back the forest but jimmys satisfaction was blunted for two days margaret and he had pushed through the quiet woods in the cold evenings they had talked by the snapping fire but now the romantic journey was near its end  after a few minutes margaret stopped the horse in front dark pines rolled up the hill and the long rows of ragged tops looked like the waves of an advancing tide that broke against the rocks across the valley the sun touched the snow and at the bottom of a broken slope a lake sparkled jimmy saw its surface rippled for a chinook wind blew and the frost was gone near the end of the lake a plume of smoke streaked the trees  green lake ranch said margaret  for a few moments jimmy was quiet when they reached the valley he thought the strange charm he had felt in the mountains would vanish it was too fine and elusive for him to recapture until they started for green lake he had not known margaret cleverer than himself at woodcraft she had a mans strength and pluck she did not grumble she was frank and not embarrassed yet a womanly gentleness marked her and she did not think for herself although her touch was light jimmy had felt her control and took the line she meant him to take in the meantime they were not lovers but partners in romantic adventure  for your sake im glad well soon reach your cousins house he said i dont know if im glad for mine  margaret smiled but gently shook her head you must play up jimmy  i have played up perhaps its strange but in the woods to be content because we were pals was not hard now well soon reach your cousins im not content and one is forced to think  for a time you must think about beating the police thats all said margaret firmly  it is not all jimmy declared when we went up the hill in the evening i asked you to marry me and you promised  i promised we would talk about it said margaret before you start from peters we will do so but since you must start soon well go on  jimmy saw he could not move her and they went down the hill at the ranch fence a man met them and took them to the house when they went in a woman got up kissed margaret and gave jimmy a smile so far as he could see mrs jardine and her husband did not think it strange he had arrived with margaret and he was somewhat comforted although he noted that margarets color rose margaret knew her relations they were primitive honest folk and took it for granted jimmy was her lover  sit right down dinner will soon be ready said peter jardine hows the old man give us your news  jimmy narrated his and margarets adventures and until he stopped his hosts said nothing it did not look as if they were disturbed but they were bush folk and the bush is quiet for all that jimmy felt they owned themselves margarets relations and for her sake were willing to help him out  the trappers old shack is the spot for you peter remarked after dinner well start margaret must stay with us  margaret agreed but jimmy objected  margaret is going with me to the mission the police will soon arrive  i reckon they dont know her and they dont know how many womenfolk ive got when she puts on sadies clothes shell look as if she belonged to the ranch maybe the police havent found your trail but we mustnt bet on that  margaret went off with sadie and jimmy speculated about their talk by and by he turned to his host  im going to marry your cousin when she is willing  sure said peter you reckoned to get married at the mission  that is so so far margaret refuses  peter knitted his brows sometimes i dont see what sadie gets after and i sure cant calculate margarets notion women beat me all the same its plain she thinks you a white man and margarets not a fool now well let it go say did you plug the warden  it looks like that jimmy replied however if i did hit the fellow i didnt know i was shooting at a man  very well you cant get down the main track to the coast because the police will reckon on your going there and watch the stations id make for the plains and then shove south for montana  that was stannards plan  peter smiled scornfully you were to cross the rocks and carry your grub and camping truck shucks an oldtime prospector might make it you could not youve got to lie up at the trappers shack until we look about maybe we can fix it to ship you out of the mountains on board a construction train that sometimes runs down to a station on the calgary side well lets make our packs and catch the horse  they got to work and after the horse was caught peter turned back to the house but jimmy stopped i must talk to margaret for a few minutes he said  margaret came out to him her look was quiet but he knew her resolute  when dinners over peter and i must start he said you refused to go to the mission i want to know what this implies  margaret gave him a level glance isnt it plain jimmy you know my father and now you have met my relations they are not your sort  so far as i know theyre a remarkably good sort jimmy rejoined besides in a way i am their sort my grandfather was a mill hand my father borrowed a small sum and started with cheap machinery to spin cotton at a little oldfashioned mill he was frugal and laborious in fact he prospered because he had your bushmans qualities i have loafed and squandered but after a time i felt id had enough and began to see id inherited something from the people who made leylands go then if we must talk about our relations you dont know my uncle dick well ive stated something like this before but its my reply to your argument  but you mean to go back to lancashire and when you marry your wife ought  to begin with i doubt if the police will allow me to go back then if i cant get you i dont want a wife  yet not very long since it looked as if you might be satisfied with miss stannard  the blood came to jimmys skin and to conquer his embarrassment was hard  i dont think youre kind well im young and until i met stannard i was very raw all i knew was the cotton mill and i expect laura carried me away but i was not altogether a fool laura stannard is a charming girl the obstacle was she saw i was not the man for her then i did not know you  margaret smiled but her smile was gentle perhaps i was not kind youre stanch and my experiment was shabby  your remark was justified anyhow its not important if i can cheat the police and get back to lancashire will you marry me margaret  for a few moments margaret was quiet then she said in a steady voice your cheating the police would not persuade me in fact somehow i think they will find out you had nothing to do with the wardens getting shot the obstacles not there you are young jimmy and you admitted you were carried away  one cannot carry you away jimmy rejoined  i must think for you and for myself said margaret and jimmys heart beat because he saw her calm was forced suppose your trustees did not approve your marrying a girl from the bush  dick leyland might not approve his habits to be nasty but mines not to bother about dick sir jim is head of the house and hes human i cant picture his not being altogether satisfied with you  but you dont know  jimmy pondered margarets firmness baffled him but from her point of view he saw she took the proper line all the same it cost her something she was highly strung her color came and went and her tight mouth was significant the trouble was he dared not urge her very hard in the meantime he must hide from the police and might be sent to the chaingang  i want you my dear he said im selfish if you marry me i run no risk but you may run some my drawbacks are rather numerous particularly just now  very well said margaret when you come back from the mountains i may perhaps agree but your relations must approve and i dont yet engage  jimmy advanced but she stepped back and stopped him then he turned and saw mrs jardine wave to them from the stoop  dinner was a melancholy function and jimmy thought his hosts disturbed they were margarets relations and for her sake were willing to help but he pictured mrs jardines weighing the risk then he was bothered about margaret for peters confidence that his wife could bluff the police if they arrived before he returned did not banish his doubts  at length mrs jardine got up and peter and jimmy went to load the horse by and by the rancher ran back for some tobacco and jimmy moodily fastened the packrope stooping by the horse he thought he heard a step but did not look up and a few moments afterwards he felt a hand on his shoulder then an arm went around his neck and margaret turned his head and kissed him he tried to seize her but she slipped away and stopped a yard or two off jimmy thrilled and his eyes sparkled  now i know when i come back you wont refuse me  you dont know i dont know margaret replied in a trembling voice all the same i love you and youre going away  peter and mrs jardine came out the rancher seized the bridle and called to the horse jimmy lifted his battered hat and they started across the clearing  three days afterwards they stopped at a small stone hut built against the bottom of a great rock on one side dark pines rolled up to the walls and a hundred yards off one could hardly see the pile of stones was a building yet the small room was rudely furnished and the earth floor was dry they cut some wood made a fire and cooked food and after the meal lighted their pipes  you have got an ax and a rifle but if you run out of grub graham the sectionhand on the railroad will put me wise said peter toms a white man and his posts not far from the spot we crossed the line the trapper who lived here is dead and i reckon nobody but tom and me knows about the shack  i expect ive got all i want but im bothered about margaret  you dont want to bother in the meantime margarets my wifes sister from calgary thats good enough for the police and anyhow the royal northwest arent city patrolmen they reckon theyre highbrow frontier cavalry and i guess the trooper wont allow a girl held him up youll stay put until we see if we can ship you out with the construction boys to the calgary side if that plan wont go well push across the range for the big park valley and try to run you south i think thats all but if you want to send a letter to your friends graham will mail it for you  after a time peter knocked out his pipe and jimmy went with him to the door when the rancher vanished in the woods and all was quiet jimmy leaned against the post and gave himself to gloomy thought  it began to get dark the snowveined rocks melted in the mist and the pines were vague and black in the distance a timber wolf howled and the long mournful note emphasized the dreariness in the rocks where jimmy hid at the beginning he had deerings society and at the ranch he had margarets and jardines now he was altogether alone in the savage wilds going back to the fire he threw on fresh wood and although he was not keen about smoking lighted his pipe     xxv  the call   jimmy fastened his skin coat and going to the door of the sectionmans hut looked up the track the railroad and an angry river occupied the bottom of the gorge but the water was low and a rapid throbbed on a dull note jimmy knew its slack beat was ominous the frost had stopped the streams that not long since leaped out from the glaciers  he shivered for the cold was keen and the coat he had got at green lake was old besides he was tired he had started before daybreak from his shack but when he reached the railroad the moon was on the rocks in the shadow the snow that streaked the mountainside was blue across the gorge broken crags shone like polished steel and the small pines growing in the cracks sparkled with frost not far off a dark hole in a slanted white bank indicated the mouth of a snow shed but jimmy knew the stones and snow had come down the hill  when he looked up his view on one side was cut by the top of a precipice it was like looking up from a deep pit farther along the gorge the rocks got indistinct and melted in the moons pale reflections no track but the railroad pierced the mountains although the wide chain was broken by narrow valleys running north and south jimmy had come up the line from the valley he occupied and by another some distance off one could reach green lake the nearest station was twelve miles away at the end of grahams section  jimmy had arrived half an hour since but had not found graham although his stove was burning peter jardine had stated he could trust the man who had begun to clear a ranch at green lake but had stopped when his money was gone in the mountains ranching is a slow and laborious job and men whose means are small are forced at times to follow another occupation  by and by a lantern twinkled at the mouth of the snow shed and a man came up the track  hello he said ive got some news and wondered if youd blow in but i wanted to take a look at the rockcut before the freight comes through did you make supper  jimmy said he had cooked some flapjacks although he felt he ought to wait until his host arrived  shucks remarked graham jardines my neighbor and he allows youre his friend but the colds fierce lets get in  they sat down by the stove and for a minute or two jimmy was content to warm himself and smoke at the shack he had no light but the fire and the long evenings were dreary all the same he was disturbed and with something of an effort he said well  two troopers got off the westbound at the depot and my partner tellson allowed they brought a lot of truck looks as if they meant to stop around and search the neighborhood  ah said jimmy i expect they know im about did they bring their horses  tellson saw no horses if the boys were going to green lake they could ride besides the other outfit went there not long since  jimmy nodded he knew the police had not bothered margaret and he must think for himself the troopers not bringing their horses was ominous since it indicated that they were going to push into the mountains the valley in which he hid did not open to the track to reach it one must climb a mountain spur but he imagined the police meant to climb if they found the mouth of the valley they might reach the shack before he knew and if he got away he must take the snowy rocks  i expect jardine hasnt yet arranged to send me out on board a train he said  peter was trying to fix it he had to wait until he met a construction boss he knows but he cant fix it now the police will stop the gangs and tally up the boys  if they come down the line to find out where i am wont take them long  your chances dont look very good graham agreed if you could cross the range to the park valley you might get away south but i doubt if you could make it  jimmy said nothing he imagined deering stated the range had been climbed by some city members of the canadian alpine club but they no doubt took packers to carry supplies and went when the snowline was high for a lonely man to venture on the icy rocks was ridiculous after a few minutes graham pulled out his watch  the freights making good time and when shes gone i must go up the track to the piece the boys underpinned he said i reckon ill be away an hour and you had better go to bed  jimmy heard a rumble and went with graham to the door to watch the great train come down the gorge would for a few minutes banish his gloomy thoughts up the track a streak of silver light touched the rocks and trees the speeding beam got brighter and by and by dazzling radiance flooded the gorge the ground began to shake harsh clanging echoes rolled across the rocks one heard the big cars jolt and the roar of wheels then black smoke swirled about the hut and the beam was gone in the dark the banging cars rushed by a blaze touched the snow shed and went out and the turmoil died away  graham picked up his lantern and jimmy went back to the stove lighting his pipe he pulled out stannards map and began to ponder it was obvious he must not stay long at the trappers shack since the police watched the neighborhood he could not get food and when they found the way to the valley he would be driven back into the mountains in fact he felt he ought to try for freedom now before his line of retreat was cut but he was tired and did not see where he could go  there was no use in stealing off along the track because the station agents were no doubt warned to look out for him if he started before daybreak he might perhaps reach the trail to green lake but peter had already run some risk for him and margaret was at her cousins to go to green lake would put the police on her track  jimmy studied stannards map across the mountains behind the shack the park valley ran southeast and from its other end one could perhaps reach the plains and the united states graham had stated jimmy could not cross the range but graham was not a mountaineer stannard was a mountaineer and could get supplies and packers then stannard was his friend and perhaps owed him something  the adventure was daunting but jimmy resolved to try it he must for a few days risk stopping at the shack and pulling out a blankbook he wrote a note graham would send the note and stannard would no doubt start soon after it arrived then jimmy thought he ought to let margaret know his plans and he wrote another note putting the envelopes on a shelf he got into grahams bunk  when jimmys note arrived at the hotel stannard was at dinner for the most part the guests had gone but mrs dillon had returned with frank and laura and a young man had joined the party stevens belonged to the canadian alpine club and knowing about stannards exploits had cultivated his society  stannard took the soiled envelope from the page and noted it had not a stamp  who brought the letter he asked  a freight brakesman gave it to our porter at the station  stannard put down the envelope and resumed his dinner but laura said the hand is jimmys arent you curious  i am curious anyhow dillon declared and mrs dillon looked up for she knew something about jimmys adventures  if you want to read your letter do so she said to stannard  stannard opened the envelope and laura remarked his thoughtful look she took the note from him and after a moment or two gave it dillon  is it possible for jimmy to get across dillon asked  i frankly dont know said stannard and turned to stevens a young friend of ours wants to try a rather bold exploit he thinks he can cross the cedar range and i could help in summer i wouldnt hesitate to venture on the snowfields now is another thing  stevenss eyes sparkled he was young and enthusiastic and to climb with a mountaineer like stannard was something to talk about  although i havent long joined the club sir i went with gordon when he explored the cascades from rawden if you go id like to join you  i dont yet know if ill go or not said stannard and resumed his dinner  mrs dillon touched laura she was a large and rather quiet lady and not marked by much refinement but she was kind and sometimes firm  i want to see that note she said  laura looked at stannard and gave her the note  the poor young man hes surely up against it she exclaimed i like jimmy if i was a mountain clubman id feel id got a call  stannard said nothing and laura was quiet she was disturbed about jimmy but she knew her father besides she thought stevens curious by and by she looked at dillon who began to talk about something else  when dinner was over mrs dillon joined another lady and stannard went off laura and dillon remained at the table and stevens saw they did not want his society he went away and laura asked do you think jimmy can escape  if he stops at his hut i expect the police will get him dillon replied  laura frowned and looked about the table was decorated by flowers from the coast and the electric light was reflected by good china and glass in the background were polished hardwood panels and carved pillars the spacious room was warm all struck a note of luxurious refinement but laura thought about jimmy cut off from his supplies in the snow  had jimmy gone back to lancashire she admitted she might have married him he had refused and for a time his obstinacy had hurt but she was not revengeful and since she had rather weighed his advantages than loved him she could let it go she liked jimmy and was moved by a gentle sentimental tenderness  are you willing to help jimmy frank she asked  why of course i thought you knew i mean to help dillon declared perhaps i was jealous about jimmy but now im sorry for him all the same your father puzzles me hes not keen  i expect he knows the risk said laura thoughtfully for stannards hesitation was obvious since he must lead the party he feels he ought not to be rash then if jimmy got away across the mountains i expect the police would make you all accountable  oh well the job is awkward although i expect we could put it over suppose we look for mr stannard  stannard was in the rotunda and when laura and dillon advanced he smiled  you are young and romantic but i am not when one gets old one uses caution  i doubt if i am romantic but i think mrs dillon did not exaggerate laura rejoined jimmy is our friend and trusts us his note is a call  sometimes deafness is not a drawback i own id sooner not hear the call  but you mean to go  it looks as if i might be forced franks resolve is rather obvious said stannard with a resigned shrug  dillon gave him a keen glance somehow he felt stannard did mean to go but wanted to be forced frank thought it strange  i feel we ought to help and now deering is not about nobody but you can lead us  for a few moments stannard was quiet then he said very well but if we are going we must start soon we want packers to carry food and a tent as far as possible and id like a good mountaineer to help on the rocks the hotel guides are gone but i expect the clerk knows where to find them  grant lives at calgary  i think the fellow i wants at revelstoke and he could get the train that arrives in the morning said stannard and pulled out his watch we can send a nightletter and neednt use economy ill telephone the station agent and give him the message  frank knew grant of calgary was a good mountaineer but he said nothing and stannard gave laura a smile  i expect you are satisfied  youre as noble as i thought said laura i knew why you hesitated and it wasnt for yourself but i knew you would go     xxvi  deering takes the trail   stannard was marked by a superficial languidness strangers thought him careless and his humorous tranquillity had charm for all that when speed was important he moved fast and after he telephoned to the station he got to work he packed rucksacks for his companions got ropes and iceaxes and arranged with the hotel cook to put up a supply of food then he sent a messenger for two or three halfbreeds who carried loads for fishing parties stevens helped and admitted that stannard knew his job all he did was carefully thought about  after some time dillon joined them and stannard said its awkward but willmer at revelstoke is engaged however he states he can send us a useful man and we are to meet him at the station hell come by the train in the morning and well get on board we ought to reach the railroad hut jimmy talks about by dark and if the night is clear well push on  if the police are about the station where we get off they may stop us  its possible stannard agreed still they dont know our object and we must persuade them we are mountaineering tourists boast about your climbing and the canadian alpine club stevens knows their exploits all the same i imagine the police are in the mountains well your sack is packed and when you have got your snowspectacles and the grease for your skin well stop for a smoke  in the morning the halfbreed packers arrived and soon afterwards all were ready to start the hotel servants and three or four guests came to see them go but when the others strapped on their loads stannard joined laura on the steps  well we are going to jimmys help he said with a smile frank is very keen but as far as possible ill try to see he does nothing rash to know your marriage is fixed is some comfort  laura looked up quickly although stannards smile was kind she was vaguely disturbed  when frank wanted the wedding soon i thought you agreed rather easily i was satisfied to stay with you for some time  oh well said stannard im afraid i havent carried out my duties im a careless fellow and feel my daughter does not owe me much although you have grown up beautiful and attractive nature and your aunts are accountable then you see im getting old and mountaineering is my hobby sometimes one slips on an icy rock  you mustnt talk like that it hurts said laura with a touch of emotion you gave me all i asked for you have always indulged me then i urged you to go and now i feel i ought not to urge to be generous in my way costs one nothing i shall not venture on the rocks i send you  stannard laughed but laura studying him was moved her father was handsome and wore the stamp of high cultivation although he was not young he carried himself like an athlete she knew his strength and pluck and his gentleness to her now she thought him fine and chivalrous  you follow your heart he said and kissed her then he pulled out his watch but i must not be selfish and frank is waiting  dillon advanced and stannard resumed youth is romantic and sometimes exaggerates laura imagines her generosity and yours accounts for my starting on our adventure well perhaps im slow and cautious but now and then one recaptures a touch of ones boyish rashness however i mustnt philosophize we must get off in a few minutes  ill join you on the trail said dillon who remarked that stannard implied that he hesitated to go stannard had said something like that before as if he wanted others to note that the plan was not his all the same it was not important and dillon took lauras hand  five minutes afterwards the party started the packers carried the heavy loads the others the iceaxes and stevens and stannard wore round their shoulders coils of alpine rope where the trail turned they stopped for a moment and waved their hats and then vanished in the trees  some time afterwards laura saw a plume of black smoke roll across the pines and stole off to her room she did not want mrs dillons comfort her father and her lover had started for the rocks and if they paid for their rashness she was accountable  in the morning she got a jar for a sergeant of the royal northwest police arrived at the hotel he was polite but firm and laura saw she must brace up mrs dillon had gone with her to the rotunda and to know she had her help was some comfort  mr stannard started for the mountains yesterday the sergeant remarked he took a quantity of camp truck and two of your friends where did he go  i dont altogether know his line laura replied when you climb high mountains you cannot make fixed plans much depends on the snow  well i expect mr stannard stated where he meant to start  why of course said mrs dillon hed get off at the green river depot  the sergeant remarked her frankness but thought she saw some frankness was indicated because for him to find out where the party had got off was not hard  do you know mr stannards object our clubmen go for the rocks in summer his starting now was strange  laura lifted her head and her look was proud she thought she could play up and the fellow must not imagine stannard had gone to jimmys help  my father is not a canadian clubman hes a famous alpine mountaineer and can go where others cannot  our boys are pretty smart said the sergeant smiling but are all mr stannards party expert mountaineers mr stevens for example and mr frank dillon  my son said mrs dillon who saw the other had talked to the hotel clerk frank knows something about the rocks and belongs to a club that explores the olympian range were americans  the sergeant bowed politely but she resumed mr stannards english all the lot are tourists and i sure cant see what the canadian police have to do with their going off to climb your rocks youre not going to draw strangers to the country if you bother them like that  sometimes the polices duty is awkward said the sergeant in an apologetic voice  the police have not much grounds to inquire about my fathers excursion laura remarked haughtily when he killed the bighorn he did not know he poached on a game reserve but he paid the fine and it is done with  the sergeant saw her eyes sparkled and she was not playing a part she did not know all he knew and he must not enlighten her  not long since mr stannard went shooting with the pitlight which is not allowed and the gamewarden was shot  my father did not shoot the warden he stayed and helped the police  three of his party pulled out the sergeant rejoined maybe mr leyland could put us wise about the shooting and we reckoned mr stannard knows where he is  then you must wait for his return if you found his track i dont suppose you could follow him on the rocks  in the meantime youre resolved not to help us hit his track  i dont know his track laura replied  the sergeant went off he had talked to the hotel clerk and although he had not found out much from laura he had found out something the girl was persuaded stannard had gone to help leyland and the sergeant thought his plan really was to help the young fellow get away in fact the sergeant thought he saw stannards object for doing so  laura however was disturbed she was anxious for jimmy and knew the risks stannard ran in the mountains but she imagined she had baffled the sergeant and she resigned herself to wait for news  when the next train for the coast rolled across the pass deering was on board a firstclass car he was dressed like a city sportsman but his clothes were thick and his shooting jacket was lined with sheepskin for deering knew the wilds when he went to vancouver his movements interested the police but at calgary they left him alone and nothing indicated that they now bothered where he went deering thought it strange unless they knew something he did not  in the meantime he was occupied by another subject although he meant to see jimmy out he had frankly no use for hiding much longer at the ranch jimmy must be smuggled across the boundary to the united states and deering weighed a plan  when he got down at the station he meant to push on for jardines but kelshope was some distance off and he resolved to stop at the hotel he had been for some time at calgary and stannard would perhaps know if jimmy was all right the clerk sent for laura and by and by she came down she gave deering a cold glance but he had long known her antagonism  you cannot see my father he and frank are in the mountains she said  deering knitted his brows when winter had begun one did not start for the rocks for nothing  it looks as if the police have found out jimmy was at his ranch  then jimmy was at the ranch we didnt know he did not come to see us i expect you stopped him  you dont trust me miss laura still you ought to see jimmy dared not come to the hotel  i did not think you a proper friend for jimmy and frank  deering smiled he knew he was a better friend of jimmys than stannard but he said oh well perhaps its not important anyhow jimmy trusts me and i mustnt let him down you imply hes not at the ranch  laura told him about jimmys note and he inquired about stannards plans when she had satisfied his curiosity his look was thoughtful  stannard will send back the packers at the bottom of the rocks he remarked has he got a guide  he could not engage the guide he wanted another man about whom i dont think he knew much was sent  your father needs a useful man jimmys steady on an awkward pitch but sometimes hes rash the others are raw boys it looks as if ive got to hit the trail  frank is not a boy and my father is a famous climber laura rejoined if he cannot cross the mountains do you think its possible for you then you ought to have started before the police have followed jimmy for some time and i think another party set off yesterday  deering thought to embarrass him gave her some satisfaction but he smiled  i know youre not my friend miss laura and i must try to be resigned all the same unless you put me wise it may be awkward for jimmy what about the last lot of police  she told him and he bowed thank you ill get off  but the sergeant is in front of you and there is not a train  the police are pretty smart but ive known them bluffed deering remarked then the station agent and another fellow talked about a construction trains going up the line ive traveled on board a calaboose before  laura hesitated and then gave him her hand after all i think you want to help and if you agree to leave frank alone  i rather think you dont know your power deering rejoined with a twinkle frank is well guarded from all my wiles in fact im willing to give you best  oh well said laura perhaps i was not just  he went off and laura mused she had not liked deering he was a gambler and exploited the extravagance of rich young men yet frank trusted the fellow and she began to doubt if her antagonism were altogether warranted for one thing deering was stanch and his pluck was rather fine her father had started with a wellequipped party deering went alone and when he got to green lake must baffle the police then she liked his humorous politeness he knew she doubted him but he was not revengeful on the whole she thought when she gave him her hand she took the proper line     xxvii  deerings progress   soon after deering started from the hotel he met jardine deering knew the shrewd canadian scots and thought the rancher a man to trust moreover he had not yet got all the light he wanted jardine was on foot and deering said hello its a long hike to kelshope wheres your horse  margarets got the cayuse at green lake dye no ken  i didnt know said deering but youre coming from the station when do they expect the construction train  she stopped doon the track for the boys to fix some rails the operator was grumbling because shed no get through till dark and hed got to block the line for the kamloops freight  oh well said deering since i want to get on board the calaboose perhaps her stopping in the dark is not a drawback but what about miss margarets going to green lake  jardine looked at him rather hard i alloo yere mr leylands friend  sure thing said deering jimmy reckons you his friend well i want to know how he got away  jardine told him and deering pondered he had undertaken an awkward job and since he saw some obstacles he resolved to give the rancher his confidence among the trees the frost was not keen and the sun was on the road deering indicated a spruce log and pulled out some cigars  suppose we take a smoke and talk he said and when jardine lighted a cigar resumed wont miss margarets shooting the fellows horse make trouble for her  i reckon not said jardine who had heard the troopers statement and when he got a note from margaret remarked that the narratives did not agree im thinking the boys dinna mean to pit it on margaret and the troopers no altogether prood  its possible but why didnt you put jimmy wise  id cut my foot chopping a day or two before  deering rather doubted if jardines cutting his foot accounted for all but he said lets talk straight i suppose miss margaret is going to marry leyland  maybe but i dinna ken jimmy wanted to marry her  very well said deering ill tell you all i know  he narrated his interview with laura and stannards going to jimmys help jardines look got thoughtful and sometimes he frowned when deering stopped he said ye dinna trust stannard yed sooner jimmy hadna gone across the rocks wi him  i would sooner he had not deering agreed jimmy trusts stannard the others are tenderfoots and i understand they have not a firstclass guide  the man theyve got is no a mountain guide ava gillanes a packer on the government surveys but i dinna see much light yet jimmy owes stannard a guid sum  leyland insured his life in stannards favor and stannard wants money well im going up the line with the construction gang to follow the partys trail  jardine got up and his look was very grim just that ill join ye  not at all said deering your parts to go to green river depot afterwards and watch out i expect youre a good bushman but this is a job for a firstclass mountaineer besides you cut your foot  jardine gave him a keen glance but deering resumed you see i must hit up the pace and cant boost you along can i hire a young man a prospector if possible at green river  the others arguments did not move him and by and by jardine resigned himself to stay behind  im thinking my nephew peter is the man ye want whiles he goes to the depot for his groceries and mail the storekeeper will ken if hes aboot ye can tell peter i sent ye to him  after a few minutes deering went off but he went slowly and did not keep the road to the station joining the line two or three miles down the valley he found a trackgraders tool hut and went in and smoked the hut was cold but deerings fur coat was thick and good when dusk began to fall he walked along the track and stopped three or four hundred yards from the station  by and by a light twinkled like a star in the gloom of the woods a steady throb rolled up the valley and presently deering distinguished a locomotives measured snorts and the rumble of wheels the star was now a dazzling moon and its reflections picked out far in advance glittering rails and frostspangled trees when the locomotive was level with deering he began to run up the line and soon after the train stopped he got behind the last car  he knew the companys rules but he knew something about traingangs and he had ready a few dollar bills although the station agent did not see him get on board when the train rolled up the track he occupied a box in front of the calaboose stove the men gave him supper and when he had drained a can of strong coffee he pulled out some cards and showed how an expert puzzled his antagonists  cold draughts swept the rocking calaboose the stove roared and one smelt locomotive smoke labored snorts echoed in the rocks couplings rang and when the train sped across a bridge the roll of wheels drowned deerings voice deering smiled and waited for the noise to stop he had undertaken a daunting job and was bothered about jimmy but in the meantime he owed something to his hosts and he played up although deering had some drawbacks his rule was to play up  a number of the men had long studied cards and could bluff on a poor hand three or four won regularly some part of their companions wages but they knew a masters touch and for a time deering held the group then he lighted his pipe and began to talk about something else he found out that the train ran between a gravel pit and green river the men were filling up a trestle and cutting out an awkward curve  have they got a hotel at the settlement deering inquired  theyve no use for a hotel at green river sometimes a rancher comes in for his mail and a survey party jumps off i guess thats all you can stop at the post office the man who keeps it runs a small store  nothing much doing yet deering remarked do the mounted policemen come to the settlement  a big shovelman laughed theyre getting busy around green river two lots came in not long since and a troopers there now but he wont bother you looks as if he was sent to watch out for somebody who wanted to get on the train  then you reckon theyre after somebody in the rocks said deering carelessly  thats so another agreed i wouldnt bet much on the fellows chance when we ran up with the last load a police outfit was starting for the range three or four troopers and a packhorse theyd loaded up some truck  oh well said deering the royal northwest are smart boys but ive known them beat however ive been for some time on the road and think ill go to bed can somebody give me a bunk  they gave him a bunk and for an hour or two he slept he knew it might be long before he slept warm again when he awoke the locomotive bell was tolling and the roll of wheels was getting slack the calaboose was very cold and deering jumping from his bunk went to the open door  in front a fire burned by a water tank and the beam from the headlamp flickered across a small clearing and touched a wooden house farther off a big blastlamp threw up a pillar of flame the light tossed and for a few moments all was shadowy then the strong illumination leaped up again and deering saw a man who carried a short rifle walk along the line he knew the royal northwest uniform  deering picked up his fur coat and hesitated in the mountains one must wear proper clothes and the coat was good but unless he could cheat the trooper he might not reach the mountains he touched the man who had given him the bunk  ill trade my coat and cap for yours  the fellows skin coat and cap were old and he looked at deering with surprise  why do you want to trade a trackgrader doesnt buy revillon furs  deering indicated the trooper the policeman might calculate something like that but i expect he knows you belong to the gang you are going to dump some rails and for half an hour i want a job  now i get you said the other  he pulled off his shabby coat and when the train stopped and deering jumped down nothing distinguished him from the construction gang climbing on to a flat car he joined the men who threw down the rails and presently saw the trooper stop the fellow who wore his coat and cap he did not know how the railroad man accounted for his wearing good furs but he was obviously a trackgrader and after a few moments the trooper let him go then the train rolled up the line and deering stayed with the men who moved the rails  by and by the trooper walked past the gang glanced at the men carelessly and turning back vanished in the gloom deering thought him satisfied nobody but the trackgraders was about and soon afterwards he started for the house so far he had trusted his luck but he wanted help and must get food moreover he must not excite the storekeepers curiosity  a clump of pines cut the illumination up the track sometimes when the blastlamps flame leaped up bright reflections touched the house but for the most part the ground in front was dark when deering was near the door a man came out and stopped for a few moments deering thought him a rancher and when he went down the steps met him at the bottom  can i buy some flour and groceries he asked  you might said the other and looked at deering as if he thought the inquiry strange why do you want groceries where are you going  deering saw something must be risked and when a risk must be run he did not hesitate  if i can find the trail im going up the valley peter jardine has a ranch at the lake i think  thats so said the other im peter jardine  deering laughed his luck had not turned and when the reflections from the blastlamp touched the ranchers face he thought he had got the proper man  then as soon as you can get me some groceries ill start for the rocks your uncle sent me along and stated you would help you see im jimmy leylands partner and miss margarets friend  ah said peter youre deering well the police are after jimmy for some days two troopers hunted for his tracks and then a sergeant and another came in on the train and started off as if they knew where he was in the meantime a sports outfit hit the trail but i didnt meet up with them i made the station in the afternoon and didnt know what i ought to do in fact when you came along i was wondering if id pull out for the ranch  youre coming with me i dont want to boast but im a mountain clubman and on the rocks i reckon i can beat the police  but jimmys friends got off in front of the troopers  theres the trouble theyre not all his friends deering rejoined on the whole id sooner the police got him than he crossed the range with the other lot but well talk about this again when can you start  i can start as soon as my horse is loaded up but we have got to bluff the policeman he mustnt see us take the mountain trail well ive pork and flour and groceries have you got all you want  i want a hudsons bay blanket and a packrope said deering and gave peter a roll of bills then you had better buy a fryingpan and grubhoe  very well go ahead up the trail across the clearing and wait for me by the creek said peter and returned to the store  after a time he rejoined deering and tied his loaded horse to a branch  the storekeeper knows i hit the green lake trail and we dont want the cayuse when we have sorted out the truck we need hell make the ranch all right light the lantern and well fix our packs  deering lighted the lantern and after a few minutes strapped a bag of food on his back he pushed his folded blanket through the straps gave peter the rope and picked up the grubhoe a canadian digging tool very like a mountaineers iceax then they put out the light let the horse go and went back quietly to the railroad nobody was about and stealing across the line they plunged into the gloom  my lucks good said deering when i think about all were up against i sure want it good     xxviii  a dissolving picture   after a time deering stopped and looked about the stones on the river bank were large and sharp the night was dark and his load embarrassed him in the distance he saw a small red fire a dim light marked the post office and the reflections from the blastlamp quivered behind the trees deering got his breath and braced up  born in the bush he had known poverty and stern physical toil he was a good mountaineer but he admitted that his two hundred pounds was something of a load to carry across icy rocks then he had for the most part lived extravagantly at fashionable hotels and his big muscles were soft but this was not all the distant lights stood for human society and civilization deering was very human and fought against an atavistic shrinking from the dark and loneliness moreover he knew the wilds for all that he meant to conquer his shrinking  he admitted that he was perhaps a romantic sentimentalist and his adventure did not harmonize with his occupation sometimes however one was not logical and not long since he would have plunged down the rocks but for jimmys pluck besides he saw stannard had used him to entangle the lad deering had his rude code but stannard had none he was cold and calculating and deering thought he meant to carry out the plan he tried before when he sent jimmy over the neck although deering did not like the job he meant to baffle him  in the meantime all was quiet but for the turmoil of the river a few yards off dark pines occupied the narrow level belt by the track and on the other side vague blurred rocks went up thin mist drifted about and the line running downhill melted into the gloom the trooper was at the station and deering imagined nobody was about  the stones are sharp and slippery he said well take the track and push on for the sectionhut  they got on the line but did not progress fast the gravel ballast was large and hurt their feet the ties were not evenly spaced sometimes deering stepped on the timber and sometimes on the loose stones then numerous ravines pierced the rocks and although the construction gangs had begun to fill up the chasms for the most part wooden trestles spanned the gaps to cross an openwork trestle in the dark is awkward and when deering balanced on a narrow tie and looked for the next he sweated and breathed hard on one trestle he stopped sixty feet below him he saw the foam of an angry torrent the next tie was some distance off and the wood sparkled with frost  in a sense his adventure was ridiculous when he used the railroad he went on board a firstclass car and checked his baggage now he stumbled over the ballast and carried on his back all he could not go without in the meantime however he must cross the trestle and he trusted his luck and jumped  he got across and after three or four hours they reached the sectionshack graham was in bed but he got up and told them all they wanted to know three policemen with an indian and a packhorse had come down the track and graham imagined they had found the entrance to jimmys valley he reckoned they would send back the indian and the horse when they took the rocks but the fellow had not yet returned peter was puzzled about the indian  they didnt hire him up at the station he remarked looks as if theyd fixed it for him to meet them  it looks as if theyd made their plans and their plans were pretty good said deering however since theyve got a loaded horse they cant shove on fast how long was the other outfit in front  graham told him and for a few moments deering pondered then he said its awkward stannard knows where jimmy is and hell hit up the pace i reckon the police dont know and must look for his tracks if we hustle well run up against the gang  the difficulty was obvious and peter frowned  we might get by their camp in the dark wed see the fire  i doubt deering rejoined if the boys make a fire theyll make it where the light is hid they dont want to put jimmy wise  well said peter what is your plan  deering laughed a noisy laugh for now he had started his hesitation vanished  well trust our luck and shove ahead in the morning well get up the rocks and look about ive brought my glasses lets get going  graham gave them directions and when they climbed a steep hill they found the valley the ground was broken and in places covered by tangled brush but they made progress and at daybreak labored across the snow to the top of a spur deering sat on his pack and used his prismatic glasses  gray cloud floated about the mountain slopes but the high peaks were sharp and began to shine in the rising sun some were rosepink and some were yellow the hollows between their broken tops were gray and blue a map of the mountains occupied a wall of the hotel rotunda and deering using his glasses imagined it roughly accurate  i expect the blue gap is the head of the valley he remarked and when peter nodded resumed well allow stannard joined jimmy ahead of the police and took him along we have got to hit their line and this is not as hard as it looks they cant steer for the shoulder of the big peak the rocks wont go and i see an ugly icefall on the glacier i reckon id head back obliquely for the col up the long arrête  i dont use no habitant french peter observed  oh well our clubmen have begun to use the tourists talk said deering and gave peter the glasses anyway you see the ridge that runs up to the neck  peter studied the ridge he had hunted mountain sheep and imagined sun and frost had worn the rocks to something like a knifeedge in places sharp pinnacles broke the top and he thought it significant that for the most part the snow did not lie the shadow behind the top no doubt marked a great precipitous gulf but the farther end of the ridge touched a white hollow between two peaks if one could get across one might find a glacier going down the other side  i reckon your friends couldnt make it between sunup and dark he said anyhow the police would see them on the rocks  stannard might hit a line a few yards below the top but i imagine the clouds will soon roll up give me the glasses i want to locate a gully that goes for some distance up the ridge  peter saw his object the long ridge ran back obliquely from farther up the valley and to get up by the line deering marked would cut out the corner moreover peter imagined the police had reached jimmys hut and if they found the tracks of stannards party they would climb the ridge from the other end in consequence deerings going up the gully would put him in front  i guess well start when we noon well be nearer and if the mists not thick you can look for the line you want  they went down the hill and by and by the cloud rolled up the slope and rocks and peaks were lost in gloom then deering began to get tired for although there was no snow at the bottom of the valley the ground was rough after an hour or two he pushed into the timber and stopped  perhaps its risky but ive got to eat and take a rest he said the trees are pretty thick and if the smoke goes up the hills a good background  they cooked some food and then sat by the fire not far off the belt of trees was broken and presently deering saw the cloud had got thin and begun to roll back up the mountains vague rocks pierced the vapor and grew distinct the mist trailed away from battered trees and slanted fields of snow for a time it clung about the high dark precipices and then one saw the snowpacked gullies seam the crags like marble veins a faint light pierced the vapor and the broken top of the ridge began to cut the background  deering pulled out his glasses and went to the opening in the wood the light was getting stronger but he did not think the cloud would altogether melt and he must search the rocks while search was possible by and by a beam touched the ridge and the snow glimmered like pale gold against blue shadow above the shadow were broken peaks but the belt of dark blue indicated a gap and deering noting the strong color thought the gap profound  the landscape lighted by the unsteady beam was strangely beautiful the pale illumination did not travel far and the rocks outside its reach owed something of their mysterious grandeur to the contrast deering however was not romantic and thought he saw a line across a steep white slope and up a buttress to the ridge if he could get up he would cut stannards track and imagined he would not be much behind the party  he concentrated on the ridge the slope along the top was not even but went up rather like a terraced walk rocky buttresses supported the terraces and for the most part the stones were free from snow deering knew this indicated a very steep pitch one buttress was marked by a broad white band and when he rubbed the glasses he thought he saw on the snow a small object he had not remarked before the object moved and calling peter he gave him the glasses  whats that a cinnamon  the bears have come down said peter the bighorn have gone for the low benches i guess the things a man  deering agreed and waited perhaps it was strange but of all the animals civilized man alone was willing to front the cold on the daunting heights the ridge outlined against a vague background of majestic peaks looked as remote as another world to imagine flesh and blood could reach it was hard but deering meant to try and knew stannards calculating steadiness if one went carefully studying the obstacles and using the ax and rope  its a man all right i see another said jardine and gave deering the glasses deering saw three men they advanced very slowly and he pictured their cutting steps before they moved one crossed the snowbelt and vanished when he was anchored in the rocks he would steady his companions deering knew it was stannard for stannard would not trust a poor guide at a spot like that the others perhaps were dillon and stevens then he saw two more gillane the packer and jimmy anyhow stannard had started with three companions and now he had four deering knew all he wanted to know  he watched the party strung out at even distances move across the white band and then the figures melted they had not reached the other side but when he rubbed his glasses they were gone the peaks in the background vanished the ridge got indistinct and the black pines on the lower snowfields faded as if a curtain were drawn across the picture  deering shut his glasses and went for his pack the mist was not thick and he knew his line to the buttress  put out the fire and lets get off he said  you cant cross the ridge in the dark and the colds going to be fierce peter remarked  that is so i doubt if stannard can make the neck but if he gets there he must wait for morning maybe well find a hole in the rocks  peter said nothing he had engaged to go where the other went and must try to make good although the road was daunting in thick timber a bushman can front biting cold but on the high icy rocks one could not make camp and light a fire if their luck were very good they might find a hole behind a stone in which they must wait for daybreak and try not to freeze  he put out the fire and when they went through the wood pondered gloomily to reach the neck would cost them much but to get there was not all they must get down on the other side and for the most part the mountain tops were tremendous precipices peter rather thought the neck opened on a glacier but sometimes a glacier is broken by awkward icefalls  all the same peter set his mouth and pushed ahead in the valley he could hit up the pace for deering but he imagined to follow the big fellow on the rocks was another thing when a bushman took the rocks he went to shoot bighorn and bear the mountain clubmen studied climbing as one studies the ballgame     xxix  held up   a few pale stars were in the sky and the moon was over a vague gray peak deering shivered beat his numbed hands and looked about the frost was keen and he had not thought he could sleep but when he looked about before the stars were bright and the moon was not above the peak in front the buttress cut the sky and although the rocks were indistinct he saw the belt of snow stannard had crossed since stannard had got his party up the buttress deering imagined he could get up but the rocks were awkward  deering wore the railroad mans skin coat and a thick hudsons bay blanket for climbing their weight was an embarrassment but he would sooner carry the load than freeze although he lay with his shoulders against jardine he was numb and the outside of the blanket sparkled with frost a tilted slab partly covered them but the gravel in the hole was frozen and deerings hipjoint hurt the worst trouble was when he was very cold his brain got dull and he hated to use effort yet effort was needed for day had begun to break and he must cross the neck by dark to stop another night on the high rocks was unthinkable and he knew his luck might turn if thick snow fell or a strong wind blew he and peter would stay on the rocks for good  moreover jimmy was in front and deering thought jimmy ran a daunting risk he ought to get up and start but he shrank from the frost and for a minute or two he weighed his grounds for doubting stannard jimmy owed stannard a large sum and had insured his life if he went over a precipice the company would pay stannard deering admitted the argument looked ridiculous stannard was highly cultivated rather extravagant than greedy and not at all the man to plan a revolting crime yet he had not engaged a proper guide and his companions were trustful young fellows whom he could mislead moreover he had gone down into a snowswept gully to help leyland and knew this would weigh stannard had then expected jimmy to marry laura  deering pushed peter who woke up and grumbled deering open his pack awkwardly and pulled out a bannock and some canned meat  day is breaking when you have had your breakfast we must start  unless i get a hot drink ive not much use for breakfast peter replied when do you reckon well get down to the timber when i camp i like a fire  depends on our luck said deering dryly i doubt if youll make a fire tonight  if i wasnt a fool id go right back stannards most a days hike ahead then if the police have hit his trail theyre not far behind us  we cut out some ground and on the rocks two men go faster than five stannard must find a line for his gang and us then i expect hell be held up for a time at the neck i dont know where the police are  peter ate the bannock and put on his pack well lets get going  the light was not yet good their muscles were stiff physical fatigue reacted on their nervous strength and at the belt of snow they stopped the belt was perhaps ten yards across and occupied a channel in the rocks the surface was smooth and hard and deering imagined if one slipped one would not stop until one reached the valley a row of small holes however indicated that stannards party had gone across and up the dark forbidding buttress on the other side deering frankly shrank from the labor and risk of crossing but he dared not turn back  where the boys have gone we mustnt stop he said tie on the rope and give me the grubhoe  peter gave him the hoe the blade was curved like a carpenters adze and at its head was a short pick the tool although rather heavy was a good iceax in soft snow one can kick holes but the snow was hard and deering doubted if the notches stannard had cut would carry him he used the pick balancing in a hole while he chipped out the next and when they got across he sent peter in front their hands were numb and where the snow had melted veins of ice filled the cracks in the rocks the hold was bad and peter stopped at the bottom of a slab deering had remarked when he sent him in front  i sure dont know how were going to get up  stannard got up said deering and looked about  thirty feet below him the belt of snow pierced the rocks it looked nearly perpendicular and the snowfield at its foot was horribly steep in the shadow the surface was gray and dark patches marked where rocks pushed through a very long way down across a sharp but broken line the color was blue and deering thought the line the top of a precipice he turned and looked up the slab was upright and about ten feet high he could not see a crack or knob but he noted two or three fresh scratches  lean against the rock and spread your arms he said and when peter did so climbed up his back  standing on the others shoulders he could reach the top of the slab the top was nearly flat and went back for some distance but the snow was hard deering dared not trust his numbed hands and he tried the pick the blade got hold but he could not see farther than the handle if he had caught a small lump of ice that would not support him the rope would pull jardine off the rock all the same something must be risked  brace up good he said and trusted the pick  the tool held and he got his chest on the top but now the blade was near his body his reach was short and when he used his hand his stiff fingers slipped across the snow it was obvious he must move the pick but the tool was his main support and the effort to push it forward might send him down still if he could get three or four inches higher he might perhaps balance on the edge  his boots got no grip on the smooth slab but when he used his knee his clothes stuck to the stone when his waist was nearly level with the top he pulled out the pick and moved it forward for a moment or two the blade came back and he began to go down then it held and after a stern effort he was up the rock above the ledge was broken and throwing the rope across a knob he helped peter  half an hour afterwards they reached the ridge behind the buttress deerings hands were bleeding and he was not cold his skin was wet and he breathed by labored gasps in front the ridge went up unevenly to the neck the narrow broken top for the most part was supported by precipitous rocks one must use caution and could not go fast but after a time a snow cornice began on one side the top leveled by the wind was smooth and so far as it rested on the stone was firm as a rule a snow cornice is widest above and deering knew if he crossed the line where it overhung its base he might break through but the marks in front indicated where stannard had gone  stannard knew much about snow cornices and deering wondered whether he could not have found some grounds for throwing off the rope and letting jimmy venture on the dangerous overhang he had obviously not done so moreover he had brought his companions up the buttress if deering himself had meant to let somebody fall he thought he would have tried at the awkward slab in fact he admitted that to picture stannards weighing a plan like that was theatrically extravagant yet he knew stannard who was not the man people thought he was very clever and if he plotted to get rid of jimmy he would not do so soon after he had taken him into the mountains he would wait until he had nearly carried out his job and was bringing his party down from the rocks anyhow deerings business was to overtake the party to wonder whether he exaggerated jimmys danger would not help  for a time he made good progress along the cornice and in the afternoon he reached the neck at the end of the ridge stannards tracks forked one row of footmarks crossed a steep snowbank running up a peak the other went along the hollow neck  all the outfit went up the neck and then two or three turned back peter remarked after examining the trampled snow  deering nodded stannard sent them back and pushed ahead with gillane to look for a line down the other side when we get across well see what he was up against  at the end of the neck they stopped and deering frowned he had been longer than he thought and a pale illumination behind a peak indicated that the sun was low in the valley below he saw a frozen lake and a dark winding band he knew was timber on a river bank he had food and if he could reach the trees he need not bother about the frost a canadian grubhoe made for cutting roots is a useful tool and he could build a wall of bark and branches light a fire and brew hot tea the trouble was to get down to the friendly pines  in front of him a snowfield sloped to a spot at which two uneven converging rows of dark rocks ought to have met the rocks were the tops of precipices but the point of their intersection was cut out and a glacier began at the gap deering could see for a short distance down the glacier until it plunged across the top of a steeper pitch and when he used his glasses he noted its surface was crumpled as if it broke in angry waves in fact it was rather like a rapid suddenly frozen at the top of a fall deering knew it was an icefall and the waves were giant blocks the rocks at the side were very steep and veined by snow  nothings doing there he remarked i dont see stannard but he wont find a useful line lets look for the boys  they turned and following the tracks along the neck after some time went round a buttress that broke the front of the range on the other side three people occupied a little hollow in the rock one got up awkwardly  its peter he shouted why deering you grand old sport  deering gave jimmy his hand and noted that his look was strained and his face was pinched  miss laura put me on your track and mr jardine wanted to come along he said and studied the others who did not get up  theyve had enough said jimmy we were two nights on the rocks and the cold was keen stannards gone to see if we can get down the glacier but i dont think hes hopeful anyhow lets go back into our hole when you wriggle down under a blanket its a little warmer than outside  deering joined the others a jambed stone partly covered the hole and the boys packs fur coats and blankets kept them from freezing but he saw their pluck was nearly gone  what about the police he asked when he had lighted his pipe  we dont know where they are jimmy replied stannard brought us up the ridge but from my shack you see another way up at the head of the valley i went over to study the ground and thought the climb harder than it looks all the same i imagine the police have tried it of course when they got to the snow they wouldnt find our tracks but they know were in the mountains  then theyre south of us  jimmy nodded on this side of the range theyd reckon on our pushing south and expect to cut us off now you see why stannards keen about getting down the glacier  we cant get down the icefall wont go said stevens moodily i doubt if i could get down a ladder my notion is stannard knows his plans a forlorn hope and gillane is badly rattled  the fellows a common packer stannard ought not to have hired him dillon agreed still we couldnt wait and when the revelstoke man sent gillane we were forced to start anyhow id trust stannard where i wouldnt trust a guide  he hasnt hit a useful line yet stevens rejoined were held up and i doubt if we can stand for another night in the frost  im willing to go back and risk the police said jimmy still we couldnt start until daybreak and would be forced to camp again on the ridge the valleys not far off if we can make it  we must wait for stannards report said deering soothingly when i was at the hotel the clerk gave me a letter for you  jimmy beat his numbed hands and opened the envelope then he laughed a dreary laugh  in a way the things a joke leylands has something to do with a japanese cotton mill and sir jim writes from tokio hes going to england by vancouver and sails on board the first cpr boat he means to stop for a few days and look me up jimmy studied the postmark and resumed i expect hes at vancouver now  your luck is certainly bad deering remarked in a sympathetic voice  jims the head of the house dick owns him boss jimmy went on his letters kind and if hed arrived before when i was making good i might have got his support i wanted to persuade him i was not a careless fool but when he gets to know my recent exploits  deering imagined jimmy had wanted his uncle to agree about his marrying margaret since sir james was a sober business man the lad had not much grounds to hope he would approve his nephews romantic adventures  after all i rather think well cheat the police he said they dont know where we are and when we make the valley well hit up the pace ive friends wholl help you across the frontier and you can sail for england from new york  the drawback is we cant make the valley stannard cant lead us down stevens interrupted gloomily  deering looked up well know soon i hear steps  stannard came round the corner saw deering and stopped rather quickly  hello we did not expect you were you at the hotel have you got some news  i was at the hotel deering replied the morning before i got there a police sergeant arrived i understand he was curious about your excursion  stannards glance was keen and deering thought him disturbed  you imply the fellow knew id gone to join jimmy  miss laura imagined something like that but what about the glacier  stannard hesitated and knitted his brows i think well risk it in the morning you see if we pushed along the range we might meet the police besides we must get down to the timber soon  you sure cant get down remarked gillane the packer who had followed stannard  well try said stannard and turning to the others forced a smile well i want some food and frank might light the spirit lamp you must brace up for another night on the mountain but were lucky because we have got a corner where we shant freeze     xxx  the gully   day broke drearily the sky was dark and snow clouds rolled about the peaks in the hollow behind the rock stannards party crowded round the spirit lamp one could get no warmth but in the snowy wilds the small blue flame and steaming kettle called moreover each would soon receive a measured draught of strong hot tea  all were numb and their faces were pinched stevens was frankly despondent and when dillon broke his hard bannock his stiff hands shook gillane was apathetic but when stannard measured out the tea he joked and deering laughed to laugh cost the big man something but he knew he must stern effort was needed and human effort does not altogether depend on muscular strength the packers mood was daunting and it was obvious they would not get much help from him  jimmy was quiet he must concentrate on holding out and could not force a laugh he admitted he had not pluck like stannards stannard was indomitable and now his gay carelessness was very fine although he was the oldest of the party and his face was haggard he joked and his jokes were good when the meal was over he got up and beat his hands  we must get down before dark and i think i know a line he said if our luck is good well camp in the trees by a splendid fire  to start was hard but they got off and the snow was firm the steep slope below the neck was smooth and for a time they made progress jimmy remarked the thickening snow cloud and knew stannard thought it ominous for he pushed on as fast as possible so far one could use some speed the obstacles were in front  the snowfield stopped at the top of a chain of precipices the rocks were broken by the deep gap through which the glacier went but jimmy noted smaller breaks he thought were gullies filled by snow he could not see the front of the precipices but he pictured their falling for six or seven hundred feet at the bottom no doubt were steep spurs and long ridges across which one might reach the trees rolling up from the valley the precipice was the main obstacle but jimmy did not think the rocks were perpendicular anyhow the glacier was not and if one could cross the icefalls it would carry them down the trouble was the cloud was getting thick  after a time they stopped at the head of the glacier and stannard jimmy and deering climbed to a shelf that commanded the icefall mist rolled about but for some distance one saw the broad white belt curve down between the rocks then jimmy saw the fall and set his mouth the snowy ice was piled in tremendous blocks and split by yawning cracks it looked as if the cracks went to the bottom and one imagined others hidden by fresh snow stannard turned to deering who shook his head  the boys cant make it i doubt if you can nothings doing  very well said stannard i marked a gully about two miles south i dont know if youll like it but we must get down  deering pulled out his watch you have got to hustle the boys cant stand for another night on the mountain  when they rejoined the others it looked as if his remark was justified gillane declared if they could not cross the icefall they must stop and freeze stevens owned he was exhausted and doubted if he could reach the gully jimmy would sooner have risked the fall since he was persuaded the other line would not carry them down but if stannard thought the line might go he was willing to try it  they fronted the laborious climb to the snowfield and soon after they got there mist blew across the slope the party was now drawn out in a straggling row and by and by deering stopped and looked about he knew two or three were behind him but he saw nobody  where are the boys he shouted  peter said he had not seen stevens and dillon for some time but they were no doubt pushing along and the partys track was plain  im going back said deering watch out for jimmy  he plunged into the mist and presently found stevens sitting in the snow dillon was with the lad and when deering arrived urged him to get up stevens dully refused and said there was no use in the others bothering he could go no farther deering pulled him up and shoved him along  youre going to the gully anyhow he shouted with a jolly laugh when we get you there you can sit down and slide  dillon helped and some time afterwards they came up with peter  wheres jimmy deering asked in a sharp voice  stannard reckoned he was near the spot hed marked he took a rope and gillane and jimmy went along they allowed i must stop to watch out for you  you let jimmy go  sure i did said peter with sullen quietness i reckon you neednt bother about jimmy somethings bitten you stannards all right if he cant help us we have got to freeze  deering said nothing stannards charm was strong and cold and fatigue had dulled peters brain there was no use in arguing and he followed the others track he could not see much for the mist was thick the ground got steeper and rocks pierced the snow it looked as if he were near the top of the precipice but so long as the marks in front were plain he need not hesitate after a few minutes he saw gillane the packer leaned against a massy block round which he had thrown the rope the end was over the top of the rocks  hello said deering whats your job  im standing by to steady mr stannard top of the gullys blocked and he calculated to get in by a traverse across the front theres a kind of ledge but we didnt see a good anchor hold  deering remarked that the fellows grasp was slack and a single turn of the rope was round the stone if a heavy strain came on the end he thought the rope would run and gillane would not have time to throw on another loop cold and fatigue had made him careless  get a good hold and stiffen up said deering im going after stannard  the rocks were not as steep as he had thought and the ledge was wide enough to carry him but a yard or two in front it turned a corner although the mist was puzzling deering thought it melted in the meantime he must reach the corner sometimes jimmy was rash and if stannard allowed him to run a risk he ought not to run nobody would know  when deering got to the corner the mist rolled off the mountain top he saw a tremendous slope of rock pierced by a narrow white hollow for four or five hundred feet the gully went down and gradually melted in a fresh wave of mist deering noted the sharpness of the pitch and then fixed his glance on stannard who leaned back against the rock jimmy holding on by stannards shoulder was trying to get past on the outside of the ledge  deering stopped and his heart beat the others did not see him and he dared not shout but if stannard moved it was obvious jimmy would fall stannard did not move and jimmy crossing in front of him stopped and looked down  the stretch is awkward and you cant steady me he said still i think i could reach the slab and slide into the gully before we bring the others perhaps i ought to try  you have a longer reach than mine and you are younger stannard replied  deering could not see the slab but he imagined stannard had noted something about it that jimmy had not now jimmy fronted the other way stannards hand was at his waist and deering thought he loosed the knot on the rope  hold on jimmy he said in a quiet voice  jimmy stopped stannard turned and although his look was cool deering thought his coolness forced he leaned against the rock but deering saw his hands were occupied behind his back  i thought you went for stevens he remarked  the kid wasnt far back deering replied and laughed gillanes rattled and half frozen i reckon he might let you go but my two hundred pounds is a pretty good anchor slip off the rope and ill help jimmy he wont pull me off  stannard awkwardly pulled out the knot and deering who had thought to see the rope fall was baffled for all that he knew stannards cleverness and imagined the fellow knew he had experimented  im going in front of you he resumed wait until i tie on jimmy you cant trust the slab  when he had tied on he braced himself against the rock jimmy vanished across the edge and the rope got tight after a few minutes he came up  so far as i can see we can get down by cutting steps but i couldnt see very far he said your tip about the slab was useful deering the top was rotten and a lump came off i was lucky because i put on the rope  on the rocks caution pays deering remarked well lets get up and go for the others cutting steps for four or five hundred feet is a pretty long job  they went back along the ledge but deering felt slack and his big hands shook he had borne some strain and rather thought that had he arrived a few moments later jimmy and perhaps gillane would have gone down the rocks yet he did not know in fact he admitted that he might not altogether know     xxxi  stannards line   a wave of mist rolled across the rocks but the vapor was faintly luminous as if a light shone through deering stannard jardine and jimmy waited on the steep bank above the ledge gillane had gone back for the others when he arrived the party would start  deering knew the venture was rash and the labor heavy they would use two ropes and the leader must kick and cut steps in the snow the others behind would then occupy the holes and hold him up until he cut another lot cutting steps however soon tired ones arms and when the leader was exhausted to pull him up and tie on a fresh man might be dangerous then nobody knew what was at the bottom and the gully might break off on the front of an icy cliff  all the same some rashness was justified nothing indicated that the mist would altogether roll away and in two or three hours it would be dark if they stopped for another night on the high rocks all would freeze an effort to reach the timber and camp by a fire was so to speak their forlorn hope besides stannard was persuaded they could get down and deering admitted his judgment was good by and by stannard gave him a careless glance  ill lead on the first rope and take gillane and stevens jimmy and the others will go with you  deering wondered he was resolved jimmy should use his rope but stannards proposing it was significant if stannard knew why he had joined them on the ledge it looked as if he were resigned to let jimmy go then stannard pulled out his watch  we must get off shout for gillane your voice carries well  deering shouted and fixed his glance on the slope behind the group after a few minutes two or three indistinct objects loomed in the mist  the boys are coming he said and resumed in a puzzled voice gillane went for stevens and dillon but i see four  there are four said jimmy and deerings mouth got tight  he thought the first man did not belong to stannards party and now he saw two others behind the advancing group  the police said stannard and shrugged resignedly  jimmy turned his face was pinched and his pose was slack but his look was calm  you have played up nobly but were beaten and ive had enough in fact to know im beaten is rather a relief  deering nodded gloomily there was no use in trying to get away the royal northwest are empowered to shoot and as a rule shoot straight he waited and noted mechanically that stannard was a few yards nearer the top of the rocks by and by a police sergeant stopped opposite the group  we have got you dont move until you get my orders he said and signing a trooper indicated gillanes party hold that lot off  we are not looking for trouble and the boys wont bother you said deering whats your business  he turned and glanced at stannard who said nothing the mist was getting thin and deering thought his look strained gillane had stopped behind the police and the sergeant advanced pulling at his belt  i have a warrant but my hands are frozen and i cant get inside my coat  you can show us the warrant later said jimmy im james leyland the man you want  we dont want you the sergeant replied  jimmys legs shook and he sat down in the snow after the long strain his relief was poignant and reacted on his exhausted body he gave the sergeant a dull puzzled look  then whom do you want  harvey stannard said the other and stannard turned  his figure cut the misty background and he carried himself as if he were not disturbed in fact jimmy imagined he had expected something like this  i am stannard why do you want me  when i can loose my belt ill read you the warrant the charge is killing gamewarden douglas  then douglas is dead said stannard in a quiet voice  he died four or five days since the sergeant replied  ah said stannard and braced himself well i have nothing to state i reserve my defense  stop him shouted the sergeant and leaped across the snow  stannard stepped back stumbled on the steep bank and vanished  for a moment jimmy numbed by horror wondered whether his imagination had cheated him then he saw stannard was really gone and he ran for the ledge the others joined him but stannard was not on the ledge two or three hundred feet below a dark object rolled down a long slab and at the bottom plunged into a gulf where the gray mist tossed  hes gone deering remarked to the sergeant perhaps youll find him when the snow melts  they went back to the spot where they had left their packs and ropes for a time all were quiet and then the sergeant said to deering he beat me but i dont get it yet i didnt reckon on his going over he stated he reserved his defense  perhaps he was rash deering remarked in a thoughtful voice in the meantime however we must let it go and think about getting down to the bush how did you find us  we went for a neck behind mr leylands shack when we saw no tracks we pushed along the main range we reckoned youd gone by the long ridge and we might cut your trail we were three nights in the rocks and are all played out  then you had better join us we are going to try stannards line down the gully i dont engage to make the woods but i dont see another plan  the sergeant hesitated stannard hit the line  he declared the line would go said deering quietly perhaps you have not much grounds to trust him but he was a great mountaineer  jimmy turned and threw deering the end of the rope  dont talk he said to the sergeant if you mean to join us tie on we must start  a few minutes afterwards they crossed the shelf deering led and jimmy going first on the second rope rather doubted if they would reach the trees in summer the long straight crack was obviously the mountains rubbish shoot and its sides were ground smooth by rolling stones now it was packed by hard firm snow to slip would mean a savage glissade and then perhaps a plunge  much depended on the leaders nerve reaching down held by the rope he must chip out holes and then when the man behind him occupied the notches move a foot or two and cut another sometimes deering used his boots and sometimes the icepick but for the most part when his party had gone across the holes were broken and jimmy was forced to cut the labor was exhausting and by and by deering owned he had had enough the trouble was to help him back and put another in his place but gillane got into the loop and brought them down some distance then he stopped and for a few minutes all lay in the snow mist hid the bottom of the gully and none dared hope their labor would be lightened much when they got there for all they knew they were painfully crawling down to the top of a precipice in fact nobody was willing to brace up for the effort to change the leaders  after a time jimmy turned his head the mist was lifting it went up in torn shreds and the bottom of the gully began to get distinct where the dark trough ran out from the rocks a smooth snowfield went down the vapor steadily rolled off the slope until jimmy saw a vague dark belt he thought was timber his heart beat and he got back his pluck  stannard hit the proper line he said well pitch camp in the woods  dillon took gillanes post the sergeant took jimmys and they pushed on by and by the mist rolled down and hid the pitches below but now all knew where they went the gloom vanished and slack muscles were braced for all that when they reached the snowfield deering looked to the west and frowned  the lights going and the trees are a long way off he said mush along boys you have got to get there  in places the snow was loose and to get forward was hard jimmy pushed stevens for some distance and they were forced to stop for a young police trooper on some pitches the snow was hard and slippery and rocks with icy tops broke the surface dark crept up from the valley and the trees were behind the ground in front yet from the daunting gully they had looked down across the vast white slope and the picture that melted like the mist led them on ahead were rest and food and warmth at length two or three hours after dark dillon stumbled and rolled in the snow  watch out for the juniper i ran up against he shouted keep going this trails for the woods  half an hour afterwards jimmy threw off his pack and leaned against a spruce the ground was steep and stony but rows of small trunks cut the glimmering snow all round was fuel and one could build a shelter and eat hot food he thrilled and the blood came to his frozen skin they had run daunting risks and borne all flesh and blood could bear but the strain was done with they had made it     xxxii  by the campfire   in the timber the cold was not very keen and the tired men braced themselves for the effort to pitch camp peter and the sergeant took control and soon a big fire burned behind a wall of branches against the wall twigs and thin branches were packed for beds where the bushman can find fuel and material for building he does not bother about the frost and in winter the royal northwest patrols sleep by their campfires far out on the snowy wilds  a trooper fried pork and doughy bannocks deering brewed a kettle of strong tea and when all had eaten like famished animals the men for the most part went to sleep for a time however deering the sergeant and jimmy sat by the fire and smoked  on the mountains they were absorbed by the stern physical effort and concentrated mechanically on getting down animal instinct urged them forward but now the risk of freezing was gone they began to think like men the sergeant and jimmy were puzzled and imagined they might get some light from deering jimmys brows were knit and when he looked about he frowned although he was warm and the hot tea had revived him he felt his brain was dull  sparks leaped up from the fire smoke tossed about the camp one heard the wind in the pinetops and the trunks reflected gleams of flickering light the mist had blown away and jimmy saw far off a dim white ridge cut the sky then he turned his head and shivered for he knew stannards broken body was somewhere in the rocks and perhaps nobody would find the spot stannard was his friend a cultivated gentleman and a famous mountaineer but he had slipped and gone down the precipice like a raw tourist moreover although it looked as if he had killed the game warden he had said nothing in fact it looked as if he were willing for jimmy to pay yet jimmy was not persuaded for stannard to use treachery like that was unthinkable  youre satisfied im not accountable for the shooting accident he said to the sergeant  i guess my chiefs are satisfied our orders were to leave you alone  for a few moments jimmy was quiet he had carried a heavy load and now the load was gone he could urge margaret to marry him and get on with his ranching perhaps if she agreed he might go back to lancashire but he must not yet dwell on this  when did your officers find out i had nothing to do with it he resumed  not long since the day before warden douglas died all the time he was at the hospital we waited for his statement but got nothing although ive seen men shot douglas puzzled me and i reckon he puzzled the doctors sometimes he was sensible but he didnt talk and when we asked him about the shooting he looked at us as if hed plumb forgot then one day it all came back and he gave us his story  the night was dark and douglas could not see much deering remarked i expect you had something to go on that helped you fill out his statement  the sergeant smiled the trooper who measured up the distances and made a plan of the clearing was a surveyors clerk then douglas was shot in the center of his chest but the mark at the back was to one side besides we had got mr leylands hired man miss jardine put us on his track he sure doesnt like mr leyland but his tale was useful  in fact if mr leyland had not pulled out you would not have bothered him  i expect that is so when stannard sent mr leyland off he reckoned to give us a useful clue our duty was to try the clue  jimmy looked up sharply but deering said stannards plan was good but your officers are not fools then another thing is obvious if you had tried very hard you might have hit mr leylands trail before  its possible the sergeant agreed with a touch of dryness maybe the bosses were after stannard but i dont get it all yet stannard was not a fool i guess he knew we couldnt put it on him that he meant to shoot douglas since he was using the pitlight hed have gone to the pen but i guess he could have stood for all he got yet when he saw he was corralled he stepped back off the rocks  stannard was an english highbrow a year or two in a penitentiary would have knocked him out perhaps this accounts for it  oh well said the sergeant i guess well let it go for three nights ive shivered on the rocks and i want to sleep  he lay down on the branches and jimmy waited the smoke was gone the fire was clear and red reflections played about the quiet figures at the bottom of the rude wall after a time jimmy thought all slept and he turned to deering  i dont know if the sergeant was satisfied but i am not you imply that when stannard stepped back he knew where he went  deering pondered he saw jimmy was disturbed and puzzled but he doubted if there was much use in enlightening him stannard was gone jimmy had trusted the fellow and had already got a nasty knock yet if he had begun to see a light deering did not mean to cheat him he was not stannards champion  well he said it certainly looks like that  but why the sergeant thinks they would not have tried stannard for shooting with intent to kill he declares stannard could have stood for all he got  i expect that is so sometimes however people are not logical for example when you thought you had shot douglas you pulled out  i ought to have stayed now i think about it stannard rather persuaded me to go jimmy agreed and looked at deering hard when you recently found out stannard had gone to my help why did you go after him  for one thing i knew he had not got a proper guide i thought the job a mans job and stevens and dillon are boys  somehow i feel thats not all said jimmy and for a moment or two was very quiet then he resumed when stannard and i were on the ledge you were at the corner i was going to jump on the slab but you shouted  sometimes youre rash when you jump on a rock you want to know the rock is sound  the slab was not sound said jimmy in a hoarse voice still i was on the rope and stannard knew if i went down i might pull him off the ledge  he stopped and deering saw he did not want to solve the puzzle its done with and youre a stanch friend he resumed well im very tired  deering gave him a sympathetic nod and pulling his blanket round him got down on a pile of twigs jimmy sat with his back against a log and looked into the gloom behind the black pinetops high up on the lonely rocks a rotten slab dropped to the gully and but for deerings stanchness he might have taken an awful plunge in the meantime the cold was keen his body was exhausted and his brain was dull he did not know much and did not want to know all the thing was done with and he resolved to let it go by and by he got down on the twigs by deering stretched his legs to the fire and went to sleep  in the morning after breakfast the sergeant lighted his pipe and stopped the troopers who had begun to roll up their packs  we wont break camp yet boys he said and turned to deering mr stevens cant stand for a long hike and my orders were to bring stannard back  sometimes the police orders do not go said deering dryly until the snow melts nobody will bring stannard back he has cheated you  ive got to try and want your help  you can reckon on mine said dillon and looked at jimmy laura must be satisfied  that is so im going to stay said jimmy and when deering agreed the sergeant ordered a trooper and gillane to start for the railroad  he stated he must send a report and jimmy and dillon gave the packer some telegrams the men set off and soon afterwards the others leaving stevens to watch the fire began to climb the long steep ridge behind the camp  the effort cost them much all were slack and tired and knew their labor would not be rewarded yet for some hours they struggled across the snowfields and searched the rocks with the glasses in the afternoon they went back and lying about the fire talked and smoked  at daybreak they started again and reached higher ground the day was bright and the rocks and gullies were distinct but when the sun sank behind the range they had found nothing all the same jimmy saw that when stannard resolved to try the gully his judgment was strangely good there was not another line down the rocks and nowhere but at the bottom could the party have reached a slope leading to the trees at length deering gave the sergeant his glasses  nothings on the big gravel bank and we cant get up the cliff he said i have had enough and i expect you are satisfied maybe youll find stannard after the thaw but when he stepped off the rocks i think he went for good  ive tried said the sergeant lets get down at sunup well pull out for the railroad  they went back but after supper nobody talked much somehow the camp was gloomy and jimmy fought against a vague sense of horror to know they would take the trail in the morning was some relief  at daybreak they broke camp and started downhill all were glad to go but when they reached the valley jimmy stopped and looked up at the distant white streak in the rocks now he was on level ground to picture his crawling down the awful gully was hard and at the top was the snowbank where stannard vanished  jimmy shivered but after a few moments turned and ran to join the others he was young the sun was on the mountains and the doubts and horror he had known melted like the dark the thing was done with the load he had carried was gone and he was free  perhaps it was strange but he began to perceive that the freedom he thought he enjoyed with stannard was an illusion stannards light touch was very firm and he had led jimmy where he did not mean to go laura not knowing all she did had helped him to resist and when he knew margaret stannards control was broken it looked as if stannard had not meant to let him go but jimmy refused to speculate about the others plans  at length so to speak he was his own man he had paid for his extravagance and extravagance had lost its charm now he knew no obstacle to his marrying margaret and if she were willing he resolved to resume his proper job at the cotton mill when he thought about it his heart beat but margaret was not yet persuaded and unless she knew his relations approved to persuade her might be hard well sir james was at vancouver in fact he was perhaps at the hotel and jimmy was keen to meet him  progress however was slow broken trees and rocks from the mountain blocked the way fresh snow had fallen and stevens was lame he had slept with his wet boots on and his foot was frostbitten then dillon was slack and moody his fatigue was not gone and if gillane had sent the telegrams when the party reached the settlement laura would be waiting dillon shrank from enlightening her and jimmy sympathized     xxxiii  sir james approves   the sun was low but the light was good and jimmys party crossing a hillside saw a long plume of smoke the smoke moved and when it melted the rumble of a distant freight train rolled up the valley after a time they saw telegraph posts a break in the rocks and two or three small houses then their fatigue vanished and all went fast but jimmy was sorry for dillon whose mouth was tight jimmy thought laura waited at the railroad and frank must tell her stannard would not come back moreover she must soon know stannard had shot the game warden and was willing for jimmy to pay when they reached the bottom of the hill he stopped dillon  i expect laura has got a cruel knock but perhaps we can save her some extra pain if you take the line you think will hurt her least ill play up and you can trust deering  dillon said nothing but gave jimmy a grateful look half an hour afterwards they pushed through a belt of trees and saw a party waiting by the railroad it was obvious the telegrams had arrived although the people were some distance off jimmy picked out margaret who stood by a man he did not think was jardine the bush ranchers did not wear furs like his by and by he distinguished mrs dillon and mrs jardine graham the section hand and a police trooper but they were not important and he speculated about the stranger until when the track was not far off he saw a light margarets companion was sir james leyland  jimmy frowned his uncles arrival was awkward for he had rather hoped to work on margarets emotion and carry her away in fact he had wondered whether to take her boldly in his arms might not be a useful plan now the plan would not work although when he stopped in front of margaret he saw she was moved the blood came to her skin and her glance was very kind she wore an old fur cap and a soft deerskin jacket in fact her clothes were a ranchers daughters clothes but somehow she was marked by a touch of dignity she gave jimmy her hand and he turned to his uncle  you know miss jardine sir  it looks like that sir james replied with a smile since you are my nephew i felt i ought to know your friends then miss jardine was kind and seeing my curiosity helped to throw some light upon your romantic adventures  jimmy gave margaret a grateful look and laughed i expect you were puzzled sir  to some extent i was puzzled sir james agreed im a sober and perhaps oldfashioned business man the golden days when i was young and rash are gone but one recaptures a reflection of their vanished charm  ah said jimmy i knew you were human no days were golden for uncle dick i expect you know we jarred  dick indicated something like that but he has a number of useful qualities perhaps theyre inherited qualities because i think one or two are yours for example i went to see your ranch you have made good progress on sound business lines although chopping trees is obviously a strenuous job  do you know much about ranching jimmy inquired  i do not miss jardine thought i ought to see the ranch and her father enlightened me  margaret blushed and sir james smiled friends are useful jimmy so long as ones friends are good but we mustnt philosophize they are cooking some food for you at the post office and the station agent has agreed to stop the vancouver express he imagines the train will arrive before very long  they went to the post office and soon afterwards the train rolled down the gorge jimmy helped margaret up the steps gave peter his awkward thanks and jumped on board by and by the cars sped past a small stone hut and he wondered whether he was the man who had not long since stolen down at night to meet the section hand  when they reached the hotel the guests jimmy had known were gone and a lonely stranger occupied a room the clerk stated they would shut down for the winter as soon as the party went but dinner would be served as usual in the big diningroom  jimmy refreshed by a hot bath dressed with luxurious satisfaction to wear clean dry clothes and know others would cook his food was something new when he went downstairs sir james was in the rotunda  now you are the fashionable young fellow i expected to meet he remarked with a twinkle you see dick drew your portrait  oh well said jimmy i expect i bothered dick and perhaps he was a better friend than i thought all the same i hope to persuade you the portrait was something of a caricature  sir james gave him a thoughtful glance it is possible when you came down the hill at green river carrying your heavy pack your mouth tight and your eyes fixed i knew my nephew sometimes when the cheap mill engine stopped and your father put down his pen and took off his coat he looked like that well its long since and i have got a title i did not particularly want but after all we are new arrivals and the primitive vein is not yet run out he stopped and resumed mrs dillon is in the drawingroom but we must wait for miss jardine she and her father are my guests  you are kind but i thought them my guests sir  sir james smiled you are rather dull jimmy after all i am the head of your house  they went to the diningroom and at the door jimmy stopped margaret and jardine crossed the belt of polished wood between the pillars but now margaret was not dressed like a bush girl the deerskin jacket was gone her clothes were fashionable and her skin shone against the fine darkcolored material yet she was marked by the grace and balance one gets in the woods and jimmy thought her step like a mountain deers then he saw his uncle studied him and he crossed the floor  mrs dillon frank and deering came in but although sir james was an urbane host sometimes the talk got slack laura had not come down and another occupied stannards chair  the stranger jimmy had remarked dined alone some distance off but when mrs dillon got up he joined the group  you agreed to give me an interview he said to sir james  that is so sir james replied you wanted to see my nephew i think and since we may talk about stannard i would like mr deering to join us  they went to the rotunda and the stranger pulled out some documents he was old and rather fat but his clothes were fastidiously neat and his glance was keen  you know im mayson and my london address is on my card he said the card does not state my occupation but i lend money  i imagined something like that said sir james stannard was your partner  he was my agent stannard belonged to exclusive sporting clubs i could not join but perhaps this is not important i understand you are satisfied he is dead  deering nodded nothing made of flesh and blood could stand for his plunge down the rocks  since he was a famous mountaineer i expect you thought his carelessness strange  i have some grounds to think you could account for it said deering dryly  we will talk about this again said mayson and turned to sir james mr leyland owes me a large sum i have brought his notes  sir james studied the documents and gave them to jimmy who admitted the account was accurate  very well said sir james my nephew meets his bills the interest is high but he must pay for his extravagance before i write you a check i want to see your agreement with stannard and would like some particulars  mayson gave him a document and when jimmy stated that he knew stannards hand resumed stannard joined me some years since at a time when he was awkwardly embarrassed the combine had advantages stannard had qualities i had not his friends were fashionable sporting people for all that he was bankrupt and i supplied him with money  exactly said sir james still perhaps stannards agreeing to tout for you was strange my nephew thought him a fastidious gentleman theres another thing since he was willing to exploit his friends did you not imagine he might cheat you  mayson smiled stannard dared not cheat me and perhaps i can give mr deering the light he wants i knew something about stannard that had others known would have broken him when we made our agreement he declared the person he had injured was recently dead and the risk he ran was gone perhaps he was sincere but sometimes i doubt not long since when he began to keep back sums i ought to have got i made inquiries and found out that another knew in fact it looked as if stannard were buying the fellows silence with my money had he been frank i might have broken the extortioner but he was not frank i think he knew he had deceived me about the agreement and was afraid anyhow he tried to meet the demands until  i think i see said deering you do not yet know all stannards plans and now theyre not important i expect we can take it for granted that he imagined the demands could not long be met then he saw the police had found out his part in the shooting accident and he went down the rocks  it looks like that mayson agreed  deering turned to jimmy jimmys look was stern and his brows were knit deering thought he saw a light but he said nothing and sir james got up  if you will go with me to the office mr mayson i will write you a check  they went off and soon afterwards dillon joined jimmy  laura wants to see you he said in a disturbed voice she knows stannard shot douglas and its now obvious he meant you to pay but i rather think thats not all she talks about her not being justified in marrying me the things ridiculous if stannard was a crook shes not accountable but my arguments dont carry much weight perhaps you can help you agreed to play up  ill try said jimmy and went to the drawingroom  nobody but laura was about and her forlorn look moved him her face was pinched and all her color was gone but she gave jimmy a level glance  you know im sorry he said and taking her cold hand resumed with some embarrassment franks my friend and you were very kind not long since i thought  you thought you were my lover said laura in a quiet voice you were lucky because you were not but had you agreed to go back to the cotton mill i might have married you now you know my shabbiness  i know nothing like that jimmy declared i do however know i owe you much you were the first to warn me where my extravagance led now i want to help  ah said laura you are generous i was willing to cheat you and its plain my father was not your friend  jimmy studied her and thought her afraid in fact he began to see why she had sent for him laura was keen she knew something but he imagined she did not know all anyhow he was not going to enlighten her  you mustnt exaggerate the importance of the shooting accident he said i and mr stannard used our rifles the night was dark and i imagined i had hit the warden i expect mr stannard had no grounds to think the unlucky shot was his until recently the police believed the shot was mine  laura was quiet for a few moments and then with an effort looked up  my father knew the rocks he was a famous mountaineer yet when the police sergeant ordered him to stop he went down the bank  after all his carelessness was not very strange jimmy replied mr stannard was leader and had borne a heavy strain in fact we were all exhausted and our nerve was gone then the police came out of the mist the sergeant shouted and mr stannard knew they claimed he had shot the warden he was startled and so to speak mechanically stepped back  he stopped for although his object was good he knew lauras cleverness he did not know if he had altogether banished her doubts but she gave him a grateful look  frank is your friend she said in a quiet voice he wants me to marry him are you satisfied i ought not to refuse  why of course im satisfied jimmy declared you had nothing to do with the shooting accident you were my friend before frank was i hope were friends for good to refuse to marry frank is ridiculous since im persuaded you ought not to doubt  laura gave him her hand  you are stanch jimmy but im tired she said and let him go  in the hall jimmy met sir james who said i am going for a quiet smoke will you join me  not for a time sir since i arrived ive been strenuously occupied doing things i ought now im going to do something i want to do  for example sir james inquired  im going to talk to margaret i hope to persuade her to marry me  when i suggested our taking a smoke my object was to inquire about your friendship for miss jardine after all i am your trustee  i hope you approve my plan sir jimmy rejoined  you know where to stop sir james remarked with a twinkle perhaps my approval carries more weight than you think because had i not approved miss jardine would not have agreed  then you have talked to her about it said jimmy with keen surprise  not at all miss jardine is not dull i soon saw she understood my importance but did not mean to use her charm her friendliness was marked by some reserve in fact it was plain she acknowledged my business was to judge if she were the girl for you and she would not persuade me well i liked her pride and although we did not talk about it i rather think she knew i did approve  thank you sir said jimmy with a grateful look  sir james put his hand on jimmys arm  when i started from bombay i was bothered about you dick had found out something about stannard and he imagined that miss stannard was his accomplice  miss stannard didnt know stannards occupation she is not accountable for her father  that is so sir james agreed i think miss stannard a charming girl but she was not the girl for you leylands are manufacturers and your job is to control a big industry miss stannards is to cultivate her social talents and amuse herself margaret jardine however is our sort shes stanch and sincere you know her pluck and all she risked for you you want a wife like that and i wish you luck  jimmy found margaret in the drawingroom mrs dillon had gone off with laura and jimmy advanced resolutely  at green lake i asked you to marry me and you refused yet you knew i loved you and perhaps i had some grounds to think  the blood came to margarets skin i did know jimmy but to marry you because i stopped the trooper was another thing  now youre ridiculous all the same in some respects your refusal was justified my drawbacks were plain for all you knew i was an extravagant wastrel and the police were on my track since i mustnt urge you i was forced to be resigned  sometimes you are rather dull margaret remarked and smiled  well im not forced to try for resignation now i was something of an extravagant fool but the police will leave me alone  the police were not the obstacle said margaret in a quiet voice  jimmy laughed it looks like that the trooper who tried to catch us did not bother you long if sir james was the obstacle hes so to speak removed you have conquered him and he declared a few minutes since you were the girl for me hes a kind old fellow dont you think you ought to indulge him  he reached down and took her hands i want you margaret my extravagance is done with im going back to undertake my proper job and i need your help  then i must try to help said margaret and jimmy took her in his arms   the end     by the same author
