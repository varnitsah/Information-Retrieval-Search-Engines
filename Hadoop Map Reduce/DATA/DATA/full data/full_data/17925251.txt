17925251	the wogglebug book  by  l frank baum  pictures by ike morgan        chicago the reilly  britton co 1905  copyright 1905 by l frank baum every right reserved    the unique adventures of the wogglebug  one day mr h m wogglebug t e becoming separated from his comrades who had accompanied him from the land of oz and finding that time hung heavy on his hands he had four of them decided to walk down the main street of the city and try to discover something or other of interest  the initials h m before his name meant highly magnified for this wogglebug was several thousand times bigger than any other wogglebug you ever saw and the initials t e after his named meant thoroughly educatedand so he was in the land of oz but his education being applied to a wogglebug intellect was not at all remarkable in this country where everything is quite different than oz yet the wogglebug did not suspect this and being like so many other thoroughly educated persons proud of his mental attainments he marched along the street with an air of importance that made one wonder what great thoughts were occupying his massive brain  being about as big in his magnified state as a man the wogglebug took care to clothe himself like a man only instead of choosing sober colors for his garments he delighted in the most gorgeous reds and yellows and blues and greens so that if you looked at him long the brilliance of his clothing was liable to dazzle your eyes  i suppose the wagglebug did not realize at all what a queer appearance he made being rather nervous he seldom looked into a mirror and as the people he met avoided telling him he was unusual he had fallen into the habit of considering himself merely an ordinary citizen of the big city wherein he resided  so the wogglebug strutted proudly along the street swinging a cane in one hand flourishing a pink handkerchief in the other fumbling his watchfob with another and feeling his necktie was straight with another having four hands to use would prove rather puzzling to you or me i imagine but the woggiebug was thoroughly accustomed to them  presently he came to a very fine store with big plateglass windows and standing in the center of the biggest window was a creature so beautiful and radiant and altogether charming that the first glance at her nearly took his breath away her complexion was lovely for it was wax but the thing which really caught the wogglebugs fancy was the marvelous dress she wore indeed it was the latest last years paris model although the wogglebug did not know that and the designer must have had a real woggly love for bright colors for the gown was made of red cloth covered with big checks which were so loud the fashion books called them wagnerian plaids  never had our friend the wogglebug seen such a beautiful gown before and it afflicted him so strongly that he straightaway fell in love with the entire outfiteven to the waxcomplexioned lady herself very politely he tipped his to her but she stared coldly back without in any way acknowledging the courtesy  never mind he thought faint heart never won fair lady and im determined to win this kaliedoscope of beauty or perish in the attempt you will notice that our insect had a way of using big words to express himself which leads us to suspect that the school system in oz is the same they employ in boston  as with swelling heart the wogglebug feasted his eyes upon the enchanting vision a small green tag that was attached to a button of the waist suddenly attracted his attention upon the tag was marked price 793greatly reduced  ah murmured the wogglebug my darling is in greatly reduced circumstances and 793 will make her mine where oh where shall i find the seven ninetythree wherewith to liberate this divinity and make her mrs wogglebug  move on said a gruff policeman who came along swinging his club and the wogglebug obediently moved on his brain working fast and furious in the endeavor to think of a way to procure seven dollars and ninetythree cents  you see in the land of oz they use no money at all so that when the wogglebug arrived in america he did not possess a single penny and no one had presented him with any money since  yet there must be several ways to procure money in this country he reflected for otherwise everybody would be as penniless as i am but how i wonder do they manage to get it  just then he came along a side street where a number of men were at work digging a long and deep ditch in which to lay a new sewer  now these men thought the wogglebug must get money for shoveling all that earth else they wouldnt do it here is my chance to win the charming vision of beauty in the shop window  seeking out the foreman he asked for work and the foreman agreed to hire him  how much do you pay these workmen asked the highly magnified one  two dollars a day answered the foreman  then said the wogglebug you must pay me four dollars a day for i have four arms to their two and can do double their work  if that is so ill pay you four dollars agreed the man  the wogglebug was delighted  in two days he told himself as he threw off his brilliant coat and placed his hat upon it and rolled up his sleeves in two days i can earn eight dollarsenough to purchase my greatly reduced darling and buy her seven cents worth of caramels besides  he seized two spades and began working so rapidly with his four arms that the foreman said you must have been forewarned  why asked the insect  because theres a saying that to be forewarned is to be fourarmed replied the other  that is nonsense said the wogglebug digging with all his might for they call you the foreman and yet i only see one of you  ha ha laughed the man and he was so proud of his new worker that he went into the corner saloon to tell his friend the barkeeper what a treasure he had found  it was just after noon that the wogglebug hired as a ditchdigger in order to win his hearts desire so at noon on the second day he quit work and having received eight silver dollars he put on his coat and rushed away to the store that he might purchase his intended bride  but alas for the uncertainty of all our hopes just as the wogglebug reached the door he saw a lady coming out of the store dressed in identical checks with which he had fallen in love  at first he did not know what to do or say for the young ladys complexion was not waxfar from it but a glance into the window showed him the wax lady now dressed in a plain black tailormade suit and at once he knew the wearer of the wagnerian plaids was his real love and not the stiff creature behind the glass  beg pardon he exclaimed stopping the young lady but youre mine heres the seven ninetythree and seven cents for candy  but she glanced at him in a haughty manner and walked away with her nose slightly elevated  he followed he could not do otherwise with those delightful checks shining before him like beaconlights to urge him on  the young lady stepped into a car which whirled away rapidly for a moment he was nearly paralyzed at his loss then he started after the car as fast as he could go and this was very fast indeedhe being a wogglebug  somebody cried stop thief and a policeman ran out to arrest him but the wogglebug used his four hands to push the officer aside and the astonished man went rolling into the gutter so recklessly that his uniform bore marks of the encounter for many days  still keeping an eye on the car the wogglebug rushed on he frightened two dogs upset a fat gentleman who was crossing the street leaped over an automobile that shot in front of him and finally ran plump into the car which had abruptly stopped to let off a passenger breathing hard from his exertions he jumped upon the rear platform of the car only to see his charmer step off at the front and walk mincingly up the steps of a house despite his fatigue he flew after her at once crying out  stop my variegated dearstop dont you know youre mine  but she slammed the door in his face and he sat down upon the steps and wiped his forehead with his pink handkerchief and fanned himself with his hat and tried to think what he should do next  presently a very angry man came out of the house he had a revolver in one hand and a carvingknife in the other  what do you mean by insulting my wife he demanded  was that your wife asked the wogglebug in meek astonishment  of course it is my wife answered the man  oh i didnt know said the insect rather humbled but ill give you seven ninetythree for her thats all shes worth you know for i saw it marked on the tag  the man gave a roar of rage and jumped into the air with the intention of falling on the wogglebug and hurting him with the knife and pistol but the wogglebug was suddenly in a hurry and didnt wait to be jumped on indeed he ran so very fast that the man was content to let him go especially as the pistol wasnt loaded and the carvingknife was as dull as such knives usually are  but his wife had conceived a great dislike for the wagnerian check costume that had won for her the wogglebugs admiration ill never wear it again she said to her husband when he came in and told her that the wogglebug was gone  then he replied youd better give it to bridget for shes been bothering me about her wages lately and the present will keep her quite for a month longer  so she called bridget and presented her with the dress and the delighted servant decided to wear it that night to mickey schwartzs ball  now the poor wogglebug finding his affection scorned was feeling very blue and unhappy that evening when he walked out dressed among other things in a purplestriped shirt with a yellow necktie and peagreen gloves he looked a great deal more cheerful than he really was he had put on another hat for the wogglebug had a superstition that to change his hat was to change his luck and luck seemed to have overlooked the fact that he was in existence  the hat may really have altered his fortunes as the insect shortly met ikey swanson who gave him a ticket to mickey schwartzs ball for ikeys clean dickey had not come home from the laundry and so he could not go himself  the wogglebug thinking to distract his mind from his dreams of love attended the hall and the first thing he saw as he entered the room was bridget clothed in that same gorgeous gown of wagnerian plaid that had so fascinated his bugly heart  the dear bridget had added to her charms by putting seven fullblown imitation roses and three secondhand ostrichplumes in her red hair so that her entire person glowed like a sunset in june  the wogglebug was enraptured and although the divine bridget was waltzing with fritzie casey the insect rushed to her side and seizing her with all his four arms at once cried out in his truly educated bostonian way  oh my superlative conglomeration of beauty i have found you at last  bridget uttered a shriek and fritzie casey doubled two fists that looked like tombstones and advanced upon the intruder  still embracing the plaid costume with two arms the wogglebug tipped mr casey over with the other two but bridget made a bound and landed with her broad heel which supported 180 pounds firmly upon the insects toes he gave a yelp of pain and promptly released the lady and a moment later he found himself flat upon the floor with a dozen of the dancers piled upon himall of whom were pummeling each other with much pleasure and a firm conviction that the diversion had been planned for their special amusement  but the wogglebug had the strength of many men and when he flopped the big wings that were concealed by the tails of his coat the gentlemen resting upon him were scattered like autumn leaves in a gust of wind  the insect stood up rearranged his dress and looked about him bridget had run away and gone home and the others were still fighting amongst themselves with exceeding cheerfulness so the wogglebug selected a hat which fit him his own having been crushed out of shape and walked sorrowfully back to his lodgings  evidently that was not a lucky hat i wore to the ball he reflected but perhaps this one i now have will bring about a change in my fortunes  bridget needed money and as she had worn her brilliant costume once and allowed her friends to see how becoming it was she carried it the next morning to a secondhand dealer and sold it for three dollars in cash  scarcely had she left the shop when a lady of swedish extractiona widow with four small children in her trainentered and asked to look at a gown the dealer showed her the one he had just bought from bridget and its gay coloring so pleased the widow that she immediately purchased it for 365  ay tank ets a good deal money by sure she said to herself but das leedle children mus have new fadder to mak mind un tak care dere mudder like by yimminy an ay tank no man look may way in das ole dress i been wearing  she took the gown and the four children to her home where she lost no time in trying on the costume which fitted her as perfectly as a floursack does a peck of potatoes  das beautiful she exclaimed in rapture as she tried to see herself in a cracked mirror ay go das very afternoon to valk in da park for das manfolks go crazylike ven he sees may fine frocks  then she took her green parasol and a handbag stuffed with papers to make it look prosperous and aristocratic and sallied forth to the park followed by all her interesting flock  the men didnt fail to look at her as you may guess but none looked with yearning until the wogglebug sauntering gloomily along a path happened to raise his eyes and see before him his hearts delight the very identical wagnerian plaids which had filled him with such unbounded affection  aha my excruciatingly lovely creation he cried running up and kneeling before the widow i have found you once again do not i beg of you treat me with coldness  for he had learned from experience not to unduly startle his charmer at their first moment of meeting so he made a firm attempt to control himself that the wearer of the checked gown might not scorn him  the widow had no great affection for bugs having wrestled with the species for many years but this one was such a bigbug and so handsomely dressed that she saw no harm in encouraging himespecially as the men she had sought to captivate were proving exceedingly shy  so you tank ay i ban loavely she asked with a coy glance at the insect  i do with all my heart i do protested the wogglebug placing all four hands one after another over that beating organ  das mak plenty trouble by you i dond could be yours sighed the widow indeed regretting her admirer was not an ordinary man  why not asked the wogglebug i have still the seven ninetythree and as that was the original price and you are now slightly worn and secondhanded i do not see why i need despair of calling you my own  it is very queer when we think of it that the wogglebug could not separate the wearer of his lovely gown from the gown itself indeed he always made love directly to the costume that had so enchanted him without any regard whatsoever to the person inside it and the only way we can explain this remarkable fact is to recollect that the wogglebug was only a wogglebug and nothing more could be expected of him the widow did not of course understand his speech in the least but she gathered the fact that the wogglebug had id money so she sighed and hinted that she was very hungry and that there was a good shortorder restaurant just outside the park  the wogglebug became thoughtful at this he hated to squander his money which he had come to regard a sort of purchase price with which to secure his divinity but neither could he allow those darling checks to go hungry so he said  if you will come with me to the restaurant i will gladly supply you with food  the widow accepted the invitation at once and the wogglebug walked proudly beside her leading all of the four children at once with his four hands  two such gay costumes as those worn by the widow and the wogglebug are seldom found together and the restaurant man was so impressed by the sight that he demanded his money in advance  the four children jabbering delightedly in their broken english clambered upon four stools and the widow sat upon another and the wogglebug who was not hungry being engaged in feasting his eyes upon the checks laid down a silver dollar as a guarantee of good faith  it was wonderful to see so much pie and cake and breadandbutter and pickles and doughnuts and sandwiches disappear into the mouths of the four innocents and their comparatively innocent mother the wogglebug had to add another quarter to the vanished dollar before the score was finally settled and no sooner had the tribe trooped out restaurant than they turned into the open portals of an icecream parlor where they all attacked huge stacks of pale icecream and consumed several plates of ladyfingers and creampuffs  again the wogglebug reluctantly abandoned a dollar but the end was not yet the dear children wanted candy and nuts and then they warned pink lemonade and then popcorn and chewinggum and always the wogglebug after a glance at the entrancing costume found himself unable to resist paying for the treat  it was nearly evening when the widow pleaded fatigue and asked to be taken home for none of them was able to eat another morsel and the wogglebug wearied her with his protestations of boundless admiration  will you permit me to call upon you this evening asked the insect pleadingly as he bade the wearer of the gown goodbye on her doorstep  sure like she replied not caring to dismiss him harshly and the happy wogglebug went home with a light heart murmuring to himself  at last the lovely plaids are to be my own the new hat i found at the ball has certainly brought me luck  i am glad our friend the wogglebug had those few happy moments for he was destined to endure severe disappointments in the near future  that evening he carefully brushed his coat put on a green satin necktie and a purple embroidered waistcoat and walked briskly towards the house of the widow but alas as he drew near to the dwelling a most horrible stench greeted his nostrils a sense of great depression came over him and upon pausing before the house his body began to tremble and his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets  for the wily widow wishing to escape her admirer had sprinkled the doorstep and the front walk with insect exterminator and not even the wogglebugs love for the enchanting checked gown could induce him to linger longer in that vicinity  sick and discouraged he returned home where his first act was to smash the luckless hat and replace it with another but it was some time before he recovered from the horrors of that near approach to extermination and he passed a very wakeful and unhappy night indeed  meantime the widow had traded with a friend of hers who had once been a washlady for general funston the wagnerian costume for a crazy quilt and a corset that was nearly as good as new and a pair of silk stockings that were not mates it was a good bargain for both of them and the washlady being coloredthat is she had a deep mahogany complexionwas delighted with her gorgeous gown and put it on the very next morning when she went to deliver the wash to the bricklayers wife  surely it must have been fate that directed the wogglebugs steps for as he walked disconsolately along an intuition caused him to raise his eyes and he saw just ahead of him his affinitycarrying a large clothesbasket  stop he called our anxiously stop my fair grenadine i implore you  the colored lady cast one glance behind her and imagined that satan had at last arrived to claim her for she had never before seen the wogglebug and was horrified by his sudden and unusual appearance  go way mars debbil go way an lemme lone she screeched and the next minute she dropped her empty basket and sped up the street with a swiftness that only fear could have lent her flatbottomed feet  nevertheless the wogglebug might have overtaken her had he not stepped into the clothesbasket and fallen headlong becoming so tangled up in the thing that he rolled over and over several times before he could free himself then when he had picked up his hat which was utterly ruined and found his cane which had flown across the street his mahogany charmer in the wagnerian plaids had disappeared from view  with a sigh at his latest misfortune he returned home for another hat and the agitated washlady imagining that the devil had doubtless been lured by her beautiful gown made haste to sell it to a chinaman who lived next door  its bright colors pleased the chink who ripped it up and made it over into a chinese robe with flowing draperies falling to his heels he dressed himself in his new costume and being proud of possessing such finery sat down on a bench outside his door so that everyone passing by could see how magnificent he looked  it was here the wandering wogglebug espied him and recognizing at once the pattern and colors of his infatuating idol he ran up and sat beside the chinaman saying in agitated but educated tones  oh my prismatic personification of gigantic gorgeousnessagain i have found you  sure tling said the chink with composure  be mine only be mine continued the enraptured wogglebug  the chinaman did not quite understand  two dlolla a day he answered cautiously  oh joy exclaimed the insect in delight i can then own you for a day and a halffor i have three dollars left may i feel your exquisite texture my dearest fabric  no flabic no feelee you too flesh i man chinaman returned the oriental calmly  never mind that tis your beautiful garment i love every check in that entrancing dress is a joy and a delight to my heart  while the wogglebug thus raved the chinamans wife who was mattie de forest before she married him heard the conversation and decided this love affair had gone far enough so she suddenly appeared with a broomstick and with it began pounding the wogglebug as fiercely as possibleand mattie was no weakling i assure you  the first blow knocked the insects hat so far over his eyes that he was blinded but resolving not to be again cheated out of his darling he grasped firmly hold of the wagnerian plaids with all four hands and tore a goodly portion of it from the frightened celestials body  next moment he was dashing down the street with the precious cloth tucked securely underneath an arm and mattie being in slight dishabile did not think best to follow him  the triumphant joy of the wogglebug can well be imagined no more need he chase the fleeting vision of his loveno more submit to countless disappointments in his efforts to approach the object of his affection the gorgeous plaids were now his own or a large part of them anyway and upon reaching the quiet room wherein he lodged he gloated long and happily over its vivid coloring and violent contrasts of its glowing hues to the eyes of the wogglebug nothing could be more beautiful and he positively regretted the necessity of ever turning his gaze from this bewitching treasure  that he might never in the future be separated from the checks he folded them with many loving caresses into compact form and wrapped them in a sheet of stout paper tied with cotton cord that had a loveknot at the end wherever he went thereafter he carried the parcel underneath his left upper arm pressed as closely to his heart as possible and this sense of possession was so delightful that our wogglebug was happy as the day is long  in the evening his fortunes changed with cruel abruptness  he walked out to take the air and noticing a crowd people standing in an open space and surrounding a huge brown object our wogglebug stopped to learn what the excitement was about  pushing his way through the crowd and hugging his precious parcel he soon reached the inner circle of spectators and found they had assembled to watch a balloon ascension the professor who was to go up with the balloon had not yet arrived but the balloon itself was fully inflated and tugging hard at the rope that held it as if anxious to escape the blended breaths of the people that crowded around just below the balloon was a small basket attached to the netting of the gasbag and the wogglebug was bending over the edge of this to see what it contained when a warning cry from the crowd caused him to pause and glance over his shoulder  great horrors and crumpled creeps springing toward him with a scowl on his face and a long knife with a zigzag blade in his uplifted hand was that very chinaman from whose body he had torn the wagnerian plaids  the plundered celestial was evidently vindictive and intended to push the wicked knife into the wogglebugs body  our hero was a brave bug as can easily be proved but he did not wait for the knife to arrive at the broad of his back instead he gave a yell to show he was not afraid and leaped nimbly into the basket of the balloon the descending knife missing its intended victim fell upon the rope and severed it and instantly the great balloon from the crowd and soared majestically toward the heavens  the wogglebug had escaped the chinaman but he didnt know whether to be glad or not  for the balloon was earning him into the clouds and he had no idea how to manage it or to make it descend to earth again when he peered over the edge of the basket he could hear the faint murmur of the crowd and dimly see the enraged professor who had come too late pounding the chinaman while the chinaman tried to dissect the professor with his knife  then all was blotted out clouds rolled about him night fell the man in the moon laughed at him the stars winked at each other as if delighted at the wogglebugs plight and a witch riding by on her broomstick yelled at him to keep on the right side of the road and not run her down  but the wogglebug squatted in the bottom of the basket and hugging his precious parcel to his bosom paid no attention to anything but his own thoughts  he had often ridden in the gump but never had he been so high as this and the distance to the ground made him nervous  when morning came he saw a strange country far beneath him and longed to tread the earth again  now all wogglebugs are born with wings and our highlymagnified one had a beautiful broad pair of floppers concealed beneath ample coattails but long ago he had learned that his wings were not strong enough to lift his big body from the ground so he had never tried to fly with them  here however was an occasion when he might put these wings to good use for if he spread them in the air and then leaped over the side of the basket they would act in the same way a parachute does and bear him gently to the ground  no sooner did this thought occur to him than he put it into practice  disentangling his wings from his coattails he spread them as wide as possible and then jumped from the car of the balloon  down down the wogglebug sank but so slowly that there was no danger in the flight he began to see the earth again lying beneath him like a sunkissed panorama of mud and frogponds and rocks and brushwood  there were few trees yet it was our insects fate to drop directly above what trees there were so that presently he came kerplunk into a mass of tangled branchesand stuck there with his legs dangling helplessly between two limbs and his wings caught in the foliage at either side  below was a group of arab children who at first started to run away but seeing that the queer creature which had dropped from the skies was caught fast in the tree they stopped and began to throw stones and clubs at it one of the missiles struck the treelimb at the right of the wogglebug and jarred him loose the next instant he fluttered to the ground where his first act was to fold up his wings and tuck them underneath his coattails again and his next action was to assure himself that the beloved plaids were still safe  then he looked for the arab children but they had scuttled away towards a group of tents and now several men with dark skins and gay clothing came from the tents and ran towards the wogglebug  good morning said our hero removing his hat with a flourish and bowing politely  meblachebah shouted the biggest arab and at once two others wound coils of rope around the wogglebug and tied the ends in hard knots  his hat was knocked off and trampled into the mud by the shiek who was the big arab and the precious parcel was seized and ruthlessly opened  very good said the shiek eyeing the plaids with pleasure my slaves shall make me a new waistcoat of this cloth  no oh no cried the agonized insect it is taken from a person who has had smallpox and yellowfever and toothache and mumpsall at the same time do not i bet you risk your valuable life by wearing that cloth  bah said the shiek scornfully i have had all those diseases and many more i am immune but now he continued allow me to bid you goodbye i am sorry to be obliged to kill you but such is our custom  this was bad news for the wogglebug but he did not despair  are you not afraid to kill me he asked as if surprised  why should i be afraid demanded the shiek  because it is wellknown that to kill a wogglebug brings bad luck to one  the shiek hesitated for he was very superstitious  are you a wogglebug he asked  i am replied the insect proudly and i may as well tell you that the last person who killed one of my race had three unlucky days the first his suspenders broke the arab shuddered the second day he smashed a lookingglass the arab moaned and the third day he was chewed up by a crocodile  now the greatest aversion arabs have is to be chewed by a crocodile because these people usually roam over the sands of the desert where to meet an amphibian is simply horrible so at the wogglebugs speech they set up a howl of fear and the shiek shouted  unbind him let not a hair of his head be injured  at once the knots in the ropes were untied and the wogglebug was free all the arabs united to show him deference and every respectful attention and since his own hat had been destroyed they wound about his head a picturesque turban of an exquisite soiled white color having stripes of red and yellow in it  then the wogglebug was escorted to the tents where he suddenly remembered his precious plaids and asked that the cloth he restored to him  thereupon the shiek got up and made a long speech in which he described his grief at being obliged to refuse the request  at the end of that time one of the women came op to them with a lovely waistcoat which she had manufactured out of the wagnerian plaids and when the shiek saw it he immediately ordered all the tomtoms and kettledrums in the camp destroyed as they were no longer necessary then he put on the gorgeous vestment and turned a deaf ear to the wogglebugs agonized wails  but there were some scraps of cloth left and to show that he was liberal and goodnatured the shiek ordered these manufactured into a handsome necktie which he presented wogglebug in another long speech  our hero realizing a larger part of his darling was lost to him decided to be content with the smaller share so he put on the necktie and felt really proud of its brilliance and aggressive elegance  then bidding the arabs farewell he strode across the desert until he reached the borders of a more fertile and favored country  indeed he found before him a cool and enticing jungle which at first seemed deserted but while he stared about him a sound fell upon his ear and he saw approaching a young lady chimpanzee she was evidently a personage of some importance for her hair was neatly banged just over her eyes and she wore a clean white pinafore with bows of pink ribbon at the shoulders  good morning mr beetle said she with merry laughter  do not i beg of you call me a beetle exclaimed our hero rather peevishly for i am actually a wogglebug and highlymagnified at that  whats in a name laughed the gay damsel come let me introduce you to our jungle where strangers of good breeding are always welcome  as for breeding said the wogglebug my father although of ordinary size was a famous bugwizard in his day and claimed descent from the original protoplasm which constituted the nucleus of the present planetary satellite upon which we exist  thats all right returned miss chim tell that to our king and hell decorate you with the medal of the omnipotent order of onerous orthographers are you ready to meander  the wogglebug did not like the flippant tone in which maiden spoke but he at once followed her  presently they came to a tall hedge surrounding the inner jungle and without this hedge stood a patrol of brown bears who wore red soldiercaps and carried goldplated muskets in their hands  we call this the bearier said miss chim pointing to the soldiers because they oblige all strangers to paws  i should think it was a bearicade remarked the wogglebug  but when they approached the gateway the officer in charge saluted respectfully to miss chim and permitted her to escort the wogglebug into the sacred precincts of the inner jungle  here his eyes were soon opened to their widest capacity in genuine astonishment  the jungle was as clean and as wellregulated as any city of men the insect had ever visited just within the gate a sleek antelope was running a popcorn stand and a little further on a screechowl stood upon a stump playing a violin while across her breast was a sign reading i am blindat present  as they walked up the street they came to a big grey monkey turning a handorgan and attached to a cord was a little niggerboy whom the monkey sent into the crowd of animals standing by to gather up the pennies pulling him back every now and then by means of the cord  theres a curious animal for you said miss chim pointing to the boy those horrid things they call men whether black or white seem to me the lowest of all created beasts  i have seen them in a highly civilized state replied the wogglebug and theyre really further advanced than you might suppose  but miss chim gave a scornful laugh and pulled him away to where a hippopotamus sat under the shade of a big tree mopping his brow with a red handkerchieffor the weather was somewhat sultry before the hip was a table covered with a blue cloth and upon the cloth was embroidered the words professor hipmus fortune teller  want your fortune told asked miss chim  i dont mind replied the wogglebug  ill read your hand said the professor with a yawn that startled the insect to my notion palmistry is the best means of finding out what nobody knows or cares to know  he took the upperright hand of the wogglebug and after adjusting his spectacles bent over it with an air of great wisdom  you have been in love announced the professor but you got it in the neck  true murmured the astonished insect putting up his left lower hand to feel of the beloved necktie  you think you have won continued the hip but there are others who have 1 2 you have many heart throbs before you during your future life afterward i see no heart throbs whatever forty cents please  isnt he just wonderful asked miss chim with enthusiasm hes the greatest fortune teller in the jungle  on account of his size i suppose returned the wogglebug as they walked on  soon they came to the royal palace which was a beautiful bower formed of vines upon which grew many brillianthued forest flowers the entrance was guarded by a zebra who barred admission until miss chim whispered the password in his ear then he permitted them to enter and the chimpanzee immediately ushered the wogglebug into the presence of king weasel  this monarch lay coiled upon a purple silk cushion half asleep and yet wakeful enough to be smoking a big cigar beside him crouched two prairiedogs who were combing his hair very carefully while a red squirrel perched near his head and fanned him with her bushy tail  dear me what have we here exclaimed the king of the jungle in a querulous tone is it an overgrown pinchbug or is it a kissingbug  i have the honor to be a wogglebug your majesty replied our hero proudly  sav cut out that majesty snapped the king with a scowl if you can find anything majestic about me id like to know what it is  dont treat him with any respect whispered miss chim to the insect or youll get him riled sneer at him and slap his face if you get a chance  the wogglebug took the hint  really he told the king i have never seen a more despicable creature than you the admirable perspicacity inherent in your tribe seems to have deteriorated in you to a hyperbolated insousancy then he reached out his arms and slapped the king four times twice on one side of his face and twice on the other  thanks my dear junebug said the monarch i now recognize you to be a person of some importance  sire i am a wogglebug highly magnified and thoroughly educated it is no exaggeration to say i am the greatest wogglebug on earth  i fully believe it so pray do not play any more foursomes on my jaw i am sufficiently humiliated at this moment to recognize you as a sullivanthauros should you claim to be a member of that extinct race  then two little weaselsa boy weasel and a girl weaselcame into the bower and threw their schoolbooks at the squirrel so cleverly that one hit the king upon the nose and smashed his cigar and the other caught him fairly in the pit of his stomach  at first the monarch howled a bit then he wiped the tears from his face and said  ah what delightful children i have what do you wish my darlings  i want a cent for chewing gum said the girl weasel  get it from the guineapig you have my assent and what does my dear boy want  pop went the weasel our billygoat has swallowed the hare you gave me to play with  dear me sighed the king how often i find a hair in the butter whenever i reign people carry umbrellas and my son although quite polished indulges only in monkeyshines uneasy lies the head that wears a crown but if one is scalped the loss of the crown renders the head still more uneasy  couldnt they find a better king than you enquired the wogglebug curiously as the children left the bower  yes but no worse answered the weasel and here in the jungle honors are conferred only upon the unworthy for if a truly great animal is honored he gets a swelled head and that renders him unbearable they now regard the king of the jungle with contempt and that makes all my subjects selfrespecting  there is wisdom in that declared the wogglebug approvingly a single glance at you makes me content with being so excellent a bug  true murmured the king yawning but you tire me good stranger miss chim will you kindly get the gasoline can its high time to eradicate this insect  with pleasure said miss chim moving away with a smile  but the wogglebug did not linger to be eradicated with one wild bound he cleared the door of the palace and sprinted up the entrance of the jungle the bear soldiers saw him running away and took careful aim and fired but the goldplated muskets would not shoot straight and now the wogglebug was far distant and still running with all his might  nor did he pause until he had emerged from the forest and crossed the plains and reached at last the city from whence he had escaped in the balloon and once again in his old lodgings he looked at himself in the mirror and said  after all this necktie is my loveand my love is now mine forevermore why should i not be happy and content   the end   a full account of the wogglebug is given in mr baums delightful counter story the marvelous land of oz in which is also narrated the amazing adventures of the scarecrow the tin woodman jack pumpkinhead and the animated saw horse
