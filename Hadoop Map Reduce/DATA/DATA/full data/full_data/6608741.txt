6608741	the evil genius  a domestic story  by wilkie collins                  affectionately dedicated                to holman hunt     before the story  miss westerfields education  1the trial  the gentlemen of the jury retired to consider their verdict  their foreman was a person doubly distinguished among his colleagues he had the clearest head and the readiest tongue for once the right man was in the right place  of the eleven jurymen four showed their characters on the surface they were  the hungry juryman who wanted his dinner  the inattentive juryman who drew pictures on his blotting paper  the nervous juryman who suffered from fidgets  the silent juryman who decided the verdict  of the seven remaining members one was a little drowsy man who gave no trouble one was an irritable invalid who served under protest and five represented that vast majority of the populationeasily governed tranquilly happywhich has no opinion of its own    the foreman took his place at the head of the table his colleagues seated themselves on either side of him then there fell upon that assembly of men a silence never known among an assembly of womenthe silence which proceeds from a general reluctance to be the person who speaks first  it was the foremans duty under these circumstances to treat his deliberative brethren as we treat our watches when they stop he wound the jury up and set them going  gentlemen he began have you formed any decided opinion on the casethus far  some of them said yes and some of them said no the little drowsy man said nothing the fretful invalid cried go on the nervous juryman suddenly rose his brethren all looked at him inspired by the same fear of having got an orator among them he was an essentially polite man and he hastened to relieve their minds pray dont be alarmed gentlemen i am not going to make a speech i suffer from fidgets excuse me if i occasionally change my position the hungry juryman who dined early looked at his watch halfpast four he said for heavens sake cut it short he was the fattest person present and he suggested a subject to the inattentive juryman who drew pictures on his blottingpaper deeply interested in the progress of the likeness his neighbors on either side looked over his shoulders the little drowsy man woke with a start and begged pardon of everybody the fretful invalid said to himself damned fools all of them the patient foreman biding his time stated the case  the prisoner waiting our verdict gentlemen is the honorable roderick westerfield younger brother of the present lord le basque he is charged with willfully casting away the british bark john jerniman under his command for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining a share of the insurance money and further of possessing himself of certain brazilian diamonds which formed part of the cargo in plain words here is a gentleman born in the higher ranks of life accused of being a thief before we attempt to arrive at a decision we shall only be doing him justice if we try to form some general estimate of his character based on the evidenceand we may fairly begin by inquiring into his relations with the noble family to which he belongs the evidence so far is not altogether creditable to him being at the time an officer of the royal navy he appears to have outraged the feelings of his family by marrying a barmaid at a publichouse  the drowsy juryman happening to be awake at that moment surprised the foreman by interposing a statement talking of barmaids he said i know a curates daughter shes in distressed circumstances poor thing and shes a barmaid somewhere in the north of england curiously enough the name of the town has escaped my memory if we had a map of england there he was interrupted cruelly interrupted by one of his brethren  and by what right cried the greedy juryman speaking under the exasperating influence of hungerby what right does mr westerfields family dare to suppose that a barmaid may not be a perfectly virtuous woman  hearing this the restless gentleman in the act of changing his position was suddenly inspired with interest in the proceedings pardon me for putting myself forward he said with his customary politeness speaking as an abstainer from fermented liquors i must really protest against these allusions to barmaids  speaking as a consumer of fermented liquors the invalid remarked i wish i had a barmaid and a bottle of champagne before me now  superior to interruption the admirable foreman went on  whatever you may think gentlemen of the prisoners marriage we have it in evidence that his relatives turned their backs on him from that momentwith the one merciful exception of the head of the family lord le basque exerted his influence with the admiralty and obtained for his brother then out of employment an appointment to a ship all the witnesses agree that mr westerfield thoroughly understood his profession if he could have controlled himself he might have risen to high rank in the navy his temper was his ruin he quarreled with one of his superior officers  under strong provocation said a member of the jury  under strong provocation the foreman admitted but provocation is not an excuse judged by the rules of discipline the prisoner challenged the officer on duty to fight a duel at the first opportunity on shore and receiving a contemptuous refusal struck him on the quarterdeck as a matter of course mr westerfield was tried by courtmartial and was dismissed the service lord le basques patience was not exhausted yet the merchant service offered a last chance to the prisoner of retrieving his position to some extent at least he was fit for the sea and fit for nothing else at my lords earnest request the owners of the john jerniman trading between liverpool and rio took mr westerfield on trial as first mate and to his credit be it said he justified his brothers faith in him in a tempest off the coast of africa the captain was washed overboard and the first mate succeeded to the command his seamanship and courage saved the vessel under circumstances of danger which paralyzed the efforts of the other officers he was confirmed rightly confirmed in the command of the ship and so far we shall certainly not be wrong if we view his character on the favorable side  there the foreman paused to collect his ideas  certain members of the assemblyled by the juryman who wanted his dinner and supported by his inattentive colleague then engaged in drawing a ship in a storm and a captain falling overboardproposed the acquittal of the prisoner without further consideration but the fretful invalid cried stuff and the five jurymen who had no opinions of their own struck by the admirable brevity with which he expressed his sentiments sang out in chorus hear hear hear the silent juryman hitherto overlooked now attracted attention he was a baldheaded person of uncertain age buttoned up tight in a long frockcoat and wearing his gloves all through the proceedings when the chorus of five cheered he smiled mysteriously everybody wondered what that smile meant the silent juryman kept his opinion to himself from that moment he began to exercise a furtive influence over the jury even the foreman looked at him on resuming the narrative  after a certain term of service gentlemen during which we learn nothing to his disadvantage the prisoners merits appear to have received their reward he was presented with a share in the ship which he commanded in addition to his regular salary as master with these improved prospects he sailed from liverpool on his last voyage to brazil and no one his wife included had the faintest suspicion that he left england under circumstances of serious pecuniary embarrassment the testimony of his creditors and of other persons with whom he associated distinctly proves that his leisure hours on shore had been employed in cardplaying and in betting on horse races after an unusually long run of luck his good fortune seems to have deserted him he suffered considerable losses and was at last driven to borrowing at a high rate of interest without any reasonable prospect of being able to repay the moneylenders into whose hands he had fallen when he left rio on the homeward voyage there is no sort of doubt that he was returning to england to face creditors whom he was unable to pay there gentlemen is a noticeable side to his character which we may call the gambling side and which as i think was too leniently viewed by the judge  he evidently intended to add a word or two more but the disagreeable invalid insisted on being heard  in plain english he said you are for finding the prisoner guilty  in plain english the foreman rejoined i refuse to answer that question  why  because it is no part of my duty to attempt to influence the verdict  you have been trying to influence the verdict sir ever since you entered this room i appeal to all the gentlemen present  the patience of the longsuffering foreman failed him at last not another word shall pass my lips he said until you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty among yourselvesand then ill tell you if i agree to your verdict  he folded his arms and looked like the image of a man who intended to keep his word  the hungry juryman laid himself back in his chair and groaned the amateur artist who had thus far found a fund of amusement in his blottingpaper yawned discontentedly and dropped his pen the courteous gentleman who suffered from fidgets requested leave to walk up and down the room and at the first turn he took woke the drowsy little man and maddened the irritable invalid by the creaking of his boots the chorus of five further than ever from arriving at an opinion of their own looked at the silent juryman once more he smiled mysteriously and once more he offered an explanation of what was passing in his mindexcept that he turned his bald head slowly in the direction of the foreman was he in sympathy with a man who had promised to be as silent as himself  in the meantime nothing was said or done helpless silence prevailed in every part of the room  why the devil doesnt somebody begin cried the invalid have you all forgotten the evidence  this startling question roused the jury to a sense of what was due to their oaths if not to themselves some of them recollected the evidence in one way and some of them recollected it in another and each man insisted on doing justice to his own excellent memory and on stating his own unanswerable view of the case  the first man who spoke began at the middle of the story told by the witnesses in court i am for acquitting the captain gentlemen he ordered out the boats and saved the lives of the crewand i am for finding him guilty because the ship struck on a rock in broad daylight and in moderate weatheri agree with you sir the evidence shows that the vessel was steered dangerously near to the land by direction of the captain who gave the coursecome come gentlemen let us do the captain justice the defense declares that he gave the customary course and that it was not followed when he left the deck as for his leaving the ship in moderate weather the evidence proves that he believed he saw signs of a storm brewingyes yes all very well but what were the facts when the loss of the ship was reported the brazilian authorities sent men to the wreck on the chance of saving the cargo and days afterward there the ship was found just as the captain and the crew had left herdont forget sir that the diamonds were missing when the salvors examined the wreckall right but thats no proof that the captain stole the diamonds and before they had saved half the cargo a storm did come on and break the vessel up so the poor man was only wrong in the matter of time after allallow me to remind you gentlemen that the prisoner was deeply in debt and therefore had an interest in stealing the diamondswait a little sir fair plays a jewel who was in charge of the deck when the ship struck the second mate and what did the second mate do when he heard that his owners had decided to prosecute he committed suicide is there no proof of guilt in that actyou are going a little too fast sir the coroners jury declared that the second mate killed himself in a state of temporary insanitygently gently we have nothing to do with what the coroners jury said what did the judge say when he summed upbother the judge he said what they all say find the prisoner guilty if you think he did it and find him not guilty if you think he didnt and then he went away to his comfortable cup of tea in his private room and here are we perishing of hunger and our families dining without usspeak for yourself sir i havent got a familyconsider yourself lucky sir i have got twelve and my life is a burden to me owing to the difficulty of making both ends meetgentlemen gentlemen we are wandering again is the captain guilty or not mr foreman we none of us intended to offend you will you tell us what you think  no the foreman kept his word decide for yourselves first was his only reply  in this emergency the member afflicted with fidgets suddenly assumed a position of importance he started a new idea  suppose we try a show of hands he suggested gentlemen who find the prisoner guilty will please hold up their hands  three votes were at once registered in this way including the vote of the foreman after a moment of doubt the chorus of five decided on following the opinion which happened to be the first opinion expressed in point of time thereupon the show of hands for the condemnation of the prisoner rose to eight would this result have an effect on the undecided minority of four in any case they were invited to declare themselves next only three hands were held up one incomprehensible man abstained from expressing his sentiments even by a sign is it necessary to say who that man was a mysterious change had now presented itself in his appearance which made him an object of greater interest than ever his inexplicable smile had vanished he sat immovable with closed eyes was he meditating profoundly or was he only asleep the quickwitted foreman had long since suspected him of being simply the stupidest person presentwith just cunning enough to conceal his own dullness by holding his tongue the jury arrived at no such sensible conclusion impressed by the intense solemnity of his countenance they believed him to be absorbed in reflections of the utmost importance to the verdict after a heated conference among themselves they decided on inviting the one independent member presentthe member who had taken no part in their proceedingsto declare his opinion in the plainest possible form which way does your view of the verdict incline sir guilty or not guilty  the eyes of the silent juryman opened with the slow and solemn dilation of the eyes of an owl placed between the alternatives of declaring himself in one word or in two his taciturn wisdom chose the shortest form of speech guilty he answeredand shut his eyes again as if he had had enough of it already  an unutterable sense of relief pervaded the meeting enmities were forgotten and friendly looks were exchanged with one accord the jury rose to return to court the prisoners fate was sealed the verdict was guilty   2the sentence   the low hum of talk among the persons in court ceased when the jury returned to their places curiosity now found its center of attraction in the prisoners wifewho had been present throughout the trial the question of the moment was how will she bear the interval of delay which precedes the giving of the verdict  in the popular phrase mrs westerfield was a showy woman her commanding figure was finely robed in dark colors her profuse light hair hung over her forehead in little clusters of ringlets her features firmly but not delicately shaped were on a large scale no outward betrayal of the wifes emotion rewarded the public curiosity her bold lightgray eyes sustained the general gaze without flinching to the surprise of the women present she had brought her two young children with her to the trial the eldest was a pretty little girl of ten years old the second child a boy sat on his mothers knee it was generally observed that mrs westerfield took no notice of her eldest child when she whispered a word from time to time it was always addressed to her son she fondled him when he grew restless but she never looked round to see if the girl at her side was as weary of the proceedings as the boy  the judge took his seat and the order was given to bring the prisoner up for judgment  there was a long pause the audienceremembering his ghastly face when he first appeared before themwhispered to each other hes taken ill and the audience proved to be right  the surgeon of the prison entered the witnessbox and being duly sworn made his medical statement  the prisoners heart had been diseased for some time past and the malady had been neglected he had fainted under the prolonged suspense of waiting for the verdict the swoon had proved to be of such a serious nature that the witness refused to answer for consequences if a second faintingfit was produced by the excitement of facing the court and the jury  under these circumstances the verdict was formally recorded and sentence was deferred once more the spectators looked at the prisoners wife  she had risen to leave the court in the event of an adverse verdict her husband had asked for a farewell interview and the governor of the prison after consultation with the surgeon had granted the request it was observed when she retired that she held her boy by the hand and left the girl to follow a compassionate lady near her offered to take care of the children while she was absent mrs westerfield answered quietly and coldly thank youtheir father wishes to see them  the prisoner was dying nobody could look at him and doubt it  his eyes opened wearily when his wife and children approached the bed on which he lay helplessthe wreck of a grandlymade man he struggled for breath but he could still speak a word or two at a time i dont ask you what the verdict is he said to his wife i see it in your face  tearless and silent she waited by her husbands side he had only noticed her for a moment all his interest seemed to be centered in his children the girl stood nearest to him he looked at her with a faint smile  the poor child understood him crying piteously she put her arms around his neck and kissed him dear papa she said come home and let me nurse you  the surgeon watching the fathers face saw a change in him which the other persons present had not observed the failing heart felt that parting moment and sank under it take the child away the surgeon whispered to the mother brandy was near him he administered it while he spoke and touched the fluttering pulse it felt just felt the stimulant he revived for a moment and looked wistfully for his son the boy he murmured i want my boy as his wife brought the child to him the surgeon whispered to her again if you have anything to say to him be quick about it she shuddered she took his cold hand her touch seemed to nerve him with new strength he asked her to stoop over him they wont let me write here he whispered unless they see my letter he paused to get his breath again lift up my left arm he gasped open the wristband  she detached the stud which closed the wristband of the shirt on the inner side of the linen there was a line written in red lettersred of the color of blood she saw these words look in the lining of my trunk  what for she asked  the fading light in his eyes flashed on her a dreadful look of doubt his lips fell apart in the vain effort to answer his last sigh fluttered the light ringlets of her hair as she bent over him  the surgeon pointed to her children take the poor things home he said they have seen the last of their father  mrs westerfield obeyed in silence she had her own reasons for being in a hurry to get home leaving the children under the servants care she locked herself up in the dead mans room and emptied his trunk of the few clothes that had been left in it  the lining which she was now to examine was of the customary material and of the usual striped pattern in blue and white her fingers were not sufficiently sensitive to feel anything under the surface when she tried it with her hand turning the empty trunk with the inner side of the lid toward the light she discovered on one of the blue stripes of the lining a thin little shining stain which looked like a stain of dried gum after a moments consideration she cut the gummed line with a penknife something of a white color appeared through the aperture she drew out a folded sheet of paper  it proved to be a letter in her husbands handwriting an inclosure dropped to the floor when she opened it in the shape of a small slip of paper she picked it up the morsel of paper presented letters figures and crosses arranged in lines and mingled together in what looked like hopeless confusion   3the letter   mrs westerfield laid the incomprehensible slip of paper aside and in search of an explanation returned to the letter here again she found herself in a state of perplexity directed to mrs roderick westerfield the letter began abruptly without the customary form of address did it mean that her husband was angry with her when he wrote it meant that he doubted her  in these terms he expressed himself    i write to you before my trial takes place if the verdict goes in my favor i shall destroy what i have written if i am found guilty i must leave it to you to do what i should otherwise have done for myself  the undeserved misfortune that has overtaken me began with the arrival of my ship in the port of rio our second mate his duty for the day being done asked leave to go on shoreand never returned what motive determined him on deserting i am not able to say it was my own wish to supply his place by promoting the best seaman on board my owners agents overruled me and appointed a man of their own choosing  what nation he belonged to i dont know the name he gave me was beljames and he was reported to be a brokendown gentleman whoever he might be his manner and his talk were captivating everybody liked him  after the two calamities of the loss of the ship and the disappearance of the diamondsthese last being valued at five thousand poundsi returned to england by the first opportunity that offered having beljames for a companion  shortly after getting back to my house in london i was privately warned by a good friend that my owners had decided to prosecute me for willfully casting away the ship and crueler still for having stolen the missing diamonds the second mate who had been in command of the vessel when she struck on the rock was similarly charged along with me knowing myself to be innocent i determined of course to stand my trial my wonder was what beljames would do would he follow my example or if he got the chance would he try to make his escape  i might have thought it only friendly to give this person a word of warning if i had known where to find him we had separated when the ship reached the port of falmouth in cornwall and had not met since i gave him my address in london but he gave me no address in return  on the voyage home beljames told me that a legacy had been left to him being a small freehold house and garden in st johns wood london his agent writing to him on the subject had reported the place to be sadly out of repair and had advised him to find somebody who would take it off his hands on reasonable terms this seemed to point to a likelihood of his being still in london trying to sell his house  while my mind was running on these recollections i was told that a decent elderly woman wanted to see me she proved to be the landlady of the house in which beljames lodged and she brought an alarming message the man was dying and desired to see me i went to him immediately  few words are best when one has to write about ones own troubles  beljames had heard of the intended prosecution how he had been made aware of it death left him no time to tell me the miserable wretch had poisoned himselfwhether in terror of standing his trial or in remorse of conscience it is not any business of mine to decide most unluckily for me he first ordered the doctor and the landlady out of the room and then when we two were alone owned that he had purposely altered the course of the ship and had stolen the diamonds  to do him justice he was eager to save me from suffering for his fault  having eased his mind by confession he gave me the slip of paper written in cipher which you will find inclosed in this there is my note of the place where the diamonds are hidden he said among the many ignorant people who know nothing of ciphers i am oneand i told him so thats how i keep my secret he said write from my dictation and you shall know what it means lift me up first as i did it he rolled his head to and fro evidently in pain but he managed to point to pen ink and paper on a table hard by on which his doctor had been writing i left him for a moment to pull the table nearer to the bedand in that moment he groaned and cried out for help i ran to the room downstairs where the doctor was waiting when we got back to him he was in convulsions it was all over with beljames  the lawyers who are to defend me have tried to get experts as they call them to interpret the cipher the experts have all failed they will declare if they are called as witnesses that the signs on the paper are not according to any known rules and are marks made at random meaning nothing  as for any statement on my part of the confession made to me the law refuses to hear it except from the mouth of a witness i might prove that the ships course was changed contrary to my directions after i had gone below to rest if i could find the man who was steering at the time god only knows where that man is  on the other hand the errors of my past life and my being in debt are circumstances dead against me the lawyers seem to trust almost entirely in a famous counsel whom they have engaged to defend me for my own part i go to my trial with little or no hope  if the verdict is guilty and if you have any regard left for my character never rest until you have found somebody who can interpret these cursed signs do for me i say what i cannot do for myself recover the diamonds and when you restore them show my owners this letter  kiss the children for me i wish them when they are old enough to read this defense of myself and to know that their father who loved them dearly was an innocent man my good brother will take care of you for my sake i have done  roderick westerfield   mrs westerfield took up the cipher once more she looked at it as if it were a living thing that defied her  if i am able to read this gibberish she decided i know what ill do with the diamonds  4the garret  one year exactly after the fatal day of the trial mrs westerfield secluded in the sanctuary of her bedroom celebrated her release from the obligation of wearing widows weeds  the conventional graduations in the outward expression of grief which lead from black clothing to gray formed no part of this afflicted ladys system of mourning she laid her best blue walking dress and her new bonnet to match on the bed and admired them to her hearts content her discarded garments were left on the floor thank heaven ive done with you she saidand kicked her rusty mourning out of the way as she advanced to the fireplace to ring the bell  where is my little boy she asked when the landlady entered the room  hes down with me in the kitchen maam im teaching him to make a plum cake for himself hes so happy i hope you dont want him just now  not the least in the world i want you to take care of him while i am away bytheby wheres syd  the elder child the girl had been christened sydney in compliment to one of her fathers female relatives the name was not liked by her motherwho had shortened it to syd by way of leaving as little of it as possible with a look at mrs westerfield which expressed illconcealed aversion the landlady answered shes up in the lumberroom poor child she says you sent her there to be out of the way  ah to be sure i did  theres no fireplace in the garret maam im afraid the little girl must be cold and lonely  it was useless to plead for sydmrs westerfield was not listening her attention was absorbed by her own plump and pretty hands she took a tiny file from the dressingtable and put a few finishing touches to her nails send me some hot water she said i want to dress  the servant girl who carried the hot water upstairs was new to the ways of the house after having waited on mrs westerfield she had been instructed by the kindhearted landlady to go on to the top floor you will find a pretty little girl in the garret all by herself say you are to bring her down to my room as soon as her mamma has gone out  mrs westerfields habitual neglect of her eldest child was known to every person in the house even the new servant had heard of it interested by what she saw on opening the garret door she stopped on the threshold and looked in  the lumber in the room consisted of two rotten old trunks a broken chair and a dirty volume of sermons of the oldfashioned quarto size the grimy ceiling slanting downward to a cracked window was stained with rain that had found its way through the roof the faded wallpaper loosened by damp was torn away in some places and bulged loose in others there were holes in the skirtingboard and from one of them peeped the brightly timid eyes of the childs only living companion in the garreta mouse feeding on crumbs which she had saved from her breakfast  syd looked up when the mouse darted back into its hole on the opening of the door lizzie lizzie she said gravely you ought to have come in without making a noise you have frightened away my youngest child  the goodnatured servant burst out laughing have you got a large family miss she inquired humoring the joke  syd failed to see the joke only two more she answered as gravely as everand lifted up from the floor two miserable dolls reduced to the last extremity of dirt and dilapidation my two eldest this strange child resumed setting up the dolls against one of the empty trunks the eldest is a girl and her name is syd the other is a boy untidy in his clothes as you see their kind mamma forgives them when they are naughty and buys ponies for them to ride on and always has something nice for them to eat when they are hungry have you got a kind mamma lizzie and are you very fond of her  those innocent allusions to the neglect which was the one sad experience of syds young life touched the servants heart a bygone time was present to her memory when she too had been left without a playfellow to keep her company or a fire to warm her and she had not endured it patiently  oh my dear she said your poor little arms are red with cold come to me and let me rub them  but syds bright imagination was a better protection against the cold than all the rubbing that the hands of a merciful woman could offer you are very kind lizzie she answered i dont feel the cold when i am playing with my children i am very careful to give them plenty of exercise we are going to walk in the park  she gave a hand to each of the dolls and walked slowly round and round the miserable room pointing out visionary persons of distinction and objects of interest heres the queen my dears in her gilt coach drawn by six horses do you see her scepter poking out of the carriage window she governs the nation with that bow to the queen and now look at the beautiful bright water theres the island where the ducks live ducks are happy creatures they have their own way in everything and theyre good to eat when theyre dead at least they used to be good when we had nice dinners in papas time i try to amuse the poor little things lizzie their papa is dead im obliged to be papa and mamma to them both in one do you feel the cold my dears she shivered as she questioned her imaginary children now we are at home again she said and led the dolls to the empty fireplace roaring fires always in my house cried the resolute little creature rubbing her hands cheerfully before the bleak blank grate  warmhearted lizzie could control herself no longer  if the child would only make some complaint she burst out it wouldnt be so dreadful oh what a shame what a shame she cried to the astonishment of little syd come down my dear to the nice warm room where your brother is oh your mother i dont care if your mother sees us i should like to give your mother a piece of my mind there i dont mean to frighten you im one of your bad childreni fly into a passion you carry the dolls and ill carry you oh how she shivers give us a kiss  sympathy which expressed itself in this way was new to syd her eyes opened wide in childish wonderand suddenly closed again in childish terror when her good friend the servant passed mrs westerfields door on the way downstairs if mamma bounces out on us she whispered pretend we dont see her the nice warm room received them in safety under no stress of circumstances had mrs westerfield ever been known to dress herself in a hurry a good halfhour more had passed before the house door was heard to bangand the pleasant landlady peeping through the window said there she goes now well enjoy ourselves  5the landlord  mrs westerfields destination was the publichouse in which she had been once employed as a barmaid entering the place without hesitation she sent in her card to the landlord he opened the parlor door himself and invited her to walk in  you wear well he said admiring her have you come back here to be my barmaid again  do you think i am reduced to that she answered  well my dear more unlikely things have happened they tell me you depend for your income on lord le basqueand his lordships death was in the newspapers last week  and his lordships lawyers continue my allowance  having smartly set the landlord right in those words she had not thought it necessary to add that lady le basque continuing the allowance at her husbands request had also notified that it would cease if mrs westerfield married again  youre a lucky woman the landlord remarked well im glad to see you what will you take to drink  nothing thank you i want to know if you have heard anything lately of james bellbridge  the landlord was a popular person in his own circlenot accustomed to restrain himself when he saw his way to a joke heres constancy he said shes sweet on james after having jilted him twelve years ago  mrs westerfield replied with dignity i am accustomed to be treated respectfully she replied i wish you goodmorning  the easy landlord pressed her back into her chair dont be a fool he said james is in londonjames is staying in my house what do you think of that  mrs westerfields bold gray eyes expressed eager curiosity and interest you dont mean that he is going to be barman here again  no such luck my dear he is a gentleman at large who patronizes my house  mrs westerfield went on with her questions  has he left america for good  not he james bellbridge is going back to new york to open a saloon as they call it in partnership with another man hes in england he says on business its my belief that he wants money for this new venture on bad security theyre smart people in new york his only chance of getting his bills discounted is to humbug his relations down in the country  when does he go to the country  hes there now  when does he come back  youre determined to see him it appears he comes back tomorrow  is he married  aha now were coming to the point make your mind easy plenty of women have set the trap for him but he has not walked into it yet shall i give him your love  yes she said coolly as much love as you please  meaning marriage the landlord inquired  and money mrs westerfield added  lord le basques money  lord le basques money may go to the devil  hullo your language reminds me of the time when you were a barmaid you dont mean to say you have had a fortune left you  i do will you give a message to james  ill do anything for a lady with a fortune  tell him to come and drink tea with his old sweetheart tomorrow at six oclock  he wont do it  he will  with that difference of opinion they parted  6the brute  tomorrow cameand mrs westerfields faithful james justified her confidence in him  oh jemmy how glad i am to see you you dear dear fellow im yours at last  that depends my lady on whether i want you let go of my neck  the man who entered this protest against imprisonment in the arms of a fine woman was one of the human beings who are grown to perfection on english soil he had the fat face the pink complexion the hard blue eyes the scanty yellow hair the smile with no meaning in it the tremendous neck and shoulders the mighty fists and feet which are seen in complete combination in england only men of this breed possess a nervous system without being aware of it suffer affliction without feeling it exercise courage without a sense of danger marry without love eat and drink without limit and sink big as they are when disease attacks them without an effort to live  mrs westerfield released her guests bullneck at the word of command it was impossible not to submit to himhe was so brutal impossible not to admire himhe was so big  have you no love left for me was all she ventured to say  he took the reproof goodhumoredly love he repeated come i like thatafter throwing me over for a man with a handle to his name which am i to call you mrs or my lady  call me your own what is there to laugh at jemmy you used to be fond of me you would never have gone to america when i married westerfield if i hadnt been dear to you oh if im sure of anything im sure of that you wouldnt bear malice dear if you only knew how cruelly i have been disappointed  he suddenly showed an interest in what she was saying the brute became cheery and confidential so he made you a bad husband did he up with his fist and knocked you down i daresay if the truth was known  youre all in the wrong dear he would have been a good husband if i had cared about him i never cared about anybody but you it wasnt westerfield who tempted me to say yes  thats a lie  no indeed it isnt  then why did you marry him  when i married him jemmy there was a prospectoh how could i resist it think of being one of the le basques held in honor to the end of my life by that noble family whether my husband lived or died  to the barmans ears this sounded like sheer nonsense his experience in the publichouse suggested an explanation i say my girl have you been drinking  mrs westerfields first impulse led her to rise and point indignantly to the door he had only to look at herand she sat down again a tamed woman you dont understand how the chance tempted me she answered gently  what chance do you mean  the chance dear of being a lords mother  he was still puzzled but he lowered his tone the trueborn briton bowed by instinct before the woman who had jilted him when she presented herself in the character of a lords mother how do you make that out maria he asked politely  she drew her chair nearer to him when he called her by her christian name for the first time  when westerfield was courting me she said his brother my lord was a bachelor a ladyif one can call such a creature a ladywas living under his protection he told westerfield he was very fond of her and he hated the idea of getting married if your wifes first child turns out to be a son he said there is an heir to the title and estates and i may go on as i am now we were married a month afterwardand when my first child was born it was a girl i leave you to judge what the disappointment was my lord persuaded as i suspect by the woman i mentioned just now ran the risk of waiting another year and a year afterward rather than be married through all that time i had no other child or prospect of a child his lordship was fairly driven into taking a wife ah how i hate her their first child was a boya big bouncing healthy brute of a boy and six months afterward my poor little fellow was born only think of it and tell me jemmy dont i deserve to be a happy woman after suffering such a dreadful disappointment as that is it true that youre going back to america  quite true  take me back with you  with a couple of children  no only with one i can dispose of the other in england wait a little before you say no do you want money  you couldnt help me if i did  marry me and i can help you to a fortune  he eyed her attentively and saw that she was in earnest what do you call a fortune he asked  five thousand pounds she answered  his eyes opened his mouth opened he scratched his head even his impenetrable nature proved to be capable of receiving a shock five thousand pounds he asked faintly for a drop of brandy  she had a bottle of brandy ready for him  you look quite overcome she said  he was too deeply interested in the restorative influence of the brandy to take any notice of this remark when he had recovered himself he was not disposed to believe in the five thousand pounds  wheres the proof of it he said sternly  she produced her husbands letter did you read the trial of westerfield for casting away his ship she asked  i heard of it  will you look at this letter  is it long  yes  then suppose you read it to me  he listened with the closest attention while she read the question of stealing the diamonds if they could only be found did not trouble either of them it was a settled question by tacit consent on both sides but the value in money of the precious stones suggested a doubt that still weighed on his mind  how do you know theyre worth five thousand pounds he inquired  you dear old stupid doesnt westerfield himself say so in his letter  read that bit again  she read it again after the two calamities of the loss of the ship and the disappearance of the diamondsthese last being valued at five thousand poundsi returned to england  satisfied so far he wanted to look at the cipher next she handed it to him with a stipulation yours jemmy on the day when you marry me  he put the slip of paper into his pocket now ive got it he said suppose i keep it  a woman who has been barmaid at a publichouse is a woman not easily found at the end of her resources  in that case she curtly remarked i should first call in the police and then telegraph to my husbands employers in liverpool  he handed the cipher back i was joking he said  so was i she answered  they looked at each other they were made for each otherand they both felt it at the same time james kept his own interests steadily in view he stated the obvious objection to the cipher experts had already tried to interpret the signs and had failed  quite true she added but other people may succeed  how are you to find them  leave me to try will you give me a fortnight from today  all right anything else  one thing more get the marriage license at once  why  to show that you are in earnest  he burst out laughing it mightnt be much amiss he said if i took you back with me to america youre the sort of woman we want in our new saloon ill get the license goodnight  as he rose to go there was a soft knock at the door a little girl in a shabby frock ventured to show herself in the room  what do you want here her mother asked sharply  syd held out a small thin hand with a letter in it which represented her only excuse mrs westerfield read the letter and crumpled it up in her pocket one of your secrets james asked anything about the diamonds for instance  wait till you are my husband she said and then you may be as inquisitive as you please her amiable sweethearts guess had actually hit the mark during the year that had passed she too had tried her luck among the experts and had failed having recently heard of a foreign interpreter of ciphers she had written to ask his terms the reply just received not only estimated his services at an extravagantly high rate but asked cautious questions which it was not convenient to answer another attempt had been made to discover the mystery of the cipher and made in vain  james bellbridge had his moments of goodhumor and was on those rare occasions easily amused he eyed the child with condescending curiosity looks half starved he saidas if he were considering the case of a stray cat hollo there buy a bit of bread he tossed a penny to syd as she left the room and took the opportunity of binding his bargain with syds mother mind if i take you to new york im not going to be burdened with both your children is that girl the one you leave behind you  mrs westerfield smiled sweetly and answered yes dear  7the cipher  an advertisement in the newspapers addressed to persons skilled in the interpretation of ciphers now represented mrs westerfields only chance of discovering where the diamonds were hidden the first answer that she received made some amends for previous disappointment it offered references to gentlemen whose names were in themselves a sufficient guarantee she verified the references nevertheless and paid a visit to her correspondent on the same day  his personal appearance was not in his favorhe was old and dirty infirm and poor his mean room was littered with shabby books none of the ordinary courtesies of life seemed to be known to him he neither wished mrs westerfield goodmorning nor asked her to take a seat when she attempted to enter into explanations relating to her errand he rudely interrupted her  show me your cipher he said i dont promise to study it unless i find it worth my while  mrs westerfield was alarmed  do you mean that you want a large sum of money she asked  i mean that i dont waste my time on easy ciphers invented by fools  she laid the slip of paper on his desk  waste your time on that she said satirically and see how you like it  he examined itfirst with his bleared redrimmed eyes then with a magnifyingglass the only expression of opinion that escaped him was indicated by his actions he shut up his book and gloated over the signs and characters before him on a sudden he looked at mrs westerfield how did you come by this he asked  thats no business of yours  in other words you have reasons of your own for not answering my question  yes  drawing his own inferences from that reply he showed his three lastleft yellow teeth in a horrid grin i understand he said speaking to himself he looked at the cipher once more and put another question have you got a copy of this  it had not occurred to her to take a copy he rose and pointed to his empty chair his opinion of the cipher was to all appearance forced to express itself by the discovery that there was no copy  do you know what might happen he asked the only cipher that has puzzled me for the last ten years might be lostor stolenor burned if there was a fire in the house you deserve to be punished for your carelessness make the copy yourself  this desirable suggestion uncivilly as it was expressed had its effect upon mrs westerfield her marriage depended on that precious slip of paper she was confirmed in her opinion that this very disagreeable man might nevertheless be a man to be trusted  shall you be long in finding out what it means she asked when her task was completed  he carefully compared the copy with the originaland then he replied  days may pass before i can find the clew i wont attempt it unless you give me a week  she pleaded for a shorter interval he coolly handed back her papers the original and the copy  try somebody else he suggestedand opened his book again mrs westerfield yielded with the worst possible grace in granting him the week of delay she approached the subject of his fee for the second time how much will it cost me she inquired  ill tell you when ive done  that wont do i must know the amount first  he handed her back her papers for the second time mrs westerfields experience of poverty had never been the experience of such independence as this in sheer bewilderment she yielded again he took back the original cipher and locked it up in his desk call here this day week he saidand returned to his book  you are not very polite she told him on leaving the room  at any rate he answered i dont interrupt people when they are reading  the week passed  repeating her visit mrs westerfield found him still seated at his desk still surrounded by his books still careless of the polite attentions that he owed to a lady  well she asked have you earned your money  i have found the clew  what is it she burst out tell me the substance i cant wait to read  he went on impenetrably with what he had to say but there are some minor combinations which i have still to discover to my own satisfaction i want a few days more  she positively refused to comply with this request write down the substance of it she repeated and tell me what i owe you  he handed her back her cipher for the third time  the woman who could have kept her temper under such provocation as this may be found when the mathematician is found who can square the circle or the inventor who can discover perpetual motion with a furious look mrs westerfield expressed her opinion of the philosopher in two words you brute she failed to produce the slightest impression on him  my work he proceeded must be well done or not done at all this is saturday eleventh of the month we will say the evening of wednesday next  mrs westerfield sufficiently controlled herself to be able to review her engagements for the coming week on thursday the delay exacted by the marriage license would expire and the wedding might take place on friday the express train conveyed passengers to liverpool to be in time for the departure of the steamer for new york on saturday morning having made these calculations she asked with sulky submission if she was expected to call again on the wednesday evening  no leave me your name and address i will send you the cipher interpreted at eight oclock  mrs westerfield laid one of her visiting cards on his desk and left him  8the diamonds  the new week was essentially a week of events  on the monday morning mrs westerfield and her faithful james had their first quarrel she took the liberty of reminding him that it was time to give notice of the marriage at the church and to secure berths in the steamer for herself and her son instead of answering one way or another james asked how the expert was getting on  has your old man found out where the diamonds are  not yet  then well wait till he does  do you believe my word mrs westerfield asked curtly  james bellbridge answered with roman brevity no  this was an insult mrs westerfield expressed her sense of it she rose and pointed to the door go back to america as soon as you please she said and find the money you wantif you can  as a proof that she was in earnest she took her copy of the cipher out of the bosom of her dress and threw it into the fire the original is safe in my old mans keeping she added leave the room  james rose with suspicious docility and walked out having his own private ends in view  half an hour later mrs westerfields old man was interrupted over his work by a person of bulky and blackguard appearance whom he had never seen before  the stranger introduced himself as a gentleman who was engaged to marry mrs westerfield he requested not at all politely to be permitted to look at the cipher he was asked if he had brought a written order to that effect signed by the lady herself mr bellbridge resting his fists on the writingtable answered that he had come to look at the cipher on his own sole responsibility and that he insisted on seeing it immediately allow me to show you something else first was the reply he received to this assertion of his will and pleasure do you know a loaded pistol sir when you see it the barrel of the pistol approached within three inches of the barmans big head as he leaned over the writingtable for once in his life he was taken by surprise it had never occurred to him that a professed interpreter of ciphers might sometimes be trusted with secrets which placed him in a position of danger and might therefore have wisely taken measures to protect himself no power of persuasion is comparable to the power possessed by a loaded pistol james left the room and expressed his sentiments in language which has not yet found its way into any english dictionary  but he had two merits when his temper was in a state of repose he knew when he was beaten and he thoroughly appreciated the value of the diamonds when mrs westerfield saw him again on the next day he appeared with undeniable claims on her mercy notice of the marriage had been received at the church and a cabin had been secured for her on board the steamer  her prospects being thus settled to her own satisfaction mrs westerfield was at liberty to make her arrangements for the desertion of poor little syd  the person on whose assistance she could rely was an unmarried elder sister distinguished as proprietor of a cheap girls school in one of the suburbs of london this ladyknown to local fame as miss wiggerhad already proposed to take syd into training as a pupil teacher ill force the child on miss wigger promised till she can earn her board and lodging by taking my lowest class when she gets older she will replace my regular governess and i shall save the salary  with this proposal waiting for a reply mrs westerfield had only to inform her sister that it was accepted come here she wrote on friday next at any time before two oclock and syd shall be ready for you psi am to be married again on thursday and start for america with my husband and my boy by next saturdays steamer  the letter was posted and the mothers anxious mind was to use her own phrase relieved of another worry  as the hour of eight drew near on wednesday evening mrs westerfields anxiety forced her to find relief in action of some kind she opened the door of her sittingroom and listened on the stairs it still wanted for a few minutes to eight oclock when there was a ring at the housebell she ran down to open the door the servant happened to be in the hall and answered the bell the next moment the door was suddenly closed again  anybody there mrs westerfield asked  no maam  this seemed strange had the old wretch deceived her after all look in the letterbox she called out the servant obeyed and found a letter mrs westerfield tore it open standing on the stairs it contained half a sheet of common notepaper the interpretation of the cipher was written on it in these words  remember number 12 purbeck road st johns wood go to the summerhouse in the back garden count to the fourth plank in the floor reckoning from the side wall on the right as you enter the summerhouse prize up the plank look under the mould and rubbish find the diamonds  not a word of explanation accompanied these lines neither had the original cipher been returned the strange old man had earned his money and had not attended to receive ithad not even sent word where or how it might be paid had he delivered his letter himself he or his messenger had gone before the housedoor could be opened  a sudden suspicion of him turned her cold had he stolen the diamonds she was on the point of sending for a cab and driving it to his lodgings when james came in eager to know if the interpretation had arrived  keeping her suspicions to herself she merely informed him that the interpretation was in her hands he at once asked to see it she refused to show it to him until he had made her his wife put a chisel in your pocket when we go to church tomorrow morning was the one hint she gave him as thoroughly worthy of each other as ever the betrothed lovers distrusted each other to the last  at eleven oclock the next morning they were united in the bonds of wedlock the landlord and the landlady of the publichouse in which they had both served being the only witnesses present the children were not permitted to see the ceremony on leaving the church door the married pair began their honeymoon by driving to st johns wood  a dirty printed notice in a broken window announced that the house was to let and a sourtempered woman informed them that they were free to look at the rooms  the bride was in the best of humors she set the bridegroom the example of keeping up appearances by examining the dilapidated house first this done she said sweetly to the person in charge may we look at the garden  the woman made a strange answer to this request thats curious she said  james interfered for the first time whats curious he asked roughly  among all the idle people who have come here at one time or another to see this house the woman said only two have wanted to look at the garden  james turned on his heel and made for the summerhouse leaving it to his wife to pursue the subject or not as she pleased she did pursue the subject  i am one of the persons of course she said who is the other  an old man came on monday  the brides pleasant smile vanished  what sort of person was he she asked  the sourtempered woman became sourer than ever  oh how can i tell a brute there  a brute the very words which the new mrs bellbridge had herself used when the expert had irritated her with serious misgivings she too turned her steps in the direction of the garden  james had already followed her instructions and used his chisel the plank lay loose on the floor with both his big hands he rapidly cleared away the mould and the rubbish in a few minutes the hidingplace was laid bare  they looked into it they looked at each other there was the empty hole telling its own story the diamonds were gone   9the mother   mrs bellbridge eyed her husband prepared for a furious outbreak of rage he stood silent staring stupidly straight before him the shock that had fallen on his dull brain had stunned it for the time he was a big idiotspeechless harmless helpless  she put back the rubbish and replaced the plank and picked up the chisel come james she said pull yourself together it was useless to speak to him she took his arm and led him out to the cab that was waiting at the door  the driver helping him to get in noticed a piece of paper lying on the front seat advertisements seeking publicity under all possible circumstances are occasionally sent flying into the open windows of vehicles the driver was about to throw the paper away when mrs bellbridge seeing it on the other side took it out of his hand it isnt print she said its writing a closer examination showed that the writing was addressed to herself her correspondent must have followed her to the church as well as to the house in st johns wood he distinguished her by the name which she had changed that morning under the sanction of the clergy and the law  this was what she read dont trouble yourself madam about the diamonds you have made a mistakeyou have employed the wrong man  those wordsand no more enough surely to justify the conclusion that he had stolen the diamonds was it worth while to drive to his lodgings they tried the experiment the expert had gone away on businessnobody knew where  the newspaper came as usual on friday morning to mrs bellbridges amazement it set the question of the theft at rest on the highest authority an article appeared in a conspicuous position thus expressed  another of the many proofs that truth is stranger than fiction has just occurred at liverpool a highly respected firm of shipwreckers in that city received a strange letter at the beginning of the present week premising that he had some remarkable circumstances to communicate the writer of the letter entered abruptly on the narrative which follows a friend of hisconnected with literaturehad it appeared noticed a ladys visiting card on his desk and had been reminded by it in what way it was not necessary to explain of a criminal case which had excited considerable public interest at the time viz the trial of captain westerfield for willfully casting away a ship under his command never having heard of the trial the writer at his friends suggestion consulted a file of newspapersdiscovered the reportand became aware for the first time that a collection of brazilian diamonds consigned to the liverpool firm was missing from the wrecked vessel when she had been boarded by the salvage party and had not been found since events which it was impossible for him to mention seeing that doing so would involve a breach of confidence placed in him in his professional capacity had revealed to his knowledge a hidingplace in which these same diamonds in all probability were concealed this circumstance had left him no alternative as an honest man but to be beforehand with the persons who as he believed contemplated stealing the precious stones he had accordingly taken them under his protection until they were identified and claimed by the rightful owners in now appealing to these gentlemen he stipulated that the claim should be set forth in writing addressed to him under initials at a postoffice in london if the lost property was identified to his satisfaction he would meetat a specified place and on a certain day and houra person accredited by the firm and would personally restore the diamonds without claiming or consenting to receive a reward the conditions being complied with this remarkable interview took place the writer of the letter described as an infirm old man very poorly dressed fulfilled his engagement took his receipt and walked away without even waiting to be thanked it is only an act of justice to add that the diamonds were afterward counted and not one of them was missing  miserable deservedlymiserable married pair the stolen fortune on which they had counted had slipped through their fingers the berths in the steamer for new york had been taken and paid for james had married a woman with nothing besides herself to bestow on him except an incumbrance in the shape of a boy  late on the fatal weddingday his first idea when he was himself again after the discovery in the summerhouse was to get back his passagemoney to abandon his wife and his stepson and to escape to america in a french steamer he went to the office of the english company and offered the places which he had taken for sale the season of the year was against him the passengertraffic to america was at its lowest ebb and profits depended upon freights alone  if he still contemplated deserting his wife he must also submit to sacrifice his money the other alternative was as he expressed it himself to have his pennyworth for his penny and to turn his family to good account in new york he had not quite decided what to do when he got home again on the evening of his marriage  at that critical moment in her life the bride was equal to the demand on her resources  if she was foolish enough to allow james to act on his natural impulses there were probably two prospects before her in one state of his temper he might knock her down in another state of his temper he might leave her behind him her only hope of protecting herself in either case was to tame the bridegroom in his absence she wisely armed herself with the most irresistible fascinations of her sex never yet had he seen her dressed as she was dressed when he came home never yet had her magnificent eyes looked at him as they looked now emotions for which he was not prepared overcame this much injured man he stared at the bride in helpless surprise that inestimable moment of weakness was all mrs bellbridge asked for bewildered by his own transformation james found himself reading the newspaper the next morning sentimentally with his arm round his wifes waist    by a refinement of cruelty not one word had been said to prepare little syd for the dreary change that was now close at hand in her young life the poor child had seen the preparations for departure and had tried to imitate her mother in packing up she had collected her few morsels of darned and ragged clothing and had gone upstairs to put them into one of the dilapidated old trunks in the garret play ground when the servant was sent to bring her back to the sittingroom there enthroned in an easychair sat a strange lady and there hiding behind the chair in undisguised dislike of the visitor was her little brother roderick syd looked timidly at her mother and her mother said  here is your aunt  the personal appearance of miss wigger might have suggested a modest distrust of his own abilities to lavater when that selfsufficient man wrote his famous work on physiognomy whatever betrayal of her inner self her face might have presented in the distant time when she was young was now completely overlaid by a surface of a flabby fat which assisted by green spectacles kept the virtues or vices of this womans nature a profound secret until she opened her lips when she used her voice she let out the truth nobody could hear her speak and doubt for a moment that she was an inveterately illnatured woman  make your curtsey child said miss wigger nature had so toned her voice as to make it worthy of the terrors of her face but for her petticoats it would have been certainly taken for the voice of a man  the child obeyed trembling  you are to go away with me the schoolmistress proceeded and to be taught to make yourself useful under my roof  syd seemed to be incapable of understanding the fate that was in store for her she sheltered herself behind her merciless mother im going away with you mamma she saidwith you and rick  her mother took her by the shoulders and pushed her across the room to her aunt  the child looked at the formidable female creature with the mans voice and the green spectacles  you belong to me said miss wigger by way of encouragement and i have come to take you away at those dreadful words terror shook little syd from head to foot she fell on her knees with a cry of misery that might have melted the heart of a savage oh mamma mamma dont leave me behind what have i done to deserve it oh pray pray pray have some pity on me  her mother was as selfish and as cruel a woman as ever lived but even her hard heart felt faintly the influence of the most intimate and most sacred of all human relationships her florid cheeks turned pale she hesitated  miss wigger marked through her own green medium that moment of maternal indecisionand saw that it was time to assert her experience as an instructress of youth  leave it to me she said to her sister you never did know and you never will know how to manage children  she advanced the child threw herself shrieking on the floor miss wiggers long arms caught her upheld hershook her be quiet you imp it was needless to tell her to be quiet syds little curly head sank on the schoolmistresss shoulder she was carried into exile without a word or a cryshe had fainted   10the school  times march moves slowly where weary lives languish in dull places  dating from one unkempt and unacknowledged birthday to another sydney westerfield had attained the sixth year of her martyrdom at school in that long interval no news of her mother her brother or her stepfather had reached england she had received no letter she had not even heard a report without friends and without prospects roderick westerfields daughter was in the saddest sense of the word alone in the world    the hands of the ugly old clock in the schoolroom were approaching the time when the studies of the morning would come to an end wearily waiting for their release the scholars saw an event happen which was a novelty in their domestic experience the maidofallwork audaciously put her head in at the door and interrupted miss wigger conducting the education of the firstclass  if you please miss theres a gentleman  having uttered these introductory words she was reduced to silence by the tremendous voice of her mistress  havent i forbidden you to come here in school hours go away directly  hardened by a life of drudgery under conditions of perpetual scolding the servant stood her ground and recovered the use of her tongue  theres a gentleman in the drawingroom she persisted miss wigger tried to interrupt her again and heres his card she shouted in a voice that was the louder of the two  being a mortal creature the schoolmistress was accessible to the promptings of curiosity she snatched the card out of the girls hand  mr herbert linley mount morven perthshire i dont know this person miss wigger declared you wretch have you let a thief into the house  a gentleman if ever i see one yet the servant asserted  hold your tongue did he ask for me do you hear  you told me to hold my tongue no he didnt ask for you  then who did he want to see  its on his card  miss wigger referred to the card again and discovered faintly traced in pencil these words to see miss sw  the schoolmistress instantly looked at miss westerfield miss westerfield rose from her place at the head of her class  the pupils astonished at this daring act all looked at the teachertheir natural enemy appointed to supply them with undesired information derived from hated books they saw one of mother natures favorite daughters designed to be the darling of her family and the conqueror of hearts among men of all tastes and ages but sydney westerfield had lived for six weary years in the place of earthly torment kept by miss wigger under the name of a school every budding beauty except the unassailable beauty of her eyes and her hair had been nipped under the frosty superintendence of her maternal aunt her cheeks were hollow her delicate lips were pale her shabby dress lay flat over her bosom observant people meeting her when she was out walking with the girls were struck by her darkly gentle eyes and by the patient sadness of her expression what a pity they said to each other she would be a pretty girl if she didnt look so wretched and so thin  at a loss to understand the audacity of her teacher in rising before the class was dismissed miss wigger began by asserting her authority she did in two words sit down  i wish to explain maam  sit down  i beg miss wigger that you will allow me to explain  sydney westerfield you are setting the worst possible example to your class i shall see this man myself will you sit down  pale already sydney turned paler still she obeyed the word of commandto the delight of the girls of her class it was then within ten minutes of the half hour after twelvewhen the pupils were dismissed to the playground while the cloth was laid for dinner what use would the teacher make of that half hour of freedom  in the meanwhile miss wigger had entered her drawingroom with the slightest possible inclination of her head she eyed the stranger through her green spectacles even under that disadvantage his appearance spoke for itself the servants estimate of him was beyond dispute mr herbert linleys good breeding was even capable of suppressing all outward expression of the dismay that he felt on finding himself face to face with the formidable person who had received him  what is your business if you please miss wigger began  men animals and buildings wear out with years and submit to their hard lot time only meets with flat contradiction when he ventures to tell a woman that she is growing old herbert linley had rashly anticipated that the young lady whom it was the object of his visit to see would prove to be young in the literal sense of the word when he and miss wigger stood face to face if the door had been set open for him he would have left the house with the greatest pleasure  i have taken the liberty of calling he said in answer to an advertisement may i askhe paused and took out a newspaper from the pocket of his overcoatif i have the honor of speaking to the lady who is mentioned here  he opened the newspaper and pointed to the advertisement  miss wiggers eyes restednot on the passage indicated but on the visitors glove it fitted him to such perfection that it suggested the enviable position in life which has gloves made to order he politely pointed again still inaccessible to the newspaper miss wigger turned her spectacles next to the front window of the room and discovered a handsome carriage waiting at the door money evidently in the pockets of those beautiful trousers worthy of the gloves as patiently as ever linley pointed for the third time and drew miss wiggers attention in the right direction at last she read the advertisement   a young lady wishes to be employed in the education of a little girl possessing but few accomplishments and having been only a junior teacher at a school she offers her services on trial leaving it to her employer to pay whatever salary she may be considered to deserve if she obtains a permanent engagement apply by letter to sw 14 delta gardens ne  most impertinent said miss wigger  mr linley looked astonished  i say most impertinent miss wigger repeated  mr linley attempted to pacify this terrible woman its very stupid of me he said i am afraid i dont quite understand you  one of my teachers has issued an advertisement and has referred to my address without first consulting me have i made myself understood sir she looked at the carriage again when she called him sir  not even linleys capacity for selfrestraint could repress the expression of relief visible in his brightening face when he discovered that the lady of the advertisement and the lady who terrified him were two different persons  have i made myself understood miss wigger repeated  perfectly madam at the same time i am afraid i must own that the advertisement has produced a favorable impression on me  i fail entirely to see why miss wigger remarked  there is surely linley repeated something straightforwardi might almost say something innocentin the manner in which the writer expresses herself she seems to be singularly modest on the subject of her own attainments and unusually considerate of the interests of others i hope you will permit me  before he could add to see the young lady the door was opened a young lady entered the room  was she the writer of the advertisement he felt sure of it for no better reason than this the moment he looked at her she interested him it was an interest new to linley in his experience of himself there was nothing to appeal to his admiration by way of his senses in the pale worn young creature who stood near the door resigned beforehand to whatever reception she might meet with the poor teacher made him think of his happy young wife at homeof his pretty little girl the spoiled child of the household he looked at sydney westerfield with a heartfelt compassion which did honor to them both  what do you mean by coming here miss wigger inquired  she answered gently but not timidly the tone in which the mistress had spoken had evidently not shaken her resolution so far  i wish to know she said if this gentleman desires to see me on the subject of my advertisement  your advertisement miss wigger repeated miss westerfield how dare you beg for employment in a newspaper without asking my leave  i only waited to tell you what i had done till i knew whether my advertisement would be answered or not  she spoke as calmly as before still submitting to the insolent authority of the schoolmistress with a steady fortitude very remarkable in any girland especially in a girl whose face revealed a sensitive nature linley approached her and said his few kind words before miss wigger could assert herself for the third time  i am afraid i have taken a liberty in answering you personally when i ought to have answered by letter my only excuse is that i have no time to arrange for an interview in london by correspondence i live in scotland and i am obliged to return by the mail tonight  he paused she was looking at him did she understand him  she understood him only too well for the first time poor soul in the miserable years of her school life she saw eyes that rested on her with the sympathy that is too truly felt to be uttered in words the admirable resignation which had learned its first hard lesson under her mothers neglectwhich had endured in afteryears the daily persecution that heartless companionship so well knows how to inflictfailed to sustain her when one kind look from a stranger poured its balm into the girls sore heart her head sank her wasted figure trembled a few tears dropped slowly on the bosom of her shabby dress she tried desperately tried to control herself i beg your pardon sir was all she could say i am not very well  miss wigger tapped her on the shoulder and pointed to the door are you well enough to see your way out she asked  linley turned on the wretch with a mind divided between wonder and disgust good god what has she done to deserve being treated in that way he asked  miss wiggers mouth widened miss wiggers forehead developed new wrinkles to own it plainly the schoolmistress smiled  when it is of serious importance to a man to become acquainted with a womans true naturesay when he contemplates marriagehis one poor chance of arriving at a right conclusion is to find himself provoked by exasperating circumstances and to fly into a passion if the lady flies into a passion on her side he may rely on it that her faults are more than balanced by her good qualities if on the other hand she exhibits the most admirable selfcontrol and sets him an example which ought to make him ashamed of himself he has seen a bad sign and he will do well to remember it  miss wiggers selfcontrol put herbert linley in the wrong before she took the trouble of noticing what he had said  if you were not out of temper she replied i might have told you that i dont allow my house to be made an office for the engagement of governesses as it is i merely remind you that your carriage is at the door  he took the only course that was open to him he took his hat  sydney turned away to leave the room linley opened the door for her dont be discouraged he whispered as she passed him you shall hear from me having said this he made his parting bow to the schoolmistress miss wigger held up a peremptory forefinger and stopped him on his way out he waited wondering what she would do next she rang the bell  you are in the house of a gentlewoman miss wigger explained my servant attends visitors when they leave me a faint smell of soap made itself felt in the room the maid appeared wiping her smoking arms on her apron door i wish you goodmorningwere the last words of miss wigger   leaving the house linley slipped a bribe into the servants hand i am going to write to miss westerfield he said will you see that she gets my letter  that i will  he was surprised by the fervor with which the girl answered him absolutely without vanity he had no suspicion of the value which his winning manner his kind brown eyes and his sunny smile had conferred on his little gift of money a handsome man was an eighth wonder of the world at miss wiggers school  at the first stationers shop that he passed he stopped the carriage and wrote his letter  i shall be glad indeed if i can offer you a happier life than the life you are leading now it rests with you to help me do this will you send me the address of your parents if they are in london or the name of any friend with whom i can arrange to give you a trial as governess to my little girl i am waiting your answer in the neighborhood if any hinderance should prevent you from replying at once i add the name of the hotel at which i am stayingso that you may telegraph to me before i leave london tonight  the stationers boy inspired by a private view of halfacrown set off at a runand returned at a run with a reply  i have neither parents nor friends and i have just been dismissed from my employment at the school without references to speak for me i must not take advantage of your generous offer will you help me to bear my disappointment permitting me to see you for a few minutes only at your hotel indeed indeed sir i am not forgetful of what i owe to my respect for you and my respect for myself i only ask leave to satisfy you that i am not quite unworthy of the interest which you have been pleased to feel insw  in those sad words sydney westerfield announced that she had completed her education     the story     first book     chapter i mrs presty presents herself  not far from the source of the famous river which rises in the mountains between loch katrine and loch lomond and divides the highlands and the lowlands of scotland travelers arrive at the venerable gray walls of mount morven and after consulting their guide books ask permission to see the house  what would be called in a modern place of residence the first floor is reserved for the occupation of the family the great hall of entrance and its quaint old fireplace the ancient rooms on the same level opening out of it are freely shown to strangers cultivated travelers express various opinions relating to the family portraits and the elaborately carved ceilings the uninstructed public declines to trouble itself with criticism it looks up at the towers and the loopholes the battlements and the rusty old guns which still bear witness to the perils of past times when the place was a fortressit enters the gloomy hall walks through the stonepaved rooms stares at the faded pictures and wonders at the lofty chimneypieces hopelessly out of reach sometimes it sits on chairs which are as cold and as hard as iron or timidly feels the legs of immovable tables which might be legs of elephants so far as size is concerned when these marvels have been duly admired and the guide books are shut up the emancipated tourists emerging into the light and air all find the same social problem presented by a visit to mount morven how can the family live in such a place as that  if these strangers on their travels had been permitted to ascend to the first floor and had been invited for example to say goodnight to mrs linleys pretty little daughter they would have seen the stone walls of kittys bedchamber snugly covered with velvet hangings which kept out the cold they would have trod on a doublylaid carpet which set the chilly influences of the pavement beneath it at defiance they would have looked at a bright little bed of the last new pattern worthy of a childs delicious sleep and they would only have discovered that the room was three hundred years old when they had drawn aside the window curtains and had revealed the adamantine solidity of the outer walls or if they had been allowed to pursue their investigations a little further and had found their way next into mrs linleys sitting room here again a transformation scene would have revealed more modern luxury presented in the perfection which implies restraint within the limits of good taste but on this occasion instead of seeing the head of a lively little child on the pillow side by side with the head of her doll they would have encountered an elderly lady of considerable size fast asleep and snoring in a vast armchair with a book on her lap the married men among the tourists would have recognized a motherinlaw and would have set an excellent example to the rest that is to say the example of leaving the room  the lady composed under the soporific influence of literature was a person of importance in the householding rank as mrs linleys mother and being otherwise noticeable for having married two husbands and survived them both  the first of these gentlementhe right honorable joseph normanhad been a member of parliament and had taken office under government mrs linley was his one surviving child he died at an advanced age leaving his handsome widow young enough as she was always ready to mention to be his daughter well provided for and an object of matrimonial aspiration to single gentlemen who admired size in a woman set off by money after hesitating for some little time mrs norman accepted the proposal of the ugliest and dullest man among the ranks of her admirers why she became the wife of mr presty known in commercial circles as a merchant enriched by the sale of vinegar she was never able to explain why she lamented him with tears of sincere sorrow when he died after two years of married life was a mystery which puzzled her nearest and dearest friends and why when she indulged a little too frequently in recollections of her married life she persisted in putting obscure mr presty on a level with distinguished mr norman was a secret which this remarkable woman had never been known to reveal presented by their widow with the strictest impartiality to the general view the characters of these two husbands combined by force of contrast the ideal of manly perfection that is to say the vices of mr norman were the virtues of mr presty and the vices of mr presty were the virtues of mr norman  returning to the sittingroom after bidding kitty goodnight mrs linley discovered the old lady asleep and saw that the book on her mothers lap was sliding off before she could check the downward movement the book fell on the floor and mrs presty woke  oh mamma i am so sorry i was just too late to catch it  it doesnt matter my dear i daresay i should go to sleep again if i went on with my novel  is it really as dull as that  dull mrs presty repeated you are evidently not aware of what the new school of novel writing is doing the new school provides the public with soothing fiction  are you speaking seriously mamma  seriously catherineand gratefully these new writers are so good to old women no story to excite our poor nerves no improper characters to cheat us out of our sympathies no dramatic situations to frighten us exquisite management of details as the reviews say and a masterly anatomy of human motives whichi know what i mean my dear but i cant explain it  i think i understand mamma a masterly anatomy of human motives which is in itself a motive of human sleep no i wont borrow your novel just now i dont want to go to sleep i am thinking of herbert in london  mrs presty consulted her watch  your husband is no longer in london she announced he has begun his journey home give me the railway guide and ill tell you when he will be here tomorrow you may trust me catherine to make no mistakes mr prestys wonderful knowledge of figures has been of the greatest use to me in later life thanks to his instructions i am the only person in the house who can grapple with the intricacies of our railway system your poor father mr norman could never understand timetables and never attempted to conceal his deficiencies he had none of the vanity harmless vanity perhaps which led poor mr presty to express positive opinions on matters of which he knew nothing such as pictures and music what do you want malcolm  the servant to whom this question was addressed answered a telegram maam for the mistress  mrs linley recoiled from the message when the man offered it to her not usually a very demonstrative person the feeling of alarm which had seized on her only expressed itself in a sudden change of color an accident she said faintly an accident on the railway  mrs presty opened the telegram  if you had been the wife of a cabinet minister she said to her daughter you would have been too well used to telegrams to let them frighten you mr presty who received his telegrams at his office was not quite just to the memory of my first husband he used to blame mr norman for letting me see his telegrams but mr prestys nature had all the poetry in which mr normans nature was deficient he saw the angelic side of womenand thought telegrams and business and all that sort of thing unworthy of our mission i dont exactly understand what our mission is  mamma mamma is herbert hurt  stuff and nonsense nobody is hurt there has been no accident  they why does he telegraph to me  hitherto mrs presty had only looked at the message she now read it through attentively to the end her face assumed an expression of stern distrust she shook her head  read it yourself she answered and remember what i told you when you trusted your husband to find a governess for my grandchild i said you do not know men as i do i hope you may not live to repent it  mrs linley was too fond of her husband to let this pass why shouldnt i trust him she asked he was going to london on businessand it was an excellent opportunity  mrs presty disposed of this weak defense of her daughters conduct by waving her hand read your telegram she repeated with dignity and judge for yourself  mrs linley read  i have engaged a governess she will travel in the same train with me i think i ought to prepare you to receive a person whom you may be surprised to see she is very young and very inexperienced quite unlike the ordinary run of governesses when you hear how cruelly the poor girl has been used i am sure you will sympathize with her as i do  mrs linley laid down the message with a smile  poor dear herbert she said tenderly after we have been eight years married is he really afraid that i shall be jealous mamma why are you looking so serious  mrs presty took the telegram from her daughter and read extracts from it with indignant emphasis of voice and manner  travels in the same train with him very young and very inexperienced and he sympathizes with her ha i know the men catherinei know the men    chapter ii the governess enters  mr herbert linley arrived at his own house in the forenoon of the next day mrs linley running out to the head of the stairs to meet her husband saw him approaching her without a traveling companion where is the governess she askedwhen the first salutes allowed her the opportunity of speaking  on her way to bed poor soul under the care of the housekeeper linley answered  anything infectious my dear herbert mrs presty inquired appearing at the breakfastroom door  linley addressed his reply to his wife  nothing more serious catherine than want of strength she was in such a state of fatigue after our long night journey that i had to lift her out of the carriage  mrs presty listened with an appearance of the deepest interest quite a novelty in the way of a governess she said may i ask what her name is  sydney westerfield  mrs presty looked at her daughter and smiled satirically  mrs linley remonstrated  surely she said you dont object to the young ladys name  i have no opinion to offer catherine i dont believe in the name  oh mamma do you suspect that its an assumed name  my dear i havent a doubt that it is may i ask another question the old lady continued turning to linley what references did miss westerfield give you  no references at all  mrs presty rose with the alacrity of a young woman and hurried to the door follow my example she said to her daughter on her way out lock up your jewelbox  linley drew a deep breath of relief when he was left alone with his wife what makes your mother so particularly disagreeable this morning he inquired  she doesnt approve dear of my leaving it to you to choose a governess for kitty  where is kitty  out on her pony for a ride over the hills why did you send a telegram herbert to prepare me for the governess did you really think i might be jealous of miss westerfield  linley burst out laughing no such idea entered my head he answered it isnt in you my dear to be jealous  mrs linley was not quite satisfied with this view of her character her husbands wellintended compliment reminded her that there are occasions when any woman may be jealous no matter how generous and how gentle she may be we wont go quite so far as that she said to him because she stopped unwilling to dwell too long on a delicate subject he jocosely finished the sentence for her because we dont know what may happen in the future he suggested making another mistake by making a joke  mrs linley returned to the subject of the governess  i dont at all say what my mother says she resumed but was it not just a little indiscreet to engage miss westerfield without any references  unless i am utterly mistaken linley replied you would have been quite as indiscreet in my place if you had seen the horrible woman who persecuted and insulted her  his wife interrupted him how did all this happen herbert who first introduced you to miss westerfield  linley mentioned the advertisement and described his interview with the schoolmistress having next acknowledged that he had received a visit from miss westerfield herself he repeated all that she had been able to tell him of her fathers wasted life and melancholy end really interested by this time mrs linley was eager for more information her husband hesitated i would rather you heard the rest of it from miss westerfield he said in my absence  why in your absence  because she can speak to you more freely when i am not present hear her tell her own story and then let me know whether you think i have made a mistake i submit to your decision beforehand whichever way it may incline  mrs linley rewarded him with a kiss if a married stranger had seen them at that moment he would have been reminded of forgotten daysthe days of his honeymoon  and now linley resumed suppose we talk a little about ourselves i havent seen any brother yet where is randal  staying at the farm to look after your interests we expect him to come back today ah herbert what do we not all owe to that dear good brother of yours there is really no end to his kindness the last of our poor highland families who have emigrated to america have had their expenses privately paid by randal the wife has written to me and has let out the secret there is an american newspaper among the letters that are waiting your brothers return sent to him as a little mark of attention by these good grateful people having alluded to the neighbors who had left scotland mrs linley was reminded of other neighbors who had remained she was still relating events of local interest when the clock interrupted her by striking the hour of the nursery dinner what had become of kitty mrs linley rose and rang the bell to make inquiries  on the point of answering the servant looked round at the open door behind him he drew aside and revealed kitty in the corridor hand in hand with sydney westerfieldwho timidly hesitated at entering the room here she is mamma cried the child i think shes afraid of you help me to pull her in  mrs linley advanced to receive the new member of her household with the irresistible grace and kindness which charmed every stranger who approached her oh its all right said kitty syd likes me and i like syd what do you think she lived in london with a cruel woman who never gave her enough to eat see what a good girl i am im beginning to feed her already kitty pulled a box of sweetmeats out of her pocket and handed it to the governess with a tap on the lid suggestive of an old gentleman offering a pinch of snuff to a friend  my dear child you mustnt speak of miss westerfield in that way pray excuse her said mrs linley turning to sydney with a smile i am afraid she has been disturbing you in your room  sydneys silent answer touched the mothers heart she kissed her little friend i hope you will let her call me syd she said gently it reminds me of a happier time her voice faltered she could say no more kitty explained with the air of a grown person encouraging a child i know all about it mamma she means the time when her papa was alive she lost her papa when she was a little girl like me i didnt disturb her i only said my names kitty may i get up on the bed and she was quite willing and we talked and i helped her to dress mrs linley led sydney to the sofa and stopped the flow of her daughters narrative the look the voice the manner of the governess had already made their simple appeal to her generous nature when her husband took kittys hand to lead her with him out of the room she whispered as he passed you have done quite right i havent a doubt of it now    chapter iii mrs presty changes her mind   the two ladies were alone  widely as the lot in life of one differed from the lot in life of the other they presented a contrast in personal appearance which was more remarkable still in the prime of life tall and fairthe beauty of her delicate complexion and her brilliant blue eyes rivaled by the charm of a figure which had arrived at its mature perfection of developmentmrs linley sat side by side with a frail little darkeyed creature thin and pale whose wasted face bore patient witness to the three cruelest privations under which youth can sufferwant of fresh air want of nourishment and want of kindness the gentle mistress of the house wondered sadly if this lost child of misfortune was capable of seeing the brighter prospect before her that promised enjoyment of a happier life to come  i was afraid to disturb you while you were resting mrs linley said let me hope that my housekeeper has done what i might have done myself if i had seen you when you arrived  the housekeeper has been all that is good and kind to me madam  dont call me madam it sounds so formalcall me mrs linley you must not think of beginning to teach kitty till you feel stronger and better i see but too plainly that you have not been happy dont think of your past life or speak of your past life  forgive me mrs linley my past life is my one excuse for having ventured to come into this house  in what way my dear  at the moment when that question was put the closed curtains which separated the breakfastroom from the library were softly parted in the middle a keen old face strongly marked by curiosity and distrust peeped througheyed the governess with stern scrutinyand retired again into hiding  the introduction of a stranger without references into the intimacy of the family circle was as mrs presty viewed it a crisis in domestic history conscience with its customary elasticity adapted itself to the emergency and linleys motherinlaw stole information behind the curtainin linleys best interests it is quite needless to say  the talk of the two ladies went on without a suspicion on either side that it was overheard by a third person  sydney explained herself  if i had led a happier life she said i might have been able to resist mr linleys kindness i concealed nothing from him he knew that i had no friends to speak for me he knew that i had been dismissed from my employment at the school oh mrs linley everything i said which would have made other people suspicious of me made him feel for me i began to wonder whether he was an angel or a man if he had not prevented it i should have fallen on my knees before him hard looks and hard words i could have endured patiently but i had not seen a kind look i had not heard a kind word for more years than i can reckon up that is all i can say for myself i leave the rest to your mercy  say my sympathy mrs linley answered and you need say no more but there is one thing i should like to know you have not spoken to me of your mother have you lost both your parents  no  then you were brought up by your mother  yes  you surely had some experience of kindness when you were a child  a third short answer would have been no very grateful return for mrs linleys kindness sydney had no choice but to say plainly what her experience of her mother had been  are there such women in the world mrs linley exclaimed where is your mother now  in americai think  you think  my mother married again said sydney she went to america with her husband and my little brother six years ago  and left you behind  yes  and has she never written to you  never  this time mrs linley kept silence not without an effort thinking of sydneys motherand for one morbid moment seeing her own little darling in sydneys placeshe was afraid to trust herself to speak while the first impression was vividly present to her mind  i will only hope she replied after waiting a little that some kind person pitied and helped you when you were deserted any change must have been for the better after that who took charge of you  my mothers sister took charge of me an elder sister who kept a school the time when i was most unhappy was the time when my aunt began to teach me if you dont want to be beaten and kept on bread and water she said learn you ugly little wretch and be quick about it  did she speak in that shameful way to the other girls  oh no i was taken into her school for nothing and young as i was i was expected to earn my food and shelter by being fit to teach the lowest class the girls hated me it was such a wretched life that i hardly like to speak of it now i ran away and i was caught and severely punished when i grew older and wiser i tried to find some other employment for myself the elder girls bought penny journals that published stories they were left about now and then in the bedrooms i read the stories when i had the chance even my ignorance discovered how feeble and foolish they were they encouraged me to try if i could write a story myself i couldnt do worse and i might do better i sent my manuscript to the editor it was accepted and printedbut when i wrote and asked him if he would pay me something for it he refused dozens of ladies he said wrote stories for him for nothing it didnt matter what the stories were anything would do for his readers so long as the characters were lords and ladies and there was plenty of love in it my next attempt to get away from the school ended in another disappointment a poor old man who had once been an actor used to come to us twice a week and get a few shillings by teaching the girls to read aloud he was called professor of english literature and he taught out of a ragged book of verses which smelled of his pipe i learned one of the pieces and repeated it to him and asked if there was any hope of my being able to go on the stage he was very kind he told me the truth my dear you have no dramatic ability god forbid you should go on the stage i went back again to the penny journals and tried a new editor he seemed to have more money than the other one or perhaps he was kinder i got ten shillings from him for my story with that money i made my last attempti advertised for a situation as governess if mr linley had not seen my advertisement i might have starved in the streets when my aunt heard of it she insisted on my begging her pardon before the whole school do girls get half maddened by persecution if they do i think i must have been one of those girls i refused to beg pardon and i was dismissed from my situation without a character will you think me very foolish i shut my eyes again when i woke in my delicious bed today i was afraid that the room and everything in it was a dream she looked round and started to her feet oh heres a lady shall i go away  the curtains hanging over the entrance to the library were opened for the second time with composure and dignity the lady who had startled sydney entered the room  have you been reading in the library mrs linley asked and mrs presty answered no catherine i have been listening  mrs linley looked at her mother her lovely complexion reddened with a deep blush  introduce me to miss westerfield mrs presty proceeded as coolly as ever  mrs linley showed some hesitation what would the governess think of her mother perfectly careless of what the governess might think mrs presty crossed the room and introduced herself  miss westerfield i am mrs linleys mother and i am in one respect a remarkable person when i form an opinion and find its the opinion of a fool i am not in the least ashamed to change my mind i have changed my mind about you shake hands  sydney respectfully obeyed  sit down again sydney returned to her chair  i had the worst possible opinion of you mrs presty resumed before i had the pleasure of listening on the other side of the curtain it has been my good fortunewhats your christian name did i hear it or have i forgotten it sydney eh very well i was about to say sydney that it has been my good fortune to be intimately associated in early life with two remarkable characters husbands of mine in short whose influence over me has i am proud to say set death and burial at defiance between them they have made my mind the mind of a man i judge for myself the opinions of others when they dont happen to agree with mine i regard as chaff to be scattered to the winds no catherine i am not wandering i am pointing out to a young person who has her way to make in the world the vast importance on certain occasions of possessing an independent mind if i had been ashamed to listen behind those curtains there is no injury that my stupid prejudices might not have inflicted on this unfortunate girl as it is i have heard her story and i do her justice count on me sydney as your friend and now get up again my grandchild never accustomed to wait for anything since the day when she was born is waiting dinner for you she is at this moment shouting for her governess as king richard i am a great reader of shakespeare once shouted for his horse the maid you will recognize her as a stout person suffering under tight stays is waiting outside to show you the way to the nursery au revoir stop i should like to judge the purity of your french accent say au revoir to me thank youweak in her french catherine mrs presty pronounced when the door had closed on the governess but what can you expect poor wretch after such a life as she has led now we are alone i have a word of advice for your private ear we have much to anticipate from miss westerfield that is pleasant and encouraging but i dont conceal it from myself or from you we have also something to fear  to fear mrs linley repeated i dont understand you  never mind catherine whether you understand me or not i want more information tell me what your husband said to you about this young lady  wondering at the demon of curiosity which appeared to possess her mother mrs linley obeyed listening throughout with the closest attention mrs presty reckoned up the items of information and pointed the moral to be drawn from them by worldly experience  first obstacle in the way of her moral development her fathertried found guilty and dying in prison second obstacle her motheran unnatural wretch who neglected and deserted her own flesh and blood third obstacle her mothers sisterbeing her mother over again in an aggravated form people who only look at the surface of things might ask what we gain by investigating miss westerfields past life we gain this we know what to expect of miss westerfield in the future  i for one mrs linley interposed expect everything that is good and true  say shes naturally an angel mrs presty answered and i wont contradict you but do pray hear how my experience looks at it i remember what a life she has led and i ask myself if any human creature could have suffered as that girl has suffered without being damaged by it among those damnable peoplei beg your pardon my dear mr norman sometimes used strong language and it breaks out of me now and thenthe good qualities of that unfortunate young person can not have always resisted the horrid temptations and contaminations about her hundreds of times she must have had deceit forced on her she must have lied through ungovernable fear she must have been left at a critical time in her life mind with no more warning against the insidious advances of the passions thanthanim repeating what mr presty said of a niece of his own who went to a bad school at paris and i dont quite remember what comparisons that eloquent man used when he was excited but i know what i mean i like miss westerfield i believe miss westerfield will come out well in the end but i dont forget that she is going to lead a new life herea life of luxury my dear a life of ease and health and happinessand god only knows what evil seed sown in her in her past life may not spring up under new influences i tell you we must be careful i tell you we must keep our eyes open and so much the better for her and so much the better for us  mrs prestys wise and wary advice presented unfavorably it must be owned through her inveterately quaint way of expressing herself failed to produce the right impression on her daughters mind mrs linley replied in the tone of a person who was unaffectedly shocked  oh mamma i never knew you so unjust before you cant have heard all that miss westerfield said to me you dont know her as i know her so patient so forgiving so grateful to herbert  so grateful to herbert mrs presty looked at her daughter in silent surprise there could be no doubt about it mrs linley failed entirely to see any possibilities of future danger in the grateful feeling of her sensitive governess toward her handsome husband at this exhibition of simplicity the old ladys last reserves of endurance gave way she rose to go you have an excellent heart catherine she remarked but as for your head  well and what of my head  its always beautifully dressed my dear by your maid with that parting shot mrs presty took her departure by way of the library almost at the same moment the door of the breakfastroom was opened a young man advanced and shook hands cordially with mrs linley    chapter iv randal receives his correspondence   selfrevealed by the family likeness as herberts brother randal linley was nevertheless greatly herberts inferior in personal appearance his features were in no way remarkable for manly beauty in stature he hardly reached the middle height and young as he was either bad habit or physical weakness had so affected the upper part of his figure that he stooped but with these and other disadvantages there was something in his eyes and in his smilethe outward expression perhaps of all that was modestly noble in his natureso irresistible in its attractive influence that men women and children felt the charm alike inside of the house and outside of the house everybody was fond of randal even mrs presty included  have you seen a new face among us since you returned were his sisterinlaws first words randal answered that he had seen miss westerfield the inevitable question followed what did he think of her ill tell you in a week or two more he replied  no tell me at once  i dont like trusting my first impression i have a bad habit of jumping to conclusions  jump to a conclusion to please me do you think shes pretty  randal smiled and looked away your governess he replied looks out of health and perhaps for that reason strikes me as being insignificant and ugly let us see what our fine air and our easy life here will do for her in so young a woman as she is i am prepared for any sort of transformation we may be all admiring pretty miss westerfield before another month is over our headshave any letters come for me while i have been away  he went into the library and returned with his letters this will amuse kitty he said handing his sisterinlaw the illustrated new york newspaper to which she had already referred in speaking to her husband  mrs linley examined the engravingsand turned back again to look once more at an illustration which had interested her a paragraph on the same page caught her attention she had hardly glanced at the first words before a cry of alarm escaped her dreadful news for miss westerfield she exclaimed read it randal  he read these words   the weeks list of insolvent traders includes an englishman named james bellbridge formerly connected with a disreputable saloon in this city bellbridge is under suspicion of having caused the death of his wife in a fit of delirium tremens the unfortunate woman had been married for the first time to one of the english aristocracythe honorable roderick westerfieldwhose trial for casting away a ship under his command excited considerable interest in london some years since the melancholy circumstances of the case are complicated by the disappearance on the day of the murder of the womans young son by her first husband the poor boy is supposed to have run away in terror from his miserable home and the police are endeavoring to discover some trace of him it is reported that another child of the first marriage a daughter is living in england but nothing is known about her   has your governess any relations in england randal asked  only an aunt who has treated her in the most inhuman manner  serious news for miss westerfield as you say randal resumed and as i think serious news for us here is a mere girla poor friendless creatureabsolutely dependent on our protection what are we to do if anything happens in the future to alter our present opinion of her  nothing of the sort is likely to happen mrs linley declared  let us hope not randal said gravely    chapter v randal writes to new york   the members of the family at mount morven consulted together before sydney westerfield was informed of her brothers disappearance and of her mothers death  speaking first as master of the house herbert linley offered his opinion without hesitation his impulsive kindness shrank from the prospect of reviving the melancholy recollections associated with sydneys domestic life why distress the poor child just as she is beginning to feel happy among us he asked give me the newspaper i shant feel easy till i have torn it up  his wife drew the newspaper out of his reach wait a little she said quietly some of us may feel that it is no part of our duty to conceal the truth  mrs presty spoke next to the surprise of the family council she agreed with her soninlaw  somebody must speak out the old lady began and i mean to set the example telling the truth she declared turning severely to her daughter is a more complicated affair than you seem to think its a question of morality of course butin family circles my dearits sometimes a question of convenience as well is it convenient to upset my granddaughters governess just as she is entering on her new duties certainly not good heavens what does it matter to my young friend sydney whether her unnatural mother lives or dies herbert i second your proposal to tear up the paper with the greatest pleasure  herbert sitting next to randal laid his hand affectionately on his brothers shoulder are you on our side he asked  randal hesitated  i feel inclined to agree with you he said to herbert it does seem hard to recall miss westerfield to the miserable life that she has led and to do it in the way of all others which must try her fortitude most cruelly at the same time  oh dont spoil what you have said by seeing the other side of the question cried his brother you have already put it admirably leave it as it is  at the same time randal gently persisted i have heard no reasons which satisfy me that we have a right to keep miss westerfield in ignorance of what has happened  this serious view of the question in debate highly diverted mrs presty i do not like that man she announced pointing to randal he always amuses me look at him now he doesnt know which side he is on himself  he is on my side herbert declared  not he  herbert consulted his brother what do you say yourself  i dont know randal answered  there cried mrs presty what did i tell you  randal tried to set his strange reply in the right light i only mean he explained that i want a little time to think  herbert gave up the dispute and appealed to his wife you have still got the american newspaper in your hand he said what do you mean to do with it  quietly and firmly mrs linley answered i mean to show it to miss westerfield  against my opinion against your mothers opinion herbert asked have we no influence over you do as randal doestake time my dear to think  she answered this with her customary calmness of manner and sweetness of tone i am afraid i must appear obstinate but it is indeed true that i want no time to think my duty is too plain to me  her husband and her mother listened to her in astonishment too amiable and too happyand it must be added too indolentto assert herself in the ordinary emergencies of family life mrs linley only showed of what metal she was made on the very rare occasions when the latent firmness in her nature was stirred to its innermost depths the general experience of this sweettempered and delightful woman ranging over long intervals of time was the only experience which remained in the memories of the persons about her in bygone days they had been amazed when her unexpected readiness and firmness of decision presented an exception to a general rulejust as they were amazed now  herbert tried a last remonstrance is it possible catherine that you dont see the cruelty of showing that newspaper to miss westerfield  even this appeal to mrs linleys sympathies failed to shake her resolution you may trust me to be careful was all she said in reply i shall prepare her as tenderly for the sad news from america as if she was a daughter of my own  hearing this mrs presty showed a sudden interest in the proceedings when do you mean to begin she asked  at once mamma  mrs presty broke up the meeting on the spot wait till i am out of the way she stipulated do you object to herbert giving me his arm distressing scenes are not in his line or in mine  mrs linley made no objection herbert resigned himself not at all unwillingly to circumstances arm in arm he and his wifes mother left the room  randal showed no intention of following them he had given himself time to think we are all wrong catherine he said and you alone are right what can i do to help you  she took his hand gratefully always kind never thinking of yourself i will see miss westerfield in my own room wait here in case i want you  after a much shorter absence than randal anticipated mrs linley returned has it been very distressing he asked seeing the traces of tears in her eyes  there are noble qualities she answered in that poor illused girl her one thought as soon as she began to understand my motive in speaking to her was not for herself but for me even you a man must have felt the tears in your eyes if you had heard her promise that i should suffer no further anxiety on her account you shall see no distressing change in me she said when we meet tomorrow all she asked was to be left in her room for the rest of the day i feel sure of her resolution to control herself and yet i should like to encourage her if i can her chief sorrow as it seems to me must benot for the mother who has so shamefully neglected herbut for the poor little brother a castaway lost in a strange land can we do nothing to relieve her anxiety  i can write randal said to a man whom i know in new york a lawyer in large practice  the very person we want writepray write by todays post  the letter was dispatched it was decidedand wisely decided as the result provedto say nothing to sydney until the answer was received randals correspondent wrote back with as little delay as possible he had made every inquiry without success not a trace of the boy had been found or in the opinion of the police was likely to be found the one event that had happened since the appearance of the paragraph in the new york journal was the confinement of james bellbridge in an asylum as a madman under restraint without hope of recovery    chapter vi sydney teaches   mrs presty had not very seriously exaggerated the truth when she described her muchindulged granddaughter as a child who had never been accustomed to wait for anything since the day when she was born  governesses in general would have found it no easy matter to produce a favorable impression on kitty and to exert the necessary authority in instructing her at the same time spoiled children whatever moralists may say to the contrary are companionable and affectionate children for the most partexcept when they encounter the unfortunate persons employed to introduce them to useful knowledge mr and mrs linley guiltily conscious of having been too fond of their only child to subject her to any sort of discipline were not very willing to contemplate the prospect before miss westerfield on her first establishment in the schoolroom to their surprise and relief there proved to be no cause for anxiety after all without making an attempt to assert her authority the new governess succeeded nevertheless when older and wiser women would have failed  the secret of sydneys triumph over adverse circumstances lay hidden in sydney herself  everything in the ordinary routine of life at mount morven was a source of delight and surprise to the unfortunate creature who had passed through six years of cruelty insult and privation at her aunts school look where she might in her new sphere of action she saw pleasant faces and heard kind words at meal times wonderful achievements in the art of cookery appeared on the table which she had not only never tasted but never even heard of when she went out walking with her pupil they were free to go where they pleased without restriction of timeexcept the time of dinner to breathe the delicious air to look at the glorious scenery were enjoyments so exquisitely exhilarating that by sydneys own confession she became quite light headed with pleasure she ran races with kittyand nobody reproved her she rested out of breath while the stronger child was ready to run onand no merciless voice cried none of your laziness times up wild flowers that she had never yet seen might be gathered and no offense was committed kitty told her the names of the flowers and the names of the summer insects that flashed and hummed in the hillside breezes and was so elated at teaching her governess that her rampant spirits burst out in singing your turn next the joyous child cried when she too was out of breath sing sydneysing alas for sydney she had not sung since those happiest days of her childhood when her good father had told her fairy stories and taught her songs they were all forgotten now i cant sing kitty i cant sing the pupil hearing this melancholy confession became governess once more say the words syd and hum the tune after me they laughed over the singing lesson until the echoes of the hills mocked them and laughed too looking into the schoolroom one day mrs linley found that the serious business of teaching was not neglected the lessons went on smoothly without an obstacle in the way kitty was incapable of disappointing her friend and playfellow who made learning easy with a smile and a kiss the balance of authority was regulated to perfection in the lives of these two simple creatures in the schoolroom the governess taught the child out of the schoolroom the child taught the governess division of labor was a principle in perfect working order at mount morvenand nobody suspected it but as the weeks followed each other one more remarkable circumstance presented itself which every person in the household was equally quick to observe the sad sydney westerfield whom they all pitied had now become the pretty sydney westerfield whom they all admired it was not merely a changeit was a transformation kitty stole the handglass from her mothers room and insisted that her governess should take it and look at herself papa says youre as plump as a partridge and mamma says youre as fresh as a rose and uncle randal wags his head and tells them he saw it from the first i heard it all when they thought i was playing with my dolland i want to know you best of nice girls what you think of your own self  i think my dear its time we went on with our lessons  wait a little syd i have something else to say  what is it  its about papa he goes out walking with usdoesnt he  yes  he didnt go out walking with mebefore you came here ive been thinking about it and im sure papa likes you what are you looking in the drawer for  for your lesson books dear  yesbut i havent quite done yet papa talks a good deal to you and you dont talk much to papa dont you like him  oh kitty  then do you like him  how can i help liking him i owe all my happiness to your papa  do you like him better than mamma  i should be very ungrateful if i liked anybody better than your mamma  kitty considered a little and shook her head i dont understand that she declared roundly what do you mean  sydney cleaned the pupils slate and set the pupils sumand said nothing  kitty placed a suspicious construction of her own on her governesss sudden silence perhaps you dont like my wanting to know so many things she suggested or perhaps you meant to puzzle me  sydney sighed and answered im puzzled myself     chapter vii sydney suffers  in the autumn holidaytime friends in the south who happened to be visiting scotland were invited to stop at mount morven on their way to the highlands and were accustomed to meet the neighbors of the linleys at dinner on their arrival the time for this yearly festival had now come round again the guests were in the house and mr and mrs linley were occupied in making their arrangements for the dinnerparty with her unfailing consideration for every one about her mrs linley did not forget sydney while she was sending out her cards of invitation our table will be full at dinner she said to her husband miss westerfield had better join us in the evening with kitty  i suppose so linley answered with some hesitation  you seem to doubt about it herbert why  i was only wondering  wondering about what  has miss westerfield got a gown catherine that will do for a party  linleys wife looked at him as if she doubted the evidence of her own senses fancy a man thinking of that she exclaimed herbert you astonish me  he laughed uneasily i dont know how i came to think of itunless it is that she wears the same dress every day very neat but perhaps im wrong a little shabby too  upon my word you pay miss westerfield a compliment which you have never paid to me wear what i may you never seem to know how i am dressed  i beg your pardon catherine i know that you are always dressed well  that little tribute restored him to his place in his wifes estimation i may tell you now she resumed with her gentle smile that you only remind me of what i had thought of already my milliner is at work for miss westerfield the new dress must be your gift  are you joking  i am in earnest tomorrow is sydneys birthday and here is my present she opened a jewelers case and took out a plain gold bracelet suggested by kitty she added pointing to an inlaid miniature portrait of the child herbert read the inscription to sydney westerfield with catherine linleys love he gave the bracelet back to his wife in silence his manner was more serious than usualhe kissed her hand  the day of the dinnerparty marked an epoch in sydneys life  for the first time in all her past experience she could look in the glass and see herself prettily dressed with a gold bracelet on her arm if we consider how men in one way and milliners in another profit by it vanity is surely to be reckoned not among the vices but among the virtues of the sex will any woman who speaks the truth hesitate to acknowledge that her first sensations of gratified vanity rank among the most exquisite and most enduring pleasures that she has ever felt sydney locked her door and exhibited herself to herselfin the front view the side view and the back view over the shoulder with eyes that sparkled and cheeks that glowed in a delicious confusion of pride and astonishment she practiced bowing to strangers in her new dress she practiced shaking hands gracefully with her bracelet well in view suddenly she stood still before the glass and became serious and thoughtful kind and dear mr linley was in her mind now while she was asking herself anxiously what he would think of her kittyarrayed in her new finery as vain and as happy as her governessdrummed with both fists outside the door and announced at the top of her voice that it was time to go downstairs sydneys agitation at the prospect of meeting the ladies in the drawingroom added a charm of its own to the flush that her exercises before the glass had left on her face shyly following instead of leading her little companion into the room she presented such a charming appearance of youth and beauty that the ladies paused in their talk to look at her some few admired kittys governess with generous interest the greater number doubted mrs linleys prudence in engaging a girl so very pretty and so very young little by little sydneys mannersimple modest shrinking from observationpleaded in her favor even with the ladies who had been prejudiced against her at the outset when mrs linley presented her to the guests the most beautiful woman among them mrs macedwin made room for her on the sofa and with perfect tact and kindness set the stranger at her ease when the gentlemen came in from the dinnertable sydney was composed enough to admire the brilliant scene and to wonder again as she had wondered already what mr linley would say to her new dress  mr linley certainly did notice herat a distance  he looked at her with a momentary fervor of interest and admiration which made sydney so gratefully and so guiltlessly attached to him tremble with pleasure he even stepped forward as if to approach her checked himself and went back again among his guests now in one part of the room and now in another she saw him speaking to them the one neglected person whom he never even looked at again was the poor girl to whom his approval was the breath of her life had she ever felt so unhappy as she felt now no not even at her aunts school  friendly mrs macedwin touched her arm my dear you are losing your pretty color are you overcome by the heat shall i take you into the next room  sydney expressed her sincere sense of the ladys kindness her commonplace excuse was a true excuseshe had a headache and she asked leave to retire to her room  approaching the door she found herself face to face with mr linley he had just been giving directions to one of the servants and was reentering the drawingroom she stopped trembling and cold but in the very intensity of her wretchedness she found courage enough to speak to him  you seem to avoid me mr linley she began addressing him with ceremonious respect and keeping her eyes on the ground i hope she hesitated and desperately looked at himi hope i havent done anything to offend you  in her knowledge of him up to that miserable evening he constantly spoke to her with a smile she had never yet seen him so serious and so inattentive as he was now his eyes wandering round the room rested on mrs linleybrilliant and beautiful and laughing gayly why was he looking at his wife with plain signs of embarrassment in his face sydney piteously persisted in repeating her innocent question i hope i havent done anything to offend you  he seemed to be still reluctant to notice heron the one occasion of all others when she was looking her best but he answered at last  my dear child it is impossible that you should offend me you have misunderstood and mistaken me dont supposepray dont suppose that i am changed or can ever be changed toward you  he emphasized the kind intention which those words revealed by giving her his hand  but the next moment he drew back there was no disguising it he drew back as if he wished to get away from her she noticed that his lips were firmly closed and his eyebrows knitted in a frown he looked like a man who was forcing himself to submit to some hard necessity that he hated or feared  sydney left the room in despair  he had denied in the plainest and kindest terms that he was changed toward her was that not enough it was nothing like enough the facts were there to speak for themselves he was an altered man anxiety sorrow remorseone or the other seemed to have got possession of him judging by mrs linleys gayety of manner his wife could not possibly have been taken into his confidence  what did it mean oh the useless hopeless question and yet again and again she asked herself what did it mean  in bewildered wretchedness she lingered on the way to her room and stopped at the end of a corridor  on her right hand a broad flight of old oak stairs led to the bedchambers on the second floor of the house on her left hand an open door showed the stone steps which descended to the terrace and the garden the moonlight lay in all its loveliness on the flowerbeds and the grass and tempted her to pause and admire it a prospect of sleepless misery was the one prospect before her that sydney could see if she retired to rest the cool night air came freshly up the vaulted tunnel in which the steps were set the moonlit garden offered its solace to the girls sore heart no curious womenservants appeared on the stairs that led to the bedchambers no inquisitive eyes could look at her from the windows of the ground floora solitude abandoned to the curiosity of tourists sydney took her hat and cloak from the stand in a recess at the side of the door and went into the garden    chapter viii  mrs presty makes a discovery   the dinnerparty had come to an end the neighbors had taken their departure and the ladies at mount morven had retired for the night  on the way to her room mrs presty knocked at her daughters door i want to speak to you catherine are you in bed  no mamma come in  robed in a dressinggown of delicatelymingled white and blue and luxuriously accommodated on the softest pillows that could be placed in an armchair mrs linley was meditating on the events of the evening this has been the most successful party we have ever given she said to her mother and did you notice how charmingly pretty miss westerfield looked in her new dress  its about that girl i want to speak to you mrs presty answered severely i had a higher opinion of her when she first came here than i have now  mrs linley pointed to an open door communicating with a second and smaller bedchamber not quite so loud she answered or you might wake kitty what has miss westerfield done to forfeit your good opinion  discreet mrs presty asked leave to return to the subject at a future opportunity  i will merely allude now she said to a change for the worse in your governess which you might have noticed when she left the drawingroom this evening she had a word or two with herbert at the door and she left him looking as black as thunder  mrs linley laid herself back on her pillows and burst out laughing black as thunder poor little sydney what a ridiculous description of her i beg your pardon mamma dont be offended  on the contrary my dear i am agreeably surprised your poor fathera man of remarkable judgment on most subjectsnever thought much of your intelligence he appears to have been wrong you have evidently inherited some of my sense of humor however that is not what i wanted to say i am the bearer of good news when we find it necessary to get rid of miss westerfield  mrs linleys indignation expressed itself by a look which for the moment at least reduced her mother to silence always equal to the occasion however mrs prestys face assumed an expression of innocent amazement which would have produced a round of applause on the stage what have i said to make you angry she inquired surely my dear you and your husband are extraordinary people  do you mean to tell me mamma that you have said to herbert what you said just now to me  certainly i mentioned it to herbert in the course of the evening he was excessively rude he said tell mrs macedwin to mind her own businessand set her the example yourself  mrs linley returned her mothers look of amazement without her mothers eye for dramatic effect what has mrs macedwin to do with it she asked  if you will only let me speak catherine i shall be happy to explain myself you saw mrs macedwin talking to me at the party that good ladys heada feeble head as all her friends admithas been completely turned by miss westerfield the first duty of a governess this foolish woman said to me is to win the affections of her pupils my governess has entirely failed to make the children like her a dreadful temper i have given her notice to leave my service look at that sweet girl and your little granddaughter i declare i could cry when i see how they understand each other and love each other i quote our charming friends nonsense verbatim as we used to say when we were in parliament in mr normans time for the sake of what it led to if by any lucky chance miss westerfield happens to be disengaged in the future mrs macedwins house is open to herat her own time and on her own terms i promised to speak to you on the subject and i perform my promise think over it i strongly advise you to think over it  even mrs linleys good nature declined to submit to this i shall certainly not think over what cannot possibly happen she said goodnight mamma  goodnight catherine your temper doesnt seem to improve as you get older perhaps the excitement of the party has been too much for your nerves try to get some sleep before herbert comes up from the smokingroom and disturbs you  mrs linley refused even to let this pass unanswered herbert is too considerate to disturb me when his friends keep him up late she said on those occasions as you may see for yourself he has a bed in his dressingroom  mrs presty passed through the dressingroom on her way out a very comfortablelooking bed she remarked in a tone intended to reach her daughters ears i wonder herbert ever leaves it  the way to her own bedchamber led her by the door of sydneys room she suddenly stopped the door was not shut this was in itself a suspicious circumstance  young or old ladies are not in the habit of sleeping with their bedroom doors ajar a strict sense of duty led mrs presty to listen outside no sound like the breathing of a person asleep was to be heard a strict sense of duty conducted mrs presty next into the room and even encouraged her to approach the bed on tiptoe the bed was empty the clothes had not been disturbed since it had been made in the morning  the old lady stepped out into the corridor in a state of excitement which greatly improved her personal appearance she looked almost young again as she mentally reviewed the list of vices and crimes which a governess might commit who had retired before eleven oclock and was not in her bedroom at twelve on further reflection it appeared to be barely possible that miss westerfield might be preparing her pupils exercises for the next day mrs presty descended to the schoolroom on the first floor  no here again there was nothing to see but an empty room  where was miss westerfield  was it within the limits of probability that she had been bold enough to join the party in the smokingroom the bare idea was absurd  in another minute nevertheless mrs presty was at the door listening the mens voices were loud they were talking politics she peeped through the keyhole the smokers had beyond all doubt been left to themselves if the house had not been full of guests mrs presty would now have raised an alarm as things were the fear of a possible scandal which the family might have reason to regret forced her to act with caution in the suggestive retirement of her own room she arrived at a wise and wary decision opening her door by a few inches she placed a chair behind the opening in a position which commanded a view of sydneys room wherever the governess might be her return to her bedchamber before the servants were astir in the morning was a chance to be counted on the nightlamp in the corridor was well alight and a venerable person animated by a sense of duty was a person naturally superior to the seductions of sleep before taking the final precaution of extinguishing her candle mrs presty touched up her complexion and resolutely turned her back on her nightcap this is a case in which i must keep up my dignity she decided as she took her place in the chair    one man in the smokingroom appeared to be thoroughly weary of talking politics that man was the master of the house  randal noticed the worn preoccupied look in his brothers face and determined to break up the meeting the opportunity for which he was waiting occurred in another minute he was asked as a moderate politician to decide between two guests both members of parliament who were fast drifting into mere contradiction of each others secondhand opinions in plain terms they stated the matter in dispute which of our political parties deserves the confidence of the english people in plain terms on his sides randal answered the party that lowers the taxes those words acted on the discussion like water on a fire as members of parliament the two contending politicians were naturally innocent of the slightest interest in the people or the taxes they received the new idea submitted to them in helpless silence friends who were listening began to laugh the oldest man present looked at his watch in five minutes more the lights were out and the smokingroom was deserted  linley was the last to retirefevered by the combined influences of smoke and noise his mind oppressed all through the evening was as ill at ease as ever lingering wakeful and irritable in the corridor just as sydney had lingered before him he too stopped at the open door and admired the peaceful beauty of the garden  the sleepy servant appointed to attend in the smoking room asked if he should close the door linley answered go to bed and leave it to me still lingering at the top of the steps he too was tempted by the refreshing coolness of the air he took the key out of the lock secured the door after he had passed through it put the key in his pocket and went down into the garden    chapter ix somebody attends to the door   with slow steps linley crossed the lawn his mind gloomily absorbed in thoughts which had never before troubled his easy naturethoughts heavily laden with a burden of selfreproach  arrived at the limits of the lawn two paths opened before him one led into a quaintly pretty inclosure cultivated on the plan of the old gardens at versailles and called the french garden the other path led to a grassy walk winding its way capriciously through a thick shrubbery careless in what direction he turned his steps linley entered the shrubbery because it happened to be nearest to him  except at certain points where the moonlight found its way through open spaces in the verdure the grassy path which he was now following wound onward in shadow how far he had advanced he had not noticed when he heard a momentary rustling of leaves at some little distance in advance of him the faint breeze had died away the movement among the leaves had been no doubt produced by the creeping or the flying of some creature of the night looking up at the moment when he was disturbed by this trifling incident he noticed a bright patch of moonlight ahead as he advanced to a new turn in the path  the instant afterward he was startled by the appearance of a figure emerging into the moonlight from the further end of the shrubbery and rapidly approaching him he was near enough to see that it was the figure of a woman was it one of the female servants hurrying back to the house after an interview with a sweetheart in his black evening dress he was in all probability completely hidden by the deep shadow in which he stood would he be less likely to frighten the woman if he called to her than if he allowed her to come close up to him in the dark he decided on calling to her  who is out so late he asked  a cry of alarm answered him the figure stood still for a moment and then turned back as if to escape him by flight  dont be frightened he said surely you know my voice  the figure stood still again he showed himself in the moonlight and discoveredsydney westerfield  you he exclaimed  she trembled the words in which she answered him were words in fragments  the garden was so quiet and prettyi thought there would be no harmplease let me go backim afraid i shall be shut out  she tried to pass him my poor child he said what is there to be frightened about i have been tempted out by the lovely night like you take my arm it is so close in here among the trees if we go back to the lawn the air will come to you freely  she took his arm he could feel her heart throbbing against it kindly silent he led her back to the open space some garden chairs were placed here and there he suggested that she should rest for a while  im afraid i shall be shut out she repeated pray let me get back  he yielded at once to the wish that she expressed you must let me take you back he explained they are all asleep at the house by this time no no dont be frightened again i have got the key of the door the moment i have opened it you shall go in by yourself  she looked at him gratefully you are not offended with me now mr linley she said you are like your kind self again  they ascended the steps which led to the door linley took the key from his pocket it acted perfectly in drawing back the lock but the door when he pushed it resisted him he put his shoulder against it and exerted his strength helped by his weight the door remained immovable  had one of the servantssitting up later than usual after the party and not aware that mr linley had gone into the gardennoticed the door and carefully fastened the bolts on the inner side that was exactly what had happened  there was nothing for it but to submit to circumstances linley led the way down the steps again we are shut out he said  sydney listened in silent dismay he seemed to be merely amused he treated their common misfortune as lightly as if it had been a joke  theres nothing so very terrible in our situation he reminded her the servants offices will be opened between six and seven oclock the weather is perfect and the summerhouse in the french garden has one easychair in it to my certain knowledge in which you may rest and sleep im sure you must be tiredlet me take you there  she drew back and looked up at the house  cant we make them hear us she asked  quite impossible besides he was about to remind her of the evil construction which might be placed on their appearance together returning from the garden at an advanced hour of the night but her innocence pleaded with him to be silent he only said you forget that we all sleep at the top of our old castle there is no knocker to the door and no bell that rings upstairs come to the summerhouse in an hour or two more we shall see the sun rise  she took his arm in silence they reached the french garden without another word having passed between them  the summerhouse had been designed in harmony with the french taste of the last century from a classical model it was a rough copy in wood of the temple of vesta at rome opening the door for his companion linley paused before he followed her in a girl brought up by a careful mother would have understood and appreciated his hesitation she would have concealed any feeling of embarrassment that might have troubled her at the moment and would have asked him to come back and let her know when the rising of the sun began neglected by her mother worse than neglected by her aunt sydneys fearless ignorance put a question which would have lowered the poor girl cruelly in the estimation of a stranger are you going to leave me here by myself she asked why dont you come in  linley thought of his visit to the school and remembered the detestable mistress he excused sydney he felt for her she held the door open for him sure of himself he entered the summerhouse  as a mark of respect on her part she offered the armchair to him it was the one comfortable seat in the neglected place he insisted that she should take it and searching the summerhouse found a wooden stool for himself the small circular room received but little of the dim outer lightthey were near each otherthey were silent sydney burst suddenly into a nervous little laugh  why do you laugh he asked goodhumoredly  it seems so strange mr linley for us to be out here in the moment when she made that reply her merriment vanished she looked out sadly through the open door at the stillness of the night what should i have done she wondered if i had been shut out of the house by myself her eyes rested on him timidly there was some thought in her which she shrank from expressing she only said i wish i knew how to be worthy of your kindness  her voice warned him that she was struggling with strong emotion in one respect men are all alike they hate to see a woman in tears linley treated her like a child he smiled and patted her on the shoulder nonsense he said gayly there is no merit in being kind to my good little governess  she took that comforting handit was a harmless impulse that she was unable to resistshe bent over it and kissed it gratefully he drew his hand away from her as if the soft touch of her lips had been fire that burned it oh she cried have i done wrong  no my dearno no  there was an embarrassment in his manner the inevitable result of his fear of himself if he faltered in the resolute exercise of selfrestraint which was perfectly incomprehensible to sydney he moved his seat back a little so as to place himself further away something in that action at that time shocked and humiliated her completely misunderstanding him she thought he was reminding her of the distance that separated them in social rank oh the shame of it the shame of it would other governesses have taken a liberty with their master a fit of hysterical sobbing burst its way through her last reserves of selfcontrol she started to her feet and ran out of the summerhouse  alarmed and distressed he followed her instantly  she was leaning against the pedestal of a statue in the garden panting shuddering a sight to touch the heart of a far less sensitive man than the man who now approached her sydney he said dear little sydney she tried to speak to him in return breath and strength failed her together she lifted her hand vainly grasping at the broad pedestal behind her she would have fallen if he had not caught her in his arms her head sank faintly backward on his breast he looked at the poor little tortured face turned up toward him in the lovely moonlight again and again he had honorably restrained himselfhe was human he was a manin one mad moment it was done hotly passionately donehe kissed her  for the first time in her maidens life a mans lips touched her lips all that had been perplexing and strange all that had been innocently wonderful to herself in the feeling that bound sydney to her first friend was a mystery no more love lifted its veil nature revealed its secrets in the one supreme moment of that kiss she threw her arms around his neck with a low cry of delightand returned his kiss  sydney he whispered i love you  she heard him in rapturous silence her kiss had answered for her  at that crisis in their lives they were saved by an accident a poor little common accident that happens every day the spring in the bracelet that sydney wore gave way as she held him to her the bright trinket fell on the grass at her feet the man never noticed it the woman saw her pretty ornament as it dropped from her armsaw and remembered mrs linleys gift  cold and palewith horror of herself confessed in the action simple as it wasshe drew back from him in dead silence  he was astounded in tones that trembled with agitation he said to her are you ill  shameless and wicked she answered not ill she pointed to the bracelet on the grass take it up i am not fit to touch it look on the inner side  he remembered the inscription to sydney westerfield with catherine linleys love his head sank on his breast he understood her at last you despise me he said and i deserve it  no i despise myself i have lived among vile people and i am vile like them  she moved a few steps away with a heavy sigh kitty she said to herself poor little kitty  he followed her why are you thinking of the child he asked at such a time as this  she replied without returning or looking round distrust of herself had inspired her with terror of linley from the time when the bracelet had dropped on the grass  i can make but one atonement she said we must see each other no more i must say goodby to kittyi must go help me to submit to my hard loti must go  he set her no example of resignation he shrank from the prospect that she presented to him  where are you to go if you leave us he asked  away from england the further away from you the better for both of us help me with your interest have me sent to the new world in the west with other emigrants give me something to look forward to that is not shame and despair let me do something that is innocent and goodi may find a trace of my poor lost brother oh let me go let me go  her resolution shamed him he rose to her level in spite of himself  i dare not tell you that you are wrong he said i only ask you to wait a little till we are calmer before you speak of the future again he pointed to the summerhouse go in my poor girl rest and compose yourself while i try to think  he left her and paced up and down the formal walks in the garden away from the maddening fascination of her presence his mind grew clearer he resisted the temptation to think of her tenderly he set himself to consider what it would be well to do next  the moonlight was seen no more misty and starless the dark sky spread its majestic obscurity over the earth linley looked wearily toward the eastern heaven the darkness daunted him he saw in it the shadow of his own sense of guilt the gray glimmering of dawn the songs of birds when the pure light softly climbed the sky roused and relieved him with the first radiant rising of the sun he returned to the summerhouse  do i disturb you he asked waiting at the door  no  will you come out and speak to me  she appeared at the door waiting to hear what he had to say to her  i must ask you to submit to a sacrifice of your own feelings he began when i kept away from you in the drawing room last nightwhen my strange conduct made you fear that you had offended mei was trying to remember what i owed to my good wife i have been thinking of her again we must spare her a discovery too terrible to be endured while her attention is claimed by the guests who are now in the house in a weeks time they will leave us will you consent to keep up appearances will you live with us as usual until we are left by ourselves  it shall be done mr linley i only ask one favor of you my worst enemy is my own miserable wicked heart oh dont you understand me i am ashamed to look at you  he had only to examine his own heart and to know what she meant say no more he answered sadly we will keep as much away from each other as we can  she shuddered at that open recognition of the guilty love which united them in spite of their horror of it and took refuge from him in the summerhouse not a word more passed between them until the unbarring of doors was heard in the stillness of the morning and the smoke began to rise from the kitchen chimney then he returned and spoke to her  you can get back to the house he said go up by the front stairs and you will not meet the servants at this early hour if they do see you you have your cloak on they will think you have been in the garden earlier than usual as you pass the upper door draw back the bolts quietly and i can let myself in  she bent her head in silence he looked after her as she hastened away from him over the lawn conscious of admiring her conscious of more than he dared realize to himself when she disappeared he turned back to wait where she had been waiting with his sense of the duty he owed to his wife penitently present to his mind the memory of that fatal kiss still left its vivid impression on him what a scoundrel i am he said to himself as he stood alone in the summerhouse looking at the chair which she had just left    chapter x kitty mentions her birthday   a clever old lady possessed of the inestimable advantages of worldly experience must submit nevertheless to the laws of nature time and sleep togetherpowerful agents in the small hours of the morninghad got the better of mrs prestys resolution to keep awake free from discovery sydney ascended the stairs free from discovery sydney entered her own room  halfanhour later linley opened the door of his dressingroom his wife was still sleeping his motherinlaw woke two hours later looked at her watch and discovered that she had lost her opportunity other old women under similar circumstances might have felt discouraged this old woman believed in her own suspicions more devoutly than ever when the breakfastbell rang sydney found mrs presty in the corridor waiting to say good morning  i wonder what you were doing last night when you ought to have been in bed the old lady began with a treacherous amiability of manner oh i am not mistaken your door was open my dear and i looked in  why did you look in mrs presty  my young friend i was naturally anxious about you i am anxious still were you in the house or out of the house  i was walking in the garden sydney replied  admiring the moonlight  yes admiring the moonlight  alone of course sydneys friend suggested  and sydney took refuge in prevarication why should you doubt it she said  mrs presty wasted no more time in asking questions she was pleasantly reminded of the words of worldly wisdom which she had addressed to her daughter on the day of sydneys arrival at mount morven the good qualities of that unfortunate young creature she had said can not have always resisted the horrid temptations and contaminations about her hundreds of times she must have lied through ungovernable fear elevated a little higher than ever in her own estimation mrs presty took sydneys arm and led her down to breakfast with motherly familiarity linley met them at the foot of the stairs his motherinlaw first stole a look at sydney and then shook hands with him cordially my dear herbert how pale you are that horrid smoking you look as if you had been up all night    mrs linley paid her customary visit to the schoolroom that morning  the necessary attention to her guests had left little leisure for the exercise of observation at the breakfasttable the one circumstance which had forced itself on her notice had been the boisterous gayety of her husband too essentially honest to practice deception of any kind cleverly linley had overacted the part of a man whose mind was entirely at ease the most unsuspicious woman living his wife was simply amused how he does enjoy society she thought herbert will be a young man to the end of his life  in the best possible spiritsstill animated by her successful exertions to entertain her friendsmrs linley opened the schoolroom door briskly how are the lessons getting on she beganand checked herself with a start kitty she exclaimed crying  the child ran to her mother with tears in her eyes look at syd she sulks she cries she wont talk to mesend for the doctor  you tiresome child i dont want the doctor im not ill  there mamma cried kitty she never scolded me before today  in other words here was a complete reversal of the usual order of things in the schoolroom patient sydney was out of temper gentle sydney spoke bitterly to the little friend whom she loved mrs linley drew a chair to the governesss side and took her hand the strangely altered girl tore her hand away and burst into a violent fit of crying puzzled and frightened kitty to the best of a childs ability followed her example mrs linley took her daughter on her knee and gave sydneys outbreak of agitation time to subside there were no feverish appearances in her face there was no feverish heat in her skin when their hands had touched each other for a moment in all probability the mischief was nervous mischief and the outburst of weeping was an hysterical effort at relief  i am afraid my dear you have had a bad night mrs linley said  bad worse than bad  sydney stopped looked at her good mistress and friend in terror and made a confused effort to explain away what she had just said as sensibly and kindly selfpossessed as ever mrs linley told her that she only wanted rest and quiet let me take you to my room she proposed we will have the sofa moved into the balcony and you will soon go to sleep in the delicious warm air you may put away your books kitty this is a holiday come with me and be petted and spoiled by the ladies in the morningroom  neither the governess nor the pupil was worthy of the sympathy so frankly offered to them still strangely confused sydney made commonplace apologies and asked leave to go out and walk in the park hearing this kitty declared that where her governess went she would go too mrs linley smoothed her daughters pretty auburn hair and said playfully i think i ought to be jealous to her surprise sydney looked up as if the words had been addressed to herself you mustnt be fonder my dear of your governess mrs linley went on than you are of your mother she kissed the child and rising to go discovered that sydney had moved to another part of the room she was standing at the piano with a page of music in her hand the page was upside downand she had placed herself in a position which concealed her face slow as mrs linley was to doubt any person more especially a person who interested her she left the room with a vague fear of something wrong and with a conviction that she would do well to consult her husband  hearing the door close sydney looked round she and kitty were alone again and kitty was putting away her books without showing any pleasure at the prospect of a holiday  sydney took the child fondly in her arms would you be very sorry she asked if i was obliged to go away some day and leave you kitty turned pale with terror at the dreadful prospect which those words presented there there i am only joking sydney said shocked at the effect which her attempt to suggest the impending separation had produced you shall come with me darling we will walk in the park together  kittys face brightened directly she proposed extending their walk to the paddock and feeding the cows sydney readily consented any amusement was welcome to her which diverted the childs attention from herself  they had been nearly an hour in the park and were returning to the house through a clump of trees when sydneys companion running on before her cried heres papa her first impulse was to draw back behind a tree in the hope of escaping notice linley sent kitty away to gather a nosegay of daisies and joined sydney under the trees  i have been looking for you everywhere he said my wife  sydney interrupted him discovered she exclaimed  there is nothing that need alarm you he replied catherine is too good and too true herself to suspect others easily she sees a change in you that she doesnt understandshe asks if i have noticed itand that is all but her mother has the cunning of the devil there is a serious reason for controlling yourself  he spoke so earnestly that he startled her are you angry with me she asked  angry does the man live who could be angry with you  it might be better for both of us if you were angry with me i have to control myself i will try again oh if you only knew what i suffer when mrs linley is kind to me  he persisted in trying to rouse her to a sense of the danger that threatened them while the visitors remained in the house in a few days sydney there will be no more need for the deceit that is now forced on us till that time comes remembermrs presty suspects us  kitty ran back to them with her hands full of daisies before they could say more  there is your nosegay papa no i dont want you to thank mei want to know what present you are going to give me her fathers mind was preoccupied he looked at her absently the childs sense of her own importance was wounded she appealed to her governess would you believe it she asked papa has forgotten that next tuesday is my birthday  very well kitty i must pay the penalty of forgetting what present would you like to have  i want a dolls perambulator  ha in my time we were satisfied with a doll  they all three looked round another person had suddenly joined in the talk there was no mistaking the persons voice mrs presty appeared among the trees taking a walk in the park had she heard what linley and the governess had said to each other while kitty was gathering daisies  quite a domestic scene the sly old lady remarked papa looking like a saint in a picture with flowers in his hand papas spoiled child always wanting something and always getting it and papas governess so sweetly fresh and pretty that i should certainly fall in love with her if i had the advantage of being a man you have no doubt remarked herberti think i hear the bell shall we go to lunchyou have no doubt i say remarked what curiously opposite styles catherine and miss westerfield present so charming and yet such complete contrasts i wonder whether they occasionally envy each others good looks does my daughter ever regret that she is not miss westerfield and do you my dear some times wish you were mrs linley  while we are about it let me put a third question linley interposed are you ever aware of it yourself mrs presty when you are talking nonsense  he was angry and he showed it in that feeble reply sydney felt the implied insult offered to her in another way it roused her to the exercise of selfcontrol as nothing had roused her yet she ignored mrs prestys irony with a composure worthy of mrs presty herself where is the woman she said who would not wish to be as beautiful as mrs linleyand as good  thank you my dear for a compliment to my daughter a sincere compliment no doubt it comes in very neatly and nicely mrs presty acknowledged after my soninlaws little outbreak of temper my poor herbert when will you understand that i mean no harm i am an essentially humorous person my wonderful spirits are always carrying me away i do assure you miss westerfield i dont know what worry is my troublesdeaths in the family and that sort of thingseem to slip off me in a most remarkable manner poor mr norman used to attribute it to my excellent digestion my second husband would never hear of such an explanation as that his high ideal of women shrank from allusions to stomachs he used to speak so nicely quoting some poet of the sunshine of my breast vague perhaps said mrs presty modestly looking down at the ample prospect of a personal nature which presented itself below her throat but so flattering to ones feelings theres the luncheon bell again i declare ill run on before and tell them you are coming some people might say they wished to be punctual i am truth itself and i own i dont like to be helped to the underside of the fish au revoir do you remember miss westerfield when i asked you to repeat au revoir as a specimen of your french i didnt think much of your accent oh dear me i didnt think much of your accent  kitty looked after her affluent grandmother with eyes that stared respectfully in ignorant admiration she pulled her fathers coattail and addressed herself gravely to his private ear oh papa what noble words grandmamma has     chapter xi    linley asserts his authority   on the evening of monday in the new week the last of the visitors had left mount morven mrs linley dropped into a chair in what randal called the heavenly tranquillity of the deserted drawingroom and owned that the effort of entertaining her guests had completely worn her out its too absurd at my time of life she said with a faint smile but i am really and truly so tired that i must go to bed before dark as if i was a child again  mrs prestymaliciously observant of the governess sitting silent and apart in a cornerapproached her daughter in a hurry to all appearance with a special object in view linley was at no loss to guess what that object might be will you do me a favor catherine mrs presty began i wish to say a word to you in your own room  oh mamma have some mercy on me and put it off till tomorrow  mrs presty reluctantly consented to this proposal on one condition it is understood she stipulated that i am to see you the first thing in the morning  mrs linley was ready to accept that condition or any condition which promised her a night of uninterrupted repose she crossed the room to her husband and took his arm in my state of fatigue herbert i shall never get up our steep stairs unless you help me  as they ascended the stairs together linley found that his wife had a reason of her own for leaving the drawingroom  i am quite weary enough to go to bed she explained but i wanted to speak to you first its about miss westerfield no no we neednt stop on the landing do you know i think i have found out what has altered our little governess so strangelyi seem to startle you  no  i am only astonished mrs linley resumed at my own stupidity in not having discovered it before we must be kinder than ever to the poor girl now cant you guess why my dear how dull you are must i remind you that we have had two single men among our visitors one of them is old and doesnt matter but the otheri mean sir george of courseis young handsome and agreeable i am so sorry for sydney westerfield its plain to me that she is hopelessly in love with a man who has run through his fortune and must marry money if he marries at all i shall speak to sydney tomorrow and i hope and trust i shall succeed in winning her confidence thank heaven here we are at my door at last i cant say more now im ready to drop goodnight dear you look tired too its a nice thing to have friends i know but oh what a relief it is sometimes to get rid of them  she kissed him and let him go  left by himself to compare his wifes innocent mistake with the terrible enlightenment that awaited her linleys courage failed him he leaned on the quaintlycarved rail that protected the outer side of the landing and looked down at the stone hall far below if the old woodwork he thought would only give way under his weight there would be an escape from the coming catastrophe found in an instant  a timely remembrance of sydney recalled him to himself for her sake he was bound to prevent mrs prestys contemplated interview with his wife on the next morning  descending the stairs he met his brother in the corridor on the first floor  the very man i want to see randal said tell me herbert what is the matter with that curious old woman  do you mean mrs presty  yes she has just been telling me that our friend mrs macedwin has taken a fancy to miss westerfield and would be only too glad to deprive us of our pretty governess  did mrs presty say that in miss westerfields presence  no soon after you and catherine left the room miss westerfield left it too i daresay i am wrong for i havent had time to think of it but mrs prestys manner suggested to me that she would be glad to see the poor girl sent out of the house  i am going to speak to her randal on that very subject is she still in the drawingroom  yes  did she say anything more to you  i didnt give her the chance i dont like mrs presty you look worn and worried herbert is there anything wrong  if there is my dear fellow you will hear of it tomorrow  so they parted  comfortably established in the drawingroom mrs presty had just opened her favorite newspaper her only companion was linleys black poodle resting at her feet on the opening of the door the dog roseadvanced to caress his masterand looked up in linleys face if mrs prestys attention had happened to be turned that way she might have seen in the faithful creatures sudden and silent retreat a warning of her soninlaws humor at that moment but she was or assumed to be interested in her reading and she deliberately overlooked linleys appearance after waiting a little to attract her attention he quietly took the newspaper out of her hand  what does this mean mrs presty asked  it means maam that i have something to say to you  apparently something that cant be said with common civility be as rude as you please i am well used to it  linley wisely took no notice of this  since you have lived at mount morven he proceeded i think you have found me on the whole an easy man to get on with at the same time when i do make up my mind to be master in my own house i am master  mrs presty crossed her hands placidly on her lap and asked master of what  master of your suspicions of miss westerfield you are free of course to think of her and of me as you please what i forbid is the expression of your thoughtseither by way of hints to my brother or officious communications with my wife dont suppose that i am afraid of the truth mrs linley shall know more than you think for and shall know it tomorrow not from you but from me  mrs presty shook her head compassionately my good sir surely you know me too well to think that i am to be disposed of in that easy way must i remind you that your wifes mother has the cunning of the devil  linley recognized his own words so you were listening among the trees he said  yes i was listening and i have only to regret that i didnt hear more let us return to our subject i dont trust my daughters interestsmy muchinjured daughters interestsin your hands they are not clean hands mr linley i have a duty to do and i shall do it tomorrow  no mrs presty you wont do it tomorrow  who will prevent me  i shall prevent you  in what way if you please  i dont think it necessary to answer that question my servants will have their instructions and i shall see myself that my orders are obeyed  thank you i begin to understand i am to be turned out of the house very well we shall see what my daughter says  you know as well as i do mrs presty that if your daughter is forced to choose between us she will decide for her husband you have the night before you for consideration i have no more to say  among mrs prestys merits it is only just to reckon a capacity for making up her mind rapidly under stress of circumstances before linley had opened the door on his way out he was called back  i am shocked to trouble you again mrs presty said but i dont propose to interfere with my nights rest by thinking about you my position is perfectly clear to me without wasting time in consideration when a man so completely forgets what is due to the weaker sex as to threaten a woman the woman has no alternative but to submit you are aware that i had arranged to see my daughter tomorrow morning i yield to brute force sir tell your wife that i shall not keep my appointment are you satisfied  quite satisfied linley saidand left the room  his motherinlaw looked after him with a familiar expression of opinion and a smile of supreme contempt  you fool  only two words and yet there seemed to be some hidden meaning in themrelating perhaps to what might happen on the next daywhich gently tickled mrs presty in the region assigned by phrenologists to the sense of selfesteem     chapter xii two of them sleep badly  waiting for sydney to come into the bedroom as usual and wish her goodnight kitty was astonished by the appearance of her grandmother entering on tiptoe from the corridor with a small paper parcel in her hand  whisper said mrs presty pointing to the open door of communication with mrs linleys room this is your birthday present you mustnt look at it till you wake tomorrow morning she pushed the parcel under the pillowand instead of saying goodnight took a chair and sat down  may i show my present kitty asked when i go to mamma in the morning  the present hidden under the paper wrapper was a sixpenny picturebook kittys grandmother disapproved of spending money lavishly on birthday gifts to children show it of course and take the greatest care of it mrs presty answered gravely but tell me one thing my dear wouldnt you like to see all your presents early in the morning like mine  still smarting under the recollection of her interview with her soninlaw mrs presty had certain ends to gain in putting this idea into the childs head it was her special object to raise domestic obstacles to a private interview between the husband and wife during the earlier hours of the day if the gifts usually presented after the nursery dinner were produced on this occasion after breakfast there would be a period of delay before any confidential conversation could take place between mr and mrs linley in this interval mrs presty saw her opportunity of setting linleys authority at defiance by rousing the first jealous suspicion in the mind of his wife  innocent little kitty became her grandmothers accomplice on the spot i shall ask mamma to let me have my presents at breakfasttime she announced  and kind mamma will say yes mrs presty chimed in we will breakfast early my precious child goodnight  kitty was half asleep when her governess entered the room afterward much later than usual i thought you had forgotten me she said yawning and stretching out her plump little arms  sydneys heart ached when she thought of the separation that was to come with the next day her despair forced its way to expression in words  i wish i could forget you she answered in reckless wretchedness  the child was still too drowsy to hear plainly what did you say she asked sydney gently lifted her in the bed and kissed her again and again kittys sleepy eyes opened in surprise how cold your hands are she said and how often you kiss me what is it you have come to say to megoodnight or goodby  sydney laid her down again on the pillow gave her a last kiss and ran out of the room  in the corridor she heard linleys voice on the lower floor he was asking one of the servants if miss westerfield was in the house or in the garden her first impulse was to advance to the stairs and to answer his question in a moment more the remembrance of mrs linley checked her she went back to her bedchamber the presents that she had received since her arrival at mount morven were all laid out so that they could be easily seen by any person entering the room after she had left the house on the sofa lay the pretty new dress which she had worn at the evening party other little gifts were arranged on either side of it the bracelet resting on the pedestal of a statue close by kept a morsel of paper in its placeon which she had written a few penitent words of farewell addressed to mrs linley on the toilettable three photographic portraits showed themselves among the brushes and combs she sat down and looked first at the likenesses of mrs linley and kitty  had she any right to make those dear faces her companions in the future  she hesitated her tears dropped on the photographs theyre as good as spoiled now she thought theyre no longer fit for anybody but me she paused and abruptly took up the third and last photographthe likeness of herbert linley  was it an offense now even to look at his portrait no idea of leaving it behind her was in her mind her resolution vibrated between two miseriesthe misery of preserving her keepsake after she had parted from him forever and the misery of destroying it resigned to one more sacrifice she took the card in both hands to tear it up it would have been scattered in pieces on the floor but for the chance which had turned the portrait side of the card toward her instead of the back her longing eyes stole a last look at hima frenzy seized hershe pressed her lips to the photograph in a passion of hopeless love what does it matter she asked herself im nothing but the ignorant object of his kindnessthe poor fool who could see no difference between gratitude and love where is the harm of having him with me when i am starving in the streets or dying in the workhouse the fervid spirit in her that had never known a mothers loving discipline never thrilled to the sympathy of a sisterfriend rose in revolt against the evil destiny which had imbittered her life her eyes still rested on the photograph come to my heart my only friend and kill me as those wild words escaped her she thrust the card furiously into the bosom of her dressand threw herself on the floor there was something in the mad selfabandonment of that action which mocked the innocent despair of her childhood on the day when her mother left her at the cruel mercy of her aunt  that night was a night of torment in secret to another person at mount morven  wandering in his need of selfisolation up and down the dreary stone passages in the lower part of the house linley counted the hours inexorably lessening the interval between him and the ordeal of confession to his wife as yet he had failed to find the opportunity of addressing to sydney the only words of encouragement he could allow to pass his lips he had asked for her earlier in the evening and nobody could tell him where she was still in ignorance of the refuge which she might by bare possibility hope to find in mrs macedwins house sydney was spared the torturing doubts which now beset herbert linleys mind would the noble woman whom they had injured allow their atonement to plead for them and consent to keep their miserable secret might they still put their trust in that generous nature a few hours hence again and again those questions confronted linley and again and again he shrank from attempting to answer them     chapter xiii kitty keeps her birthday  they were all assembled as usual at the breakfasttable  preferring the request suggested to her by mrs presty kitty had hastened the presentation of the birthday gifts by getting into her mothers bed in the morning and exacting her mothers promise before she would consent to get out again by her own express wish she was left in ignorance of what the presents would prove to be hide them from me said this young epicure in pleasurable sensations and make me want to see them until i can bear it no longer the gifts had accordingly been collected in an embrasure of one of the windows and the time had now arrived when kitty could bear it no longer  in the procession of the presents mrs linley led the way  she had passed behind the screen which had thus far protected the hidden treasures from discovery and appeared again with a vision of beauty in the shape of a doll the dress of this wonderful creature exhibited the latest audacities of french fashion her head made a bow her eyes went to sleep and woke again she had a voice that said two wordsmore precious than two thousand in the mouth of a mere living creature kittys arms opened and embraced her gift with a scream of ecstasy that fervent pressure found its way to the right spring the doll squeaked mammaand creakedand cried againand said papa kitty sat down on the floor her legs would support her no longer i think i shall faint she said quite seriously  in the midst of the general laughter sydney silently placed a new toy a pretty little imitation of a jewelers casket at kittys side and drew back before the child could look at her mrs presty was the only person present who noticed her pale face and the trembling of her hands as she made the effort which preserved her composure  the dolls necklace bracelets and watch and chain riveted kittys attention on the casket just as she thought of looking round for her dear syd her father produced a new outburst of delight by presenting a perambulator worthy of the doll her uncle followed with a parasol devoted to the preservation of the dolls complexion when she went out for an airing then there came a pause where was the generous grandmothers gift nobody remembered it mrs presty herself discovered the inestimable sixpenny picturebook cast away and forgotten on a distant windowseat i have a great mind to keep this she said to kitty till you are old enough to value it properly in the moment of her absence at the window linleys motherinlaw lost the chance of seeing him whisper to sydney meet me in the shrubbery in half an hour he said she stepped back from him startled by the proposal when mrs presty was in the middle of the room again linley and the governess were no longer near each other  having by this time recovered herself kitty got on her legs now the spoiled child declared addressing the company present im going to play  the doll was put into the perambulator and was wheeled about the room while mrs linley moved the chairs out of the way and randal attended with the open parasolunder orders to pretend that the sun was shining once more the sixpenny picturebook was neglected mrs presty picked it up from the floor determined by this time to hold it in reserve until her ungrateful grandchild reached years of discretion she put it in the bookcase between byrons don juan and butlers lives of the saints in the position which she now occupied linley was visible approaching sydney again your own interests are seriously concerned he whispered in something that i have to tell you  incapable of hearing what passed between them mrs presty could see that a secret understanding united her soninlaw and the governess she looked round cautiously at mrs linley  kittys humor had changed she was now eager to see the dolls splendid clothes taken off and put on again come and look at it she said to sydney i want you to enjoy my birthday as much as i do left by himself randal got rid of the parasol by putting it on a table near the door mrs presty beckoned to him to join her at the further end of the room  i want you to do me a favor she began  glancing at linley before she proceeded mrs presty took up a newspaper and affected to be consulting randals opinion on a passage which had attracted her attention your brother is looking our way she whispered he mustnt suspect that there is a secret between us  false pretenses of any kind invariably irritated randal what do you want me to do he asked sharply  the reply only increased his perplexity  observe miss westerfield and your brother look at them now  randal obeyed  what is there to look at he inquired  cant you see  i see they are talking to each other  they are talking confidentially talking so that mrs linley cant hear them look again  randal fixed his eyes on mrs presty with an expression which showed his dislike of that lady a little too plainly before he could answer what she had just said to him his lively little niece hit on a new idea the sun was shining the flowers were in their brightest beautyand the doll had not yet been taken into the garden kitty at once led the way out so completely preoccupied in steering the perambulator in a straight course that she forgot her uncle and the parasol only waiting to remind her husband and sydney that they were wasting the beautiful summer morning indoors mrs linley followed her daughterand innocently placed a fatal obstacle in mrs prestys way by leaving the room having consulted each other by a look linley and the governess went out next left alone with randal mrs prestys anger under the complete overthrow of her carefullylaid scheme set restraint at defiance  my daughters married life is a wreck she burst out pointing theatrically to the door by which linley and sydney westerfield had retired and catherine has the vile creature whom your brother picked up in london to thank for it now do you understand me  less than ever randal answeredunless you have taken leave of your senses  mrs presty recovered the command of her temper  on that fine morning her daughter might remain in the garden until the luncheonbell rang linley had only to say that he wished to speak with his wife and the private interview which he had so rudely insisted on as his sole privilege would assuredly take place the one chance left of still defeating him on his own ground was to force randal to interfere by convincing him of his brothers guilt moderation of language and composure of manner offered the only hopeful prospect of reaching this end mrs presty assumed the disguise of patient submission and used the irresistible influence of good humor and good sense  i dont complain dear randal of what you have said to me she replied my indiscretion has deserved it i ought to have produced my proofs and have left it to you to draw the conclusion sit down if you please i wont detain you for more than a few minutes  randal had not anticipated such moderation as this he took the chair that was nearest to mrs presty they were both now sitting with their backs turned to the entrance from the library to the drawingroom  i wont trouble you with my own impressions mrs presty went on i will be careful only to mention what i have seen and heard if you refuse to believe me i refer you to the guilty persons themselves  she had just got to the end of those introductory words when mrs linley returned by way of the library to fetch the forgotten parasol  randal insisted on making mrs presty express herself plainly you speak of guilty persons he said am i to understand that one of those guilty persons is my brother  mrs linley advanced a step and took the parasol from the table hearing what randal said she paused wondering at the strange allusion to her husband in the meanwhile mrs presty answered the question that had been addressed to her  yes she said to randal i mean your brother and your brothers mistresssydney westerfield  mrs linley laid the parasol back on the table and approached them  she never once looked at her mother her face white and rigid was turned toward randal to him and to him only she spoke  what does my mothers horrible language mean she asked  mrs presty triumphed inwardly chance had decided in her favor after all dont you see she said to her daughter that i am here to answer for myself  mrs linley still looked at randal and still spoke to him it is impossible for me to insist on an explanation from my mother she proceeded no matter what i may feel i must remember that she is my mother i ask you againyou who have been listening to herwhat does she mean  mrs prestys sense of her own importance refused to submit to being passed over in this way  however insolently you may behave catherine you will not succeed in provoking me your mother is bound to open your eyes to the truth you have a rival in your husbands affections and that rival is your governess take your own course now i have no more to say with her head high in the airlooking the picture of conscious virtuethe old lady walked out  at the same moment randal seized his first opportunity of speaking  he addressed himself gently and respectfully to his sisterinlaw she refused to hear him the indignation which mrs presty had roused in her made no allowances and was blind to all sense of right  dont trouble yourself to account for your silence she said most unjustly you were listening to my mother without a word of remonstrance when i came into the room you are concerned in this vile slander too  randal considerately refrained from provoking her by attempting to defend himself while she was incapable of understanding him you will be sorry when you find that you have misjudged me he said and sighed and left her  she dropped into a chair if there was any one distinct thought in her at that moment it was the thought of her husband she was eager to see him she longed to say to him my love i dont believe a word of it he was not in the garden when she had returned for the parasol and sydney was not in the garden wondering what had become of her father and her governess kitty had asked the nursemaid to look for them what had happened since where had they been found after some hesitation mrs linley sent for the nursemaid she felt the strongest reluctance when the girl appeared to approach the very inquiries which she was interested in making  have you found mr linley she saidwith an effort  yes maam  where did you find him  in the shrubbery  did your master say anything  i slipped away maam before he saw me  why  miss westerfield was in the shrubbery with my master i might have been mistaken the girl paused and looked confused  mrs linley tried to tell her to go on the words were in her mind but the capacity of giving expression to them failed her she impatiently made a sign the sign was understood  i might have been mistaken the maid repeatedbut i thought miss westerfield was crying  having replied in those terms she seemed to be anxious to get away the parasol caught her eye miss kitty wants this she said and wonders why you have not gone back to her in the garden may i take the parasol  take it  the tone of the mistresss voice was completely changed the servant looked at her with vague misgivings are you not well maam  quite well  the servant withdrew  mrs linleys chair happened to be near one of the windows which commanded a view of the drive leading to the main entrance of the house a carriage had just arrived bringing holiday travelers to visit that part of mount morven which was open to strangers she watched them as they got out talking and laughing and looking about them still shrinking instinctively from the first doubt of herbert that had ever entered her mind she found a refuge from herself in watching the ordinary events of the day one by one the tourists disappeared under the portico of the front door the empty carriage was driven away next to water the horses at the village inn solitude was all she could see from the windows silence horrible silence surrounded her out of doors and in the thoughts from which she recoiled forced their way back into her mind the narrative of the nursemaids discovery became a burden on her memory once more she considered the circumstances in spite of herself she considered the circumstances again her husband and sydney westerfield together in the shrubberyand sydney crying had mrs prestys abominable suspicion of them reached their ears orno that second possibility might be estimated at its right value by any other woman not by herbert linleys wife  she snatched up the newspaper and fixed her eyes on it in the hope of fixing her mind on it next obstinately desperately she read without knowing what she was reading the lines of print were beginning to mingle and grow dim when she was startled by the sudden opening of the door she looked round  her husband entered the room    chapter xiv kitty feels the heartache   linley advanced a few stepsand stopped  his wife hurrying eagerly to meet him checked herself it might have been distrust or it might have been unreasoning fearshe hesitated on the point of approaching him  i have something to say catherine which im afraid will distress you  his voice faltered his eyes rested on herthen looked away again he said no more  he had spoken a few commonplace wordsand yet he had said enough she saw the truth in his eyes heard the truth in his voice a fit of trembling seized her linley stepped forward in the fear that she might fall she instantly controlled herself and signed to him to keep back dont touch me she said you come from miss westerfield  that reproach roused him  i own that i come from miss westerfield he answered she addresses a request to you through me  i refuse to grant it  hear it first  no  hear itin your own interest she asks permission to leave the house never to return again while she is still innocent  his wife eyed him with a look of unutterable contempt he submitted to it but not in silence  a man doesnt lie catherine who makes such a confession as i am making now miss westerfield offers the one atonement in her power while she is still innocent of having wronged youexcept in thought  is that all mrs linley asked  it rests with you he replied to say if there is any other sacrifice of herself which will be more acceptable to you  let me understand first what the sacrifice means does miss westerfield make any conditions  she has positively forbidden me to make conditions  and goes out into the world helpless and friendless  yes  even under the terrible trial that wrung her the nobility of the womans nature spoke in her next words  give me time to think of what you have said she pleaded i have led a happy life i am not used to suffer as i am suffering now  they were both silent kittys voice was audible on the stairs that led to the picturegallery disputing with the maid neither her father nor her mother heard her  miss westerfield is innocent of having wronged me except in thought mrs linley resumed do you tell me that on your word of honor  on my word of honor  so far his wife was satisfied my governess she said might have deceived meshe has not deceived me i owe it to her to remember that she shall go but not helpless and not friendless  her husband forgot the restraints he had imposed on himself  is there another woman in the world like you he exclaimed  many other women she answered firmly a vulgar termagant feeling a sense of injury finds relief in an outburst of jealousy and a furious quarrel you have always lived among ladies surely you ought to know that a wife in my position who respects herself restrains herself i try to remember what i owe to others as well as what they owe to me  she approached the writing table and took up a pen  feeling his position acutely linley refrained from openly admiring her generosity until he had deserved to be forgiven he had forfeited the right to express an opinion on her conduct she misinterpreted his silence as she understood it he appreciated an act of selfsacrifice on miss westerfields sidebut he had no word of encouragement for an act of selfsacrifice on his wifes side she threw down the pen with the first outbreak of anger that had escaped her yet  you have spoken for the governess she said to him i havent heard yet sir what you have to say for yourself is it you who tempted her you know how gratefully she feels toward youhave you perverted her gratitude and led her blindfold to love cruel cruel cruel defend yourself if you can  he made no reply  is it not worth your while to defend yourself she burst out passionately your silence is an insult  my silence is a confession he answered sadly she may accept your mercyi may not even hope for it  something in the tone of his voice reminded her of past daysthe days of perfect love and perfect confidence when she had been the one woman in the world to him dearly treasured remembrances of her married life filled her heart with tenderness and dimmed with tears the angry light that had risen in her eyes there was no pride no anger in his wife when she spoke to him now  oh my husband has she taken your love from me  judge for yourself catherine if there is no proof of my love for you in what i have resistedand no remembrance of all that i owe to you in what i have confessed  she ventured a little nearer to him can i believe you  put me to the test  she instantly took him at his word when miss westerfield has left us promise not to see her again  i promise  and not even to write to her  i promise  she went back to the writingtable my heart is easier she said simply i can be merciful to her now  after writing a few lines she rose and handed the paper to him he looked up from it in surprise addressed to mrs macedwin he said  addressed she answered to the only person i know who feels a true interest in miss westerfield have you not heard of it  i remember he saidand read the lines that followed  i recommend miss westerfield as a teacher of young children having had ample proof of her capacity industry and good temper while she has been governess to my child she leaves her situation in my service under circumstances which testify to her sense of duty and her sense of gratitude  have i said she asked more than i could honorably and truly sayeven after what has happened  he could only look at her no words could have spoken for him as his silence spoke for him at that moment when she took back the written paper there was pardon in her eyes already  the last worst trial remained to be undergone she faced it resolutely tell miss westerfield that i wish to see her  on the point of leaving the room herbert was called back if you happen to meet with my mother his wife added will you ask her to come to me  mrs presty knew her daughters nature mrs presty had been waiting near at hand in expectation of the message which she now received  tenderly and respectfully mrs linley addressed herself to her mother when we last met i thought you spoke rashly and cruelly i know now that there was truthsome truth let me sayin what offended me at the time if you felt strongly it was for my sake i wish to beg your pardon i was hasty i was wrong  on an occasion when she had first irritated and then surprised him randal linley had said to mrs presty you have got a heart after all her reply to her daughter showed that view of her character to be the right one say no more my dear she answered i was hasty i was wrong  the words had barely fallen from her lips before herbert returned he was followed by sydney westerfield  the governess stopped in the middle of the room her head sank on her breast her quick convulsive breathing was the only sound that broke the silence mrs linley advanced to the place in which sydney stood there was something divine in her beauty as she looked at the shrinking girl and held out her hand  sydney fell on her knees in silence she lifted that generous hand to her lips in silence mrs linley raised hertook the writing which testified to her character from the tableand presented it linley looked at his wife looked at the governess he waitedand still neither the one nor the other uttered a word it was more than he could endure he addressed himself to sydney first  try to thank mrs linley he said  she answered faintly i cant speak  he appealed to his wife next say a last kind word to her he pleaded  she made an effort a vain effort to obey him a gesture of despair answered for her as sydney had answered i cant speak  true nobly true to the christian virtue that repents to the christian virtue that forgives those three persons stood together on the brink of separation and forced their frail humanity to suffer and submit  in mercy to the woman linley summoned the courage to part them he turned to his wife first  i may say catherine that she has your good wishes for happier days to come  mrs linley pressed his hand  he approached sydney and gave his wifes message it was in his heart to add something equally kind on his own part he could only say what we have all saidhow sincerely how sorrowfully we all knowthe common word goodbythe common wish god bless you  at that last moment the child ran into the room in search of her mother  there was a low murmur of horror at the sight of her that innocent heart they had all hoped might have been spared the misery of the parting scene  she saw that sydney had her hat and cloak on youre dressed to go out she said sydney turned away to hide her face it was too late kitty had seen the tears oh my darling youre not going away she looked at her father and mother is she going away they were afraid to answer her with all her little strength she clasped her beloved friend and playfellow round the waist my own dear youre not going to leave me the dumb misery in sydneys face struck linley with horror he placed kitty in her mothers arms the childs piteous cry oh dont let her go dont let her go followed the governess as she suffered her martyrdom and went out linleys heart ached he watched her until she was lost to view gone he murmured to himselfgone forever  mrs presty heard him and answered himshell come back again     second book    chapter xv the doctor   as the year advanced the servants at mount morven remarked that the weeks seemed to follow each other more slowly than usual in the higher regions of the house the same impression was prevalent but the sense of dullness among the gentlefolks submitted to circumstances in silence  if the question had been asked in past days who is the brightest and happiest member of the family everybody would have said kitty if the question had been asked at the present time differences of opinion might have suggested different answersbut the whole household would have refrained without hesitation from mentioning the childs name  since sydney westerfields departure kitty had never held up her head  time quieted the childs first vehement outbreak of distress under the loss of the companion whom she had so dearly loved delicate management gently yet resolutely applied held the faithful little creature in check when she tried to discover the cause of her governesss banishment from the house she made no more complaints she asked no more embarrassing questionsbut it was miserably plain to everybody about her that she failed to recover her spirits she was willing to learn her lessons but not under another governess when her mother was able to attend to her she played with her toys and went out riding on her pony but the delightful gayety of other days was gone the shrill laughter that once rang through the house was heard no more kitty had become a quiet child and worse still a child who seemed to be easily tired  the doctor was consulted  he was a man skilled in the sound medical practice that learns its lessons without booksbedside practice his opinion declared that the childs vital power was seriously lowered some cause is at work here he said to the mother which i dont understand can you help me mrs linley helped him without hesitation my little daughter dearly loved her governess and her governess has been obliged to leave us that was her reply the doctor wanted to hear no more he at once advised that kitty should be taken to the seaside and that everything which might remind her of the absent friendbooks presents even articles of clothing likely to revive old associationsshould be left at home a new life in new air when pen ink and paper were offered to him that was the doctors prescription  mrs linley consulted her husband on the choice of the seaside place to which the child should be removed  the blank which sydneys departure left in the life of the household was felt by the master and mistress of mount morvenand felt unhappily without any open avowal on either side of what was passing in their minds in this way the governess became a forbidden subject between them the husband waited for the wife to set the example of approaching it and the wife waited for the husband the trial of temper produced by this state of hesitation and by the secret doubts which it encouraged led insensibly to a certain estrangementwhich linley in particular was morbidly unwilling to acknowledge if when the dinnerhour brought them together he was silent and dull in his wifes presence he attributed it to anxiety on the subject of his brotherthen absent on a critical business errand in london if he sometimes left the house the first thing in the morning and only returned at night it was because the management of the model farm had become one of his duties in randals absence mrs linley made no attempt to dispute this view of the altered circumstances in homelifebut she submitted with a mind ill at ease secretly fearing that linley was suffering under miss westerfields absence she allowed herself to hope that kittys father would see a necessity in his own case for change of scene and would accompany them to the seaside  wont you come with us herbert she suggested when they had both agreed on the choice of a place  his temper was in a state of constant irritation without meaning it he answered her harmless question sharply  how can i go away with you when we are losing by the farm and when there is nobody to check the ruinous expenses but myself  mrs linleys thoughts naturally turned to randals prolonged absence what can be keeping him all this time in london she said  linleys failing patience suffered a severe trial  dont you know he broke out that i have inherited my poor mothers property in england saddled with a lawsuit have you never heard of delays and disappointments and quibbles and false pretenses encountered by unfortunate wretches like me who are obliged to go to law god only knows when randal will be free to return or what bad news he may bring with him when he does come back  you have many anxieties herbert and i ought to have remembered them  that gentle answer touched him he made the best apology in his power he said his nerves were out of order and asked her to excuse him if he had spoken roughly there was no unfriendly feeling on either side and yet there was something wanting in the reconciliation mrs linley left her husband shaken by a conflict of feelings at one moment she felt angry with him at another she felt angry with herself  with the best intentions as usual mrs presty made mischief nevertheless observing that her daughter was in tears and feeling sincerely distressed by the discovery she was eager to administer consolation make your mind easy my dear if you have any doubt about herberts movements when he is away from home i followed him myself the day before yesterday when he went out a long walk for an old womanbut i can assure you that he does really go to the farm  implicitly trusting her husbandand rightly trusting himlinleys wife replied by a look which mrs presty received in silent indignation she summoned her dignity and marched out of the room  five minutes afterward mrs linley received an intimation that her mother was seriously offended in the form of a little note  i find that my maternal interest in your welfare and my devoted efforts to serve you are only rewarded with furious looks the less we see of each other the better permit me to thank you for your invitation and to decline accompanying you when you leave mount morven tomorrow mrs linley answered the note in person the next day kittys grandmotherripe for more mischiefaltered her mind and thoroughly enjoyed her journey to the seaside    chapter xvi the child   during the first week there was an improvement in the childs health which justified the doctors hopeful anticipations mrs linley wrote cheerfully to her husband and the better nature of mrs linleys mother seemed by some inscrutable process to thrive morally under the encouraging influences of the sea air it may be a bold thing to say but it is surely true that our virtues depend greatly on the state of our health  during the second week the reports sent to mount morven were less encouraging the improvement in kitty was maintained but it made no further progress  the lapse of the third week brought with it depressing results there could be no doubt now that the child was losing ground bitterly disappointed mrs linley wrote to her medical adviser describing the symptoms and asking for instructions the doctor wrote back find out where your supply of drinking water comes from if from a well let me know how it is situated answer by telegraph the reply arrived a well near the parish church the doctors advice ran back along the wires come home instantly  they returned the same dayand they returned too late  kittys first night at home was wakeful and restless her little hands felt feverish and she was tormented by perpetual thirst the good doctor still spoke hopefully attributing the symptoms to fatigue after the journey but as the days followed each other his medical visits were paid at shorter intervals the mother noticed that his pleasant face became grave and anxious and implored him to tell her the truth the truth was told in two dreadful words typhoid fever  a day or two later the doctor spoke privately with mr linley the childs debilitated conditionthat lowered state of the vital power which he had observed when kittys case was first submitted to himplaced a terrible obstacle in the way of successful resistance to the advance of the disease say nothing to mrs linley just yet there is no absolute danger so far unless delirium sets in do you think it likely linley asked the doctor shook his head and said god knows  on the next evening but one the fatal symptom showed itself there was nothing violent in the delirium unconscious of past events in the family life the poor child supposed that her governess was living in the house as usual she piteously wondered why sydney remained downstairs in the schoolroom oh dont keep her away from me i want syd i want syd that was her one cry when exhaustion silenced her they hoped that the sad delusion was at an end no as the slow fire of the fever flamed up again the same words were on the childs lips the same fond hope was in her sinking heart  the doctor led mrs linley out of the room is this the governess he asked  yes  is she within easy reach  she is employed in the family of a friend of ours living five miles away from us  send for her instantly  mrs linley looked at him with a wildlymingled expression of hope and fear she was not thinking of herselfshe was not even thinking for that one moment of the child what would her husband say if she who had extorted his promise never to see the governess again brought sydney westerfield back to the house  the doctor spoke to her more strongly still  i dont presume to inquire into your private reasons for hesitating to follow my advice he said but i am bound to tell you the truth my poor little patient is in serious dangerevery hour of delay is an hour gained by death bring that lady to the bedside as fast as your carriage can fetch her and let us see the result if kitty recognizes her governessthere i tell you plainly is the one chance of saving the childs life  mrs linleys resolution flashed on him in her weary eyesthe eyes which by day and night alike had known so little rest she rang for her maid tell your master i want to speak to him  the woman answered my master has gone out  the doctor watched the mothers face no sign of hesitation appeared in itthe one thought in her mind now was the thought of the child she called the maid back  order the carriage  at what time do you want it maam  at once     chapter xvii the husband   mrs linleys first impulse in ordering the carriage was to use it herself one look at the child reminded her that her freedom of action began and ended at the bedside more than an hour must elapse before sydney westerfield could be brought back to mount morven the bare thought of what might happen in that interval if she was absent filled the mother with horror she wrote to mrs macedwin and sent her maid with the letter  of the result of this proceeding it was not possible to entertain a doubt  sydneys love for kitty would hesitate at no sacrifice and mrs macedwins conduct had already answered for her she had received the governess with the utmost kindness and she had generously and delicately refrained from asking any questions but one person at mount morven thought it necessary to investigate the motives under which she had acted mrs prestys inquiring mind arrived at discoveries and mrs prestys sense of duty communicated them to her daughter  there can be no sort of doubt catherine that our good friend and neighbor has heard probably from the servants of what has happened and having her husband to considermen are so weak has drawn her own conclusions if she trusts our fascinating governess its because she knows that miss westerfields affections are left behind her in this house does my explanation satisfy you  mrs linley said never let me hear it again  and mrs presty answered how very ungrateful  the dreary interval of expectation after the departure of the carriage was brightened by a domestic event  thinking it possible that mrs presty might know why her husband had left the house mrs linley sent to ask for information the message in reply informed her that linley had received a telegram announcing randals return from london he had gone to the railway station to meet his brother  before she went downstairs to welcome randal mrs linley paused to consider her situation the one alternative before her was to acknowledge at the first opportunity that she had assumed the serious responsibility of sending for sydney westerfield for the first time in her life catherine linley found herself planning beforehand what she would say to her husband  a second message interrupted her announcing that the two brothers had just arrived she joined them in the drawingroom  linley was sitting in a corner by himself the dreadful discovery that the childs life by the doctors confession was in danger had completely overwhelmed him he had never even lifted his head when his wife opened the door randal and mrs presty were talking together the old ladys insatiable curiosity was eager for news from london she wanted to know how randal had amused himself when he was not attending to business  he was grieving for kitty and he was looking sadly at his brother i dont remember he answered absently other women might have discovered that they had chosen their time badly mrs presty with the best possible intentions remonstrated  really randal you must rouse yourself surely you can tell us something did you meet with any agreeable people while you were away  i met one person who interested me he said with weary resignation  mrs presty smiled a woman of course  a man randal answered a guest like myself at a club dinner  who is he  captain bennydeck  in the army  no formerly in the navy  and you and he had a long talk together  randals tones began to betray irritation no he said the captain went away early  mrs prestys vigorous intellect discovered an improbability here then how came you to feel interested in him she objected  even randals patience gave way i cant account for it he said sharply i only know i took a liking to captain bennydeck he left mrs presty and sat down by his brother you know i feel for you he said taking linleys hand try to hope  the bitterness of the fathers despair broke out in his answer i can bear other troubles randal as well as most men this affliction revolts me theres something so horribly unnatural in the child being threatened by death while the parents who should die first are alive and well he checked himself i had better say no more i shall only shock you  the misery in his face wrung the faithful heart of his wife she forgot the conciliatory expressions which she had prepared herself to use hope my dear as randal tells you she said because there is hope  his face flushed his dim eyes brightened has the doctor said it he asked  yes  why havent i been told of it before  when i sent for you i heard that you had gone out  the explanation passed by him unnoticedperhaps even unheard tell me what the doctor said he insisted i want it exactly word for word  she obeyed him to the letter  the sinister change in his face as the narrative proceeded was observed by both the other persons present as well as by his wife she waited for a kind word of encouragement he only said coldly what have you done  speaking coldly on her side she answered i have sent the carriage to fetch miss westerfield  there was a pause mrs presty whispered to randal i knew she would come back again the evil genius of the familythats what i call miss westerfield the name exactly fits her  the idea in randals mind was that the name exactly fitted mrs presty he made no reply his eyes rested in sympathy on his sisterinlaw she saw and felt his kindness at a time when kindness was doubly precious her tones trembled a little as she spoke to her silent husband  dont you approve of what i have done herbert  his nerves were shattered by grief and suspense but he made an effort this time to speak gently how can i say that he replied if the poor childs life depends on miss westerfield i ask one favorgive me time to leave the house before she comes here  mrs linley looked at him in amazement  her mother touched her arm randal tried by a sign to warn her to be careful their calmer minds had seen what the wifes agitation had prevented her from discovering in linleys position the return of the governess was a trial to his selfcontrol which he had every reason to dread his look his voice his manner proclaimed it to persons capable of quietly observing him he had struggled against his guilty passionat what sacrifice of his own feelings no one knew but himselfand here was the temptation at the very time when he was honorably resisting it brought back to him by his wife her motive did unquestionably excuse perhaps even sanction what she had done but this was an estimate of her conduct which commended itself to others from his point of viewmotive or no motivehe saw the old struggle against himself in danger of being renewed he felt the ground that he had gained slipping from under him already  in spite of the wellmeant efforts made by her relatives to prevent it mrs linley committed the very error which it was the most important that she should avoid she justified herself instead of leaving it to events to justify her miss westerfield comes here she argued on an errand that is beyond reproachan errand of mercy why should you leave the house  in justice to you linley answered  mrs presty could restrain herself no longer drop it catherine she said in a whisper  catherine refused to drop it linleys short and sharp reply had irritated her after my experience she persisted have i no reason to trust you  it is part of your experience he reminded her that i promised not to see miss westerfield again  own it at once she broke out provoked beyond endurance though i may be willing to trust youyou are afraid to trust yourself  unlucky mrs presty interfered again dont listen to her herbert keep out of harms way and you keep right  she patted him on the shoulder as if she had been giving good advice to a boy he expressed his sense of his motherinlaws friendly offices in language which astonished her  hold your tongue  do you hear that mrs presty asked appealing indignantly to her daughter  linley took his hat at what time do you expect miss westerfield to arrive he said to his wife  she looked at the clock on the mantelpiece before the halfhour strikes dont be alarmed she added with an air of ironical sympathy you will have time to make your escape  he advanced to the door and looked at her  one thing i beg you will remember he said every halfhour while i am away i am going to the farm you are to send and let me know how kitty isand especially if miss westerfield justifies the experiment which the doctor has advised us to try  having given those instructions he went out  the sofa was near mrs linley she sank on it overpowered by the utter destruction of the hopes that she had founded on the separation of herbert and the governess sydney westerfield was still in possession of her husbands heart  her mother was surely the right person to say a word of comfort to her randal made the suggestionwith the worst possible result mrs presty had not forgotten that she had been toldat her age in her position as the widow of a cabinet ministerto hold her tongue your brother has insulted me she said to randal he was weak enough to attempt to make an explanation i was speaking of my brothers wife he said your brothers wife has allowed me to be insulted having received that reply randal could only wonder this woman went to church every sunday and kept a new testament bound in excellent taste on her toilettable the occasion suggested reflection on the system which produces average christians at the present time nothing more was said by mrs presty mrs linley remained absorbed in her own bitter thoughts in silence they waited for the return of the carriage and the appearance of the governess     chapter xviii the nursemaid   pale worn haggard with anxiety sydney westerfield entered the room and looked once more on the faces which she had resigned herself never to see again she appeared to be hardly conscious of the kind reception which did its best to set her at her ease  am i in time were the first words that escaped her on entering the room reassured by the answer she turned back to the door eager to hurry upstairs to kittys bedside  mrs linleys gentle hand detained her  the doctor had left certain instructions warning the mother to guard against any accident that might remind kitty of the day on which sydney had left her at the time of that bitter parting the child had seen her governess in the same walkingdress which she wore now mrs linley removed the hat and cloak and laid them on a chair  there is one other precaution which we must observe she said i must ask you to wait in my room until i find that you may show yourself safely now come with me  mrs presty followed them and begged earnestly for leave to wait the result of the momentous experiment at the door of kittys bedroom her selfasserting manner had vanished she was quiet she was even humble while the last chance for the childs life was fast becoming a matter of minutes only the grandmothers better nature showed itself on the surface randal opened the door for them as the three went out together he was in that state of maddening anxiety about his poor little niece in which men of his imaginative temperament become morbid and say strangely inappropriate things in the same breath with which he implored his sisterinlaw to let him hear what had happened without an instant of delay he startled mrs presty by one of his familiar remarks on the inconsistencies in her character you disagreeable old woman he whispered as she passed him you have got a heart after all  left alone he was never for one moment in repose while the slow minutes followed each other in the silent house  he walked about the room he listened at the door he arranged and disarranged the furniture when the nursemaid descended from the upper regions with her mistresss message for him he ran out to meet her saw the good news in her smiling face and for the first and last time in his life kissed one of his brothers female servants susana wellbred young person thoroughly capable in ordinary cases of saying for shame sir and looking as if she expected to feel an arm round her waist nexttrembled with terror under that astounding salute her masters brother a pattern of propriety up to that time a man declared by her to be incapable of kissing a woman unless she had a right to insist on it in the licensed character of his wife had evidently taken leave of his senses would he bite her next no he only looked confused and said how very extraordinary that he would never do it again susan gave her message gravely here was an unintelligible man she felt the necessity of being careful in her choice of words  miss kitty stared at miss westerfieldonly for a moment siras if she didnt quite understand and then knew her again directly the doctor had just called he drew up the blind to let the light in and he looked and he says only be careful tenderhearted susan broke down and began to cry i cant help it sir we are all so fond of miss kitty and we are so happy only be careful those were the exact words if you please and i answer for her lifeoh dear what have i said to make him run away from me  randal had left her abruptly and had shut himself into the drawingroom susans experience of men had not yet informed her that a true englishman is ashamed to be seen especially by his inferiors with the tears in his eyes  he had barely succeeded in composing himself when another servant appearedthis time a manwith something to say to him  i dont know whether i have done right sir malcolm began theres a stranger downstairs among the tourists who are looking at the rooms and the pictures he said he knew you and he asked if you were not related to the gentleman who allowed travelers to see his interesting old house  well  well sir i said yes and then he wanted to know if you happened to be here at the present time  randal cut the mans story short and you said yes again and he gave you his card let me look at it  malcolm produced the card and instantly received instructions to show the gentleman up the name recalled the dinner at the london clubcaptain bennydeck     chapter xix the captain   the fair complexion of the captains youthful days had been darkened by exposure to hard weather and extreme climates his smooth face of twenty years since was scored by the telltale marks of care his dark beard was beginning to present variety of color by means of streaks of gray and his hair was in course of undisguised retreat from his strong broad forehead not rising above the middle height the captains spare figure was well preserved it revealed power and activity severely tested perhaps at some former time but capable even yet of endurance under trial although he looked older than his age he was still personally speaking an attractive man in repose his eyes were by habit sad and a little weary in their expression they only caught a brighter light when he smiled at such times helped by this change and by his simple earnest manner they recommended him to his fellowcreatures before he opened his lips men and women taking shelter with him for instance from the rain found the temptation to talk with captain bennydeck irresistible and when the weather cleared they mostly carried away with them the same favorable impression one would like to meet with that gentleman again  randals first words of welcome relieved the captain of certain modest doubts of his reception which appeared to trouble him when he entered the room i am glad to find you remember me as kindly as i remember you those were his first words when he and randal shook hands  you might have felt sure of that randal said  the captains modesty still doubted  you see the circumstances were a little against me we met at a dull dinner among wearisome worldly men full of boastful talk about themselves it was all i did this and i said thatand the gentlemen who were present had always been right and the gentlemen who were absent had always been wrong and oh dear when they came to politics how they bragged about what they would have done if they had only been at the head of the government and how cruelly hard to please they were in the matter of wine do you remember recommending me to spend my next holiday in scotland  perfectly my advice was selfishit really meant that i wanted to see you again  and you have your wish at your brothers house the guide book did it first i saw your family name then i read on and discovered that there were pictures at mount morven and that strangers were allowed to see them i like pictures and here i am  this allusion to the house naturally reminded randal of the master i wish i could introduce you to my brother and his wife he said unhappily their only child is ill  captain bennydeck started to his feet i am ashamed of having intruded on you he began his new friend pressed him back into his chair without ceremony on the contrary you have arrived at the best of all possible timesthe time when our suspense is at an end the doctor has just told us that his poor little patient is out of danger you may imagine how happy we are  and how grateful to god the captain said those words in tones that trembledspeaking to himself  randal was conscious of feeling a momentary embarrassment the character of his visitor had presented itself in a new light captain bennydeck looked at himunderstood himand returned to the subject of his travels  do you remember your holidaytime when you were a boy and when you had to go back to school he asked with a smile my mind is in much the same state at leaving scotland and going back to my work in london i hardly know which i admire mostyour beautiful country or the people who inhabit it i have had some pleasant talk with your poorer neighbors the one improvement i could wish for among them is a keener sense of their religious duties  this was an objection new in randals experience of travelers in general  our highlanders have noble qualities he said if you knew them as well as i do you would find a true sense of religion among them not presenting itself however to strangers as stronglyi had almost said as aggressivelyas the devotional feeling of the lowland scotch different races different temperaments  and all the captain added gravely and gently with souls to be saved if i sent to these poor people some copies of the new testament translated into their own language would my gift be accepted  strongly interested by this time in studying captain bennydecks character on the side of it which was new to him randal owned that he observed with surprise the interest which his friend felt in perfect strangers the captain seemed to wonder why this impression should have been produced by what he had just said  i only try he answered to do what good i can wherever i go  your life must be a happy one randal said  captain bennydecks head drooped the shadows that attend on the gloom of melancholy remembrance showed their darkening presence on his face briefly almost sternly he set randal right  no sir  forgive me the younger man pleaded if i have spoken thoughtlessly  you have mistaken me the captain explained and it is my fault my life is an atonement for the sins of my youth i have reached my fortieth yearand that one purpose is before me for the rest of my days sufferings and dangers which but few men undergo awakened my conscience my last exercise of the duties of my profession associated me with an expedition to the polar seas our ship was crushed in the ice our march to the nearest regions inhabited by humanity was a hopeless struggle of starving men rotten with scurvy against the merciless forces of nature one by one my comrades dropped and died out of twenty men there were three left with a last flicker in them of the vital flame when the party of rescue found us one of the three died on the homeward journey one lived to reach his native place and to sink to rest with his wife and children round his bed the last man left out of that band of martyrs to a hopeless cause lives to be worthier of gods mercyand tries to make gods creatures better and happier in this world and worthier of the world that is to come  randals generous nature felt the appeal that had been made to it will you let me take your hand captain he said  they clasped hands in silence  captain bennydeck was the first to speak again that modest distrust of himself which a man essentially noble and brave is generally the readiest of men to feel seemed to be troubling him once morejust as it had troubled him when he first found himself in randals presence  i hope you wont think me vain he resumed i seldom say so much about myself as i have said to you  i only wish you would say more randal rejoined cant you put off your return to london for a day or two  the thing was not to be done duties which it was impossible to trifle with called the captain back its quite likely he said alluding pleasantly to the impression which he had produced in speaking of the highlanders that i shall find more strangers to interest me in the great city  are they always strangers randal asked have you never met by accident with persons whom you may once have known  neveryet but it may happen on my return  in what way  in this way i have been in search of a poor girl who has lost both her parents she has i fear been left helpless at the mercy of the world her father was an old friend of mineonce an officer in the navy like myself the agent whom i formerly employed without success to trace her writes me word that he has reason to believe she has obtained a situation as pupilteacher at a school in the suburbs of london and i am going back among other things to try if i can follow the clew myself goodby my friend i am heartily sorry to go  life is made up of partings randal answered  and of meetings the captain wisely reminded him when you are in london you will always hear of me at the club  heartily reciprocating his good wishes randal attended captain bennydeck to the door on the way back to the drawingroom he found his mind dwelling rather to his surprise on the captains contemplated search for the lost girl  was the good man likely to find her it seemed useless enough to inquireand yet randal asked himself the question her father had been described as an officer in the navy well and what did that matter inclined to laugh at his own idle curiosity he was suddenly struck by a new idea what had his brother told him of miss westerfield she was the daughter of an officer in the navy she had been pupilteacher at a school was it really possible that sydney westerfield could be the person whom captain bennydeck was attempting to trace randal threw up the window which overlooked the drive in front of the house too late the carriage which had brought the captain to mount morven was no longer in sight  the one other course that he could take was to mention captain bennydecks name to sydney and be guided by the result  as he approached the bell determining to send a message upstairs he heard the door opened behind him mrs presty had entered the drawingroom with a purpose as it seemed in which randal was concerned    chapter xx  the motherinlaw   strong as the impression was which captain bennydeck had produced on randal mrs prestys first words dismissed it from his mind she asked him if he had any message for his brother  randal instantly looked at the clock has catherine not sent to the farm yet he asked in astonishment  mrs prestys mind seemed to be absorbed in her daughter ah poor catherine worn out with anxiety and watching at kittys bedside night after night without any sleep night after night tortured by suspense as usual she can depend on her old mother for sympathy i have taken all her household duties on myself till she is in better health  randal tried again mrs presty am i to understand after the plain direction herbert gave that no messenger has been sent to the farm  mrs presty held her venerable head higher than ever when randal pronounced his brothers name i see no necessity for being in a hurry she answered stiffly after the brutal manner in which herbert has behaved to me put yourself in my placeand imagine what you would feel if you were told to hold your tongue  randal wasted no more time on ears that were deaf to remonstrance feeling the serious necessity of interfering to some good purpose he asked where he might find his sisterinlaw  i have taken catherine into the garden mrs presty announced the doctor himself suggestedno i may say ordered it he is afraid that she may fall ill next poor soul if she doesnt get air and exercise  in mrs linleys own interests randal resolved on advising her to write to her husband by the messenger explaining that she was not to blame for the inexcusable delay which had already taken place without a word more to mrs presty he hastened out of the room that inveterately distrustful woman called him back she desired to know where he was going and why he was in a hurry  i am going to the garden randal answered  to speak to catherine  yes  needless trouble my dear randal she will be back in a quarter of an hour and she will pass through this room on her way upstairs  another quarter of an hour was a matter of no importance to mrs presty randal took his own waythe way into the garden  his silence and his determination to join his sisterinlaw roused mrs prestys ready suspicions she concluded that he was bent on making mischief between her daughter and herself the one thing to do in this case was to follow him instantly the active old lady trotted out of the room strongly inclined to think that the evil genius of the family might be randal linley after all  they had both taken the shortest way to the garden that is to say the way through the library which communicated at its furthest end with the corridor and the vaulted flight of stairs leading directly out of the house of the two doors in the drawingroom one on the left led to the grand staircase and the hall the other on the right opened on the backstairs and on a side entrance to the house used by the family when they were pressed for time as well as by the servants  the drawingroom had not been empty more than a few minutes when the door on the right was suddenly opened herbert linley entered with hurried uncertain steps he took the chair that was nearest to him and dropped into it like a man overpowered by agitation or fatigue  he had ridden from the farm at headlong speed terrified by the unexplained delay in the arrival of the messenger from home unable any longer to suffer the torment of unrelieved suspense he had returned to make inquiry at the house as he interpreted the otherwise inexplicable neglect of his instructions the last chance of saving the childs life had failed and his wife had been afraid to tell him the dreadful truth  after an interval he rose and went into the library  it was empty like the drawingroom the bell was close by him he lifted his hand to ring itand drew back as brave a man as ever lived he knew what fear was now the fathers courage failed him before the prospect of summoning a servant and hearing for all he knew to the contrary that his child was dead  how long he stood there alone and irresolute he never remembered when he thought of it in afterdays all he knew was that there came a time when a sound in the drawingroom attracted his attention it was nothing more important than the opening of a door  the sound came from that side of the room which was nearest to the grand staircaseand therefore nearest also to the hall in one direction and to the bedchambers in the other  some person had entered the room whether it was one of the family or one of the servants he would hear in either case what had happened in his absence he parted the curtains over the library entrance and looked through  the person was a woman she stood with her back turned toward the library lifting a cloak off a chair as she shook the cloak out before putting it on she changed her position he saw the face never to be forgotten by him to the last day of his life he saw sydney westerfield     chapter xxi the governess   linley had one instant left in which he might have drawn back into the library in time to escape sydneys notice he was incapable of the effort of will grief and suspense had deprived him of that elastic readiness of mind which springs at once from thought to action for a moment he hesitated in that moment she looked up and saw him  with a faint cry of alarm she let the cloak drop from her hands as helpless as he was as silent as he was she stood rooted to the spot  he tried to control himself hardly knowing what he said he made commonplace excuses as if he had been a stranger i am sorry to have startled you i had no idea of finding you in this room  sydney pointed to her cloak on the floor and to her hat on a chair near it understanding the necessity which had brought her into the room he did his best to reconcile her to the meeting that had followed  its a relief to me to have seen you he said before you leave us  a relief to him to see her why how what did that strange word mean addressed to her she roused herself and put the question to him  its surely better for me he answered to hear the miserable news from you than from a servant  what miserable news she asked still as perplexed as ever  he could preserve his selfcontrol no longer the misery in him forced its way outward at last the convulsive struggles for breath which burst from a man in tears shook him from head to foot  my poor little darling he gasped my only child  all that was embarrassing in her position passed from sydneys mind in an instant she stepped close up to him she laid her hand gently and fearlessly on his arm oh mr linley what dreadful mistake is this  his dim eyes rested on her with a piteous expression of doubt he heard herand he was afraid to believe her she was too deeply distressed too full of the truest pity for him to wait and think before she spoke yes yes she cried under the impulse of the moment the dear child knew me again the moment i spoke to her kittys recovery is only a matter of time  he staggered backwith a livid change in his face startling to see the mischief done by mrs prestys sense of injury had led already to serious results if the thought in linley at that moment had shaped itself into words he would have said and catherine never told me of it how bitterly he thought of the woman who had left him in suspensehow gratefully he felt toward the woman who had lightened his heart of the heaviest burden ever laid on it  innocent of all suspicion of the feeling that she had aroused sydney blamed her own want of discretion as the one cause of the change that she perceived in him how thoughtless how cruel of me she said not to have been more careful in telling you the good news pray forgive me  you thoughtless you cruel at the bare idea of her speaking in that way of herself his sense of what he owed to her defied all restraint he seized her hands and covered them with grateful kisses dear sydney dear good sydney  she drew back from him not abruptly not as if she felt offended her fine perception penetrated the meaning of those harmless kissesthe uncontrollable outburst of a sense of relief beyond the reach of expression in words but she changed the subject mrs linley she told him had kindly ordered fresh horses to be put to the carriage so that she might go back to her duties if the doctor sanctioned it  she turned away to take up her cloak linley stopped her you cant leave kitty he said positively  a faint smile brightened her face for a moment kitty has fallen asleepsuch a sweet peaceful sleep i dont think i should have left her but for that the maid is watching at the bedside and mrs linley is only away for a little while  wait a few minutes he pleaded its so long since we have seen each other  the tone in which he spoke warned her to persist in leaving him while her resolution remained firm i had arranged with mrs macedwin she began if all went well  speak of yourself he interposed tell me if you are happy  she let this pass without a reply the doctor sees no harm she went on in my being away for a few hours mrs macedwin has offered to send me here in the evening so that i can sleep in kittys room  you dont look well sydney you are pale and wornyou are not happy  she began to tremble for the second time she turned away to take up her cloak for the second time he stopped her  not just yet he said you dont know how it distresses me to see you so sadly changed i remember the time when you were the happiest creature living do you remember it too  dont ask me was all she could say  he sighed as he looked at her its dreadful to think of your young life that ought to be so bright wasting and withering among strangers he said those words with increasing agitation his eyes rested on her eagerly with a wild look in them she made a resolute effort to speak to him coldlyshe called him mr linleyshe bade him goodby  it was useless he stood between her and the door he disregarded what she had said as if he had not heard it hardly a day passes he owned to her that i dont think of you  you shouldnt tell me that  how can i see you againand not tell you  she burst out with a last entreaty for gods sake let us say goodby  his manner became undisguisedly tender his language changed in the one way of all others that was most perilous to herhe appealed to her pity oh sydney its so hard to part with you  spare me she cried passionately you dont know how i suffer  my sweet angel i do know itby what i suffer myself do you ever feel for me as i feel for you  oh herbert herbert  have you ever thought of me since we parted  she had striven against herself and against him till her last effort at resistance was exhausted in reckless despair she let the truth escape her at last  when do i ever think of anything else i am a wretch unworthy of all the kindness that has been shown to me i dont deserve your interest i dont even deserve your pity send me awaybe hard on mebe brutal to me have some mercy on a miserable creature whose life is one long hopeless effort to forget you her voice her look maddened him he drew her to his bosom he held her in his arms she struggled vainly to get away from him oh she murmured how cruel you are remember my dear one remember how young i am how weak i am oh herbert im dyingdyingdying her voice grew fainter and fainter her head sank on his breast he lifted her face to him with whispered words of love he kissed her again and again   the curtains over the library entrance moved noiselessly when they were parted the footsteps of catherine linley were inaudible as she passed through and entered the room  she stood still for a moment in silent horror  not a sound warned them when she advanced after hesitating for a moment she raised her hand toward her husband as if to tell him of her presence by a touch drew it back suddenly recoiling from her own first intention and touched sydney instead  then and then only they knew what had happened  face to face those three personswith every tie that had once united them snapped asunder in an instantlooked at each other the man owed a duty to the lost creature whose weakness had appealed to his mercy in vain the man broke the silence  catherine  with immeasurable contempt looking brightly out of her steady eyes his wife stopped him  not a word  he refused to be silent it is i he said i only who am to blame  spare yourself the trouble of making excuses she answered they are needless herbert linley the woman who was once your wife despises you  her eyes turned from him and rested on sydney westerfield  i have a last word to say to you look at me if you can  sydney lifted her head she looked vacantly at the outraged woman before her as if she saw a woman in a dream  with the same terrible selfpossession which she had preserved from the firststanding between her husband and her governessmrs linley spoke  miss westerfield you have saved my childs life she pausedher eyes still resting on the girls face deadly pale she pointed to her husband and said to sydney take him  she passed out of the roomand left them together     third book    chapter xxii retrospect   the autumn holidaytime had come to an end and the tourists had left scotland to the scots  in the dull season a solitary traveler from the north arrived at the nearest posttown to mount morven a sketchbook and a colorbox formed part of his luggage and declared him to be an artist falling into talk over his dinner with the waiter at the hotel he made inquiries about a picturesque house in the neighborhood which showed that mount morven was well known to him by reputation when he proposed paying a visit to the old border fortress the next day the waiter said you cant see the house when the traveler asked why this man of few words merely added shut up  the landlord made his appearance with a bottle of wine and proved to be a more communicative person in his relations with strangers presented in an abridged form and in the english language these as he related them were the circumstances under which mount morven had been closed to the public  a complete dispersion of the family had taken place not long since for miles round everybody was sorry for it rich and poor alike felt the same sympathy with the good lady of the house she had been most shamefully treated by her husband and by a goodfornothing girl employed as governess to put it plainly the two had run away together one report said they had gone abroad and another declared that they were living in london mr linleys conduct was perfectly incomprehensible he had always borne the highest charactera good landlord a kind father a devoted husband and yet after more than eight years of exemplary married life he had disgraced himself the minister of the parish preaching on the subject had attributed this extraordinary outbreak of vice on the part of an otherwise virtuous man to a possession of the devil assuming the devil in this case to be only a discreet and clerical way of alluding from the pulpit to a woman the landlord was inclined to agree with the minister after what had happened it was of course impossible that mrs linley could remain in her husbands house she and her little girl and her mother were supposed to be living in retirement they kept the place of their retreat a secret from everybody but mrs linleys legal adviser who was instructed to forward letters but one other member of the family remained to be accounted for this was mr linleys younger brother known at present to be traveling on the continent two trustworthy old servants had been left in charge at mount morvenand there was the whole story and that was why the house was shut up    chapter xxiii separation   in a cottage on the banks of one of the cumberland lakes two ladies were seated at the breakfasttable the windows of the room opened on a garden which extended to the waters edge and on a boathouse and wooden pier beyond on the pier a little girl was fishing under the care of her maid after a prevalence of rainy weather the sun was warm this morning for the time of year and the broad sheet of water alternately darkened and brightened as the moving masses of cloud now gathered and now parted over the blue beauty of the sky  the ladies had finished their breakfast the elder of the twothat is to say mrs prestytook up her knitting and eyed her silent daughter with an expression of impatient surprise  another bad night catherine  the personal attractions that distinguished mrs linley were not derived from the shortlived beauty which depends on youth and health pale as she was her face preserved its fine outline her features had not lost their grace and symmetry of form presenting the appearance of a woman who had suffered acutely she would have been more than ever in the eyes of some men a woman to be admired and loved  i seldom sleep well now she answered patiently  you dont give yourself a chance mrs presty remonstrated heres a fine morningcome out for a sail on the lake tomorrow theres a concert in the townlets take tickets theres a want of what i call elastic power in your mind catherinethe very quality for which your father was so remarkable the very quality which mr presty used to say made him envy mr norman look at your dress wheres the commonsense at your age of wearing nothing but black nobodys dead who belongs to us and yet you do your best to look as if you were in mourning  i have no heart mamma to wear colors  mrs presty considered this reply to be unworthy of notice she went on with her knitting and only laid it down when the servant brought in the letters which had arrived by the mornings post they were but two in numberand both were for mrs linley in the absence of any correspondence of her own mrs presty took possession of her daughters letters  one addressed in the lawyers handwriting she announced and one from randal which shall i open for you first  randals letter if you please  mrs presty handed it across the table any news is a relief from the dullness of this place she said if there are no secrets catherine read it out  there were no secrets on the first page  randal announced his arrival in london from the continent and his intention of staying there for a while he had met with a friend formerly an officer holding high rank in the navy whom he was glad to see againa rich man who used his wealth admirably in the interest of his poor and helpless fellowcreatures a home established on a new plan was just now engaging all his attention he was devoting himself so unremittingly to the founding of this institution that his doctor predicted injury to his health at no distant date if it was possible to persuade him to take a holiday randal might return to the continent as the travelingcompanion of his friend  this must be the man whom he first met at the club mrs presty remarked well catherine i suppose there is some more of it whats the matter bad news  something that i wish randal had not written read it yourselfand dont talk of it afterward  mrs presty read  i know nothing whatever of my unfortunate brother if you think this is a tooindulgent way of alluding to a man who has so shamefully wronged you let my conviction that he is already beginning to suffer the penalty of his crime plead my excuse herberts nature is in some respects better known to me than it is to you i am persuaded that your hold on his respect and his devotion is shakennot lost he has been misled by one of those passing fancies disastrous and even criminal in their results to which men are liable when they are led by no better influence than the influence of their senses it is not and never will be in the nature of women to understand this i fear i may offend you in what i am now writing but i must speak what i believe to be the truth at any sacrifice bitter repentance if he is not already feeling it is in store for herbert when he finds himself tied to a person who cannot bear comparison with you i say this pitying the poor girl most sincerely when i think of her youth and her wretched past life how it will end i cannot presume to say i can only acknowledge that i do not look to the future with the absolute despair which you naturally felt when i last saw you  mrs presty laid the letter down privately resolving to write to randal and tell him to keep his convictions for the future to himself a glance at her daughters face warned her if she said anything to choose a new subject  the second letter still remained unnoticed shall we see what the lawyer says she suggestedand opened the envelope the lawyer had nothing to say he simply inclosed a letter received at his office  mrs presty had long passed the age at which emotion expresses itself outwardly by a change of color she turned pale nevertheless when she looked at the second letter  the address was in herbert linleys handwriting    chapter xxiv hostility   when she was not eating her meals or asleep in her bed absolute silence on mrs prestys part was a circumstance without precedent in the experience of her daughter mrs presty was absolutely silent now mrs linley looked up  she at once perceived the change in her mothers face and asked what it meant mamma you look as if something had frightened you is it anything in that letter she bent over the table and looked a little closer at the letter mrs presty had turned it so that the address was underneath and the closed envelope was visible still intact why dont you open it mrs linley asked  mrs presty made a strange reply i am thinking of throwing it into the fire  my letter  yes your letter  let me look at it first  you had better not look at it catherine  naturally enough mrs linley remonstrated surely i ought to read a letter forwarded by my lawyer why are you hiding the address from me is it from some person whose handwriting we both know she looked again at her silent motherreflectedand guessed the truth give it to me directly she said my husband has written to me  mrs prestys heavy eyebrows gathered into a frown is it possible she asked sternly that you are still fond enough of that man to care about what he writes to you mrs linley held out her hand for the letter her wise mother found it desirable to try persuasion next if you really wont give way my dear humor me for once will you let me read it to you  yesif you promise to read every word of it  mrs presty promised with a mental reservation and opened the letter  at the two first words she stopped and began to clean her spectacles had her own eyes deceived her or had herbert linley actually addressed her daughterafter having been guilty of the cruelest wrong that a husband can inflict on a wifeas dear catherine yes there were the words when she put her spectacles on again was he in his right senses or had he written in a state of intoxication  mrs linley waited with a preoccupied mind she showed no signs of impatience or surprise as it presently appeared she was not thinking of the letter addressed to her by herbert but of the letter written by randal i want to look at it again with that brief explanation she turned at once to the closing lines which had offended her when she first read them  mrs presty hazarded a guess at what was going on in her daughters mind now your husband has written to you she said are you beginning to think randals opinion may be worth considering again with her eyes still on randals letter mrs linley merely answered why dont you begin mrs presty began as follows leaving out the familiarity of her soninlaws address to his wife  i hope and trust you will forgive me for venturing to write to you in consideration of the subject of my letter i have something to say concerning our child although i have deserved the worst you can think of me i believe you will not deny that even your love for our little kitty while we were living together was not a truer love than mine bad as i am my heart has that tender place left in it still i cannot endure separation from my child  mrs linley rose to her feet the first vague anticipations of future atonement and reconciliation suggested by her brotherinlaw no longer existed in her mind she foresaw but too plainly what was to come read faster she said or let me read it for myself  mrs presty went on there is no wish on my part to pain you by any needless allusion to my claims as a father my one desire is to enter into an arrangement which shall be as just toward you as it is toward me i propose that kitty shall live with her father one half of the year and shall return to her mothers care for the other half if there is any valid objection to this i confess i fail to see it  mrs linley could remain silent no longer  does he see no difference she broke out between his position and mine what consolationin gods name what consolation is left to me for the rest of my life but my child and he threatens to separate us for six months in every year and he takes credit to himself for an act of exalted justice on his part is there no such thing as shame in the hearts of men  under ordinary circumstances her mother would have tried to calm her but mrs presty had turned to the next page of the letter at the moment when her daughter spoke  what she found written on that other side produced a startling effect on her she crumpled the letter up in her hand and threw it into the fireplace it fell under the grate instead of into the grate with amazing activity for a woman of her age she ran across the room to burn it younger and quicker mrs linley got to the fireplace first and seized the letter there is something more she exclaimed and you are afraid of my knowing what it is  dont read it mrs presty called out  there was but one sentence left to read if your maternal anxiety suggests any misgiving let me add that a womans loving care will watch over our little girl while she is under my roof you will remember how fond miss westerfield was of kitty and you will believe me when i tell you that she is as truly devoted to the child as ever  i tried to prevent you from reading it said mrs presty  mrs linley looked at her mother with a strange unnatural smile  i wouldnt have missed this for anything she said the cruelest of all separations is proposed to meand i am expected to submit to it because my husbands mistress is fond of my child she threw the letter from her with a frantic gesture of contempt and burst into a fit of hysterical laughter  the old mothers instinctnot the old mothers reasontold her what to do she drew her daughter to the open window and called to kitty to come in the child still amusing herself by fishing in the lake laid down her rod mrs linley saw her running lightly along the little pier on her way to the house that influence effected what no other influence could have achieved the outraged wife controlled herself for the sake of her child mrs presty led her out to meet kitty in the garden waited until she saw them together and returned to the breakfastroom  herbert linleys letter lay on the floor his discreet motherinlaw picked it up it could do no more harm now and there might be reasons for keeping the husbands proposal unless i am very much mistaken mrs presty concluded we shall hear more from the lawyer before long she locked up the letter and wondered what her daughter would do next  in half an hour mrs linley returnedpale silent selfcontained  she seated herself at her desk wrote literally one line signed it without an instants hesitation and folded the paper before it was secured in the envelope mrs presty interfered with a characteristic request you are writing to mr linley of course she said may i see it  mrs linley handed the letter to her the one line of writing contained these words i refuse positively to part with my childcatherine linley  have you considered what is likely to happen when he gets this mrs presty inquired  no mamma  will you consult randal  i would rather not consult him  will you let me consult him for you  thank youno  why not  after what randal has written to me i dont attach any value to his opinion with that reply she sent her letter to the post and went back again to kitty  after this mrs presty resolved to wait the arrival of herbert linleys answer and to let events take their course the view from the window as she passed it walking up and down the room offered her little help in forecasting the future kitty had returned to her fishing and kittys mother was walking slowly up and down the pier deep in thought was she thinking of what might happen and summoning the resolution which so seldom showed itself on ordinary occasions    chapter xxv consultation   no second letter arrived but a telegram was received from the lawyer toward the end of the week  expect me tomorrow on business which requires personal consultation  that was the message in taking the long journey to cumberland mrs linleys legal adviser sacrificed two days of his precious time in london something serious must assuredly have happened  in the meantime who was the lawyer  he was mr sarrazin of lincolns inn fields  was he an englishman or a frenchman  he was a curious mixture of both his ancestors had been among the persecuted french people who found a refuge in england when the priestridden tyrant louis the fourteenth revoked the edict of nantes a british subject by birth and a thoroughly competent and trustworthy man mr sarrazin labored under one inveterate delusion he firmly believed that his original french nature had been completely eradicated under the influence of our insular climate and our insular customs no matter how often the strain of the lively french blood might assert itself at inconvenient times and under regrettable circumstances he never recognized this foreign side of his character his excellent spirits his quick sympathies his bright mutability of mindall those qualities in short which were most mischievously ready to raise distrust in the mind of english clients before their sentiment changed for the better under the light of later experiencewere attributed by mr sarrazin to the exhilarating influence of his happy domestic circumstances and his successful professional career his essentially english wife his essentially english children his whiskers his politics his umbrella his pew at church his plum pudding his times newspaper all answered for him he was accustomed to say as an inbred member of the glorious nation that rejoices in hunting the fox and believes in innumerable pills  this excellent man arrived at the cottage desperately fatigued after his long journey but in perfect possession of his incomparable temper nevertheless  he afforded a proof of this happy state of mind on sitting down to his supper an epicure if ever there was one yet he found the solid part of the refreshments offered to him to consist of a chop the old french blood curdled at the sight of itbut the trueborn englishman heroically devoted himself to the national meal at the same time the french vivacity discovered a kindred soul in kitty mr sarrazin became her intimate friend in five minutes he listened to her and talked to her as if the child had been his client and fishing from the pier the business which had brought him from london to mrs prestys disgust he turned up a corner of the tablecloth when he had finished his chop and began to conjure so deftly with the spoons and forks that poor little kitty often dull now under the changed domestic circumstances of her life clapped her hands with pleasure and became the joyous child of the happy old times once more mrs linley flattered in her maternal love and her maternal pride never thought of recalling this extraordinary lawyer to the business that was waiting to be discussed but mrs presty looked at the clock and discovered that her grandchild ought to have been in bed halfanhour ago  time to say goodnight the grandmother suggested  the grandchild failed to see the subject of bed in the same light oh not yet she pleaded i want to speak to mr having only heard the visitors name once and not finding her memory in good working order after the conjuring kitty hesitated isnt your name something like saracen she asked  very like cried the genial lawyer try my other name my dear im samuel as well as sarrazin  ah thatll do said kitty grandmamma before i go to bed ive something to ask samuel  grandmamma persisted in deferring the question until the next morning samuel administered consolation before he said goodnight ill get up early he whispered and well go on the pier before breakfast and fish  kitty expressed her gratitude in her own outspoken way oh dear how nice it would be samuel if you lived with us mrs linley laughed for the first time poor soul since the catastrophe which had broken up her home mrs presty set a proper example she moved her chair so that she faced the lawyer and said now mr sarrazin  he acknowledged that he understood what this meant by a very unprofessional choice of words we are in a mess he began and the sooner we are out of it the better  only let me keep kitty mrs linley declared and ill do whatever you think right  stick to that dear madam when you have heard what i have to tell youand i shall not have taken my journey in vain in the first place may i look at the letter which i had the honor of forwarding some days since  mrs presty gave him herbert linleys letter he read it with the closest attention and tapped the breastpocket of his coat when he had done  if i didnt know what i have got here he remarked i should have said another person dictated this letter and the name of the person is miss westerfield  just my idea mrs presty exclaimed there cant be a doubt of it  oh but there is a very great doubt of it maam and you will say so too when you know what your severe soninlaw threatens to do he turned to mrs linley after having seen that pretty little friend of mine who has just gone to bed how much nicer it would be for all of us if we could go to bed too i think i know how you answered your husbands letter but i ought perhaps to see how you have expressed yourself have you got a copy  it was too short mr sarrazin to make a copy necessary  do you mean you can remember it  i can repeat it word for word this was my reply i refuse positively to part with my child  no more like that  no more  mr sarrazin looked at his client with undisguised admiration the only time in all my long experience he said in which i have found a ladys letter capable of expressing itself strongly in a few words what a lawyer you will make mrs linley when the rights of women invade my profession  he put his hand into his pocket and produced a letter addressed to himself  watching him anxiously the ladies saw his bright face become overclouded with anxiety i am the wretched bearer of bad news he resumed and if i fidget in my chair that is the reason for it let us get to the pointand let us get off it again as soon as possible here is a letter written to me by mr linleys lawyer if you will take my advice you will let me say what the substance of it is and then put it back in my pocket i doubt if a woman has influenced these cruel instructions mrs presty and therefore i doubt if a woman influenced the letter which led the way to them did i not say just now that i was coming to the point and here i am wandering further and further away from it a lawyer is human there is the only excuse now mrs linley in two words your husband is determined to have little miss kitty and the law when he applies to it is his obedient humble servant  do you mean that the law takes my child away from me  i am ashamed madam to think that i live by the law but that i must own is exactly what it is capable of doing in the present case compose yourself i beg and pray a time will come when women will remind men that the mother bears the child and feeds the child and will insist that the mothers right is the best right of the two in the meanwhile  in the meanwhile mr sarrazin i wont submit to the law  quite right catherine cried mrs presty exactly what i should do in your place  mr sarrazin listened patiently i am all attention good ladies he said with the gentlest resignation let me hear how you mean to do it  the good ladies looked at each other they discovered that it is one thing to set an abuse at defiance in words and another thing to apply the remedy in deeds the kindhearted lawyer helped them with a suggestion perhaps you think of making your escape with the child and taking refuge abroad  mrs linley eagerly accepted the hint the first train tomorrow morning starts at halfpast seven she said we might catch some foreign steamer that sails from the east coast of scotland  mrs presty keeping a wary eye on mr sarrazin was not quite so ready as her daughter in rushing at conclusions i am afraid she acknowledged our worthy friend sees some objection what is it  i dont presume to offer a positive opinion maam but i think mr linley and his lawyer have their suspicions plainly speaking i am afraid spies are set to watch us already  impossible  you shall hear i travel secondclass one saves money and one finds people to talk toand at what sacrifice only a hard cushion to sit on in the same carriage with me there was a very conversable persona smart young man with flaming red hair when we took the omnibus at your station here all the passengers got out in the town except two i was one exception and the smart young man was the other when i stopped at your gate the omnibus went on a few yards and set down my fellowtraveler at the village inn my profession makes me sly i waited a little before i rang your bell and when i could do it without being seen i crossed the road and had a look at the inn there is a moon tonight i was very careful the young man didnt see me but i saw a head of flaming hair and a pair of amiable blue eyes over the blind of a window and it happened to be the one window of the inn which commands a full view of your gate mere suspicion you will say i cant deny it and yet i have my reasons for suspecting before i left london one of my clerks followed me in a great hurry to the terminus and caught me as i was opening the carriage door we have just made a discovery he said you and mrs linley are to be reckoned up reckoned up is if you please detective english for being watched my clerk might have repeated a false report of course and my fellowtraveler might have come all the way from london to look out of the window of an inn in a cumberland village what do you think yourselves  it seemed to be easier to dispute the law than to dispute mr sarrazins conclusions  suppose i choose to travel abroad and to take my child with me mrs linley persisted who has any right to prevent me  mr sarrazin reluctantly reminded her that the father had a right no personnot even the mothercan take the child out of the fathers custody he said except with the fathers consent his authority is the supreme authorityunless it happens that the law has deprived him of his privilege and has expressly confided the child to the mothers care ha cried mr sarrazin twisting round in his chair and fixing his keen eyes on mrs presty look at your good mother she sees what i am coming to  i see something more than you think mrs presty answered if i know anything of my daughters nature you will find yourself before long on delicate ground  what do you mean mamma  mrs presty had lived in the past age when persons occasionally used metaphor as an aid to the expression of their ideas being called upon to explain herself she did it in metaphor to her own entire satisfaction  our learned friend here reminds me my dear catherine of a traveler exploring a strange town he takes a turning in the confident expectation that it will reward him by leading him to some satisfactory resultand he finds himself in a blind alley or as the french put it i speak french fluently in a cool de sack do i make my meaning clear mr sarrazin  not the least in the world maam  how very extraordinary perhaps i have been misled by my own vivid imagination let me endeavor to express myself plainlylet me say that my fancy looks prophetically at what you are going to do and sincerely wishes you well out of it pray go on  and pray speak more plainly than my mother has spoken mrs linley added as i understood what you said just now there is a law after all that will protect me in the possession of my little girl i dont care what it costs i want that law  may i ask first mr sarrazin stipulated whether you are positively resolved not to give way to your husband in this matter of kitty  positively  one more question if you please on a matter of fact i have heard that you were married in scotland is that true  quite true  mr sarrazin exhibited himself once more in a highly unprofessional aspect he clapped his hands and cried bravo as if he had been in a theater  mrs linley caught the infection of the lawyers excitement how dull i am she exclaimed there is a thing they call incompatibility of temperand married people sign a paper at the lawyers and promise never to trouble each other again as long as they both live and theyre readier to do it in scotland than they are in england thats what you meanisnt it  mr sarrazin found it necessary to reassume his professional character  no indeed madam he said i should be unworthy of your confidence if i proposed nothing better than that you can only secure the sole possession of little kitty by getting the help of a judge  get it at once mrs linley interposed  and you can only prevail on the judge to listen to you mr sarrazin proceeded in one way summon your courage madam apply for a divorce  there was a sudden silence mrs linley rose trembling as if she sawnot good mr sarrazinbut the devil himself tempting her do you hear that she said to her mother  mrs presty only bowed  think of the dreadful exposure  mrs presty bowed again  the lawyer had his opportunity now  well mrs linley he asked what do you say  nonever she made that positive reply and disposed beforehand of everything that might have been urged in the way of remonstrance and persuasion by leaving the room the two persons who remained sitting opposite to each other took opposite views  mr sarrazin she wont do it  mrs presty she will     chapter xxvi decision   punctual to his fishing appointment with kitty mr sarrazin was out in the early morning waiting on the pier  not a breath of wind was stirring the lazy mist lay asleep on the further shore of the lake here and there only the dim tops of the hills rose like shadows cast by the earth on the faint gray of the sky nearer at hand the waters of the lake showed a gloomy surface no birds flew over the colorless calm no passing insects tempted the fish to rise from time to time a lastleft leaf on the wooded shore dropped noiselessly and died no vehicles passed as yet on the lonely road no voices were audible from the village slow and straight wreaths of smoke stole their way out of the chimneys and lost their vapor in the misty sky the one sound that disturbed the sullen repose of the morning was the tramp of the lawyers footsteps as he paced up and down the pier he thought of london and its ceaseless traffic its roaring high tide of life in actionand he said to himself with the strong conviction of a townbred man how miserable this is  a voice from the garden cheered him just as he reached the end of the pier for the fiftieth time and looked with fiftyfold intensity of dislike at the dreary lake  there stood kitty behind the gardengate with a fishingrod in each hand a tin box was strapped on one side of her little body and a basket on the other burdened with these impediments she required assistance susan had let her out of the house and samuel must now open the gate for her she was pleased to observe that the raw morning had reddened her friends nose and she presented her own nose to notice as exhibiting perfect sympathy in this respect feeling a misplaced confidence in mr sarrazins knowledge and experience as an angler she handed the fishingrods to him my fingers are cold she said you bait the hooks he looked at his young friend in silent perplexity she pointed to the tin box plenty of bait there samuel we find maggots do best mr sarrazin eyed the box with undisguised disgust and kitty made an unexpected discovery you seem to know nothing about it she said and samuel answered cordially nothing in five minutes more he found himself by the side of his young friendwith his hook baited his line in the water and strict injunctions to keep an eye on the float  they began to fish  kitty looked at her companion and looked away again in silence by way of encouraging her to talk the goodnatured lawyer alluded to what she had said when they parted overnight you wanted to ask me something he reminded her what is it  without one preliminary word of warning to prepare him for the shock kitty answered i want you to tell me what has become of papa and why syd has gone away and left me you know who syd is dont you  the only alternative left to mr sarrazin was to plead ignorance while kitty was instructing him on the subject of her governess he had time to consider what he should say to her next the result added one more to the lost opportunities of mr sarrazins life  you see the child gravely continued you are a clever man and you have come here to help mamma i have got that much out of grandmamma if i have got nothing else dont look at me look at your float my papa has gone away and syd has left me without even saying goodby and we have given up our nice old house in scotland and come to live here i tell you i dont understand it if you see your float begin to tremble and then give a little dip down as if it was going to sink pull your line out of the water you will most likely find a fish at the end of it when i ask mamma what all this means she says there is a reason and i am not old enough to understand it and she looks unhappy and she gives me a kiss and it ends in that way youve got a bite no you havent its only a nibble fish are so sly and grandmamma is worse still sometimes she tells me im a spoiled child and sometimes she says wellbehaved little girls dont ask questions thats nonsenseand i think its hard on me you look uncomfortable is it my fault i dont want to bother you i only want to know why syd has gone away when i was younger i might have thought the fairies had taken her oh no that wont do any longer im too old now tell me  mr sarrazin weakly attempted to gain time he looked at his watch kitty looked over his shoulder oh we neednt be in a hurry breakfast wont be ready for half an hour yet plenty of time to talk of syd go on  most unwisely seeing that he had to deal with a clever child and that child a girl mr sarrazin tried flat denial as a way out of the difficulty he said i dont know why she has gone away the next question followed instantly well then what do you think about it in sheer despair the persecuted friend said the first thing that came into his head  i think she has gone to be married  kitty was indignant  gone to be married and not tell me she exclaimed what do you mean by that  mr sarrazins professional experience of women and marriages failed to supply him with an answer in this difficulty he exerted his imagination and invented something that no woman ever did yet shes waiting he said to see how her marriage succeeds before she tells anybody about it  this sounded probable to the mind of a child  i hope she hasnt married a beast kitty said with a serious face and an ominous shake of the head when shall i hear from syd  mr sarrazin tried another prevaricationwith better results this time you will be the first person she writes to of course as that excusable lie passed his lips his float began to tremble here was a chance of changing the subjective got a fish he cried  kitty was immediately interested she threw down her own rod and assisted her ignorant companion a wretched little fish appeared in the air wriggling its a roach kitty pronounced its in pain the merciful lawyer added give it to me kitty took it off the hook and obeyed mr sarrazin with humane gentleness of handling put it back into the water go and god bless you said this excellent man as the roach disappeared joyously with a flick of its tail kitty was scandalized thats not sport she said oh yes it is he answeredsport to the fish  they went on with their angling what embarrassing question would kitty ask next would she want to be told why her father had left her no the last image in the childs mind had been the image of sydney westerfield she was still thinking of it when she spoke again  i wonder whether youre right about syd she began you might be mistaken mightnt you i sometimes fancy mamma and sydney may have had a quarrel would you mind asking mamma if thats true the affectionate little creature said anxiously you see i cant help talking of syd im so fond of her and i do miss her so dreadfully every now and then and im afraidoh dear dear im afraid i shall never see her again she let her rod drop on the pier and put her little hands over her face and burst out crying  shocked and distressed good mr sarrazin kissed her and consoled her and told another excusable lie  try to be comforted kitty im sure you will see her again  his conscience reproached him as he held out that false hope it could never be the one unpardonable sin in the judgment of fallible human creatures like herself was the sin that sydney westerfield had committed is there something wrong in human nature or something wrong in human laws all that is best and noblest in us feels the influence of loveand the rules of society declare that an accident of position shall decide whether love is a virtue or a crime  these thoughts were in the lawyers mind they troubled him and disheartened him it was a relief rather than an interruption when he felt kittys hand on his arm she had dried her tears with a childs happy facility in passing from one emotion to another and was now astonished and interested by a marked change in the weather  look for the lake she cried you cant see it  a dense white fog was closing round them its stealthy advance over the water had already begun to hide the boathouse at the end of the pier from view the raw cold of the atmosphere made the child shiver as mr sarrazin took her hand to lead her indoors he turned and looked back at the faint outline of the boathouse disappearing in the fog kitty wondered do you see anything she asked  he answered that there was nothing to see in the absent tone of a man busy with his own thoughts they took the garden path which led to the cottage as they reached the door he roused himself and looked round again in the direction of the invisible lake  was the boathouse of any use now he inquiredwas there a boat in it for instance there was a capital boat fit to go anywhere and a man to manage it to be sure the gardener was the man he had been a sailor once and he knew the lake as well as kitty stopped at a loss for a comparison as well as you know your multiplication table said mr sarrazin dropping his serious questions on a sudden kitty shook her head much better she honestly acknowledged  opening the breakfastroom door they saw mrs presty making coffee kitty at once retired when she had been fishing her grandmamma inculcated habits of order by directing her to take the rods to pieces and to put them away in their cases in the lumberroom while she was absent mr sarrazin profited by the opportunity and asked if mrs linley had thought it over in the night and had decided on applying for a divorce  i know nothing about my daughter mrs presty answered except that she had a bad night thinking no doubt over your advice the old lady added with a mischievous smile  will you kindly inquire if mrs linley has made up her mind yet the lawyer ventured to say  isnt that your business mrs presty asked slyly suppose you write a little note and i will send it up to her room the worldlywisdom which prompted this suggestion contemplated a possible necessity for calling a domestic council assembled to consider the course of action which mrs linley would do well to adopt if the influence of her mother was among the forms of persuasion which might be tried that wary relative maneuvered to make the lawyer speak first and so to reserve to herself the advantage of having the last word  patient mr sarrazin wrote the note  he modestly asked for instructions and he was content to receive them in one wordyes or no in the event of the answer being yes he would ask for a few minutes conversation with mrs linley at her earliest convenience that was all  the reply was returned in a form which left yes to be inferred i will receive you as soon as you have finished your breakfast    chapter xxvii resolution   having read mrs linleys answer mr sarrazin looked out of the breakfastroom window and saw that the fog had reached the cottage before mrs presty could make any remark on the change in the weather he surprised her by an extraordinary question  is there an upper room here maam which has a view of the road before your front gate  certainly  and can i go into it without disturbing anybody  mrs presty said of course with an uplifting of her eye brows which expressed astonishment not unmixed with suspicion do you want to go up now she added or will you wait till you have had your breakfast  i want to go up if you please before the fog thickens oh mrs presty i am ashamed to trouble you let the servant show me the room  no for the first time in her life mrs presty insisted on doing servants duty if she had been crippled in both legs her curiosity would have helped her to get up the stairs on her hands there she said opening the door of the upper room and placing herself exactly in the middle of it so that she could see all round her will that do for you  mr sarrazin went to the window hid himself behind the curtain and cautiously peeped out in half a minute he turned his back on the misty view of the road and said to himself just what i expected  other women might have asked what this mysterious proceeding meant mrs prestys sense of her own dignity adopted a system of independent discovery to mr sarrazins amusement she imitated him to his face advancing to the window she too hid herself behind the curtain and she too peeped out still following her model she next turned her back on the viewand then she became herself again now we have both looked out of window she said to the lawyer in her own inimitably impudent way suppose we compare our impressions  this was easily done they had both seen the same two men walking backward and forward opposite the front gate of the cottage before the advancing fog made it impossible to identify him mr sarrazin had recognized in one of the men his agreeable fellowtraveler on the journey from london the other mana strangerwas in all probability an assistant spy obtained in the neighborhood this discovery suggested serious embarrassment in the future mrs presty asked what was to be done next mr sarrazin answered let us have our breakfast  in another quarter of an hour they were both in mrs linleys room  her agitated manner her reddened eyes showed that she was still suffering under the emotions of the past night the moment the lawyer approached her she crossed the room with hurried steps and took both his hands in her trembling grasp you are a good man you are a kind man she said to him wildly you have my truest respect and regard tell me are youreallyreallyreally sure that the one way in which i can keep my child with me is the way you mentioned last night  mr sarrazin led her gently back to her chair  the sad change in her startled and distressed him sincerely solemnly even he declared that the one alternative before her was the alternative that he had mentioned he entreated her to control herself it was useless she still held him as if she was holding to her last hope  listen to me she cried theres something more theres another chance for me i must and will know what you think of it  wait a little pray wait a little  no not a moment is there any hope in appealing to the lawyer whom mr linley has employed let me go back with you to london i will persuade him to exert his influencei will go down on my knees to himi will never leave him till i have won him over to my sidei will take kitty with me he shall see us both and pity us and help us  hopeless quite hopeless mrs linley  oh dont say that  my dear lady my poor dear lady i must say it the man you are talking of is the last man in the world to be influenced as you suppose he is notoriously a lawyer and nothing but a lawyer if you tried to move him to pity you he would say madam i am doing my duty to my client and he would ring his bell and have you shown out yes even if he saw you crushed and crying at his feet  mrs presty interfered for the first time  in your place catherine she said i would put my foot down on that man and crush him consent to the divorce and you may do it  mrs linley lay prostrate in her chair the excitement which had sustained her thus far seemed to have sunk with the sinking of her last hope pale exhausted yielding to hard necessity she looked up when her mother said consent to the divorce and answered i have consented  and trust me mr sarrazin said fervently to see that justice is done and to protect you in the meanwhile  mrs presty added her tribute of consolation  after all she asked what is there to terrify you in the prospect of a divorce you wont hear what people say about itfor we see no society now and as for the newspapers keep them out of the house  mrs linley answered with a momentary revival of energy  it is not the fear of exposure that has tortured me she said when i was left in the solitude of the night my heart turned to kitty i felt that any sacrifice of myself might be endured for her sake its the remembrance of my marriage mr sarrazin that is the terrible trial to me those whom god has joined together let no man put asunder is there nothing to terrify me in setting that solemn command at defiance i do itoh i do itin consenting to the divorce i renounce the vows which i bound myself to respect in the presence of god i profane the remembrance of eight happy years hallowed by true love ah you neednt remind me of what my husband has done i dont forget how cruelly he has wronged me i dont forget that his own act has cast me from him but whose act destroys our marriage mine mine forgive me mamma forgive me my kind friendthe horror that i have of myself forces its way to my lips no more of it my child is my one treasure left what must i do next what must i sign what must i sacrifice tell meand it shall be done i submit i submit  delicately and mercifully mr sarrazin answered that sad appeal  all that his knowledge experience and resolution could suggest he addressed to mrs presty mrs linley could listen or not listen as her own wishes inclined in the one case or in the other her interests would be equally well served the good lawyer kissed her hand rest and recover he whispered and then he turned to her motherand became a man of business once more  the first thing i shall do maam is to telegraph to my agent in edinburgh he will arrange for the speediest possible hearing of our case in the court of session make your mind easy so far  mrs prestys mind was by this time equally inaccessible to information and advice i want to know what is to be done with those two men who are watching the gate was all she said in the way of reply  mrs linley raised her head in alarm  two she exclaimedand looked at mr sarrazin you only spoke of one last night  and i add another this morning rest your poor head mrs linley i know how it aches i know how it burns he still persisted in speaking to mrs presty one of those two men will follow me to the station and see me off on my way to london the other will look after you or your daughter or the maid or any other person who may try to get away into hiding with kitty and they are both keeping close to the gate in the fear of losing sight of us in the fog  i wish we lived in the middle ages said mrs presty  what would be the use of that maam  good heavens mr sarrazin dont you see in those grand old days you would have taken a dagger and the gardener would have taken a dagger and you would have stolen out and stabbed those two villains as a matter of course and this is the age of progress the vilest rogue in existence is a sacred person whose life we are bound to respect ah what good that national hero would have done who put his barrels of gunpowder in the right place on the fifth of november i have always said it and i stick to it guy fawkes was a great statesman  in the meanwhile mrs linley was not resting and not listening to the expression of her mothers political sentiments she was intently watching mr sarrazins face  there is danger threatening us she said do you see a way out of it  to persist in trying to spare her was plainly useless mr sarrazin answered her directly  the danger of legal proceedings to obtain possession of the child he said is more near and more serious than i thought it right to acknowledge while you were in doubt which way to decide i was carefultoo careful perhapsnot to unduly influence you in a matter of the utmost importance to your future life but you have made up your mind i dont scruple now to remind you that an interval of time must pass before the decree for your divorce can be pronounced and the care of the child be legally secured to the mother the only doubt and the only danger are there if you are not frightened by the prospect of a desperate venture which some women would shrink from i believe i see a way of baffling the spies  mrs linley started to her feet say what i am to do she cried and judge for yourself if i am as easily frightened as some women  the lawyer pointed with a persuasive smile to her empty chair if you allow yourself to be excited he said you will frighten me pleaseoh please sit down again  mrs linley felt the strong will asserting itself in terms of courteous entreaty she obeyed mrs presty had never admired the lawyer as she admired him now is that how you manage your wife she asked  mr sarrazin was equal to the occasion whatever it might be in your time maam he said did you reveal the mysteries of conjugal life he turned to mrs linley i have something to ask first he resumed and then you shall hear what i propose how many people serve you in this cottage  three our landlady who is housekeeper and cook our own maid and the landladys daughter who does the housework  any outofdoor servants  only the gardener  can you trust these people  in what way mr sarrazin  can you trust them with a secret which only concerns yourself  certainly the maid has been with us for years no truer woman ever lived the good old landlady often drinks tea with us her daughter is going to be married and i have given the weddingdress as for the gardener let kitty settle the matter with him and i answer for the rest why are you pointing to the window  look out and tell me what you see  i see the fog  and i mrs linley have seen the boathouse while the spies are watching your gate what do you say to crossing the lake under cover of the fog     fourth book   chapter xxviii mr randal linley   winter had come and gone spring was nearing its end and london still suffered under the rigid regularity of easterly winds although in less than a week summer would begin with the first of june mr sarrazin was glad to find his office warmed by a fire when he arrived to open the letters of the day  the correspondence in general related exclusively to proceedings connected with the law two letters only presented an exception to the general rule the first was addressed in mrs linleys handwriting and bore the postmark of hanover kittys mother had not only succeeded in getting to the safe side of the lakeshe and her child had crossed the german ocean as well in one respect her letter was a remarkable composition although it was written by a lady it was short enough to be read in less than a minute    my dear mr sarrazini have just time to write by this evenings post our excellent courier has satisfied himself that the danger of discovery has passed away the wretches have been so completely deceived that they are already on their way back to england to lie in wait for us at folkestone and dover tomorrow morning we leave this charming placeoh how unwillinglyfor bremen to catch the steamer to hull you shall hear from me again on our arrival gratefully yours  catherine linley   mr sarrazin put this letter into a private drawer and smiled as he turned the key has she made up her mind at last he asked himself but for the courier i shouldnt feel sure of her even now  the second letter agreeably surprised him it was announced that the writer had just returned from the united states it invited him to dinner that evening and it was signed randal linley in mr sarrazins estimation randal had always occupied a higher place than his brother the lawyer had known mrs linley before her marriage and had been inclined to think that she would have done wisely if she had given her hand to the younger brother instead of the elder his acquaintance with randal ripened rapidly into friendship but his relations with herbert made no advance toward intimacy there was a gentlemanlike cordiality between them and nothing more  at seven oclock the two friends sat at a snug little table in the private room of a hotel with an infinite number of questions to ask of each other and with nothing to interrupt them but a dinner of such extraordinary merit that it insisted on being noticed from the first course to the last  randal began before we talk of anything else he said tell me about catherine and the child where are they  on their way to england after a residence in germany  and the old lady  mrs presty has been staying with friends in london  what have they parted company has there been a quarrel  nothing of the sort a friendly separation in the strictest sense of the word oh randal what are you about dont put pepper into this perfect soup its as good as the gras double at the cafe anglais in paris  so it is i wasnt paying proper attention to it but i am anxious about catherine why did she go abroad  havent you heard from her  not for six months or more i innocently vexed her by writing a little too hopefully about herbert mrs presty answered my letter and recommended me not to write again it isnt like catherine to bear malice  dont even think such a thing possible the lawyer answered earnestly attribute her silence to the right cause terrible anxieties have been weighing on her mind since you went to america  anxieties caused by my brother oh i hope not  caused entirely by your brotherif i must tell the truth cant you guess how  is it the child you dont mean to tell me that herbert has taken kitty away from her mother  while i am her mothers lawyer my friend your brother wont do that welcome back to england in the first glass of sherry good wine but a little too dry for my taste no we wont talk of domestic troubles just yet you shall hear all about it after dinner what made you go to america you havent been delivering lectures have you  i have been enjoying myself among the most hospitable people in the world  mr sarrazin shook his head he had a case of copyright in hand just then a people to be pitied he said  why  because their government forgets what is due to the honor of the nation  how  in this way the honor of a nation which confers right of property in works of art produced by its own citizens is surely concerned in protecting from theft works of art produced by other citizens  thats not the fault of the people  certainly not i have already said its the fault of the government lets attend to the fish now  randal took his friends advice good sauce isnt it he said  the epicure entered a protest good he repeated my dear fellow its absolute perfection i dont like to cast a slur on english cookery but think of melted butter and tell me if anybody but a foreigner i dont like foreigners but i give them their due could have produced this white wine sauce so you really had no particular motive in going to america  on the contrary i had a very particular motive just remember what my life used to be when i was in scotlandand look at my life now no mount morven no model farm to look after no pleasant highland neighbors i cant go to my brother while he is leading his present life i have hurt catherines feelings i have lost dear little kitty i am not obliged to earn my living mores the pity i dont care about politics i have a pleasure in eating harmless creatures but no pleasure in shooting them what is there left for me to do but to try change of scene and go roaming around the world a restless creature without an object in life have i done something wrong again it isnt the pepper this timeand yet youre looking at me as if i was trying your temper  the french side of mr sarrazins nature had got the better of him once more he pointed indignantly to a supreme preparation of fowl on his friends plate do i actually see you picking out your truffles and putting them on one side he asked  well randal acknowledged i dont care about truffles  mr sarrazin rose with his plate in his hand and his fork ready for action he walked round the table to his friends side and reverently transferred the neglected truffles to his own plate randal you will live to repent this he said solemnly in the meantime i am the gainer until he had finished the truffles no word fell from his lips i think i should have enjoyed them more he remarked if i had concentrated my attention by closing my eyes but you would have thought i was going to sleep he recovered his english nationality after this until the dessert had been placed on the table and the waiter was ready to leave the room at that auspicious moment he underwent another relapse he insisted on sending his compliments and thanks to the cook  at last said randal we are by ourselvesand now i want to know why catherine went to germany    chapter xxix  mr sarrazin  as a lawyer randals guest understood that a narrative of events can only produce the right effect on one condition it must begin at the beginning having related all that had been said and done during his visit to the cottage including his first efforts in the character of an angler under kittys supervision he stopped to fill his glass againand then astonished randal by describing the plan that he had devised for escaping from the spies by crossing the lake in the fog  what did the ladies say to it randal inquired who spoke first  mrs presty of course she objected to risk her life on the water in a fog mrs linley showed a resolution for which i was not prepared she thought of kitty saw the value of my suggestion and went away at once to consult with the landlady in the meantime i sent for the gardener and told him what i was thinking of he was one of those stolid englishmen who possess resources which dont express themselves outwardly judging by his face you would have said he was subsiding into a slumber under the infliction of a sermon instead of listening to a lawyer proposing a stratagem when i had done the man showed the metal he was made of in plain english he put three questions which gave me the highest opinion of his intelligence how much luggage sir as little as they can conveniently take with them i said how many persons the two ladies the child and myself can you row sir in any water you like mr gardener fresh or salt think of asking me an athletic englishman if i could row in an hour more we were ready to embark and the blessed fog was thicker than ever mrs presty yielded under protest kitty was wild with delight her mother was quiet and resigned but one circumstance occurred that i didnt quite understandthe presence of a stranger on the pier with a gun in his hand  you dont mean one of the spies  nothing of the sort i mean an idea of the gardeners he had been a sailor in his timeand thats a trade which teaches a man if hes good for anything to think and act on his thought at one and the same moment he had taken a peep at the blackguards in front of the house and had recognized the shortest of the two as a native of the place perfectly well aware that one of the features attached to the cottage was a boathouse that chap is not such a fool as he looks says the gardener if he mentions the boathouse the other fellow from london may have his suspicions i thought i would post my son on the pierthat quiet young man there with the gunto keep a lookout if he sees another boat there are half a dozen on this side of the lake putting off after us he has orders to fire on the chance of our hearing him a little notion of mine sir to prevent our being surprised in the fog do you see any objection to it objection in the days when diplomacy was something more than a solemn pretense what a member of congress that gardener would have made well we shipped our oars and away we went not quite haphazardfor we had a compass with us our course was as straight as we could go to a village on the opposite side of the lake called brightfold nothing happened for the first quarter of an hourand then by the living jingo excuse my vulgarity we heard the gun  what did you do  went on rowing and held a council this time i came out as the clever one of the party the men were following us in the dark they would have to guess at the direction we had taken and they would most likely assume in such weather as we had that we should choose the shortest way across the lake at my suggestion we changed our course and made for a large town higher up on the shore called tawley we landed and waited for events and made no discovery of another boat behind us the fools had justified my confidence in themthey had gone to brightfold there was halfanhour to spare before the next train came to tawley and the fog was beginning to lift on that side of the lake we looked at the shops and i made a purchase in the town  stop a minute said randal is brightfold on the railway  no  is there an electric telegraph at the place  yes  that was awkward wasnt it the first thing those men would do would be to telegraph to tawley  not a doubt of it how would they describe us do you think  randal answered a middleaged gentlemantwo ladies one of them elderlyand a little girl quite enough to identify you at tawley if the stationmaster understood the message  shall i tell you what the stationmaster discovered with the message in his hand no elderly lady no middleaged gentleman nothing more remarkable than one ladyand a little boy  randals face brightened you parted company of course he said and you disguised kitty how did you manage it  didnt i say just now that we looked at the shops and that i made a purchase in the town a boys readymade suitnot at all a bad fit for kitty mrs linley put on the suit and tucked up the childs hair under a straw hat in an empty yardno idlers about in that bad weather we said goodby and parted with grievous misgivings on my side which proved thank god to have been quite needless kitty and her mother went to the station and mrs presty and i hired a carriage and drove away to the head of the lake to catch the train to london do you know randal i have altered my opinion of mrs presty  randal smiled you too have found something in that old woman he said which doesnt appear on the surface  the occasion seems to bring that something out the lawyer remarked when i proposed the separation and mentioned my reasons i expected to find some difficulty in persuading mrs presty to give up the adventurous journey with her daughter and her grandchild i reminded her that she had friends in london who would receive her and got snubbed for taking the liberty i know that as well as you do come alongim ready to go with you it isnt agreeable to my selfesteem to own it but i expected to hear her say that she would consent to any sacrifice for the sake of her dear daughter no such claptrap as that passed her lips she owned the true motive with a superiority to cant which won my sincerest respect ill do anything she said to baffle herbert linley and the spies he has set to watch us i cant tell you how glad i was that she had her reward on the same day we were too late at the station and we had to wait for the next train and what do you think happened the two scoundrels followed us instead of following mrs linley they had inquired no doubt at the livery stables where we hired the carriagehad recognized the description of usand had taken the long journey to london for nothing mrs presty and i shook hands at the terminus the best friends that ever traveled together with the best of motives after that i think i deserve another glass of wine  go on with your story and you shall have another bottle cried randal what did catherine and the child do after they left you  they did the safest thingthey left england mrs linley distinguished herself on this occasion it was her excellent idea to avoid popular ports of departure like folkestone and dover which were sure to be watched and to get away if the thing could be done from some place on the east coast we consulted our guide and found that a line of steamers sailed from hull to bremen once a week a tedious journey from our part of cumberland with some troublesome changing of trains but they got there in time to embark my first news of them reached me in a telegram from bremen there they waited for further instructions i sent the instructions by a thoroughly capable and trustworthy manan italian courier known to me by an experience of twenty years shall i confess it i thought i had done rather a clever thing in providing mrs linley with a friend in need while i was away from her  i think so too said randal  wrong completely wrong i had made a mistakei had been too clever and i got my reward accordingly you know how i advised mrs linley  yes you persuaded her with the greatest difficulty to apply for a divorce  very well i had made all the necessary arrangements for the trial when i received a letter from germany my charming client had changed her mind and declined to apply for the divorce there was my reward for having been too clever  i dont understand you  my dear fellow you are dull tonight i had been so successful in protecting mrs linley and the child and my excellent courier had found such a charming place of retreat for them in one of the suburbs of hanover that she saw no reason now for taking the shocking course that i had recommended to herso repugnant to all her most cherished convictions so sinful and so shameful in its doing of evil that good might come experience had convinced her that thanks to me there was no fear of kitty being discovered and taken from her she therefore begged me to write to my agent in edinburgh and tell him that her application to the court was withdrawn ah you understand my position at last the headstrong woman was running a risk which renewed all my anxieties by every days post i expected to hear that she had paid the penalty of her folly and that your brother had succeeded in getting possession of the child wait a little before you laugh at me but for the courier the thing would have really happened a week since  randal looked astonished months must have passed he objected surely after that lapse of time mrs linley must have been safe from discovery  take your own positive view of it i only know that the thing happened and why not the luck had begun by being on one sidewhy shouldnt the other side have had its turn next  do you really believe in luck  devoutly a lawyer must believe in something he knows the law too well to put any faith in that and his clients present to him if he is a man of any feeling a hideous view of human nature the poor devil believes in luckrather than believe in nothing i think it quite likely that accident helped the person employed by the husband to discover the wife and child anyhow mrs linley and kitty were seen in the streets of hanover seen recognized and followed the courier happened to be with themluck again for thirty years and more he had been traveling in every part of europe there was not a landlord of the smallest pretensions anywhere who didnt know him and like him i pretended not to see that anybody was following us he said writing from hanover to relieve my anxiety and i took the ladies to a hotel the hotel possessed two merits from our point of viewit had a way out at the back through the stables and it was kept by a landlord who was an excellent good friend of mine i arranged with him what he was to say when inquiries were made and i kept my poor ladies prisoners in their lodgings for three days the end of it is that mr linleys policeman has gone away to watch the channel steamservice while we return quietly by way of bremen and hull there is the couriers account of it i have only to add that poor mrs linley has been fairly frightened into submission she changes her mind again and pledges herself once more to apply for the divorce if we are only lucky enough to get our case heard without any very serious delay i am not afraid of my client slipping through my fingers for the second time when will the courts of session be open to us you have lived in scotland randal  but i havent lived in the courts of law i wish i could give you the information you want  mr sarrazin looked at his watch for all i know to the contrary he said we may be wasting precious time while we are talking here will you excuse me if i go away to my club  are you going in search of information  yes we have some inveterate old whistplayers who are always to be found in the cardroom one of them formerly practiced i believe in the scotch courts it has just occurred to me that the chance is worth trying  will you let me know if you succeed randal asked  the lawyer took his hand at parting you seem to be almost as anxious about it as i am he said  to tell you the truth i am a little alarmed when i think of catherine if there is another long delay how do we know what may happen before the law has confirmed the mothers claim to the child let me send one of the servants here to wait at your club will you give him a line telling me when the trial is likely to take place  with the greatest pleasure goodnight  left alone randal sat by the fireside for a while thinking of the future the prospect as he saw it disheartened him as a means of employing his mind on a more agreeable subject for reflection he opened his traveling desk and took out two or three letters they had been addressed to him while he was in america by captain bennydeck  the captain had committed an error of which most of us have been guilty in our time he had been too exclusively devoted to work that interested him to remember what was due to the care of his health the doctors warnings had been neglected his overstrained nerves had given way and the man whose strong constitution had resisted cold and starvation in the arctic wastes had broken down under stress of brainwork in london  this was the news which the first of the letters contained  the second written under dictation alluded briefly to the remedies suggested in the captains case the fresh air recommended was the air of the sea at the same time he was forbidden to receive either letters or telegrams during his absence from town until the doctor had seen him again these instructions pointed in captain bennydecks estimation to sailing for pleasures sake and therefore to hiring a yacht  the third and last letter announced that the yacht had been found and described the captains plans when the vessel was ready for sea  he proposed to sail here and there about the channel wherever it might please the wind to take him friends would accompany him but not in any number the yacht was not large enough to accommodate comfortably more than one or two guests at a time every now and then the vessel would come to an anchor in the bay of the little coast town of sandyseal to accommodate friends going and coming and in spite of medical advice to receive letters you may have heard of sandyseal the captain wrote as one of the places which have lately been found out by the doctors they are recommending the air to patients suffering from nervous disorders all over england the one hotel in the place and the few cottages which let lodgings are crammed as i hear and the speculative builder is beginning his operations at such a rate that sandyseal will be no longer recognizable in a few months more before the crescents and terraces and grand hotels turn the town into a fashionable wateringplace i want to take a last look at scenes familiar to me under their old aspect if you are inclined to wonder at my feeling such a wish as this i can easily explain myself two miles inland from sandyseal there is a lonely old moated house in that house i was born when you return from america write to me at the postoffice or at the hotel i am equally well known in both places and let us arrange for a speedy meeting i wish i could ask you to come and see me in my birthplace it was sold years since under instructions in my fathers will and was purchased for the use of a community of nuns we may look at the outside and we can do no more in the meantime dont despair of my recovery the sea is my old friend and my trust is in gods mercy  these last lines were added in a postscript  have you heard any more of that poor girl the daughter of my old friend roderick westerfieldwhose sad story would never have been known to me but for you i feel sure that you have good reasons for not telling me the name of the man who has misled her or the address at which she may be found but you may one day be at liberty to break your silence in that case dont hesitate to do so because there may happen to be obstacles in my way no difficulties discourage me when my end in view is the saving of a soul in peril  randal returned to his desk to write to the captain he had only got as far as the first sentences when the servant returned with the lawyers promised message mr sarrazins news was communicated in these cheering terms  i am a firmer believer in luck than ever if we only make hasteand wont i make hastewe may get the divorce as i calculate in three weeks time     chapter xxx the lord president   mrs linleys application for a divorce was heard in the first division of the court of session at edinburgh the lord president being the judge  to the disappointment of the large audience assembled no defense was attempted on the part of the husbanda wise decision seeing that the evidence of the wife and her witnesses was beyond dispute but one exciting incident occurred toward the close of the proceedings sudden illness made mrs linleys removal necessary at the moment of all others most interesting to herselfthe moment before the judges decision was announced  but as the event proved the poor ladys withdrawal was the most fortunate circumstance that could have occurred in her own interests after condemning the husbands conduct with unsparing severity the lord president surprised most of the persons present by speaking of the wife in these terms  grievously as mrs linley has been injured the evidence shows that she was herself by no means free from blame she has been guilty to say the least of it of acts of indiscretion when the criminal attachment which had grown up between mr herbert linley and miss westerfield had been confessed to her she appears to have most unreasonably overrated whatever merit there might have been in their resistance to the final temptation she was indeed so impulsively ready to forgive without waiting to see if the event justified the exercise of mercy that she owns to having given her hand to miss westerfield at parting not half an hour after that young persons shameless forgetfulness of the claims of modesty duty and gratitude had been first communicated to her to say that this was the act of an inconsiderate woman culpably indiscreet and i had almost added culpably indelicate is only to say what she has deserved on the next occasion to which i feel bound to advert her conduct was even more deserving of censure she herself appears to have placed the temptation under which he fell in her husbands way and so in some degree at least to have provoked the catastrophe which has brought her before this court i allude it is needless to say to her having invited the governessthen out of harms way then employed elsewhereto return to her house and to risk what actually occurred a meeting with mr herbert linley when no third person happened to be present i know that the maternal motive which animated mrs linley is considered by many persons to excuse and even to justify that most regrettable act and i have myself allowed i fear weakly allowed more than due weight to this consideration in pronouncing for the divorce let me express the earnest hope that mrs linley will take warning by what has happened and if she finds herself hereafter placed in other circumstances of difficulty let me advise her to exercise more control over impulses which one might expect perhaps to find in a young girl but which are neither natural nor excusable in a woman of her age  his lordship then decreed the divorce in the customary form giving the custody of the child to the mother                               as fast as a hired carriage could take him mr sarrazin drove from the court to mrs linleys lodgings to tell her that the one great object of securing her right to her child had been achieved  at the door he was met by mrs presty she was accompanied by a stranger whose medical services had been required interested professionally in hearing the result of the trial this gentleman volunteered to communicate the good news to his patient he had been waiting to administer a composing draught until the suspense from which mrs linley was suffering might be relieved and a reasonable hope be entertained that the medicine would produce the right effect with that explanation he left the room  while the doctor was speaking mrs presty was drawing her own conclusions from a close scrutiny of mr sarrazins face  i am going to make a disagreeable remark she announced you look ten years older sir than you did when you left us this morning to go to the court do me a favorcome to the sideboard the lawyer having obeyed she poured out a glass of wine there is the remedy she resumed when something has happened to worry you  worry isnt the right word mr sarrazin declared im furious its a most improper thing for a person in my position to say of a person in the lord presidents position but i do say ithe ought to be ashamed of himself  after giving us our divorce mrs presty exclaimed what has he done  mr sarrazin repeated what the judge had said of mrs linley in my opinion he added such language as that is an insult to your daughter  and yet mrs presty repeated he has given us our divorce she returned to the sideboard poured out a second dose of the remedy against worry and took it herself what sort of character does the lord president bear she asked when she had emptied her glass  this seemed to be an extraordinary question to put under the circumstances mr sarrazin answered it however to the best of his ability an excellent character he saidthats the unaccountable part of it i hear that he is one of the most careful and considerate men who ever sat on the bench excuse me mrs presty i didnt intend to produce that impression on you  what impression mr sarrazin  you look as if you thought there was some excuse for the judge  thats exactly what i do think  you find an excuse for him  i do  what is it maam  constitutional infirmity sir  may i ask of what nature  you may gout  mr sarrazin thought he understood her at last you know the lord president he said  mrs presty denied it positively no mr sarrazin i dont get at it in that way i merely consult my experience of another official person of high rank and apply it to the lord president you know that my first husband was a cabinet minister  i have heard you say so mrs presty on more than one occasion  very well you may also have heard that the late mr norman was a remarkably wellbred man in and out of the house of commons courteous almost to a fault one day i happened to interrupt him when he was absorbed over an act of parliament before i could apologizei tell you this in the strictest confidencehe threw the act of parliament at my head ninetynine women out of a hundred would have thrown it back again knowing his constitution i decided on waiting a day or two on the second day my anticipations were realized mr normans great toe was as big as my fist and as red as a lobster he apologized for the act of parliament with tears in his eyes suppressed gout in mr normans temper suppressed gout in the lord presidents temper he will have a toe and if i can prevail upon my daughter to call upon him i have not the least doubt he will apologize to her with tears in his eyes  this interesting experiment was never destined to be tried right or wrong mrs prestys theory remained the only explanation of the judges severity mr sarrazin attempted to change the subject mrs presty had not quite done with it yet there is one more thing i want to say she proceeded will his lordships remarks appear in the newspapers  not a doubt of it  in that case i will take care for my daughters sake that no newspapers enter the house tomorrow as for visitors we neednt be afraid of them catherine is not likely to be able to leave her room the worry of this miserable business has quite broken her down  the doctor returned at that moment  without taking the old ladys gloomy view of his patient he admitted that she was in a low nervous condition and he had reason to suppose judging by her reply to a question which he had ventured to put that she had associations with scotland which made a visit to that country far from agreeable to her his advice was that she should leave edinburgh as soon as possible and go south if the change of climate led to no improvement she would at least be in a position to consult the best physicians in london in a day or two more it would be safe to remove herprovided she was not permitted to exhaust her strength by taking long railway journeys  having given his advice the doctor took leave soon after he had gone kitty made her appearance charged with a message from mrs linleys room  hasnt the physic sent your mother to sleep yet mrs presty inquired  kitty shook her head mamma wants to go away tomorrow and no physic will make her sleep till she has seen you and settled about it thats what she told me to say if i behaved in that way about my physic i should catch it  mrs presty left the room watched by her granddaughter with an appearance of anxiety which it was not easy to understand  whats the matter mr sarrazin asked you look very serious today  kitty held up a warning hand grandmamma sometimes listens at doors she whispered i dont want her to hear me she waited a little longer and then approached mr sarrazin frowning mysteriously take me up on your knee she said theres something wrong going on in this house  mr sarrazin took her on his knee and rashly asked what had gone wrong kittys reply puzzled him  i go to mammas room every morning when i wake the child began i get into her bed and i give her a kiss and i say goodmorningand sometimes if she isnt in a hurry to get up i stop in her bed and go to sleep again mamma thought i was asleep this morning i wasnt asleepi was only quiet i dont know why i was quiet  mr sarrazins kindness still encouraged her well he said and what happened after that  grandmamma came in she told mamma to keep up her spirits she says it will all be over in a few hours more she says what a burden it will be off your mind she says is that child asleep and mamma says yes and grandmamma took one of mammas towels and i thought she was going to wash herself what would you have thought  mr sarrazin began to doubt whether he would do well to discuss mrs prestys object in taking the towel he only said go on  grandmamma dipped it into the waterjug kitty continued with a grave face but she didnt wash herself she went to one of mammas boxes though shes so old shes awfully strong i can tell you she rubbed off the luggagelabel in no time mamma says what are you doing that for and grandmamma saysthis is the dreadful thing that i want you to explain oh i can remember it all its like learning lessons only much nicergrandmamma says before the days over the name on your boxes will be your name no longer  mr sarrazin now became aware of the labyrinth into which his young friend had innocently led him the divorce and the wifes inevitable return when the husband was no longer the husband to her maiden namethese were the subjects on which kittys desire for enlightenment applied to the wisest person within her reach her mothers legal adviser  mr sarrazin tried to put her off his knee she held him round the neck he thought of the railway as a promising excuse and told her he must go back to london she held him a little tighter i really cant wait my dear he got up as he said it kitty hung on to him with her legs as well as her arms and finding the position uncomfortable lost her temper mammas going to have a new name she shouted as if the lawyer had suddenly become deaf grandmamma says she must be mrs norman and i must be miss norman i wont wheres papa i want to write to him i know he wont allow it do you hear wheres papa  she fastened her little hands on mr sarrazins coat collar and tried to shake him in a fury of resolution to know what it all meant at that critical moment mrs presty opened the door and stood petrified on the threshold  hanging on to mr sarrazin with her arms and her legs exclaimed the old lady you little wretch which are you a monkey or a child  the lawyer gently deposited kitty on the floor  mind this samuel she whispered as he set her down on her feet i wont be miss norman  mrs presty pointed sternly at the open door you were screaming just now when quiet in the house is of the utmost importance to your mother if i hear you again bread and water and no doll for the rest of the week  kitty retired in disgrace and mrs presty sharpened her tongue on mr sarrazin next im astonished sir at your allowing that impudent grandchild of mine to take such liberties with you who would suppose that you were a married man with children of your own  thats just the reason my dear madam mr sarrazin smartly replied i romp with my own childrenwhy not with kitty can i do anything for you in london he went on getting a little nearer to the door i leave edinburgh by the next train and i promise you he added with the spirit of mischief twinkling in his eyes this shall be my last confidential interview with your grandchild when she wants to ask any more questions i transfer her to you  mrs presty looked after the retreating lawyer thoroughly mystified what confidential interview what questions after some consideration her experience of her granddaughter suggested that a little exercise of mercy might be attended with the right result she looked at a cake on the sideboard i have only to forgive kitty she decided and the child will talk about it of her own accord    chapter xxxi  mr herbert linley  of the friends and neighbors who had associated with herbert linley in bygone days not more than two or three kept up their intimacy with him at the later time of his disgrace those few it is needless to say were men  one of the faithful companions who had not shrunk from him yet had just left the london hotel at which linley had taken rooms for sydney westerfield and himselfin the name of mr and mrs herbert this old friend had been shocked by the change for the worse which he had perceived in the fugitive master of mount morven linleys stout figure of former times had fallen away as if he had suffered under long illness his healthy color had faded he made an effort to assume the hearty manner that had once been natural to him which was simply pitiable to see after sacrificing all that makes life truly decent and truly enjoyable for a woman he has got nothing not even false happiness in return with that dreary conclusion the retiring visitor descended the hotel steps and went his way along the street  linley returned to the newspaper which he had been reading when his friend was shown into the room  line by line he followed the progress of the law report which informed its thousands of readers that his wife had divorced him and had taken lawful possession of his child word by word he dwelt with morbid attention on the terms of crushing severity in which the lord president had spoken of sydney westerfield and of himself sentence by sentence he read the reproof inflicted on the unhappy woman whom he had vowed to love and cherish and theneven thenurged by his own selftormenting suspicion he looked for more on the opposite page there was a leading article presenting comments on the trial written in the tone of lofty and virtuous regret taking the wifes side against the judge but declaring at the same time that no condemnation of the conduct of the husband and the governess could be too merciless and no misery that might overtake them in the future more than they had deserved  he threw the newspaper on the table at his side and thought over what he had read  if he had done nothing else he had drained the bitter cup to the dregs when he looked back he saw nothing but the life that he had wasted when his thoughts turned to the future they confronted a prospect empty of all promise to a man still in the prime of life wife and child were as completely lost to him as if they had been deadand it was the wifes doing had he any right to complain not the shadow of a right as the newspapers said he had deserved it  the clock roused him striking the hour  he rose hurriedly and advanced toward the window as he crossed the room he passed by a mirror his own sullen despair looked at him in the reflection of his face she will be back directly he remembered she mustnt see me like this he went on to the window to divert his mind and so to clear his face by watching the stream of life flowing by in the busy street artificial cheerfulness assumed love in sydneys presencethat was what his life had come to already  if he had known that she had gone out seeking a temporary separation with his fear of selfbetrayalif he had suspected that she too had thoughts which must be concealed sad forebodings of losing her hold on his heart terrifying suspicions that he was already comparing her to her own disadvantage with the wife whom he had desertedif he had made these discoveries what would the end have been but she had thus far escaped the danger of exciting his distrust that she loved him he knew that she had begun to doubt his attachment to her he would not have believed if his oldest friend had declared it on the best evidence she had said to him that morning at breakfast there was a good woman who used to let lodgings here in london and who was very kind to me when i was a child and she had asked leave to go to the house and inquire if that friendly landlady was still livingwith nothing visibly constrained in her smile and with no faltering tone in her voice it was not until she was out in the street that the telltale tears came into her eyes and the bitter sigh broke from her and mingled its little unheard misery with the grand rise and fall of the tumult of london life while he was still at the window he saw her crossing the street on her way back to him she came into the room with her complexion heightened by exercise she kissed him and said with her pretty smile have you been lonely without me who would have supposed that the torment of distrust and the dread of desertion were busy at this womans heart  he placed a chair for her and seating himself by her side asked if she felt tired every attention that she could wish for from the man whom she loved offered with every appearance of sincerity on the surface she met him halfway and answered as if her mind was quite at ease  no dear im not tiredbut im glad to get back  did you find your old landlady still alive  yes but oh so altered poor thing the struggle for life must have been a hard one since i last saw her  she didnt recognize you of course  oh no she looked at me and my dress in great surprise and said her lodgings were hardly fit for a young lady like me it was too sad i said i had known her lodgings well many years agoand with that to prepare her i told her who i was ah it was a melancholy meeting for both of us she burst out crying when i kissed her and i had to tell her that my mother was dead and my brother lost to me in spite of every effort to find him i asked to go into the kitchen thinking the change would be a relief to both of us the kitchen used to be a paradise to me in those old days it was so warm to a halfstarved childand i always got something to eat when i was there you have no idea herbert how poor and how empty the place looked to me now i was glad to get out of it and go upstairs there was a lumberroom at the top of the house i used to play in it all by myself more changes met me the moment i opened the door  changes for the better  my dear it couldnt have changed for the worse my dirty old playroom was cleaned and repaired the lumber taken away and a nice little bed in one corner some clerk in the city had taken the roomi shouldnt have known it again but there was another surprise waiting for me a happy surprise this time in cleaning out the garret what do you think the landlady found try to guess  anything to please her anything to make her think that he was as fond of her as ever was it something you had left behind you he said at the time when you lodged there  yes you are right at the first guessa little memorial of my father only some torn crumpled leaves from a book of childrens songs that he used to teach me to sing and a small packet of his letters which my mother may have thrown aside and forgotten see i have brought them back with me i mean to look over the letters at oncebut this doesnt interest you  indeed it does  he made that considerate reply mechanically as if thinking of something else she was afraid to tell him plainly that she saw this but she could venture to say that he was not looking well i have noticed it for some time past she confessed you have been accustomed to live in the country i am afraid london doesnt agree with you  he admitted that she might be right still speaking absently still thinking of the divorce she laid the packet of letters and the poor relics of the old songbook on the table and bent over him tenderly and a little timidly she put her arm around his neck let us try some purer air she suggested the seaside might do you good dont you think so  i daresay my dear where shall we go  oh i leave that to you  no sydney it was i who proposed coming to london you shall decide this time  she submitted and promised to think of it leaving him with the first expression of trouble that had shown itself in her face she took up the songs and put them into the pocket of her dress on the point of removing the letters next she noticed the newspaper on the table anything interesting today she askedand drew the newspaper toward her to look at it he took it from her suddenly almost roughly the next moment he apologized for his rudeness there is nothing worth reading in the paper he said after begging her pardon you dont care about politics do you  instead of answering she looked at him attentively  the heightened color which told of recent exercise healthily enjoyed faded from her face she was silent she was pale a little confused he smiled uneasily surely he resumed trying to speak gayly i havent offended you  there is something in the newspaper she said which you dont want me to read  he denied itbut he still kept the newspaper in his own possession her voice sank low her face turned paler still  is it all over she asked and is it put in the newspaper  what do you mean  i mean the divorce  he went back again to the window and looked out it was the easiest excuse that he could devise for keeping his face turned away from her she followed him  i dont want to read it herbert i only ask you to tell me if you are a free man again  quiet as it was her tone left him no alternative but to treat her brutally or to reply still looking out at the street he said yes  free to marry if you like she persisted  he said yes once moreand kept his face steadily turned away from her she waited a while he neither moved nor spoke  surviving the slow death little by little of all her other illusions one last hope had lingered in her heart it was killed by that cruel look fixed on the view of the street  ill try to think of a place that we can go to at the seaside having said those words she slowly moved away to the door and turned back remembering the packet of letters she took it up paused and looked toward the window the streets still interested him she left the room     chapter xxxii miss westerfield   she locked the door of her bedchamber and threw off her walkingdress light as it was she felt as if it would stifle her even the ribbon round her neck was more than she could endure and breathe freely her overburdened heart found no relief in tears in the solitude of her room she thought of the future the dreary foreboding of what it might be filled her with a superstitious dread from which she recoiled one of the windows was open already she threw up the other to get more air in the cooler atmosphere her memory recovered itself she recollected the newspaper that herbert had taken from her instantly she rang for the maid ask the first waiter you see downstairs for todays newspaper any one will do so long as i dont wait for it the report of the divorceshe was in a frenzy of impatience to read what he had readthe report of the divorce  when her wish had been gratified when she had read it from beginning to end one vivid impression only was left on her mind she could think of nothing but what the judge had said in speaking of mrs linley  a cruel reproof and worse than cruel a public reproof administered to the generous friend the true wife the devoted motherand for what for having been too ready to forgive the wretch who had taken her husband from her and had repaid a hundred acts of kindness by unpardonable ingratitude  she fell on her knees she tried wildly to pray for inspiration that should tell her what to do oh god how can i give that woman back the happiness of which i have robbed her  the composing influence of prayer on a troubled mind was something that she had heard of it was not something that she experienced now an overpowering impatience to make the speediest and completest atonement possessed her must she wait till herbert linley no longer concealed that he was weary of her and cast her off no it should be her own act that parted them and that did it at once she threw open the door and hurried halfway down the stairs before she remembered the one terrible obstacle in her waythe divorce  slowly and sadly she submitted and went back to her room  there was no disguising it the two who had once been husband and wife were parted irrevocablyby the wifes own act let him repent ever so sincerely let him be ever so ready to return would the woman whose faith herbert linley had betrayed take him back the divorce the merciless divorce answeredno  she paused thinking of the marriage that was now a marriage no more the toilettable was close to her she looked absently at her haggard face in the glass what a lost wretch she saw the generous impulses which other women were free to feel were forbidden luxuries to her she was ashamed of her wickedness she was eager to sacrifice herself for the good of the oncedear friend whom she had wronged useless longings too late too late  she regretted it bitterly why  comparing mrs linleys prospects with hers was there anything to justify regret for the divorced wife she had her sweet little child to make her happy she had a fortune of her own to lift her above sordid cares she was still handsome still a woman to be admired while she held her place in the world as high as ever what was the prospect before sydney westerfield the miserable sinner would end as she had deserved to end absolutely dependent on a man who was at that moment perhaps lamenting the wife whom he had deserted and lost how long would it be before she found herself an outcast without a friend to help herwith a reputation hopelessly lostface to face with the temptation to drown herself or poison herself as other women had drowned themselves or poisoned themselves when the brightest future before them was rest in death  if she had been a few years older herbert linley might never again have seen her a living creature but she was too young to follow any train of repellent thought persistently to its end the man she had guiltily and yet how naturally loved was lord and master in her heart doubt him as she might even in his absence he pleaded with her to have some faith in him still  she reviewed his language and his conduct toward her when she had returned that morning from her walk he had been kind and considerate he had listened to her little story of the relics of her father found in the garret as if her interests were his interests there had been nothing to disappoint her nothing to complain of until she had rashly attempted to discover whether he was free to make her his wife she had only herself to blame if he was cold and distant when she had alluded to that delicate subject on the day when he first knew that the divorce had been granted and his child had been taken from him and yet he might have found a kinder way of reproving a sensitive woman than looking into the streetas if he had forgotten her in the interest of watching the strangers passing by perhaps he was not thinking of the strangers perhaps his mind was dwelling fondly and regretfully on his wife  instinctively she felt that her thoughts were leading her back again to a state of doubt from which her youthful hopefulness recoiled was there nothing she could find to do which would offer some other subject to occupy her mind than herself and her future  looking absently round the room she noticed the packet of her fathers letters placed on the table by her bedside  the first three letters that she examined after untying the packet were briefly written and were signed by names unknown to her they all related to racehorses and to cunningly devised bets which were certain to make the fortunes of the clever gamblers on the turf who laid them absolute indifference on the part of the winners to the ruin of the losers who were not in the secret was the one feeling in common which her fathers correspondents presented in mercy to his memory she threw the letters into the empty fireplace and destroyed them by burning  the next letter which she picked out from the little heap was of some length and was written in a clear and steady hand by comparison with the blotted scrawls which she had just burned it looked like the letter of a gentleman she turned to the signature the strange surname struck her it was bennydeck  not a common name and not a name which seemed to be altogether unknown to her had she heard her father mention it at home in the time of her early childhood there were no associations with it that she could now call to mind  she read the letter it addressed her father familiarly as my dear roderick and it proceeded in these words    the delay in the sailing of your ship offers me an opportunity of writing to you again my last letter told you of my fathers death i was then quite unprepared for an event which has happened since that affliction befell me prepare yourself to be surprised our old moated house at sandyseal in which we have spent so many happy holidays when we were schoolfellows is sold  you will be almost as sorry as i was to hear this and you will be quite as surprised as i was when i tell you that sandyseal place has become a priory of english nuns of the order of st benedict  i think i see you look up from my letter with your big black eyes staring straight before you and say and swear that this must be one of my mystifications unfortunately for i am fond of the old house in which i was born it is only too true the instructions in my fathers will under which sandyseal has been sold are peremptory they are the result of a promise made many years since to his wife  you and i were both very young when my poor mother died but i think you must remember that she like the rest of her family was a roman catholic  having reminded you of this i may next tell you that sandyseal place was my mothers property it formed part of her marriage portion and it was settled on my father if she died before him and if she left no female child to survive her i am her only child my father was therefore dealing with his own property when he ordered the house to be sold his will leaves the purchase money to me i would rather have kept the house  but why did my mother make him promise to sell the place at his death  a letter attached to my fathers will answers this question and tells a very sad story in deference to my mothers wishes it was kept strictly a secret from me while my father lived  there was a younger sister of my mothers who was the beauty of the family loved and admired by everybody who was acquainted with her it is needless to make this long letter longer by dwelling on the girls miserable story you have heard it of other girls over and over again she loved and trusted she was deceived and deserted alone and friendless in a foreign country her fair fame blemished her hope in the future utterly destroyed she attempted to drown herself this took place in france the best of good womena sister of charityhappened to be near enough to the river to rescue her she was sheltered she was pitied she was encouraged to return to her family the poor deserted creature absolutely refused she could never forget that she had disgraced them the good sister of charity won her confidence a retreat which would hide her from the world and devote her to religion for the rest of her days was the one end to her wasted life that she longed for that end was attained in a priory of benedictine nuns established in france there she found protection and peacethere she passed the remaining years of her life among devoted sisterfriendsand there she died a quiet and even a happy death  you will now understand how my mothers grateful remembrance associated her with the interests of more than one community of nuns and you will not need to be told what she had in mind when she obtained my fathers promise at the time of her last illness  he at once proposed to bequeath the house as a free gift to the benedictines my mother thanked him and refused she was thinking of me if our son fails to inherit the house from his father she said it is only right that he should have the value of the house in money let it be sold  so here i amrich alreadywith this additional sum of money in my bankers care  my idea is to invest it in the funds and to let it thrive at interest until i grow older and retire perhaps from service in the navy the later years of my life may well be devoted to the founding of a charitable institution which i myself can establish and direct if i die firstoh there is a chance of it we may have a naval war perhaps or i may turn out one of those incorrigible madmen who risk their lives in arctic exploration in case of the worst therefore i shall leave the interests of my contemplated home in your honest and capable hands for the present goodby and a prosperous voyage outward bound    so the letter ended  sydney dwelt with reluctant attention on the latter half of it the story of the unhappy favorite of the family had its own melancholy and sinister interest for her she felt the foreboding that it might in some of its circumstances be her story toowithout the peaceful end into what community of merciful women could she be received in her sorest need what religious consolations would encourage her penitence what prayers what hopes would reconcile her on her deathbed to the common doom  she sighed as she folded up captain bennydecks letter and put it in her bosom to be read again if my lot had fallen among good people she thought perhaps i might have belonged to the church which took care of that poor girl  her mind was still pursuing its own sad course of inquiry she was wondering in what part of england sandyseal might be she was asking herself if the nuns at the old moated house ever opened their doors to women whose one claim on their common christianity was the claim to be pitiedwhen she heard linleys footsteps approaching the door  his tone was kind his manner was gentle his tender interest in her seemed to have revived her long absence had alarmed him he feared she might be ill i was only thinking she said he smiled and sat down by her and asked if she had been thinking of the place that they should go to when they left london     chapter xxxiii mrs romsey   the one hotel in sandyseal was full from the topmost story to the ground floor and by far the larger half of the landlords guests were invalids sent to him by the doctors  to persons of excitable temperament in search of amusement the place offered no attractions situated at the innermost end of a dull little bay sandysealso far as any view of the shipping in the channel was concernedmight have been built on a remote island in the pacific ocean vessels of any importance kept well out of the way of treacherous shoals and currents lurking at the entrance of the bay the anchorage ground was good but the depth of water was suited to small vessels onlyto shabby old fishingsmacks which seldom paid their expenses and to dirty little coasters carrying coals and potatoes at the back of the hotel two slovenly rows of cottages took their crooked course inland sailing masters of yachts off duty sat and yawned at the windows lazy fishermen looked wearily at the weather over their garden gates and superfluous coastguards gathered together in a wooden observatory and leveled useless telescopes at an empty sea the flat open country with its few dwarf trees and its mangy hedges lay prostrate under the sky in all the desolation of solitary space and left the famous restorative air free to build up dilapidated nerves without an object to hinder its passage at any point of the compass the lonely drabcolored road that led to the nearest town offered to visitors taking airings a view of a low brown object in the distance said to be the convent in which the nuns lived secluded from mortal eyes at one side of the hotel the windows looked on a little wooden pier sadly in want of repair on the other side a walled inclosure accommodated yachts of light tonnage stripped of their rigging and sitting solitary on a bank of mud until their owners wanted them in this neighborhood there was a small outlying colony of shops one that sold fruit and fish one that dealt in groceries and tobacco one shut up with a bill in the window inviting a tenant and one behind the methodist chapel answering the double purpose of a postoffice and a storehouse for ropes and coals beyond these objects there was nothing and this was the great charm of the place to distract the attention of invalids following the doctors directions and from morning to night taking care of their health    the time was evening the scene was one of the private sittingrooms in the hotel and the purpose in view was a little teaparty  rich mrs romsey connected with commerce as wife of the chief partner in the firm of romsey  renshaw was staying at the hotel in the interests of her three children they were of delicate constitution their complete recovery after severe illness which had passed from one to the other was less speedy than had been anticipated and the doctor had declared that the nervous system was in each case more or less in need of repair to arrive at this conclusion and to recommend a visit to sandyseal were events which followed each other medically speaking as a matter of course  the health of the children had greatly improved the famous air had agreed with them and the discovery of new playfellows had agreed with them they had made acquaintance with lady myries wellbred boys and with mrs normans charming little kitty the most cordial goodfeeling had established itself among the mothers owing a return for hospitalities received from lady myrie and mrs norman mrs romsey had invited the two ladies to drink tea with her in honor of an interesting domestic event her husband absent on the continent for some time past on business connected with his firm had returned to england and had that evening joined his wife and children at sandyseal  lady myrie had arrived and mr romsey had been presented to her mrs norman expected to follow was represented by a courteous note of apology she was not well that evening and she begged to be excused  this is a great disappointment mrs romsey said to her husband you would have been charmed with mrs normanhighlybred accomplished a perfect lady and she leaves us tomorrow the departure will not be an early one and i shall find an opportunity my dear of introducing you to my friend and her sweet little kitty  mr romsey looked interested for a moment when he first heard mrs normans name after that he slowly stirred his tea and seemed to be thinking instead of listening to his wife  have you made the ladys acquaintance here he inquired  yesand i hope i have made a friend for life mrs romsey said with enthusiasm  and so do i lady myrie added  mr romsey went on with his inquiries  is she a handsome woman  both the ladies answered the question together lady myrie described mrs norman in one dreadful word as classical by comparison with this mrs romseys reply was intelligible not even illness can spoil her beauty  including the headache she has got tonight mr romsey suggested  dont be illnatured dear mrs norman is here by the advice of one of the first physicians in london she has suffered under serious troubles poor thing  mr romsey persisted in being illnatured connected with her husband he asked  lady myrie entered a protest she was a widow and it was notorious among her friends that the death of her husband had been the happiest event in her married life but she understood her duty to herself as a respectable woman  i think mr romsey you might have spared that cruel allusion she said with dignity  mr romsey apologized he had his reasons for wishing to know something more about mrs norman he proposed to withdraw his last remark and to put his inquiries under another form might he ask his wife if anybody had seen mr norman  no  or heard of him  mrs romsey answered in the negative once more and added a question on her own account what did all this mean  it means lady myrie interposed what we poor women are all exposed toscandal she had not yet forgiven mr romseys allusion and she looked at him pointedly as she spoke there are some impenetrable men on whom looks produce no impression mr romsey was one of them he turned to his wife and said quietly what i mean is that i know more of mrs norman than you do i have heard of hernever mind how or where she is a lady who has been celebrated in the newspapers dont be alarmed she is no less a person than the divorced mrs linley  the two ladies looked at each other in blank dismay restrained by a sense of conjugal duty mrs romsey only indulged in an exclamation lady myrie independent of restraint expressed her opinion and said quite impossible  the mrs norman whom i mean mr romsey went on has as i have been told a mother living the old lady has been twice married her name is mrs presty  this settled the question mrs presty was established in her own proper person with her daughter and grandchild at the hotel lady myrie yielded to the force of evidence she lifted her hands in horror this is too dreadful  mrs romsey took a more compassionate view of the disclosure surely the poor lady is to be pitied she gently suggested  lady myrie looked at her friend in astonishment my dear you must have forgotten what the judge said about her surely you read the report of the case in the newspapers  no i heard of the trial and thats all what did the judge say  say lady myrie repeated what did he not say his lordship declared that he had a great mind not to grant the divorce at all he spoke of this dreadful woman who has deceived us in the severest terms he said she had behaved in a most improper manner she had encouraged the abominable governess and if her husband had yielded to temptation it was her fault and more besides that i dont remember  mr romseys wife appealed to him in despair what am i to do she asked helplessly  do nothing was the wise reply didnt you say she was going away tomorrow  thats the worst of it mrs romsey declared her little girl kitty gives a farewell dinner tomorrow to our children and ive promised to take them to say goodby  lady myrie pronounced sentence without hesitation of course your girls mustnt go daughters think of their reputations when they grow up  are you in the same scrape with my wife mr romsey asked  lady myrie corrected his language i have been deceived in the same way she said though my children are boys which perhaps makes a difference i feel it is my duty as a mother not to let them get into bad company i do nothing myself in an underhand way no excuses i shall send a note and tell mrs norman why she doesnt see my boys tomorrow  isnt that a little hard on her said merciful mrs romsey  mr romsey agreed with his wife on grounds of expediency never make a row if you can help it was the peaceable principle to which this gentleman committed himself send word that the children have caught colds and get over it in that way  mrs romsey looked gratefully at her admirable husband just the thing she said with an air of relief  lady myries sense of duty expressed itself with the strictest adherence to the laws of courtesy she rose smiled resignedly and said goodnight  almost at the same moment innocent little kitty astonished her mother and her grandmother by appearing before them in her nightgown after she had been put to bed nearly two hours since  what will this child do next mrs presty exclaimed  kitty told the truth i cant go to sleep grandmamma  why not my darling her mother asked  im so excited mamma  about what kitty  about my dinnerparty tomorrow oh said the child clasping her hands earnestly as she thought of her playfellows i do so hope it will go off well     chapter xxxiv mrs presty   belonging to the generation which has lived to see the age of hurry and has no sympathy with it mrs presty entered the sittingroom at the hotel two hours before the time that had been fixed for leaving sandyseal with her mind at ease on the subject of her luggage my boxes are locked strapped and labeled i hate being hurried whats that youre reading she asked discovering a book on her daughters lap and a hasty action on her daughters part which looked like trying to hide it  mrs norman made the most common andwhere the object is to baffle curiositythe most useless of prevaricating replies when her mother asked her what she was reading she answered nothing  nothing mrs presty repeated with an ironical assumption of interest the work of all others catherine that i most want to read she snatched up the book opened it at the first page and discovered an inscription in faded ink which roused her indignation to dear catherine from herbert on the anniversary of our marriage what unintended mockery in those words read by the later light of the divorce well this is mean said mrs presty keeping that wretchs present after the public exposure which he has forced on you oh catherine  catherine was not quite so patient with her mother as usual keeping my best remembrance of the happy time of my life she answered  misplaced sentiment mrs presty declared i shall put the book out of the way your brain is softening my dear under the influence of this stupefying place  catherine asserted her own opinion against her mothers opinion for the second time i have recovered my health at sandyseal she said i like the place and i am sorry to leave it  give me the shop windows the streets the life the racket and the smoke of london cried mrs presty thank heaven these rooms are let over our heads and out we must go whether we like it or not  this expression of gratitude was followed by a knock at the door and by a voice outside asking leave to come in which was beyond all doubt the voice of randal linley with catherines book still in her possession mrs presty opened the tabledrawer threw it in and closed the drawer with a bang discovering the two ladies randal stopped in the doorway and stared at them in astonishment  didnt you expect to see us mrs presty inquired  i heard you were here from our friend sarrazin randal said but i expected to see captain bennydeck have i mistaken the number surely these are his rooms  catherine attempted to explain they were captain bennydecks rooms she began but he was so kind although we are perfect strangers to him  mrs presty interposed my dear catherine you have not had my advantages you have not been taught to make a complicated statement in few words permit me to seize the points in the late mr prestys style and to put them in the strongest light this place randal is always full and we didnt write long enough beforehand to secure rooms captain bennydeck happened to be downstairs when he heard that we were obliged to go away and that one of us was a lady in delicate health this sweetest of men sent us word that we were welcome to take his rooms and that he would sleep on board his yacht conduct worthy of sir charles grandison himself when i went downstairs to thank him he was goneand here we have been for nearly three weeks sometimes seeing the captains yacht but to our great surprise never seeing the captain himself  theres nothing to be surprised at mrs presty captain bennydeck likes doing kind things and hates being thanked for it i expected him to meet me here today  catherine went to the window he is coming to meet you she said there is his yacht in the bay  and in a dead calm randal added joining her the vessel will not get here before i am obliged to go away again  catherine looked at him timidly do i drive you away she asked in tones that faltered a little  randal wondered what she could possibly be thinking of and acknowledged it in so many words  she is thinking of the divorce mrs presty explained you have heard of it of course and perhaps you take your brothers part  i do nothing of the sort maam my brother has been in the wrong from first to last he turned to catherine i will stay with you as long as i can with the greatest pleasure he said earnestly and kindly the truth is i am on my way to visit some friends and if captain bennydeck had got here in time to see me i must have gone away to the junction to catch the next train westward just as i am going now i had only two words to say to the captain about a person in whom he is interestedand i can say them in this way he wrote in pencil on one of his visiting cards and laid it on the table i shall be back in london in a week he resumed and you will tell me at what address i can find you in the meanwhile i miss kitty where is she  kitty was sent for she entered the room looking unusually quiet and subduedbut discovering randal became herself again in a moment and jumped on his knee  oh uncle randal im so glad to see you she checked herself and looked at her mother may i call him uncle randal she asked or has he changed his name too  mrs presty shook a warning forefinger at her granddaughter and reminded kitty that she had been told not to talk about names randal saw the childs look of bewilderment and felt for her she may talk as she pleases to me he said but not to strangers she understands that i am sure  kitty laid her cheek fondly against her uncles cheek everything is changed she whispered we travel about papa has left us and syd has left us and we have got a new name we are norman now i wish i was grown up and old enough to understand it  randal tried to reconcile her to her own happy ignorance you have got your dear good mother he said and you have got me and you have got your toys  and some nice boys and girls to play with cried kitty eagerly following the new suggestion they are all coming here directly to dine with me you will stay and have dinner too wont you  randal promised to dine with kitty when they met in london before he left the room he pointed to his card on the table let my friend see that message he said as he went out  the moment the door had closed on him mrs presty startled her daughter by taking up the card and looking at what randal had written on it it isnt a letter catherine and you know how superior i am to common prejudices with that defense of her proceeding she coolly read the message   i am sorry to say that i can tell you nothing more of your old friends daughter as yet i can only repeat that she neither needs nor deserves the help that you kindly offer to her   mrs presty laid the card down again and owned that she wished randal had been a little more explicit who can it be she wondered another young hussy gone wrong  kitty turned to her mother with a look of alarm whats a hussy she asked does grandmamma mean me the great hotel clock in the hall struck two and the childs anxieties took a new direction isnt it time my little friends came to see me she said  it was half an hour past the time catherine proposed to send to lady myrie and mrs romsey and inquire if anything had happened to cause the delay as she told kitty to ring the bell the waiter came in with two letters addressed to mrs norman  mrs presty had her own ideas and drew her own conclusions she watched catherine attentively even kitty observed that her mothers face grew paler and paler as she read the letters you look as if you were frightened mamma there was no reply kitty began to feel so uneasy on the subject of her dinner and her guests that she actually ventured on putting a question to her grandmother  will they be long do you think before they come she asked  the old ladys worldly wisdom had passed by this time from a state of suspicion to a state of certainty my child she answered they wont come at all  kitty ran to her mother eager to inquire if what mrs presty had told her could possibly be true before a word had passed her lips she shrank back too frightened to speak  never in her little experience had she been startled by such a look in her mothers face as the look that confronted her now for the first time catherine saw her child trembling at the sight of her before that discovery the emotions that shook her under the insult which she had received lost their hold she caught kitty up in her arms my darling my angel it isnt you i am thinking of i love youi love you in the whole world there isnt such a good child such a sweet lovable pretty child as you are oh how disappointed she looksshes crying dont break my heartdont cry kitty held up her head and cleared her eyes with a dash of her hand i wont cry mamma and child as she was she was as good as her word her mother looked at her and burst into tears  perversely reluctant the better nature that was in mrs presty rose to the surface forced to show itself cry catherine she said kindly it will do you good leave the child to me  with a gentleness that astonished kitty she led her little granddaughter to the window and pointed to the public walk in front of the house i know what will comfort you the wise old woman began look out of the window kitty obeyed  i dont see my little friends coming she said mrs presty still pointed to some object on the public walk thats better than nothing isnt it she persisted come with me to the maid she shall go with you and take care of you kitty whispered may i give mamma a kiss first sensible mrs presty delayed the kiss for a while wait till you come back and then you can tell your mamma what a treat you have had arrived at the door on their way out kitty whispered again i want to say somethingwell what is itwill you tell the donkeyboy to make him gallopill tell the boy he shall have sixpence if you are satisfied and you will see what he does then kitty looked up earnestly in her grandmothers face what a pity it is you are not always like what you are now she said mrs presty actually blushed     chapter xxxv captain bennydeck   for some time catherine and her mother had been left together undisturbed  mrs presty had read and destroyed the letters of lady myrie and mrs romsey with the most unfeigned contempt for the writershad repeated what the judge had really said as distinguished from lady myries malicious version of itand had expressed her intention of giving catherine a word of advice when she was sufficiently composed to profit by it you have recovered your good looks after that fit of crying mrs presty admitted but not your good spirits what is worrying you now  i cant help thinking of poor kitty  my dear the child wants nobodys pity shes blowing away all her troubles by a ride in the fresh air on the favorite donkey that she feeds every morning yes yes you neednt tell me you are in a false position and nobody can deny that its shameful to make the child feel it now listen to me properly understood those two spiteful women have done you a kindness they have as good as told you how to protect yourself in the time to come deceive the vile world catherine as it deserves to be deceived shelter yourself behind a respectable character that will spare you these insults in the future in the energy of her conviction mrs presty struck her fist on the table and finished in three audacious words be a widow  it was plainly saidand yet catherine seemed to be at a loss to understand what her mother meant  dont doubt about it mrs presty went on do it think of kitty if you wont think of yourself in a few years more she will be a young lady she may have an offer of marriage which may be everything we desire suppose her sweethearts family is a religious family and suppose your divorce and the judges remarks on it are discovered what will happen then  is it possible that you are in earnest catherine asked have you seriously thought of the advice that you are giving me setting aside the deceit you know as well as i do that kitty would ask questions do you think i can tell my child that her father is dead a lieand such a dreadful lie as that  nonsense said mrs presty  nonsense catherine repeated indignantly  rank nonsense her mother persisted hasnt your situation forced you to lie already when the child asks why her father and her governess have left us havent you been obliged to invent excuses which are lies if the man who was once your husband isnt as good as dead to you i should like to know what your divorce means my poor dear do you think you can go on as you are going on now how many thousands of people have read the newspaper account of the trial how many hundreds of peopleinterested in a handsome woman like youwill wonder why they never see mr norman what you will go abroad again go where you may you will attract attention you will make an enemy of every ugly woman who looks at you strain at a gnat catherine and swallow a camel its only a question of time sooner or later you will be a widow heres the waiter again what does the man want now  the waiter answered by announcing  captain bennydeck  catherines mother was nearer to the door than catherine she attracted the captains attention first he addressed his apologies to her pray excuse me for disturbing you  mrs presty had an eye for a handsome man irrespective of what his age might be in the language of the conjurors a magic change appeared in her she became brightly agreeable in a moment  oh captain bennydeck you mustnt make excuses for coming into your own room  captain bennydeck went on with his excuses nevertheless the landlady tells me that i have unluckily missed seeing mr randal linley and that he has left a message for me i shouldnt otherwise have ventured  mrs presty stopped him once more the captains claim to the captains rooms was the principle on which she took her stand she revived the irresistible smiles which had conquered mr norman and mr presty no ceremony i beg and pray you are at home heretake the easychair  catherine advanced a few steps it was time to stop her mother if the thing could be done she felt just embarrassment enough to heighten her color and to show her beauty to the greatest advantage it literally staggered the captain the moment he looked at her his customary composure as a wellbred man deserted him he bowed confusedly he had not a word to say mrs presty seized her opportunity and introduced them to each other my daughter mrs normancaptain bennydeck compassionating him under the impression that he was a shy man catherine tried to set him at his ease i am indeed glad to have an opportunity of thanking you she said inviting him by a gesture to be seated in this delightful air i have recovered my health and i owe it to your kindness  the captain regained his selfpossession expressions of gratitude had been addressed to him which in his modest estimate of himself he could not feel that he had deserved  you little know he replied under what interested motives i have acted when i established myself in this hotel i was fairly driven out of my yacht by a guest who went sailing with me  mrs presty became deeply interested dear me what did he do  captain bennydeck answered gravely he snored  catherine was amused mrs presty burst out laughing the captains dry humor asserted itself as quaintly as ever this is no laughing matter he resumed looking at catherine my vessel is a small one for two nights the awful music of my friends nose kept me sleepless when i woke him and said dont snore he apologized in the sweetest manner and began again on the third day i anchored in the bay here determined to get a nights rest on shore a dispute about the price of these rooms offered them to me i sent a note of apology on boardand slept peacefully the next morning my sailing master informed me that there had been what he called a little swell in the night he reported the sounds made by my friend on this occasion to have been the awful sounds of seasickness the gentleman left the yacht sir the first thing this morning he said and hes gone home by railway on the day when you happened to arrive my cabin was my own again and i can honestly thank you for relieving me of my rooms do you make a long stay mrs norman  catherine answered that they were going to london by the next train seeing randals card still unnoticed on the table she handed it to the captain  is mr linley an old friend of yours he asked as he took the card  mrs presty hastened to answer in the affirmative for her daughter it was plain that randal had discreetly abstained from mentioning his true connection with them would he preserve the same silence if the captain spoke of his visit to mrs norman when he and his friend met next mrs prestys mind might have been at ease on that subject if she had known how to appreciate randals character and randals motives the same keen sense of the family disgrace which had led him to conceal from captain bennydeck his brothers illicit relations with sydney westerfield had compelled him to keep secret his former association as brotherinlaw with the divorced wife her change of name had hitherto protected her from discovery by the captain and would in all probability continue to protect her in the future the good bennydeck had been enjoying himself at sea when the divorce was granted and when the newspapers reported the proceedings he rarely went to his club and he never associated with persons of either sex to whom gossip and scandal are as the breath of their lives ignorant of these circumstances and remembering what had happened on that day mrs presty looked at him with some anxiety on her daughters account while he was reading the message on randals card there was little to see his fine face expressed a quiet sorrow and he sighed as he put the card back in his pocket  an interval of silence followed captain bennydeck was thinking over the message which he had just read catherine and her mother were looking at him with the same interest inspired by very different motives the interview so pleasantly begun was in some danger of lapsing into formality and embarrassment when a new personage appeared on the scene  kitty had returned in triumph from her ride mamma the donkey did more than gallophe kicked and i fell off oh im not hurt cried the child seeing the alarm in her mothers face tumbling off is such a funny sensation it isnt as if you fell on the ground its as if the ground came up to you and saidbump she had got as far as that when the progress of her narrative was suspended by the discovery of a strange gentleman in the room  the smile that brightened the captains face when kitty opened the door answered for him as a man who loved children your little girl mrs norman he said  yes  a common question and a common reply nothing worth noticing in either the one or the other at the timeand yet they proved to be important enough to turn catherines life into a new course  in the meanwhile kitty had been whispering to her mother she wanted to know the strange gentlemans name the captain heard her my name is bennydeck he said will you come to me  kitty had heard the name mentioned in connection with a yacht like all children she knew a friend the moment she looked at him ive seen your pretty boat sir she said crossing the room to captain bennydeck is it very nice when you go sailing  if you were not going back to london my dear i should ask your mamma to let me take you sailing with me perhaps we shall have another opportunity  the captains answer delighted kitty oh yes tomorrow or next day she suggested do you know where to find me in london mamma where do i live when i am in london before her mother could answer she hit on a new idea dont tell me ill find it for myself its on grandmammas boxes and theyre in the passage  captain bennydecks eyes followed her as she left the room with an expression of interest which more than confirmed the favorable impression that he had already produced on catherine she was on the point of asking if he was married and had children of his own when kitty came back and declared the right address to be bucks hotel sydenham mamma puts things down for fear of forgetting them she added will you put down buck  the captain took out his pocketbook and appealed pleasantly to mrs norman may i follow your example he asked catherine not only humored the little joke but gratefully remembering his kindness said dont forget when you are in london that kittys invitation is my invitation too at the same moment punctual mrs presty looked at her watch and reminded her daughter that railways were not in the habit of allowing passengers to keep them waiting catherine rose and gave her hand to the captain at parting kitty improved on her mothers form of farewell she gave him a kiss and whispered a little reminder of her own theres a river in londondont forget your boat  captain bennydeck opened the door for them secretly wishing that he could follow mrs norman to the station and travel by the same train  mrs presty made no attempt to remind him that she was still in the room where her family interests were concerned the old lady was capable on very slight encouragement of looking a long way into the future she was looking into the future now the captains social position was all that could be desired he was evidently in easy pecuniary circumstances he admired catherine and catherines child if he only proved to be a single man mrs prestys prophetic soul without waiting an instant to reflect perceived a dazzling future captain bennydeck approached to take leave not just yet pleaded the most agreeable of women my luggage was ready two hours ago sit down again for a few minutes you seem to like my little granddaughter  if i had such a child as that the captain answered i believe i should be the happiest man living  ah my dear sir all isnt gold that glitters mrs presty remarked that proverb must have been originally intended to apply to children may i presume to make you the subject of a guess i fancy you are not a married man  the captain looked a little surprised you are quite right he said i have never been married  at a later period mrs presty owned that she felt an inclination to reward him for confessing himself to be a bachelor by a kiss he innocently checked that impulse by putting a question had you any particular reason he asked for guessing that i was a single man  mrs presty modestly acknowledged that she had only her own experience to help her you wouldnt be quite so fond of other peoples children she said if you were a married man ah your time will come yeti mean your wife will come  he answered this sadly my time has gone by i have never had the opportunities that have been granted to some favored men he thought of the favored man who had married mrs norman was her husband worthy of his happiness is mr norman with you at this place the captain asked  serious issues depended on the manner in which this question was answered for one moment and for one moment only mrs presty hesitated then in her daughters interest of course she put catherine in the position of a widow in the least blamable of all possible ways by honestly owning the truth  there is no mr norman she said  your daughter is a widow cried the captain perfectly unable to control his delight at that discovery  what else should she be mrs presty replied facetiously  what else indeed if no mr norman meant as it must surely mean that mr norman was dead and if the beautiful mother of kitty was an honest woman her social position was beyond a doubt captain bennydeck felt a little ashamed of his own impetuosity before he had made up his mind what to say next the unlucky waiter doomed to be a cause of disturbance on that day appeared again  i beg your pardon maam he said the lady and gentleman who have taken these rooms have just arrived  mrs presty got up in a hurry and cordially shook hands with the captain looking round she took up the railway guide and her knitting left on the table was there anything else left about there was nothing to be seen mrs presty crossed the passage to her daughters bedroom to hurry the packing captain bennydeck went downstairs on his way back to the yacht  in the hall of the hotel he passed the lady and gentlemanand of course noticed the lady she was little and dark and would have been pretty if she had not looked ill and out of spirits what would he have said what would he have done if he had known that those two strangers were randal linleys brother and roderick westerfields daughter     chapter xxxvi    mr and mrs herbert   the stealthy influence of distrust fastens its hold on the mind by slow degrees little by little it reaches its fatal end and disguises delusion successfully under the garb of truth  day after day the false conviction grew on sydneys mind that herbert linley was comparing the life he led now with the happier life which he remembered at mount morven day after day her unreasoning fear contemplated the time when herbert linley would leave her friendless in the world that had no place in it for women like herself delusionfatal delusion that looked like truth morally weak as he might be the man whom she feared to trust had not yet entirely lost the sense which birth and breeding had firmly fastened in himthe sense of honor acting under that influence he was if the expression may be permitted consistent even in inconsistency with equal sincerity of feeling he reproached himself for his infidelity toward the woman whom he had deserted and devoted himself to his duty toward the woman whom he had misled in sydneys presencesuffer as he might under the struggle to maintain his resolution when he was alonehe kept his intercourse with her studiously gentle in manner and considerate in language his conduct offered assurances for the future which she could only see through the falsifying medium of her own distrust  in the delusion that now possessed her she read over and over again the letter which captain bennydeck had addressed to her father she saw more and more clearly the circumstances which associated her situation with the situation of the poor girl who had closed her wasted life among the nuns in a french convent  two results followed on this state of things  when herbert asked to what part of england they should go on leaving london she mentioned sandyseal as a place that she had heard of and felt some curiosity to see the same daybent on pleasing her careless where he lived now at home or abroadhe wrote to engage rooms at the hotel  a time followed during which they were obliged to wait until rooms were free in this interval brooding over the melancholy absence of a friend or relative in whom she could confide her morbid dread of the future decided her on completing the parallel between herself and that other lost creature of whom she had read sydney opened communication anonymously with the benedictine community at sandyseal  she addressed the mother superior telling the truth about herself with but one concealment the concealment of names she revealed her isolated position among her fellowcreatures she declared her fervent desire to repent of her wickedness and to lead a religious life she acknowledged her misfortune in having been brought up by persons careless of religion and she confessed to having attended a protestant place of worship as a mere matter of form connected with the duties of a teacher at a school the religion of any christian woman who will help me to be more like herself she wrote is the religion to which i am willing and eager to belong if i come to you in my distress will you receive me to that simple appeal she added a request that an answer might be addressed to sw postoffice sandyseal  when captain bennydeck and sydney westerfield passed each other as strangers in the hall of the hotel that letter had been posted in london a week since    the servant showed mr and mrs herbert into their sittingroom and begged that they would be so good as to wait for a few minutes while the other rooms were being prepared for them  sydney seated herself in silence she was thinking of her letter and wondering whether a reply was waiting for her at the postoffice  moving toward the window to look at the view herbert paused to examine some prints hanging on the walls which were superior as works of art to the customary decorations of a room at a hotel if he had gone straight to the window he might have seen his divorced wife his child and his wifes mother getting into the carriage which took them to the railway station  come sydney he said and look at the sea  she joined him wearily with a faint smile it was a calm sunny day bathing machines were on the beach children were playing here and there and white sails of pleasure boats were visible in the offing the dullness of sandyseal wore a quiet homely aspect which was pleasant to the eyes of strangers sydney said absently i think i shall like the place and herbert added let us hope that the air will make you feel stronger he meant it and said it kindlybut instead of looking at her while he spoke he continued to look at the view a woman sure of her position would not have allowed this trifling circumstance even if she had observed it to disturb her sydney thought of the day in london when he had persisted in looking out at the street and returned in silence to her chair  had he been so unfortunate as to offend her and in what way as that doubt occurred to herbert his mind turned to catherine she never took offense at trifles a word of kindness from him no matter how unimportant it might be always claimed affectionate acknowledgment in the days when he was living with his wife in another moment he had dismissed that remembrance and could trust himself to return to sydney  if you find that sandyseal confirms your first impression he said let me know it in time so that i may make arrangements for a longer stay i have only taken the rooms here for a fortnight  thank you herbert i think a fortnight will be long enough  long enough for you he asked  her morbid sensitiveness mistook him again she fancied there was an undernote of irony in his tone  long enough for both of us she replied  he drew a chair to her side do you take it for granted he said smiling that i shall get tired of the place first  she shrank poor creature even from his smile there was as she thought something contemptuous in the goodhumor of it  we have been to many places she reminded him and we have got tired of them together  is that my fault  i didnt say it was  he got up and approached the bell i think the journey has a little overtired you he resumed would you like to go to your room  i will go to my room if you wish it  he waited a little and answered her as quietly as ever what i really wish he said is that we had consulted a doctor while we were in london you seem to be very easily irritated of late i observe a change in you which i willingly attribute to the state of your health  she interrupted him what change do you mean  its quite possible i may be mistaken sydney but i have more than once as i think seen something in your manner which suggests that you distrust me  i distrust the evil life we are leading she burst out and i see the end of it coming oh i dont blame you you are kind and considerate you do your best to hide it but you have lived long enough with me to regret the woman whom you have lost you begin to feel the sacrifice you have madeand no wonder say the word herbert and i release you  i will never say the word  she hesitatedfirst inclined then afraid to believe him i have grace enough left in me she went on to feel the bitterest repentance for the wrong that i have done to mrs linley when it ends as it must end in our parting will you ask your wife  even his patience began to fail him he refusedfirmly not angrilyto hear more she is no longer my wife he said  sydneys bitterness and sydneys penitence were mingled as opposite emotions only can be mingled in a womans breast will you ask your wife to forgive you she persisted  after we have been divorced at her petition he pointed to the window as he said it look at the sea if i was drowning out yonder i might as well ask the sea to forgive me  he produced no effect on her she ignored the divorce her passionate remorse asserted itself as obstinately as ever mrs linley is a good woman she insisted mrs linley is a christian woman  i have lost all claim on hereven the claim to remember her virtues he answered sternly no more of it sydney i am sorry i have disappointed you i am sorry if you are weary of me  at those last words her manner changed wound me as cruelly as you please she said humbly i will try to bear it  i wouldnt wound you for the world why do you persist in distressing me why do you feel suspicion of me which i have not deserved he stopped and held out his hand dont let us quarrel sydney which will you do keep your bad opinion of me or give me a fair trial  she loved him dearly she was so youngand the young are so ready to hope still she struggled against herself herbert is it your pity for me that is speaking now  he left her in despair its useless he said sadly nothing will conquer your inveterate distrust  she followed him with a faint cry of entreaty she made him turn to her and held him in a trembling embrace and rested her head on his bosom forgive mebe patient with melove me that was all she could say  he attempted to calm her agitation by speaking lightly at last sydney we are friends again he said  friends all the woman in her recoiled from that insufficient word are we lovers she whispered  yes  with that assurance her anxious heart was content she smiled she looked out at the sea with a new appreciation of the view the air of this place will do me good now she said are my eyes red herbert let me go and bathe them and make myself fit to be seen  she rang the bell the chambermaid answered it ready to show the other rooms she turned round at the door  lets try to make our sittingroom look like home she suggested how dismal how dreadfully like a thing that doesnt belong to us that empty table looks put some of your books and my keepsakes on it while i am away ill bring my work with me when i come back  he had left his travelers bag on a chair when he first came in now that he was alone and under no restraint he sighed as he unlocked the bag home he repeated we have no home poor girl poor unhappy girl let me help her to deceive herself  he opened the bag the little fragile presents which she called her keepsakes had been placed by her own hands in the upper part of the bag so that the books should not weigh on them and had been carefully protected by wrappings of cotton wool taking them out one by one herbert found a delicate china candlestick intended to hold a wax taper broken into two pieces in spite of the care that had been taken to preserve it of no great value in itself old associations made the candlestick precious to sydney it had been broken at the stem and could be easily mended so as to keep the accident concealed consulting the waiter herbert discovered that the fracture could be repaired at the nearest town and that the place would be within reach when he went out for a walk in fear of another disaster if he put it back in the bag he opened a drawer in the table and laid the two fragments carefully inside at the further end in doing this his hand touched something that had been already placed in the drawer he drew it out and found that it was a bookthe same book that mrs presty surely the evil genius of the family again had hidden from randals notice and had forgotten when she left the hotel   herbert instantly recognized the gilding on the cover imitated from a design invented by himself he remembered the inscription and yet he read it again  to dear catherine from herbert on the anniversary of our marriage  the book dropped from his hand on the table as if it had been a new discovery torturing him with a new pain  his wife he persisted in thinking of her as his wife must have occupied the roommight perhaps have been the person whom he had succeeded as a guest at the hotel did she still value his present to her in remembrance of old times no she valued it so little that she had evidently forgotten it perhaps her maid might have included it among the small articles of luggage when they left home or dear little kitty might have put it into one of her mothers trunks in any case there it was now abandoned in the drawer of a table at a hotel  oh he thought bitterly if i could only feel as coldly toward catherine as she feels toward me his resolution had resisted much but this final trial of his selfcontrol was more than he could sustain he dropped into a chairhis pride of manhood recoiled from the contemptible weakness of cryinghe tried to remember that she had divorced him and taken his child from him in vain in vain he burst into tears     chapter xxxvii mrs norman   with a heart lightened by reconciliation not the first reconciliation unhappily with hopes revived and sweet content restored sydneys serenity of mind was not quite unruffled her thoughts were not dwelling on the evil life which she had honestly deplored or on the wronged wife to whom she had been eager to make atonement where is the woman whose sorrows are not thrown into the shade by the bright renewal of love the one anxiety that troubled sydney was caused by remembrance of the letter which she had sent to the convent at sandyseal  as her better mind now viewed it she had doubly injured herbertfirst in distrusting him then by appealing from him to the compassion of strangers  if the reply for which she had rashly asked was waiting for her at that momentif the mercy of the mother superior was ready to comfort and guide herwhat return could she make how could she excuse herself from accepting what was offered in kindly reply to her own petition she had placed herself for all she knew to the contrary between two alternatives of ingratitude equally unendurable equally degrading to feel this was to feel the suspense which to persons of excitable temperament is of all trials the hardest to bear the chambermaid was still in her roomsydney asked if the postoffice was near to the hotel  the woman smiled everything is near us maam in this little place can we send to the postoffice for you  sydney wrote her initials ask if you please for a letter addressed in that way she handed the memorandum to the chambermaid corresponding with her lover under her husbands nose that was how the chambermaid explained it below stairs when the porter remarked that initials looked mysterious  the mother superior had replied sydney trembled as she opened the letter it began kindly  i believe you my child and i am anxious to help you but i cannot correspond with an unknown person if you decide to reveal yourself it is only right to add that i have shown your letter to the reverend father who in temporal as in spiritual things is our counselor and guide to him i must refer you in the first instance his wisdom will decide the serious question of receiving you into our holy church and will discover in due time if you have a true vocation to a religious life with the fathers sanction you may be sure of my affectionate desire to serve you  sydney put the letter back in the envelope feeling gratefully toward the mother superior but determined by the conditions imposed on her to make no further advance toward the benedictine community  even if her motive in writing to the convent had remained unchallenged the allusions to the priest would still have decided her on taking this step the bare idea of opening her inmost heart and telling her saddest secrets to a man and that man a stranger was too repellent to be entertained for a moment in a few lines of reply gratefully and respectfully written she thanked the mother superior and withdrew from the correspondence  the letter having been closed and posted in the hotel box she returned to the sittingroom free from the one doubt that had troubled her eager to show herbert how truly she believed in him how hopefully she looked to the future  with a happy smile on her lips she opened the door she was on the point of asking him playfully if he had felt surprised at her long absencewhen the sight that met her eyes turned her cold with terror in an instant  his arms were stretched out on the table his head was laid on them despair confessed itself in his attitude grief spoke in the deep sobbing breaths that shook him love and compassion restored sydneys courage she advanced to raise him in her armsand stopped once more the book on the table caught her eye he was still unconscious of her presence she ventured to open it she read the inscriptionlooked at himlooked back at the writingand knew the truth at last  the rigor of the torture that she suffered paralyzed all outward expression of pain quietly she put the book back on the table quietly she touched him and called him by his name  he started and looked up he made an attempt to speak to her in his customary tone i didnt hear you come in he said  she pointed to the book without the slightest change in her face or her manner  i have read the inscription to your wife she answered i have seen you while you thought you were alone the mercy which has so long kept the truth from me is mercy wasted now your bonds are broken herbert you are a free man  he affected not to have understood her she let him try to persuade her of it and made no reply he declared honestly declared that what she had said distressed him she listened in submissive silence he took her hand and kissed it she let him kiss it and let him drop it at her side she frightened him he began to fear for her reason there was silencelong horrid hopeless silence  she had left the door of the room open one of the servants of the hotel appeared outside in the passage he spoke to some person behind him perhaps the book has been left in here he suggested a gentle voice answered i hope the lady and gentleman will excuse me if i ask leave to look for my book she stepped into the room to make her apologies  herbert linley and sydney westerfield looked at the woman whom they had outraged the woman whom they had outraged paused and looked back at them  the hotel servant was surprised at their not speaking to each other he was a stupid man he thought the gentlefolks were strangely unlike gentlefolks in general they seemed not to know what to say herbert happened to be standing nearest to him he felt that it would be civil to the gentleman to offer a word of explanation  the lady had these rooms sir she has come back from the station to look for a book that has been left behind  herbert signed to him to go as the man turned to obey he drew back sydney had moved to the door before him to leave the room herbert refused to permit it stay here he said to her gently this room is yours  sydney hesitated herbert addressed her again he pointed to his divorced wife you see how that lady is looking at you he said i beg that you will not submit to insult from anybody  sydney obeyed him she returned to the room  catherines voice was heard for the first time she addressed herself to sydney with a quiet dignityfar removed from anger further removed still from contempt  you were about to leave the room she said i noticeas an act of justice to youthat my presence arouses some sense of shame  herbert turned to sydney trying to recover herself she stood near the table give me the book he said the sooner this comes to an end the better for her the better for us sydney gave him the book with a visible effort he matched catherines selfcontrol after all she had remembered his gift he offered the book to her  she still kept her eyes fixed on sydneystill spoke to sydney  tell him she said that i refuse to receive the book  sydney attempted to obey at the first words she uttered herbert checked her once more  i have begged you already not to submit to insult he turned to catherine the book is yours madam why do you refuse to take it  she looked at him for the first time a proud sense of wrong flashed at him its keenly felt indignation in her first glance your hands and her hands have touched it she answered i leave it to you and to her  those words stung him contempt he said is bitter indeed on your lips  do you presume to resent my contempt  i forbid you to insult miss westerfield with that reply he turned to sydney you shall not suffer while i can prevent it he said tenderly and approached to put his arm round her she looked at catherine and drew back from his embrace gently repelling him by a gesture  catherine felt and respected the true delicacy the true penitence expressed in that action she advanced to sydney miss westerfield she said i will take the bookfrom you  sydney gave back the book without a word in her position silence was the truest gratitude quietly and firmly catherine removed the blank leaf on which herbert had written and laid it before him on the table i return your inscription it means nothing now those words were steadily pronounced not the slightest appearance of temper accompanied them she moved slowly to the door and looked back at sydney make some allowance for what i have suffered she said gently if i have wounded you i regret it the faint sound of her dress on the carpet was heard in the perfect stillness and lost again they saw her no more  herbert approached sydney it was a moment when he was bound to assure her of his sympathy he felt for her in his inmost heart he felt for her as he drew nearer he saw tears in her eyes but they seemed to have risen without her knowledge hardly conscious of his presence she stood before himlost in thought  he endeavored to rouse her did i protect you from insult he asked  she said absently yes  will you do as i do dear will you try to forget  she said i will try to atone and moved toward the door of her room the reply surprised him but it was no time then to ask for an explanation  would you like to lie down sydney and rest  yes  she took his arm he led her to the door of her room is there anything else i can do for you he asked  nothing thank you  she closed the doorand abruptly opened it again one thing more she said kiss me  he kissed her tenderly returning to the sittingroom he looked back across the passage her door was shut  his head was heavy his mind felt confused he threw himself on the sofautterly exhausted by the ordeal through which he had passed in grief in fear in pain the time still comes when nature claims her rights the wretched wornout man fell into a restless sleep he was awakened by the waiter laying the cloth for dinner its just ready sir the servant announced shall i knock at the ladys door  herbert got up and went to her room  he entered softly fearing to disturb her if she too had slept no sign of her was to be seen she had evidently not rested on her bed a morsel of paper lay on the smooth coverlet there was only a line written on it you may yet be happyand it may perhaps be my doing  he stood looking at that last line of her writing in the empty room his despair and his submission spoke in the only words that escaped him  i have deserved it     fifth book    chapter xxxviii hear the lawyer   mr herbert linley i ask permission to reply to your inquiries in writing because it is quite likely that some of the opinions you will find here might offend you if i expressed them personally i can relieve your anxiety on the subject of miss sydney westerfield but i must be allowed to do so in my own waywithout any other restraints than those which i think it becoming to an honorable man to impose on himself  you are quite right in supposing that miss westerfield had heard me spoken of at mount morven as the agent and legal adviser of the lady who was formerly your wife what purpose led her to apply to me under these circumstances you will presently discover as to the means by which she found her way to my office i may remind you that any directory would give her the necessary information  miss westerfields object was to tell me in the first place that her guilty life with you was at an end she has left your protectionnot to return to it i was sorry to see though she tried to hide it from me how keenly she felt the parting you have been dearly loved by two sweet women and they have thrown their hearts away on youas women will  having explained the circumstances so far miss westerfield next mentioned the motive which had brought her to my office she asked if i would inform her of mrs normans address  this request i confess astonished me  to my mind she was of all persons the last who ought to contemplate communicating in any way with mrs norman i say this to you but i refrained from saying it to her what i did venture to do was to ask for her reasons she answered that they were reasons which would embarrass her if she communicated them to a stranger  after this reply i declined to give her the information she wanted  not unprepared as it appeared to me for my refusal she asked next if i was willing to tell her where she might find your brother mr randal linley in this case i was glad to comply with her request she could address herself to no person worthier to advise her than your brother in giving her his address in london i told her that he was absent on a visit to some friends and that he was expected to return in a weeks time  she thanked me and rose to go  i confess i was interested in her perhaps i thought of the time when she might have been as dear to her father as my own daughters are to me i asked if her parents were living they were dead my next question was have you any friends in london she answered i have no friends it was said with a resignation so very sad in so young a creature that i was really distressed i ran the risk of offending herand asked if she felt any embarrassment in respect of money she said i have some small savings from my salary when i was a governess the change in her tone told me that she was alluding to the time of her residence at mount morven it was impossible to look at this friendless girl and not feel some anxiety about the lodging which she might have chosen in such a place as london she had fortunately come to me from the railway and had not thought yet of where she was to live at last i was able to be of some use to her my senior clerk took care of miss westerfield and left her among respectable people in whose house she could live cheaply and safely where that house is i refuse for her sake to tell you she shall not be disturbed  after a week had passed i received a visit from my good friend randal linley  he had on that day seen miss westerfield she had said to him what she had said to me and had repeated the request which i thought it unwise to grant owning to your brother however the motives which she had refused to confide to me he was so strongly impressed by the sacrifice of herself which this penitent woman had made that he was at first disposed to trust her with mrs normans address  reflection however convinced him that her motives pure and disinterested as they undoubtedly were did not justify him in letting her expose herself to the consequences which might follow the proposed interview all that he engaged to do was to repeat to mrs norman what miss westerfield had said and to inform the young lady of the result  in the intervals of business i had felt some uneasiness when i thought of miss westerfields prospects your good brother at once set all anxiety on this subject at rest  he proposed to place miss westerfield under the care of an old and dear friend of her late fathercaptain bennydeck her voluntary separation from you offered to your brother and to the captain the opportunity for which they had both been waiting captain bennydeck was then cruising at sea in his yacht immediately on his return miss westerfields inclination would be consulted and she would no doubt eagerly embrace the opportunity of being introduced to her fathers friend  i have now communicated all that i know in reply to the questions which you have addressed to me let me earnestly advise you to make the one reparation to this poor girl which is in your power resign yourself to a separation which is not only for her good but for yourssamuel sarrazin     chapter xxxix listen to reason   not having heard from captain bennydeck for some little time randal thought it desirable in sydneys interests to make inquiries at his club nothing was known of the captains movements there on the chance of getting the information that he wanted randal wrote to the hotel at sandyseal  the landlords reply a little surprised him  some days since the yacht had again appeared in the bay captain bennydeck had landed to all appearance in fairly good health and had left by an early train for london the sailingmaster announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her portwith no other explanation than that the cruise was over this alternative in the captains plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal he called at his friends private residence only to hear from the servants that they had seen nothing of their master randal waited a while in london on the chance that bennydeck might pay him a visit  during this interval his patience was rewarded in an unexpected manner he discovered the captains address by means of a letter from catherine dated bucks hotel sydenham having gently reproached him for not writing to her or calling on her she invited him to dinner at the hotel her letter concluded in these words you will only meet one person besides ourselvesyour friend and since we last met our friend too captain bennydeck has got tired of the sea he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sydenham and he finds that it agrees with him  these lines set randal thinking seriously  to represent bennydeck as being tired of the sea and as being willing to try in place of the breezy channel the air of a suburb of london was to make excuses too perfectly futile and absurd to deceive any one who knew the captain in spite of the appearance of innocence which pervaded catherines letter the true motive for breaking off his cruise might be found as randal concluded in catherine herself her residence at the seaside helped by the lapse of time had restored to her personal attractions almost all they had lost under the deteriorating influences of care and grief and her change of name must have protected her from a discovery of the divorce which would have shocked a man so sincerely religious as bennydeck had her beauty fascinated him was she aware of the interest that he felt in her and was it secretly understood and returned randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to question catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview  in the short time that passed before the day of the dinner distressing circumstances strengthened his resolution after months of separation he received a visit from herbert  was this manhaggard pallid shabby looking at him piteously with bloodshot eyesthe handsome pleasant prosperous brother whom he remembered randal was so grieved that he was for a moment unable to utter a word he could only point to a seat herbert dropped into the chair as if he was reduced to the last extremity of fatigue and yet he spoke roughly he looked like an angry man brought to bay  i seem to frighten you he said  you distress me herbert more than words can say  give me a glass of wine ive been walkingi dont know where a long distance im dead beat  he drank the wine greedily whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner in a man morally weak calamity suffered without resisting power breaks its way through the surface which exhibits a gentleman and shows the naked nature which claims kindred with our ancestor the savage  do you feel better herbert  he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brothers question randal he said you know where sydney is  randal admitted it  give me her address my minds in such a state i cant remember it write it down  no herbert  you wont write it and you wont give it  i will do neither the one nor the other go back to your chair fierce looks and clinched fists dont frighten me miss westerfield is quite right in separating herself from you and you are quite wrong in wishing to go back to her there are my reasons try to understand them and once again sit down  he spoke sternlywith his heart aching for his brother all the time he was right the one way is the positive way when a man who suffers trouble is degraded by it  the poor wretch sank under randals firm voice and steady eye  dont be hard on me he said i think a man in my situation is to be pitiedespecially by his brother im not like you im not accustomed to live alone ive been accustomed to having a kind woman to talk to me and take care of me you dont know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the roomthinking so much of you and so little of herselfand then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark i havent got my wife she has thrown me over and taken my child away from me and now sydneys taken away from me next im alone do you hear that alone take the poker there out of the fireplace give me back sydney or knock out my brains i havent courage enough to do it for myself oh why did i engage that governess i was so happy randal with catherine and little kitty  he laid his head wearily on the back of his chair randal offered him more wine he refused it  im afraid he said wine maddens me if i take too much of it you have heard of men forgetting their sorrows in drink i tried it yesterday it set my brains on fire im feeling that glass i took just now no im not faint it eases my head when i rest like this shake hands randal we have never had any unfriendly words we mustnt begin now theres something perverse about me i didnt know how fond i was of sydney till i lost her i didnt know how fond i was of my wife till i left her he paused and put his hand to his fevered head was his mind wandering into some other train of thought he astonished his brother by a new entreatythe last imaginable entreaty that randal expected to hear dear old fellow i want you to do me a favor tell me where my wife is living now  surely randal answered you know that she is no longer your wife  never mind that i have something to say to her  you cant do it  can you do it will you give her a message  let me hear what it is first  herbert lifted his head and laid his hand earnestly on his brothers arm when he said his next words he was almost like his old self again  say that im lonely say that im dying for want of a little comfortask her to let me see kitty  his tone touched randal to the quick i feel for you herbert he said warmly she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done  as soon as possible  yesas soon as possible  and you wont forget no no of course you wont forget he tried to rise and fell back again into his chair let me rest a little he pleaded if im not in the way im not fit company for you i know ill go when you tell me  randal refused to let him go at all you will stay here with me and if i happen to be away there will be somebody in the house who is almost as fond of you as i am he mentioned the name of one of the old servants at mount morven who had attached himself to randal after the breakup of the family and now rest he said and let me put this cushion under your head  herbert answered its like being at home againand composed himself to rest    chapter xl keep your temper   on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for sydenham so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner his prospects of success in pleading for a favorable reception of his brothers message were so uncertain that he refrainedin fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justifyfrom taking herbert into his confidence no one knew on what errand he was bent when he left the house as he took his place in the carriage the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual the new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published randal bought it  after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived at the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence caring nothing for that sort of news he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye he read the paragraph in which it appeared   the charming widow mrs norman is we hear among the distinguished guests staying at bucks hotel it is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of arctic fame now better known perhaps as one of our leading philanthropists  the allusion to bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph the charming widow was it possible that this last word referred to catherine to suppose her capable of assuming to be a widow andif the child asked questionsof telling kitty that her father was dead was in randals estimation to wrong her cruelly with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger  a first disappointment was in store for him when he entered the house mrs norman and her little daughter were out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner mrs presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel  randal found her comfortably established in a summerhouse with her knitting in her hands and a newspaper on her lap she advanced to meet him all smiles and amiability how nice of you to come so soon she began her keen penetration discovered something in his face which checked the gayety of her welcome you dont mean to say that you are going to spoil our pleasant little dinner by bringing bad news she added looking at him suspiciously  it depends on you to decide that randal replied  how very complimentary to a poor useless old woman dont be mysterious my dear i dont belong to the generation which raises storms in teacups and calls skirmishes with savages battles out with it  randal handed his paper to her open at the right place there is my news he said  mrs presty looked at the paragraph and handed her newspaper to randal  i am indeed sorry to spoil your dramatic effect she said but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behind you at sydenham in the matter of news the report is premature my good friend but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether a report is true or false how much gossip would society get in its favorite newspapers besides if it isnt true now it will be true next week the author only says its whispered how delicate of him what a perfect gentleman  am i really to understand mrs presty that catherine  you are to understand that catherine is a widow i say it with pride a widow of my making  if this is one of your jokes maam  nothing of the sort sir  are you aware mrs presty that my brother  oh dont talk of your brother hes an obstacle in our way and we have been compelled to get rid of him  randal drew back a step mrs prestys audacity was something more than he could understand is this woman mad he said to himself  sit down said mrs presty if you are determined to make a serious business of itif you insist on my justifying myselfyou are to be pitied for not possessing a sense of humor but you shall have your own way i am put on my defense very well you shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandyseal after you left us  having related the circumstances she suggested that randal should put himself in catherines place before he ventured on expressing an opinion would you have exposed yourself to be humiliated again in the same way she asked and would you have seen your child made to suffer as well as yourself  i should have kept in retirement for the future he answered and not have trusted my child and myself among strangers in hotels  ah indeed and you would have condemned your poor little daughter to solitude you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her i wonder what you would have done when captain bennydeck paid us a visit at the seaside he was introduced to mrs norman and to mrs normans little girl and we were all charmed with him when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be if he had asked you about mr norman how would you have answered him  i should have told the truth  you would have said there was no mr norman  yes  exactly what i did and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that mrs norman was a widow if i had set him right what would have become of my daughters reputation if i had told the truth at this hotel when everybody wanted to know what mrs norman that handsome lady waswhat would the consequences have been to catherine and her little girl no no i have made the best of a miserable situation i have consulted the tranquillity of a cruelly injured woman and an innocent childwith this inevitable result i have been obliged to treat your brother like a character in a novel i have shipwrecked herbert as the shortest way of answering inconvenient questions vessel found bottom upward in the middle of the atlantic and everybody on board drowned of course worse stories have been printed i do assure you worse stories have been printed  randal decided on leaving her have you done all this with catherines consent he asked as he got up from his chair  catherine submits to circumstances like a sensible woman  does she submit to your telling kitty that her father is dead  for the first time mrs presty became serious  wait a minute she answered before i consented to answer the childs inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother i said will you let kitty see her father again  the very question which randal had promised to ask in his brothers interests and how did catherine answer you he inquired  honestly she said i darent after that i had her mothers authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again she asked directly if her father was dead  that will do mrs presty your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects  say thoroughly worthy of the course forced upon me and my daughter by your brothers infamous conductand you will be nearer the mark  randal passed this over without notice be so good he said as to tell catherine that i try to make every possible allowance for her but that i cannot consent to sit at her dinnertable and that i dare not face my poor little niece after what i have heard  mrs presty recovered all her audacity a very wise decision she remarked your sour face would spoil the best dinner that ever was put on the table have you any message for captain bennydeck  randal asked if his friend was then at the hotel  mrs presty smiled significantly not at the hotel just now  where is he  where he is every day about this timeout driving with catherine and kitty  it was a relief to randalin the present state of catherines relations toward bennydeckto return to london without having seen his friend  he took leave of mrs presty with the formality due to a strangerhe merely bowed that incorrigible old woman treated him with affectionate familiarity in return  goodby dear randal one moment before you go will it be of any use if we invite you to the marriage  arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in he stood looking absently at the passengers leaving the carriage on the opposite side of the platform suddenly a voice that he knew was audible asking the way to bucks hotel he crossed the line in an instant and found himself face to face with herbert     chapter xli make the best of it   for a moment the two men looked at each other without speaking herberts wondering eyes accurately reflected his brothers astonishment  what are you doing here he asked suspicion overclouded his face as he put the question you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine  randal could deny that he had seen catherine with perfect truthand did deny it in the plainest terms herbert was satisfied in all my remembrance of you he said you have never told me a lie we have both seen the same newspaper of courseand you have been the first to clear the thing up thats it isnt it  i wonder who this other mrs norman is did you find out  no  shes not catherine at any rate i for one shall go home with a lighter heart he took his brothers arm to return to the other platform do you know randal i was almost afraid that catherine was the woman the devil take the thing and the people who write in it  he snatched a newspaper out of his pocket as he spoketore it in halfand threw it away malcolm meant well poor fellow he said referring to the old servant but he made a miserable man of me for all that  not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print and wants more of it than any one editor can supply randal picked up the torn newspaper it was not the newspaper which he had bought at the station herbert had been reading a rival journal devoted to the interests of societyin which the report of mrs normans marriage was repeated with this difference that it boldly alluded to captain bennydeck by name did malcolm give you this randal asked  yes he and the servant next door subscribe to take it in and malcolm thought it might amuse me it drove me out of the house and into the railway if it had driven me out of mind i shouldnt have been surprised  gently herbert supposing the report had been true  after what you have told me why should i suppose anything of the sort  dont be angry and do pray remember that the divorce allows you and catherine to marry again if you like  herbert became more unreasonable than ever if catherine does think of marrying again he said the man will have to reckon first with me but that is not the point you seem to have forgotten that the woman at bucks hotel is described as a widow the bare doubt that my divorced wife might be the woman was bad enoughbut what i wanted to find out was how she had passed off her false pretense on our child that was what maddened me no more of it now have you seen catherine lately  not lately  i suppose she is as handsome as ever when will you ask her to let me see kitty  leave that to me was the one reply which randal could venture to make at the moment  the serious embarrassments that surrounded him were thickening fast his natural frank nature urged him to undeceive herbert if he followed his inclinations in the near neighborhood of the hotel who could say what disasters might not ensue in his brothers present frame of mind if he made the disclosure on their return to the house he would be only running the same risk of consequences after an interval of delay and if he remained silent the march of events might at any moment lead to the discovery of what he had concealed add to this that his confidence in catherine had been rudely shaken having allowed herself to be entrapped into the deception proposed by her mother and having thus far persevered in that deception were the chances in favor of her revealing her true positionespecially if she was disposed to encourage bennydecks suit randals loyalty to catherine hesitated to decide that serious question against the woman whom he had known trusted and admired for so many years in any event her second marriage would lead to one disastrous result it would sooner or later come to herberts ears in the meantime after what mrs presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kittys natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child  if randal shrank from the prospect which thus presented itself to him in his relations with his brother and if his thoughts reverted to sydney westerfield other reasons for apprehension found their way into his mind  he had promised to do his best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney an interview to perform that promise appeared to be now simply impossible under the exasperating influence of a disappointment for which she was not prepared it was hard to say what act of imprudence sydney might not commit even the chance of successfully confiding her to bennydecks protection had lost something of its fair promise since randals visit to sydenham that the captain would welcome his friends daughter as affectionately as if she had been his own child was not to be doubted for a moment but that she would receive the same unremitting attention while he was courting catherine which would have been offered to her under other circumstances was not to be hoped be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now he decided on hastening sydneys introduction to bennydeck and on writing at once to prepare the captain for that event  even this apparently simple proceeding required examination in its different bearings before he could begin his letter  would he be justified in alluding to the report which associated bennydeck with catherine considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend it was for the captain to confirm what mrs presty had said of him if he thought it desirable to touch on the subject in his reply besides looking to catherines interestand not forgetting how she had sufferedhad randal any right to regard with other than friendly feelings a second marriage which united her to a man morally and intellectually the superior of her first husband what happier future could await herespecially if she justified randals past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her characterthan to become his friends wife  written under the modifying influence of these conclusions his letter contained the few words that follow  i have news for you which i am sure you will be glad to hear your old friends daughter has abandoned her sinful way of life and has made sacrifices which prove the sincerity of her repentance without entering into particulars which may be mercifully dismissed from notice let me only assure you that i answer for sydney westerfield as being worthy of the fatherly interest which you feel in her shall i say that she may expect an early visit from you when i see her tomorrow i dont doubt that i am free already to do this but it will encourage the poor girl if i can speak with your authority  he added sydneys address in a postscript and dispatched his letter that evening    on the afternoon of the next day two letters were delivered to randal bearing the sydenham postmark  the first which he happened to take up was addressed to him in mrs prestys handwriting his opinion of this correspondent was expressed in prompt actionhe threw the letter unopened into the wastepaper basket  the next letter was from bennydeck written in the kindest terms but containing no allusion to any contemplated change in his life he would not be able he wrote to leave sydenham for a day or two no explanation of the cause of this delay followed but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captains proposals were still waiting for catherines reply  randal put the letter in his pocket and went at once to sydneys lodgings     chapter xlii try to excuse her   the weather had been unusually warm of all oppressive summers a hot summer in london is the hardest to endure the little exercise that sydney could take was as randal knew deferred until the evening on asking for her he was surprised to hear that she had gone out  is she walking he asked on a day such as this  no she was too much overcome by the heat to be able to walk the landladys boy had been sent to fetch a cab and he had heard miss westerfield tell the driver to go to lincolns inn fields  the address at once reminded randal of mr sarrazin on the chance of making a discovery he went to the lawyers office it had struck him as being just possible that sydney might have called there for the second time and on making inquiry he found that his surmise was correct miss westerfield had called and had gone away again more than an hour since  having mentioned this circumstance good mr sarrazin rather abruptly changed the subject  he began to talk of the weather and like everybody else he complained of the heat receiving no encouragement so far he selected politics as his next topic randal was unapproachably indifferent to the state of parties and the urgent necessity for reform still bent as it seemed on preventing his visitor from taking a leading part in the conversation mr sarrazin tried the exercise of hospitality next he opened his cigarcase and entered eagerly into the merits of his cigars he proposed a cool drink and described the right method of making it as distinguished from the wrong randal was not thirsty and was not inclined to smoke would the pertinacious lawyer give way at last in appearance at least he submitted to defeat you want something of me my friend he said with a patient smile what is it  i want to know why miss westerfield called on you  randal flattered himself that he had made a prevaricating reply simply impossible nothing of the sort mr sarrazin slipped through his fingers once more the unwritten laws of gallantry afforded him a refuge now  the most inviolate respect he solemnly declared is due to a ladys confidenceand what is more to a young ladys confidenceand what is more yet to a pretty young ladys confidence the sex my dear fellow must i recall your attention to what is due to the sex  this little outbreak of the foreign side of his friends character was no novelty to randal he remained as indifferent to the inviolate claims of the sex as if he had been an old man of ninety  did miss westerfield say anything about me was his next question  slippery mr sarrazin slid into another refuge he entered a protest  here is a change of persons and places he exclaimed am i a witness of the court of justiceand are you the lawyer who examines me my memory is defective my learned friend non mi ricordo i know nothing about it  randal changed his tone we have amused ourselves long enough he said i have serious reasons sarrazin for wishing to know what passed between miss westerfield and youand i trust my old friend to relieve my anxiety  the lawyer was accustomed to say of himself that he never did things by halves his answer to randal offered a proof of his accurate estimate of his own character  your old friend will deserve your confidence in him he answered you want to know why miss westerfield called here her object in view was to twist me round her fingerand i beg to inform you that she has completely succeeded my dear randal this pretty creatures cunning is remarkable even for a woman i am an old lawyer skilled in the ways of the worldand a young girl has completely overreached me she askedoh heavens how innocentlyif mrs norman was likely to make a long stay at her present place of residence  randal interrupted him you dont mean to tell me you have given her catherines address  bucks hotel sydenham mr sarrazin answered she has got the address down in her nice little pocketbook  what amazing weakness randal exclaimed  mr sarrazin cordially agreed with him amazing weakness as you say pretty miss sydney has extracted more things besides the address she knows that mrs norman is here on business relating to new investments of her money she knows besides that one of the trustees is keeping us waiting she also made sensible remarks she mentioned having heard mrs norman say that the air of london never agreed with her and she hoped that a comparatively healthy neighborhood had been chosen for mrs normans place of residence this you see was leading up to the discovery of the address the spirit of mischief possessed me i allowed miss westerfield to take a little peep at the truth mrs norman is not actually in london i said she is only in the neighborhood for what followed on this my experience of ladies ought to have prepared me i am ashamed to say this lady took me completely by surprise  what did she do  fell on her knees poor dearand said oh mr sarrazin be kinder to me than you have ever been yet tell me where mrs norman isi put her back in her chair and i took her handkerchief out of her pocket and i wiped her eyes  and then you told her the address  i was near it but i didnt do it yet i asked what you had done in the matter alas your kind heart has led you to promise more than you could perform she had waited to hear from you if mrs norman consented to see her and had waited in vain hard on her wasnt it i was sorry but i was still obdurate i only felt the symptoms which warned me that i was going to make a fool of myself when she let me into her secret for the first time and said plainly what she wanted with mrs norman her tears and her entreaties i had resisted the confession of her motives overpowered me it is right cried mr sarrazin suddenly warming into enthusiasm that these two women should meet remember how that poor girl has proved that her repentance is no sham i say she has a right to tell and the lady whom she has injured has a right to hear what she has done to atone for the past what confession she is willing to make to the one woman in the world though she is a divorced woman who is most interested in hearing what miss westerfields life has been with that wretched brother of yours ah yes i know what the english cant might say away with the english cant it is the worst obstacle to the progress of the english nation  randal listened absently he was thinking  there could be little doubt to what destination sydney westerfield had betaken herself when she left the lawyers office at that moment perhaps she and catherine were togetherand together alone  mr sarrazin had noticed his friends silence is it possible you dont agree with me he asked  i dont feel as hopefully as you do if these two ladies meet  ah my friend you are not a sanguine man by nature if mrs norman treats our poor sydney just as a commonplace illtempered woman would treat her i shall be surprised indeed say if you like that she will be insultedof this i am sure she will not return it there is no expiation that is too bitter to be endured by that resolute little creature her fine nature has been tempered by adversity a hard life has been sydneys depend upon it in the years before you and i met with her good heavens what would my wife say if she heard me the women are nice but they have their drawbacks let us wait till tomorrow my dear boy and let us believe in sydney without allowing our wivesi beg your pardon i mean my wifeto suspect in what forbidden directions our sympathies are leading us oh for shame  who could persist in feeling depressed in the company of such a man as this randal went home with the influence of mr sarrazins sanguine nature in undisturbed possession of him until his old servants gloomy face confronted him at the door  anything gone wrong malcolm  im sorry to say sir mr herbert has left us  left us why  i dont know sir  where has he gone  he didnt tell me  is there no letter no message  theres a message sir mr herbert came back  stop where had he been when he came back  he said he felt a little lonely after you went out and he thought it might cheer him up if he went to the club i was to tell you where he had gone if you asked what had become of him he said it kindly and pleasantlyquite like himself sir but when he came backif youll excuse my saying soi never saw a man in a worse temper tell my brother i am obliged to him for his hospitality and i wont take advantage of it any longer that was mr herberts message i tried to say a word he banged the door and away he went  even randals patient and gentle nature rose in revolt against his brothers treatment of him he entered his sittingroom in silence malcolm followed and pointed to a letter on the table i think you must have thrown it away by mistake sir the old man explained i found it in the wastepaper basket he bowed with the unfailing respect of the old school and withdrew  randals first resolve was to dismiss his brother from further consideration kindness is thrown away on herbert he thought i shall treat him for the future as he has treated me  but his brother was still in his mind he opened mrs prestys letteron the chance that it might turn the current of his thoughts in a new direction  in spite of mrs presty in spite of himself his heart softened toward the man who had behaved so badly to him instead of reading the letter he was now trying to discover a connection between his brothers visit to the club and his brothers angry message had herbert heard something said among gossiping members in the smokingroom which might account for his conduct if randal had belonged to the club he would have gone there to make inquiries how could he get the information that he wanted in some other way  after considering it for a while he remembered the dinner that he had given to his friend sarrazin on his return from the united states and the departure of the lawyer to his club with a purpose in view which interested them both it was the same club to which herbert belonged randal wrote at once to mr sarrazin mentioning what had happened and acknowledging the anxiety that weighed on his mind  having instructed malcolm to take the letter to the lawyers house and if he was not at home to inquire where he might be found randal adopted the readiest means of composing himself in the servants absence by lighting his pipe  he was enveloped in clouds of tobaccosmokethe only clouds which we can trust never to prove unworthy of our confidence in themwhen mrs prestys letter caught his attention if the month had been january instead of july he would have thrown it into the fire under present circumstances he took it up and read it    i bear no malice dear randal and i write to you as affectionately as if you had kept your temper on the occasion when we last met  you will be pleased to hear that catherine was as thoroughly distressed as you could wish her to be when it became my disagreeable duty to mention what had passed between us by way of accounting for your absence she was quite unable to rally her spirits even with dear captain bennydeck present to encourage her  i am not receiving you as i ought she said to him when we began dinner but there is perhaps some excuse for me i have lost the regard and esteem of an old friend who has cruelly wronged me from motives of delicacy which i dont expect you to understand she refrained from mentioning your name the prettiest answer that i ever heard was the answer that the captain returned let the true friend he said take the place in your heart which the false friend has lost  he kissed her hand if you had seen how he did it and how she looked at him you would have felt that you had done more toward persuading my daughter to marry the captain than any other person about her myself included you had deserted her you had thrown her back on the one true friend left thank you randal in our best interests thank you  it is needless to add that i got out of the way and took kitty with me at the earliest opportunityand left them by themselves  at bedtime i went into catherines room our interview began and ended in less than a minute it was useless to ask if the captain had proposed marriage her agitation sufficiently informed me of what had happened my one question was dearest catherine have you said yes she turned shockingly pale and answered i have not said no could anything be more encouraging god bless you we shall meet at the wedding    randal laid down the letter and filled his pipe again he was not in the least exasperated he was only anxious to hear from mr sarrazin if mrs presty had seen him at that moment she would have said to herself i forgot the wretch was a smoker  in half an hour more the door was opened by malcolm and mr sarrazin in person answered his friend  there are no such incorrigible gossips he said as men in the smokingroom of a club those popular newspapers began the mischief and the editor of one of them completed it how he got his information i am not able to say the smalltalk turned on that report about the charming widow and the editor congratulated himself on the delicacy of his conduct when the paragraph reached me he said the writer mentioned that mrs norman was that wellknown lady the divorced mrs herbert linley i thought this rather too bad and i cut it out your brother appears to have been presentbut he seldom goes to the club and none of the members knew him even by sight shall i give you a light your pipes out  randals feelings at that moment were not within reach of the comforting influence of tobacco  do you think your brother has gone to sydenham mr sarrazin asked  randal answered i havent a doubt of it now     chapter xliii know your own mind   the garden of the hotel at sydenham had originally belonged to a private house of great extent it had been laid out in excellent taste flowerbeds and lawns a handsome fountain seats shaded by groups of fine trees at their full growth completed the pastoral charm of the place a winding path led across the garden from the back of the house it had been continued by the speculator who purchased the property until it reached a road at the extremity of the grounds which communicated with the crystal palace visitors to the hotel had such pleasant associations with the garden that many of them returned at future opportunities instead of trying the attraction of some other place various tastes and different ages found their wishes equally consulted here children rejoiced in the finest playground they had ever seen remote walks secluded among shrubberies invited persons of reserved disposition who came as strangers and as strangers desired to remain the fountain and the lawn collected sociable visitors who were always ready to make acquaintance with each other even the amateur artist could take liberties with nature and find the accommodating limits of the garden sufficient for his purpose trees in the foreground sat to him for likenesses that were never recognized and hills submitted to unprovoked familiarities on behalf of brushes which were not daunted by distance  on the day after the dinner which had so deplorably failed in respect of one of the guests invited to fulfill catherines anticipations there was a festival at the palace it had proved so generally attractive to the guests at the hotel that the grounds were almost deserted  as the sun declined on a lovely summer evening the few invalids feebly wandering about the flowerbeds or resting under the trees began to return to the house in dread of the dew catherine and her child with the nursemaid in attendance were left alone in the garden kitty found her mother as she openly declared not such good company as usual since the day when her grandmother had said the fatal words which checked all further allusion to her father the child had shown a disposition to complain if she was not constantly amused she complained of mrs presty now  i think grandmamma might have taken me to the crystal palace she said  my dear your grandmamma has friends with herladies and gentlemen who dont care to be troubled with a child  kitty received this information in a very unamiable spirit i hate ladies and gentlemen she said  even captain bennydeck her mother asked  no i like my nice captain and i like the waiters they would take me to the crystal palaceonly theyre always busy i wish it was bedtime i dont know what to do with myself  take a little walk with susan  where shall i go  catherine looked toward the gate which opened on the road and proposed a visit to the old man who kept the lodge  kitty shook her head there was an objection to the old man he asks questions he wants to know how i get on with my sums hes proud of his summing and he finds me out when im wrong i dont like the lodgekeeper  catherine looked the other way toward the house the pleasant fall of water in the basin of the distant fountain was just audible go and feed the goldfishes she suggested  this was a prospect of amusement which at once raised kittys spirits thats the thing she cried and ran off to the fountain with the nursemaid after her  catherine seated herself under the trees and watched in solitude the decline of the sun in a cloudless sky the memory of the happy years of her marriage had never been so sadly and persistently present to her mind as at this time when the choice of another married life waited her decision to become an accomplished fact remembrances of the past which she had such bitter reason to regret and forebodings of the future in which she was more than half inclined to believe oppressed her at one and the same moment she thought of the different circumstances so widely separated by time under which herbert years ago and bennydeck twentyfour hours since had each owned his love and pleaded for an indulgent hearing her mind contrasted the dissimilar results  pressed by the faithless man who had so cruelly wronged her in afteryears she only wondered why he had waited so long before he asked her to marry him addressed with equal ardor by that other man whose age whose character whose modest devotion offered her every assurance of happiness that a woman could desire she had struggled against herself and had begged him to give her a day to consider that day was now drawing to an end as she watched the setting sun the phantom of her guilty husband darkened the heavenly light imbittered the distrust of herself which made her afraid to say yes and left her helpless before the hesitation which prevented her from saying no  the figure of a man appeared on the lonely path that led to the lodge gate  impulsively she rose from her seat as he advanced she sat down again after that first act of indecision the flutter of her spirits abated she was able to think  to avoid him after he had spared her at her own request would have been an act of ingratitude to receive him was to place herself once more in the false position of a woman too undecided to know her own mind forced to choose between these alternatives her true regard for bennydeck forbade her to think of herself and encouraged her to wait for him as he came nearer she saw anxiety in his face and observed an open letter in his hand he smiled as he approached her and asked leave to take a chair at her side at the same time when he perceived that she had noticed his letter he put it away hurriedly in his pocket  i hope nothing has happened to annoy you she said  he smiled again and asked if she was thinking of his letter it is only a report he added from my second in command whom i have left in charge of my home he is an excellent man but i am afraid his temper is not proof against the ingratitude which we sometimes meet with he doesnt yet make allowances for what even the best natures suffer under the deteriorating influence of selfdistrust and despair no i am not anxious about the results of this case i forget all my anxieties except one when i am with you  his eyes told her that he was about to return to the one subject that she dreaded she triedas women will try in the little emergencies of their livesto gain time  i am interested about your home she said i want to know what sort of place it is is the discipline very severe  there is no discipline he answered warmly my one object is to be a friend to my friendless fellowcreatures and my one way of governing them is to follow the teaching of the sermon on the mount whatever else i may remind them of when they come to me i am determined not to remind them of a prison for this reasonthough i pity the hardened wanderers of the streets i dont open my doors to them many a refuge in which discipline is inevitable is open to these poor sinners already my welcome is offered to penitents and sufferers of another kindwho have fallen from positions in life in which the sense of honor has been cultivated whose despair is associated with remembrances which i may so encourage with the new testament to help me as to lead them back to the religious influences under which their purer and happier lives may have been passed here and there i meet with disappointments but i persist in my system of trusting them as freely as if they were my own children and for the most part they justify my confidence in them on the dayif it ever comeswhen i find discipline necessary i shall suffer my disappointment and close my doors  is your house open catherine asked to men and women alike  he was eager to speak with her on a subject more interesting to him even than his home answering her question in this frame of mind his thoughts wandered he drew lines absently with his walkingstick on the soft earth under the trees  the means at my disposal he said are limited i have been obliged to choose between the men and the women  and you have chosen women  yes  why  because a lost woman is a more friendless creature than a lost man  do they come to you or do you look for them  they mostly come to me there is one young woman however now waiting to see me whom i have been looking for i am deeply interested in her  is it her beauty that interests you  i have not seen her since she was a child she is the daughter of an old friend of mine who died many years ago  and with that claim on you you keep her waiting  yes  he let his stick drop on the ground and looked at catherine but he offered no explanation of his strange conduct she was a little disappointed you have been some time away from your home she said still searching for his reasons when do you go back  i go back he answered when i know whether i may thank god for being the happiest man living  they were both silent     chapter xliv think of consequences   catherine listened to the fall of water in the basin of the fountain she was conscious of a faint hopea hope unworthy of herthat kitty might get weary of the goldfishes and might interrupt them no such thing happened no stranger appeared on the path which wound through the garden she was alone with him the influences of the still and fragrant summer evening were influences which breathed of love  have you thought of me since yesterday he asked gently  she owned that she had thought of him  is there no hope that your heart will ever incline toward me  i darent consult my heart if i had only to consider my own feelings she stopped  what else have you to consider  my past lifehow i have suffered and what i have to repent of  has your married life not been a happy one he asked  not a happy onein the end she answered  through no fault of yours i am sure  through no fault of mine certainly  and yet you said just now that you had something to repent of  i was not thinking of my husband captain bennydeck when i said that if i have injured any person the person is myself  she was thinking of that fatal concession to the advice of her mother and to the interests of her child which placed her in a false position toward the honest man who loved her and trusted her if he had been less innocent in the ways of the world and not so devotedly fond of her he might little by little have persuaded catherine to run the risk of shocking him by a confession of the truth as it was his confidence in her raised him high above the reach of suspicions which might have occurred to other men he saw her turn pale he saw distress in her face which he interpreted as a silent reproach to him for the questions he had asked  i hope you will forgive me he said simply  she was astonished what have i to forgive  my want of delicacy  oh captain bennydeck you speak of one of your great merits as if it were a fault over and over again i have noticed your delicacy and admired it  he was too deeply in earnest to abandon his doubts of himself  i have ignorantly led you to think of your sorrows he said sorrows that i cannot console i dont deserve to be forgiven may i make the one excuse in my power may i speak of myself  she told him by a gesture that he had made a needless request  the life i have led he resumed accounts perhaps in some degree for what is deficient in me at school i was not a popular boy i only made one friend and he has long since been numbered with the dead of my life at college and afterward in london i dare not speak to you i look back at it with horror my schoolfriend decided my choice of a profession he went into the navy after a while not knowing what else to do i followed his example i liked the lifei may say the sea saved me for years i was never on shore for more than a few weeks at a time i saw nothing of society i was hardly ever in the company of ladies the next change in my life associated me with an arctic expedition god forbid i should tell you of what men go through who are lost in the regions of eternal ice let me only say i was preservedmiraculously preservedto profit by that dreadful experience it made a new man of me it altered me  i hope for the better into what i am now oh i feel that i ought to have kept my secret yesterdayi mean my daring to love you i should have waited till you knew more of me till my conduct pleased you perhaps and spoke for me you wont laugh i am sure if i confess at my age that i am inexperienced never till i met you have i known what true love isand this at forty years old how some people would laugh i own it seems melancholy to me  no not melancholy  her voice trembled agitation which it was not a pain but a luxury to feel was gently taking possession of her where another man might have seen that her tenderness was getting the better of her discretion and might have presumed on the discovery this man innocently blind to his own interests never even attempted to take advantage of her no more certain way could have been devised by the most artful lover of touching the heart of a generous woman and making it his own the influence exerted over catherine by the virtues of bennydecks characterhis unaffected kindness his manly sympathy his religious convictions so deeply felt so modestly restrained from claiming noticehad been steadily increasing in the intimacy of daily intercourse catherine had never felt his ascendancy over her as strongly as she felt it now by fine degrees the warning remembrances which had hitherto made her hesitate lost their hold on her memory hardly conscious herself of what she was doing she began to search his feelings in his own presence such love as his had been unknown in her experience the luxury of looking into it and sounding it to its inmost depths was more than the womans nature could resist  i think you hardly do yourself justice she said surely you dont regret having felt for me so truly when i told you yesterday that my old friend had deserted me  no indeed  do you like to remember that you showed no jealous curiosity to know who my friend was  i should have been ashamed of myself if i had asked the question  and did you believe that i had a good motivea motive which you might yourself have appreciatedfor not telling you the name of that friend  is he some one whom i know  ought you to ask me that after what i have just said  pray forgive me i spoke without thinking  i can hardly believe it when i remember how you spoke to me yesterday i could never have supposed before we became acquainted with each other that it was in the nature of a man to understand me so perfectly to be so gentle and so considerate in feeling for my distress you confused me a little i must own by what you said afterward but i am not sure that ought to be severe in blaming you sympathyi mean such sympathy as yourssometimes says more than discretion can always approve have you not found it so yourself  i have found it so with you  and perhaps i have shown a little too plainly how dependent i am on youhow dreadful it would be to me if i lost you too as a friend  she blushed as she said it when the words had escaped her she felt that they might bear another meaning than the simple meaning which she had attached to them he took her hand his doubts of himself his needless fear of offending her restrained him no longer  you can never lose me he said if you will only let me be the nearest friend that a woman can have bear with me dearest i ask for so much i have so little to offer in return i dream of a life with you which is perhaps too perfectly happy to be enjoyed on earth and yet i cannot resign my delusion must my poor heart always long for happiness which is beyond my reach if an overruling providence guides our course through this world may we not sometimes hope for happier ends than our mortal eyes can see  he waited a momentand sighedand dropped her hand she hid her face she knew what it would tell him she was ashamed to let him see it  i didnt mean to distress you he said sadly  she let him see her face for a moment only she looked at himand then let silence tell him the rest  his arms closed round her slowly the glory of the sun faded from the heavens and the soft summer twilight fell over the earth i cant speak he whispered my happiness is too much for me  are you sure of your happiness she asked  could i think as i am thinking now if i were not sure of it  are you thinking of me  of youand of all that you will be to me in the future oh my angel if god grants us many years to come what a perfect life i see  tell mewhat do you see  i see a husband and wife who are all in all to each other if friends come to us we are glad to bid them welcome but we are always happiest by ourselves  do we live in retirement  we live where you like best to live shall it be in the country  yes yes you have spoken of the sea as you might have spoken of your best friendwe will be near the sea but i must not keep you selfishly all to myself i must remember how good you have been to poor creatures who dont feel our happiness and who need your kindness perhaps i might help you do you doubt it  i only doubt whether i ought to let you see what i have seen i am only afraid of the risk of making you unhappy you tempt me to run the risk the help of a womanand of such a woman as you areis the one thing i have wanted your influence would succeed where my influence has often failed how good how thoughtful you would be  i only want to be worthy of you she said humbly when may i see your home  he drew her closer to him tenderly and timidly he kissed her for the first time it rests with you he answered when will you be my wife  she hesitated he felt her trembling is there any obstacle he asked  before she could reply kittys voice was heard calling to her motherkitty ran up to them  catherine turned cold as the child caught her by the hand eagerly claiming her attention all that she should have remembered all that she had forgotten in a few bright moments of illusion rose in judgment against her and struck her mind prostrate in an instant when she felt kittys touch  bennydeck saw the change was it possible that the childs sudden appearance had startled her kitty had something to say and said it before he could speak  mamma i want to go where the other children are going susans gone to her supper you take me  her mother was not even listening kitty turned impatiently to bennydeck why wont mamma speak to me she asked he quieted her by a word you shall go with me his anxiety about catherine was more than he could endure pray let me take you back to the house he said i am afraid you are not well  i shall be better directly do me a kindnesstake the child  she spoke faintly and vacantly bennydeck hesitated she lifted her trembling hands in entreaty i beg you will leave me her voice her manner made it impossible to disobey he turned resignedly to kitty and asked which way she wanted to go the child pointed down the path to one of the towers of the crystal palace visible in the distance the governess has taken the others to see the company go away she said i want to go too  bennydeck looked back before he lost sight of catherine  she remained seated in the attitude in which he had left her at the further end of the path which led to the hotel he thought he saw a figure in the twilight approaching from the house there would be help near if catherine wanted it  his uneasy mind was in some degree relieved as he and kitty left the garden together     chapter xlv love your enemies   she tried to think of bennydeck  her eyes followed him as long as he was in sight but her thoughts wandered to look at him now was to look at the little companion walking by his side still the child reminded her of the living father still the child innocently tortured her with the consciousness of deceit the faithless man from whom the law had released her possessed himself of her thoughts in spite of the law he and he only was the visionary companion of her solitude when she was left by herself  did he remind her of the sin that he had committedof the insult that he had inflicted on the woman whom he had vowed to love and cherish no he recalled to her the years of love that she had passed by his side he upbraided her with the happiness which she had owed to him in the prime and glory of her life woman set that against the wrong which i have done to you you have the right to condemn me and society has the right to condemn mebut i am your childs father still forget me if you can  all thought will bear the test of solitude excepting only the thought that finds its origin in hopeless selfreproach the soft mystery of twilight the solemn silence of the slowlycoming night daunted catherine in that lonely place she rose to return to light and human beings as she set her face toward the house a discovery confronted her she was not alone  a woman was standing on the path apparently looking at her  in the dim light and at the distance between them recognition of the woman was impossible she neither moved nor spoke strained to their utmost point of tension catherines nerves quivered at the sight of that shadowy solitary figure she dropped back on the seat in tones that trembled she said who are you what do you want  the voice that answered was like her own voice faint with fear it said i want a word with you  moving slowly forwardstoppingmoving onward againhesitating againthe woman at last approached there was light enough left to reveal her face now that she was near it was the face of sydney westerfield  the survival of childhood in the mature human being betrays itself most readily in the sex that bears children the chances and changes of life show the childs mobility of emotion constantly associating itself with the passions of the woman at the moment of recognition the troubled mind of catherine was instantly steadied under the influence of that coarsest sense which levels us with the animalsthe sense of anger  i am amazed at your audacity she said  there was no resentmentthere was only patient submission in sydneys reply  twice i have approached the house in which you are living and twice my courage has failed me i have gone away againi have walked i dont know where i dont know how far shame and fear seemed to be insensible to fatigue this is my third attempt if i was a little nearer to you i think you would see what the effort has cost me i have not much to say may i ask you to hear me  you have taken me by surprise miss westerfield you have no right to do that i refuse to hear you  try madam to bear in mind that no unhappy creature in my place would expose herself to your anger and contempt without a serious reason will you think again  no  sydney turned to go awayand suddenly stopped  another person was advancing from the hotel an interruption a trivial domestic interruption presented itself the nursemaid had missed the child and had come into the garden to see if she was with her mother  where is miss kitty maam the girl asked  her mistress told her what had happened and sent her to the palace to relieve captain bennydeck of the charge that he had undertaken susan listened looking at sydney and recognizing the familiar face as the girl moved away sydney spoke to her  i hope little kitty is well and happy  the mother does not live who could have resisted the tone in which that question was put the broken heart the love for the child that still lived in it spoke in accents that even touched the servant she came back remembering the happy days when the governess had won their hearts at mount morven and for a moment at least remembering nothing else  quite well and happy miss thank you susan said  as she hurried away on her errand she saw her mistress beckon to sydney to return and place a chair for her the nursemaid was not near enough to hear what followed  miss westerfield will you forget what i said just now with those words catherine pointed to the chair i am ready to hear you she resumedbut i have something to ask first does what you wish to say to me relate only to yourself  it relates to another person as well as to myself  that reply and the inference to which it led tried catherines resolution to preserve her selfcontrol as nothing had tried it yet  if that other person she began means mr herbert linley  sydney interrupted her in words which she was entirely unprepared to hear  i shall never see mr herbert linley again  has he deserted you  no it is i who have left him  you  the emphasis laid on that one word forced sydney to assert herself for the first time  if i had not left him of my own free will she said what else would excuse me for venturing to come here  catherines sense of justice felt the force of that reply at the same time her sense of injury set its own construction on sydneys motive has his cruelty driven you away from him she asked  if he has been cruel to me sydney answered do you think i should have come here to complain of it to you do me the justice to believe that i am not capable of such selfdegradation as that i have nothing to complain of  and yet you have left him  he has been all that is kind and considerate he has done everything that a man in his unhappy position could do to set my mind at ease and yet i have left him oh i claim no merit for my repentance bitterly as i feel it i might not have had the courage to leave himif he had loved me as he once loved you  miss westerfield you are the last person living who ought to allude to my married life  you may perhaps pardon the allusion madam when you have heard what i have still to say i owe it to mr herbert linley if not to you to confess that his life with me has not been a life of happiness he has tried compassionately tried to keep his secret sorrow from discovery and he has failed i had long suspected the truth but i only saw it in his face when he found the book you left behind you at the hotel your image has from first to last been the one living image in his guilty heart i am the miserable victim of a mans passing fancy you have been you are still the one object of a husbands love ask your own heart if the woman lives who can say to you what i have saidunless she knew it to be true  catherines head sank on her bosom her helpless hands lay trembling on her lap overpowered by the confession which she had just hearda confession which had followed closely on the thoughts inspired by the appearance of the childher agitation was beyond control her mind was unequal to the effort of decision the woman who had been wrongedwho had the right to judge for herself and to speak for herselfwas the silent woman of the two  it was not quite dark yet sydney could see as well as hear  for the first time since the beginning of the interview she allowed the impulse of the moment to lead her astray in her eagerness to complete the act of atonement she failed to appreciate the severity of the struggle that was passing in catherines mind she alluded again to herbert linley and she spoke too soon  will you let him ask your pardon she said he expects no more  catherines spirit was roused in an instant he expects too much she answered sternly is he here by your connivance is he too waiting to take me by surprise  i am incapable madam of taking such a liberty with you as that i may perhaps have hoped to be able to tell him by writing of a different reception she checked herself i beg your pardon if i have ventured to hope i dare not ask you to alter your opinion  do you dare to look the truth in the face catherine interposed do you remember what sacred ties that man has broken what memories he has profaned what years of faithful love he has cast from him must i tell you how he poisoned his wifes mind with doubts of his truth and despair of his honor when he basely deserted her you talk of your repentance does your repentance forget that he would still have been my blameless husband but for you  sydney silently submitted to reproach silently endured the shame that finds no excuse for itself  catherine looked at her and relented the noble nature which could stoop to anger but never sink to the lower depths of malice and persecution restrained itself and made amends i say it in no unkindness to you she resumed but when you ask me to forgive consider what you ask me to forget it will only distress us both if we remain longer together she continued rising as she spoke perhaps you will believe that i mean well when i ask if there is anything i can do for you  nothing  all the desolation of the lost woman told its terrible tale in that one word invited to rest herself in the hotel she asked leave to remain where she was the mere effort of rising was too much for her now catherine said the parting words kindly i believe in your good intentions i believe in your repentance  believe in my punishment after that reply no more was said  behind the trees that closed the view at the further extremity of the lawn the moon was rising as the two women lost sight of each other the new light pure and beautiful began to dawn over the garden     chapter xlvi nil desperandum   no horror of her solitude no melancholy recollections no dread of the future disturbed sydneys mind the one sense left in her was the sense of fatigue vacantly mechanically the girl rested as a tired animal might have rested she saw nothing heard nothing the one feeling of which she was conscious was a dull aching in every limb the moon climbed the heavens brightened the topmost leaves of the trees found the gloom in which sydney was hidden and cheered it tenderly with radiant light she was too weary to sleep too weary even to shade her face when the moonbeams touched it while the light still strengthened while the slow minutes still followed each other unheeded the one influence that could rouse sydney found her at lastset her faint heart throbbingcalled her prostrate spirit to life again she heard a glad cry of recognition in a childs voice  oh sydney dear is it you  in another instant her little pupil and playfellow of former days was in her arms  my darling how did you come here  susan answered the question we are on our way back from the palace miss i am afraid she said timidly that we ought to go in  silently resigned sydney tried to release the child kitty clung to her and kissed her kitty set the nurse at defiance do you think i am going to leave syd now i have found her susan i am astonished at you  susan gave way where the nature is gentle kindness and delicacy go handinhand together undisturbed by the social irregularities which beset the roadway of life the nursemaid drew back out of hearing kittys first questions followed each other in breathless succession some of them proved to be hard indeed to answer truly and without reserve she inquired if sydney had seen her mother and then she was eager to know why sydney had been left in the garden alone  why havent you gone back to the house with mamma she asked  dont ask me dear was all that sydney could say kitty drew the inevitable conclusion have you and mamma quarreled  oh no  then come indoors with me  wait a little kitty and tell me something about yourself how do you get on with your lessons  you dear foolish governess do you expect me to learn my lessons when i havent got you to teach me where have you been all this long while i wouldnt have gone away and left you she paused her eager eyes studied sydneys face with the unrestrained curiosity of a child is it the moonlight that makes you look pale and wretched she said or are you really unhappy tell me syd do you ever sing any of those songs that i taught you when you first came to us  never dear  have you anybody to go out walking with you and running races with you as i did  no my sweet those days have gone by forever  kitty laid her head sadly on sydneys bosom its not the moonlight she said shall i tell you a secret sometimes i am not happy either poor papa is dead he always liked youim sure you are sorry for him  astonishment held sydney speechless before she could ask who had so cruelly deceived the child and for what purpose the nursemaid standing behind the chair warned her to be silent by a touch  i think we are all unhappy now kitty went on still following her own little train of thought mamma isnt like what she used to be and even my nice captain hasnt a word to say to me he wouldnt come back with us he said he would go back by himself  another allusion which took sydney by surprise she asked who the captain was kitty started as if the question shocked her oh dear dear this is what comes of your going away and leaving us you dont know captain bennydeck  the name of her fathers correspondent the name which she vaguely remembered to have heard in her childhood where did you first meet with him she inquired  at the seaside dear  do you mean at sandyseal  yes mamma liked himand grandmamma liked him which is wonderfuland i gave him a kiss promise me not to tell my nice captain is going to be my new papa  was there any possible connection between what kitty had just said and what the poor child had been deluded into believing when she spoke of her father even susan seemed to be in the secret of this strange second marriage she interfered with a sharp reproof you mustnt talk in that way miss kitty please put her off your lap miss westerfield we have been here too long already  kitty proposed a compromise ill go she said if syd will come with me  im sorry my darling to disappoint you  kitty refused to believe it you couldnt disappoint me if you tried she said boldly  indeed indeed i must go away oh kitty try to bear it as i do  entreaties were useless the child refused to hear of another parting i want to make you and mamma friends again dont break my heart sydney come home with me and teach me and play with me and love me  she pulled desperately at sydneys dress she called to susan to help her with tears in her eyes the girl did her best to help them both miss westerfield will wait here she said to kitty while you speak to your mammasay yes she whispered to sydney its our only chance  the child instantly exacted a promise in the earnestness of her love she even dictated the words say it after me as i used to say my lessons she insisted say kitty i promise to wait for you  who that loved her could have refused to say it in one form or another the horrid necessity for deceit had followed and was still following that first worst act of falsehoodthe elopement from mount morven  kitty was now as eager to go as she had been hitherto resolute to remain she called for susan to follow her and ran to the hotel  my mistress wont let her come backyou can leave the garden that way the maid pointed along the path to the left and hurried after the child  they were goneand sydney was alone again  at the parting with kitty the measure of her endurance was full not even the farewell at mount morven had tried her by an ordeal so cruel as this no kind woman was willing to receive her and employ her now the one creature left who loved her was the faithful little friend whom she must never see again i am still innocent to that child she thoughtand i am parted from her forever  she rose to leave the garden  a farewell look at the last place in which she had seen kitty tempted her to indulge in a moment of delay her eyes rested on the turn in the path at which she had lost sight of the active little figure hastening away to plead her cause even in absence the child was sydneys good angel still as she turned away to follow the path that had been shown to her the relief of tears came at last it cooled her burning head it comforted her aching heart she tried to walk on the tears blinded hershe strayed from the pathshe would have fallen but for a hand that caught her and held her up a mans voice firm and deep and kind quieted her first wild feeling of terror my child you are not fit to be by yourself let me take care of youlet me comfort you if i can  he carried her back to the seat that she had left and waited by her in merciful silence  you are very young to feel such bitter sorrow he said when she was composed again i dont ask what your sorrow is i only want to know how i can help you  nobody can help me  can i take you back to your friends  i have no friends  pardon me you have one friend at leastyou have me  you a stranger  no human creature who needs my sympathy is a stranger  she turned toward him for the first time in her new position she was clearly visible in the light he looked at her attentively i have seen you somewhere he said before now  she had not noticed him when they had passed each other at sandyseal i think you must be mistaken she answered may i thank you for your kindness and may i hope to be excused if i say goodnight  he detained her are you sure that you are well enough to go away by yourself he asked anxiously  i am quite sure  he still detained her his memory of that first meeting at the seaside hotel reminded him that he had seen her in the company of a man at their second meeting she was alone and in tears sad experience led him to form his own conclusions if you wont let me take care of you he said will you consider if i can be of any use to you and will you call at that address he gave her his card she took it without looking at it she was confused she hardly knew what to say do you doubt me he askedsadly not angrily  oh how can i do that i doubt myself i am not worthy of the interest you feel in me  that is a sad thing to say he answered let me try to give you confidence in yourself do you go to london when you leave this place  yes  tomorrow he resumed i am going to see another poor girl who is alone in the world like you if i tell you where she lives will you ask her if i am a person to be trusted  he had taken a letter from his pocket while he was speaking and he now tore off a part of the second leaf and gave it to her i have only lately he said received the address from a friend  as he offered that explanation the shrill sound of a childs voice raised in anger and entreaty reached their ears from the neighborhood of the hotel faithful little kitty had made her escape determined to return to sydney had been overtaken by the maidand had been carried back in susans arms to the house sydney imagined that she was not perhaps alone in recognizing the voice the stranger who had been so kind to her did certainly start and look round  the stillness of the night was disturbed no more the man turned again to the person who had so strongly interested him the person was gone  in fear of being followed sydney hurried to the railway station by the light in the carriage she looked for the first time at the fragment of the letter and the card  the stranger had presented her with her own address and when she looked at the card the name was bennydeck     chapter xlvii better do it than wish it done   more than once on one and the same day the captain had been guilty of a weakness which would have taken his oldest friends by surprise if they had seen him at the moment he hesitated  a man who has commanded ships and has risked his life in the regions of the frozen deep is a man formed by nature and taught by habit to meet emergency face to face to see his course straight before him and to take it lead him where it may but nature and habit formidable forces as they are find their master when they encounter the passion of love  at once perplexed and distressed by that startling change in catherine which he had observed when her child approached her bennydecks customary firmness failed him when the course of conduct toward his betrothed wife which it might be most becoming to follow presented itself to him as a problem to be solved when kitty asked him to accompany her nursemaid and herself on their return to the hotel he had refused because he felt reluctant to intrude himself on catherines notice until she was ready to admit him to her confidence of her own free will left alone he began to doubt whether delicacy did really require him to make the sacrifice which he had contemplated not five minutes since it was surely possible that catherine might be waiting to see him and might then offer the explanation which would prove to be equally a relief on both sides he was on his way to the hotel when he met with sydney westerfield  to see a woman in the sorest need of all that kindness and consideration could offer and to leave her as helpless as he had found her would have been an act of brutal indifference revolting to any man possessed of even ordinary sensibility the captain had only followed his natural impulses and had only said and done what in nearly similar cases he had said and done on other occasions  left by himself he advanced a few steps mechanically on the way by which sydney had escaped himand then stopped was there any sufficient reason for his following her and intruding himself on her notice she had recovered she was in possession of his address she had been referred to a person who could answer for his good intentions all that it was his duty to do had been done already he turned back again in the direction of the hotel  hesitating once more he paused halfway along the corridor which led to catherines sittingroom voices reached him from persons who had entered the house by the front door he recognized mrs prestys loud confident tones she was taking leave of friends and was standing with her back toward him bennydeck waited unobserved until he saw her enter the sittingroom no such explanation as he was in search of could possibly take place in the presence of catherines mother he returned to the garden  mrs presty was in high spirits she had enjoyed the festival she had taken the lead among the friends who accompanied her to the palace she had ordered everything and paid for nothing at that worst of all bad public dinners in england the dinner which pretends to be french in a buoyant frame of mind ready for more enjoyment if she could only find it what did she see on opening the sittingroom door to use the expressive language of the stage catherine was discovered alonewith her elbows on the table and her face hidden in her handsthe picture of despair  mrs presty surveyed the spectacle before her with righteous indignation visible in every line of her face the arrangement which bound her daughter to give bennydeck his final reply on that day had been well known to her when she left the hotel in the morning the conclusion at which she arrived on returning at night was expressed with roman brevity and roman eloquence in four words  oh the poor captain  catherine suddenly looked up  i knew it mrs presty continued with her sternest emphasis i see what you have done in your face you have refused bennydeck  god forgive me i have been wicked enough to accept him  hearing this some mothers might have made apologies and other mothers might have asked what that penitential reply could possibly mean mrs presty was no matron of the ordinary type she welcomed the good news without taking the smallest notice of the expression of selfreproach which had accompanied it  my dear child accept the congratulations of your fond old mother i have never been one of the kissing sort i mean of course where women are concerned but this is an occasion which justifies something quite out of the common way come and kiss me  catherine took no notice of that outburst of maternal love  i have forgotten everything that i ought to have remembered she said in my vanity in my weakness in my selfish enjoyment of the passing moment i have been too supremely happy even to think of the trials of my past life and of the false position in which they have placed me toward a man whom i ought to be ashamed to deceive i have only been recalled to a sense of duty i might almost say to a sense of decency by my poor little child if kitty had not reminded me of her father  mrs presty dropped into a chair she was really frightened her fat cheeks trembled like a jelly on a dish that is suddenly moved  has that man been here she asked  what man  the man who may break off your marriage if he meets with the captain has herbert linley been here  certainly not the one person associated with my troubles whom i have seen today is sydney westerfield  mrs presty bounced out of her chair youhave seensydney westerfield she repeated with emphatic pauses which expressed amazement tempered by unbelief  yes i have seen her  where  in the garden  and spoken to her  yes  mrs presty raised her eyes to the ceiling whether she expected our old friend the recording angel to take down the questions and answers that had just passed or whether she was only waiting to see the hotel that held her daughter collapse under a sense of moral responsibility it is not possible to decide after an awful pause the old lady remembered that she had something more to sayand said it  i make no remark catherine i dont even want to know what you and miss westerfield said to each other at the same time as a matter of convenience to myself i wish to ascertain whether i must leave this hotel or not the same house doesnt hold that woman and me has she gone  she has gone  mrs presty looked round the room and taken kitty with her she asked  dont speak of kitty catherine cried in the greatest distress i have had to keep the poor innocent affectionate child apart from miss westerfield by force my heart aches when i think of it  im not surprised catherine my granddaughter has been brought up on the modern system children are all little angelsno punishmentsonly gentle remonstrancedont be naughty dear because you will make poor mamma unhappy and then mamma grieves over it and wonders over it when she finds her little angel disobedient what a fatal system of education all my success in life every quality that endeared me to your father and mr presty every social charm that has made me the idol of society i attribute entirely to judicious correction in early life applied freely with the open hand we will change the subject where is dear bennydeck i want to congratulate him on his approaching marriage she looked hard at her daughter and mentally added hell live to regret it  catherine knew nothing of the captains movements like you she told her mother i have something to say to him and i dont know where he is  mrs presty still kept her eyes fixed on her daughter nobody observing catherines face and judging also by the tone of her voice would have supposed that she was alluding to the man whose irresistible attractions had won her she looked ill at ease and she spoke sadly  you dont seem to be in good spirits my dear mrs presty gently suggested no lovers quarrel already i hope  nothing of the kind  can i be of any use to you  you might be of the greatest use but i know only too well you would refuse  thus far mrs presty had been animated by curiosity she began now to feel vaguely alarmed after all that i have done for you she answered i dont think you ought to say that why should i refuse  catherine hesitated  her mother persisted in pressing her has it anything to do with captain bennydeck  yes  what is it  catherine roused her courage  you know what it is as well as i do she said captain bennydeck believes that i am free to marry him because i am a widow you might help me to tell him the truth  what  that exclamation of horror and astonishment was loud enough to have been heard in the garden if mrs prestys hair had been all her own it must have been hair that stood on end  catherine quietly rose we wont discuss it she said with resignation i knew you would refuse me she approached the door her mother got up and resolutely stood in the way before you commit an act of downright madness mrs presty said i mean to try if i can stop you go back to your chair  catherine refused  i know how it will end she answered and the sooner it ends the better you will find that i am quite as determined as you are a man who loves me as he loves me is a man whom i refuse to deceive  lets have it out plainly mrs presty insisted he believes your first marriage has been dissolved by death do you mean to tell him that it has been dissolved by divorce  i do  what right has he to know it  a right that is not to be denied a wife must have no secrets from her husband  mrs presty hit back smartly  youre not his wife yet wait till you are married  never who but a wretch would marry an honest man under false pretenses  i deny the false pretenses you talk as if you were an impostor are you or are you not the accomplished lady who has charmed him are you or are you not the beautiful woman whom he loves there isnt a stain on your reputation in every respect you are the wife he wants and the wife who is worthy of him and you are cruel enough to disturb the poor man about a matter that doesnt concern him you are fool enough to raise doubts of you in his mind and give him a reproach to cast in your teeth the first time you do anything that happens to offend him any womani dont care who she may bemight envy the home thats waiting for you and your child if youre wise enough to hold your tongue upon my word catherine i am ashamed of you have you no principles  she really meant it the purely selfish considerations which she urged on her daughter were so many undeniable virtues in mrs prestys estimation she took the highest moral ground and stood up and crowed on it with a pride in her own principles which the primate of all england might have envied  but catherines rare resolution held as firm as ever she got a little nearer to the door goodnight mamma was the only reply she made  is that all you have to say to me  i am tired and i must rest please let me go  mrs presty threw open the door with a bang  you refuse to take my advice she said oh very well have your own way you are sure to prosper in the end these are the days of exhibitions and gold medals if there is ever an exhibition of idiots at large i know who might win the prize  catherine was accustomed to preserve her respect for her mother under difficulties but this was far more than her sense of filial duty could successfully endure  i only wish i had never taken your advice she answered many a miserable moment would have been spared me if i had always done what i am doing now you have been the evil genius of my life since miss westerfield first came into our house  she passed through the open doorwaystoppedand came back again i didnt mean to offend you mammabut you do say such irritating things goodnight  not a word of reply acknowledged that kindlymeant apology mrs prestyvivacious mrs presty of the indomitable spirit and the ready tonguewas petrified she the guardian angel of the family whose experience devotion and sound sense had steered catherine through difficulties and dangers which must have otherwise ended in utter domestic shipwreckshe the model motherhad been stigmatized as the evil genius of her daughters life by no less a person than that daughter herself what was to be said what was to be done what terrible and unexampled course of action should be taken after such an insult as this mrs presty stood helpless in the middle of the room and asked herself these questions and waited and wondered and found no answer  an interval passed there was a knock at the door a waiter appeared he said a gentleman to see mrs norman  the gentleman entered the room and revealed himself  herbert linley     chapter xlviii be careful   the divorced husband looked at his motherinlaw without making the slightest sacrifice to the claims of politeness he neither offered his hand nor made his bow his frowning eyebrows his flushed face betrayed the anger that was consuming him  i want to see catherine he said  this deliberate rudeness proved to be the very stimulant that was required to restore mrs presty to herself the smile that always meant mischief made its threatening appearance on the old ladys face  what sort of company have you been keeping since i last saw you she began  what have you got to do with the company i keep  nothing whatever i am happy to say i was merely wondering whether you have been traveling lately in the south part of africa and have lived exclusively in the society of hottentots the only other explanation of your behavior is that i have been so unfortunate as to offend you but it seems improbablei am not your wife  thank god for that  thank god as you say but i should really be glad as a mere matter of curiosity to know what your extraordinary conduct means you present yourself in this room uninvited you find a lady here and you behave as if you had come into a shop and wanted to ask the price of something let me give you a lesson in good manners observe i receive you with a bow and i say how do you do mr linley do you understand me  i dont want to understand youi want to see catherine  who is catherine  you know as well as i doyour daughter  my daughter sir is a stranger to you we will speak of her if you please by the namethe illustrious namewhich she inherited at her birth you wish to see mrs norman  call her what you like i have a word to say to her and i mean to say it  no mr linley you wont say it  well see about that where is she  my daughter is not well  well or ill i shant keep her long  my daughter has retired to her room  where is her room  mrs presty moved to the fireplace and laid her hand on the bell  are you aware that this house is a hotel she asked  it doesnt matter to me what it is  oh yes it does a hotel keeps waiters a hotel when it is as large as this has a policeman in attendance must i ring  the choice between giving way to mrs presty or being disgracefully dismissed was placed plainly before him herberts life had been the life of a gentleman he knew that he had forgotten himself it was impossible that he could hesitate  i wont trouble you to ring he said and i will beg your pardon for having allowed my temper to get the better of me at the same time it ought to be remembered i think in my favor that i have had some provocation  i dont agree with you mrs presty answered she was deaf to any appeal for mercy from herbert linley as to provocation she added returning to her chair without asking him to be seated when you apply that word to yourself you insult my daughter and me you provoked oh heavens  you wouldnt say that he urged speaking with marked restraint of tone and manner if you knew what i have had to endure  mrs presty suddenly looked toward the door wait a minute she said i think i hear somebody coming in  in the silence that followed footsteps were audible outsidenot approaching the door however but retiring from it mrs presty had apparently been mistaken yes she said resignedly permitting herbert to proceed  he really had something to say for himself and he said it with sufficient moderation that he had been guilty of serious offenses he made no attempt to deny but he pleaded that he had not escaped without justly suffering for what he had done he had been entirely in the wrong when he threatened to take the child away from her mother by force of law but had he not been punished when his wife obtained her divorce and separated him from his little daughter as well as from herself no mrs presty failed to see it if anybody had suffered by the divorce the victim was her injured daughter still patient herbert did not deny the injury he only submitted once more that he had suffered his punishment whether his life with sydney westerfield had or had not been a happy one he must decline to say he would only declare that it had come to an end she had left him yes she had left him forever he had no wish to persuade her to return to their guilty life they were both penitent they were both ashamed of it but she had gone away without the provision which he was bound in honor to offer to her  she is friendless she may be in a state of poverty that i tremble to think of herbert declared is there nothing to plead for me in such anxiety as i am suffering now mrs presty stopped him there she had heard enough of sydney already  i see nothing to be gained she said by dwelling on the past and i should be glad to know why you have come to this place tonight  i have come to see kitty  quite out of the question  dont tell me that mrs presty im one of the wretchedest men living and i ask for the consolation of seeing my child kitty hasnt forgotten me yet i know her mother cant be so cruel as to refuse she shall fix her own time and send me away when she likes ill submit to anything will you ask catherine to let me see kitty  i cant do it  why not  for private reasons  what reasons  for reasons into which you have no right to inquire  he got up from his chair his face presented the same expression which mrs presty had seen on it when he first entered the room  when i came in here he said i wished to be certain of one thing your prevarication has told me what i wanted to know the newspapers had catherines own authority for it mrs presty when they called her widow i know now why my brother who never deceived me before has deceived me about this i understand the part that your daughter has been playingand i am as certain as if i had heard it of the devilish lie that one of youperhaps both of youmust have told my poor child no no i had better not see catherine many a man has killed his wife and has not had such good reason for doing it as i have you are quite right to keep me away from her  he stoppedand looked suddenly toward the door i hear her he cried shes coming in  the footsteps outside were audible once more this time they were approaching they were close to the door herbert drew back from it looking round to see that he was out of the way mrs presty rushed forwardtore open the door in terror of what might happenand admitted captain bennydeck     chapter xlix keep the secret   the captains attention was first attracted by the visitor whom he found in the room he bowed to the stranger but the first impression produced on him did not appear to have been of the favorable kind when he turned next to mrs presty  observing that she was agitated he made the customary apologies expressing his regret if he had been so unfortunate as to commit an intrusion trusting in the good sense and good breeding which distinguished him on other occasions mrs presty anticipated that he would see the propriety of leaving her alone again with the person whom he had found in her company to her dismay he remained in the room and worse still he noticed her daughters absence and asked if there was any serious cause for it  for the moment mrs presty was unable to reply her presence of mindor to put it more correctly her ready audacitydeserted her when she saw catherines husband that had been and catherines husband that was to be meeting as strangers and but too likely to discover each other  in all her experience she had never been placed in such a position of embarrassment as the position in which she found herself now the sense of honor which had prompted catherines resolution to make bennydeck acquainted with the catastrophe of married life might plead her excuse in the estimation of a man devotedly attached to her but if the captain was first informed that he had been deceived by a person who was a perfect stranger to him what hope could be entertained of his still holding himself bound by his marriage engagement it was even possible that distrust had been already excited in his mind he must certainly have heard a mans voice raised in anger when he approached the doorand he was now observing that man with an air of curiosity which was already assuming the appearance of distrust that herbert on his side resented the captains critical examination of him was plainly visible in his face after a glance at bennydeck he asked mrs presty who that gentleman was  i may be mistaken he added but i thought your friend looked at me just now as if he knew me  i have met you sir before this the captain made the reply with a courteous composure of tone and manner which apparently reminded herbert of the claims of politeness  may i ask where i had the honor of seeing you he inquired  we passed each other in the hall of the hotel at sandyseal you had a young woman with you  your memory is a better one than mine sir i fail to remember the circumstance to which you refer  bennydeck let the matter rest there struck by the remarkable appearance of embarrassment in mrs prestys mannerand feeling in spite of herberts politeness of language increased distrust of the man whom he had found visiting herhe thought it might not be amiss to hint that she could rely on him in case of necessity i am afraid i have interrupted a confidential interview he began and i ought perhaps to explain  mrs presty listened absently preoccupied by the fear that herbert would provoke a dangerous disclosure and by the difficulty of discovering a means of preventing it she interrupted the captain  excuse me for one moment i have a word to say to this gentleman bennydeck immediately drew back and mrs presty lowered her voice if you wish to see kitty she resumed attacking herbert on his weak side it depends entirely on your discretion  what do you mean by discretion  be careful not to speak of our family troublesand i promise you shall see kitty that is what i mean  herbert declined to say whether he would be careful or not he was determined to find out first with what purpose bennydeck had entered the room the gentleman was about to explain himself to you he said to mrs presty why dont you give him the opportunity  she had no choice but to submitin appearance at least never had she hated herbert as she hated him at that moment the captain went on with his explanation he had his reasons he said for hesitating in the first instance to present himself uninvited and he accordingly retired on second thoughts however he had returned in the hope  in the hope herbert interposed of seeing mrs prestys daughter  that was one of my motives bennydeck answered  is it indiscreet to inquire what the other motive was  not at all i heard a strangers voice speaking in a tone which to say the least of it is not customary in a ladys room and i thought  herbert interrupted him again and you thought your interference might be welcome to the lady am i right  quite right  am i making another lucky guess if i suppose myself to be speaking to captain bennydeck  i shall be glad to hear sir how you have arrived at the knowledge of my name  shall we say captain that i have arrived at it by instinct  his face as he made that reply alarmed mrs presty she cast a look at him partly of entreaty partly of warning no effect was produced by the look he continued in a tone of ironical compliment you must pay the penalty of being a public character your marriage is announced in the newspapers  i seldom read the newspapers  ah indeed perhaps the report is not true as you dont read the newspapers allow me to repeat it you are engaged to marry the beautiful widow mrs norman i think i quote those last words correctly  mrs presty suddenly got up with an inscrutable face that told no tales she advanced to the door herberts insane jealousy of the man who was about to become catherines husband had led him into a serious error he had driven catherines mother to desperation in that state of mind she recovered her lost audacity as a matter of course opening the door she turned round to the two men with a magnificent impudence of manner which in her happiest moments she had never surpassed  i am sorry to interrupt this interesting conversation she said but i have stupidly forgotten one of my domestic duties you will allow me to return and listen with renewed pleasure when my household business is off my mind i shall hope to find you both more polite to each other than ever when i come back she was in such a frenzy of suppressed rage that she actually kissed her hand to them as she left the room  bennydeck looked after her convinced that some sinister purpose was concealed under mrs prestys false excuses and wholly unable to imagine what that purpose might be herbert still persisted in trying to force a quarrel on the captain  as i remarked just now he proceeded newspaper reports are not always to be trusted do you seriously mean my dear sir to marry mrs norman  i look forward to that honor and that happiness but i am at a loss to know how it interests you  in that case allow me to enlighten you my name is herbert linley  he had held his name in reserve feeling certain of the effect which he would produce when he pronounced it the result took him completely by surprise not the slightest appearance of agitation showed itself in bennydecks manner on the contrary he looked as if there was something that interested him in the discovery of the name  you are probably related to a friend of mine he said quietly  who is your friend  mr randal linley  herbert was entirely unprepared for this discovery once more the captain had got the best of it  are you and randal linley intimate friends he inquired as soon as he had recovered himself  most intimate  its strange that he should never have mentioned me on any occasion when you and he were together  it does indeed seem strange  herbert paused his brothers keen sense of the disgrace that he had inflicted on the family recurred to his memory he began to understand randals otherwise unaccountable silence  are you nearly related to mr randal linley the captain asked  i am his elder brother  ignorant on his part of the family disgrace bennydeck heard that reply with amazement from his point of view it was impossible to account for randals silence  will you think me very inquisitive herbert resumed if i ask whether my brother approves of your marriage  there was a change in his tone as he put that question which warned bennydeck to be on his guard i have not yet consulted my friends opinion he answered shortly  herbert threw off the mask in the meantime you shall have my opinion he said your marriage is a crimeand i mean to prevent it  the captain left his chair and sternly faced the man who had spoken those insolent words  are you mad he asked  herbert was on the point of declaring himself to have been catherines husband until the law dissolved their marriagewhen a waiter came in and approached him with a message you are wanted immediately sir  who wants me  a person outside sir its a serious matterthere is not a moment to lose  herbert turned to the captain i must have your promise to wait for me he said or i dont leave the room  make your mind easy i shall not stir from this place till you have explained yourself was the firm reply  the servant led the way out he crossed the passage and opened the door of a waitingroom herbert passed inand found himself face to face with his divorced wife     chapter l forgiveness to the injured doth belong   without one word of explanation catherine stepped up to him and spoke first  answer me this she saidhave you told captain bennydeck who i am  not yet  the shortest possible reply was the only reply that he could make in the moment when he first looked at her  she was not the same woman whom he had last seen at sandyseal returning for her lost book the agitation produced by that unexpected meeting had turned her pale the overpowering sense of injury had hardened and aged her face this time she was prepared to see him this time she was conscious of a resolution that raised her in her own estimation her clear blue eyes glittered as she looked at him the bright color glowed in her cheeks he was literally dazzled by her beauty  in the past time which we both remember she resumed you once said that i was the most truthful woman you had ever known have i done anything to disturb that part of your old faith in me  nothing  she went on before you entered this house i had determined to tell captain bennydeck what you have not told him yet when i say that do you believe me  if he had been able to look away from her he might have foreseen what was coming and he would have remembered that his triumph over the captain was still incomplete but his eyes were riveted on her face his tenderest memories of her were pleading with him he answered as a docile child might have answered  i do believe you  she took a letter from her bosom and showing it begged him to remark that it was not closed  i was in my bedroom writing she said when my mother came to me and told me that you and captain bennydeck had met in my sittingroom she dreaded a quarrel and an exposure and she urged me to go downstairs and insist on sending you awayor permit her to do so if i could not prevail on myself to follow her advice i refused to allow the shameful dismissal of a man who had once had his claim on my respect the only alternative that i could see was to speak with you here in private as we are speaking now my mother undertook to manage this for me she saw the servant and gave him the message which you received where is captain bennydeck now  he is waiting in the sittingroom  waiting for you  yes  she considered a little before she said her next words  i have brought with me what i was writing in my own room she resumed wishing to show it to you will you read it  she offered the letter to him he hesitated is it addressed to me he asked  it is addressed to captain bennydeck she answered  the jealousy that still rankled in his mindjealousy that he had no more lawful or reasonable claim to feel than if he had been a strangerurged him to assume an indifference which he was far from feeling he begged that catherine would accept his excuses  she refused to excuse him  before you decide she said you ought at least to know why i have written to captain bennydeck instead of speaking to him as i had proposed my heart failed me when i thought of the distress that he might feeland perhaps of the contempt of myself which good and gentle as he is he might not be able to disguise my letter tells him the truth without concealment i am obliged to speak of the manner in which you have treated me and of the circumstances which forced me into acts of deception that i now bitterly regret i have tried not to misrepresent you i have been anxious to do you no wrong it is for you not for me to say if i have succeeded once more will you read my letter  the sad selfpossession the quiet dignity with which she spoke appealed to his memory of the pardon that she had so generously granted while he and sydney westerfield were still guiltless of the injury inflicted on her at a later time silently he took the letter from her and read it  she kept her face turned away from him and from the light the effort to be still calm and reasonableto suffer the heartache and not to let the suffering be seenmade cruel demands on the selfbetraying nature of a woman possessed by strong emotion there was a moment when she heard him sigh while he was reading she looked round at him and instantly looked away again  he rose and approached her he held out the letter in one hand and pointed to it with the other twice he attempted to speak twice the influence of the letter unmanned him  it was a hard struggle but it was for her sake he mastered his weakness and forced his trembling voice to submit to his will  is the man whom you are going to marry worthy of this he asked still pointing to the letter  she answered firmly more than worthy of it  marry him catherineand forget me  the great heart that he had so sorely wounded pitied him forgave him answered him with a burst of tears she held out one imploring hand  his lips touched ithe was gone     chapter li dum spiro spero   brisk and smiling mrs presty presented herself in the waitingroom we have got rid of our enemy she announced i looked out of the window and saw him leaving the hotel she paused struck with the deep dejection expressed in her daughters attitude catherine she exclaimed i tell you herbert has gone and you look as if you regretted it is there anything wrong did my message fail to bring him here  no  he was bent on mischief when i saw him last has he told bennydeck of the divorce  no  thank heaven for that there is no one to be afraid of now where is the captain  he is still in the sittingroom  why dont you go to him  i darent  shall i go  yesand give him this  mrs presty took the letter you mean tear it up she said and quite right too  no i mean what i say  my dear child if you have any regard for yourself if you have any regard for me dont ask me to give bennydeck this mad letter you wont hear reason you still insist on it  i do  if kitty ever behaves to you catherine as you have behaved to meyou will have richly deserved it oh if you were only a child again id beat it out of youi would  with that outburst of temper she took the letter to bennydeck in less than a minute she returned a tamed woman he frightens me she said  is he angry  noand that is the worst of it when men are angry i am never afraid of them hes quiet too quiet he said im waiting for mr herbert linley where is he i said he has left the hotel he said what does that mean i handed the letter to him perhaps this will explain i said he looked at the address and at once recognized your handwriting why does she write to me when we are both in the same house why doesnt she speak to me i pointed to the letter he wouldnt look at it he looked straight at me theres some mystery here he said im a plain man i dont like mysteries mr linley had something to say to me when the message interrupted him who sent the message do you know if there is a woman living catherine who would have told the truth in such a position as mine was at that moment i should like to have her photograph i said i didnt knowand i saw he suspected me of deceiving him those kind eyes of hisyou wouldnt believe it of themlooked me through and through i wont detain you any longer he said im not easily daunted as you knowthe relief it was to me to get away from him is not to be told in words what do you think i heard when i got into the passage i heard him turn the key of the door hes locked in my dear hes locked in we are too near him here come upstairs  catherine refused i ought to be near him she said hopefully he may wish to see me  her mother reminded her that the waitingroom was a public room and might be wanted  lets go into the garden mrs presty proposed we can tell the servant who waits on us where we may be found  catherine yielded mrs prestys excitement found its overflow in talking perpetually her daughter had nothing to say and cared nothing where they went all outward manifestation of life in her seemed to be suspended at that terrible time of expectation they wandered here and there in the quietest part of the grounds half an hour passedand no message was received the hotel clock struck the hourand still nothing happened  i can walk no longer catherine said she dropped on one of the gardenchairs holding by her mothers hand go to him for gods sake she entreated i can endure it no longer  mrs prestyeven bold mrs prestywas afraid to face him again hes fond of the child she suggested lets send kitty  some little girls were at play close by who knew where kitty was to be found in a few minutes more they brought her back with them mrs presty gave the child her instructions and sent her away proud of her errand and delighted at the prospect of visiting the captain by herself as if she was a grownup lady  this time the period of suspense was soon at an end kitty came running back its lucky you sent me she declared he wouldnt have opened the door to anybody elsehe said so himself  did you knock softly as i told you mrs presty asked  no grandmamma i forgot that i tried to open the door he called out not to disturb him i said its only me and he opened the door directly what makes him look so pale mamma is he ill  perhaps he feels the heat mrs presty suggested judiciously  he said dear little kitty and he caught me up in his arms and kissed me when he sat down again he took me on his knee and he asked if i was fond of him and i said yes i am and he kissed me again and he asked if i had come to stay with him and keep him company i forgot what you wanted me to say kitty acknowledged addressing mrs presty so i made it up out of my own head  what did you tell him  i told him mamma was as fond of him as i was and i said we will both keep you company he put me down on the floor and he got up and went to the window and looked out i told him that wasnt the way to find her and i said i know where she is ill go and fetch her hes an obstinate man our nice captain he wouldnt come away from the window i said you wish to see mamma dont you and he said yes you mustnt lock the door again i told him she wont like that and what do you think he said he said goodby kitty wasnt it funny he didnt seem to know what he was talking about if you ask my opinion mamma i think the sooner you go to him the better catherine hesitated mrs presty on one side and kitty on the other led her between them into the house     chapter lii lhomme propose et dieu dispose   captain bennydeck met catherine and her child at the open door of the room mrs presty stopping a few paces behind them waited in the passage eager to see what the captains face might tell her it told her nothing  but catherine saw a change in him there was something in his manner unnaturally passive and subdued it suggested the idea of a man whose mind had been forced into an effort of selfcontrol which had exhausted its power and had allowed the signs of depression and fatigue to find their way to the surface the captain was quiet the captain was kind neither by word nor look did he warn catherine that the continuity of their intimacy was in danger of being brokenand yet her spirits sank when they met at the open door  he led her to a chair and said she had come to him at a time when he especially wished to speak with her kitty asked if she might remain with them he put his hand caressingly on her head no my dear not now  the child eyed him for a moment conscious of something which she had never noticed in him before and puzzled by the discovery she walked back cowed and silent to the door he followed her and spoke to mrs presty  take your grandchild into the garden we will join you there in a little while goodby for the present kitty  kitty said goodby mechanicallylike a dull child repeating a lesson her grandmother led her away in silence  bennydeck closed the door and seated himself by catherine  i thank you for your letter he said if such a thing is possible it has given me a higher opinion of you than any opinion that i have held yet  she looked at him with a feeling of surprise so sudden and so overwhelming that she was at a loss how to reply the last words which she expected to hear from him when he alluded to her confession were the words that had just passed his lips  you have owned to faults that you have committed and deceptions that you have sanctioned he went onwith nothing to gain and everything to lose by telling the truth who but a good woman would have done that  there was a deeper feeling in him than he had ventured to express it betrayed itself by a momentary trembling in his voice catherine drew a little closer to him  you dont know how you surprise me how you relieve me she said warmlyand pressed his hand in the eagerness of her gratitude in the gladness that had revived her sinking heart she failed to feel that the pressure was not returned  what have i said to surprise you he asked what anxiety have i relieved without knowing it  i was afraid you would despise me  why should i despise you  have i not gained your good opinion under false pretenses have i not allowed you to admire me and to love me without telling you that there was anything in my past life which i have reason to regret even now i can hardly realize that you excuse and forgive me you who have read the confession of my worst faults you who know the shocking inconsistencies of my character  say at once he answered that i know you to be a mortal creature is there any human character even the noblest that is always consistently good  one reads of them sometimes she suggested in books  yes he said in the worst books you could possibly readthe only really immoral books written in our time  why are they immoral  for this plain reason that they deliberately pervert the truth claptrap you innocent creature to catch foolish readers when do these consistently good people appear in the life around us the life that we all see never are the best mortals that ever lived above the reach of temptation to do ill and are they always too good to yield to it how does the lords prayer instruct humanity it commands us all without exception to pray that we may not be led into temptation you have been led into temptation in other words you are a human being all that a human being could do you have doneyou have repented and confessed dont i know how you have suffered and how you have been tried why what a mean pharisee i should be if i presumed to despise you  she looked at him proudly and gratefully she lifted her arm as if to thank him by an embrace and suddenly let it drop again at her side  am i tormenting myself without cause she said or is there something that looks like sorrow showing itself to me in your face  you see the bitterest sorrow that i have felt in all my sad life  is it sorrow for me  no sorrow for myself  has it come to you through me is it my fault  it is more your misfortune than your fault  then you can feel for me  i can and do  he had not yet set her at ease  i am afraid your sympathy stops somewhere she said where does it stop  for the first time he shrank from directly answering her i begin to wish i had followed your example he owned it might have been better for both of us if i had answered your letter in writing  tell me plainly she cried is there something you cant forgive  there is something i cant forget  what is it oh what is it when my mother told poor little kitty that her father was dead are you even more sorry than i am that i allowed it are you even more ashamed of me than i am of myself  no i regret that you allowed it but i understand how you were led into that error your husbands infidelity had shaken his hold on your respect for him and your sympathy with him and had so left you without your natural safeguard against mrs prestys sophistical reasoning and bad example but for that wrongdoing there is a remedy left enlighten your child as you have enlightened me and theni have no personal motive for pleading mr herbert linleys cause after what i have seen of himand then acknowledge the fathers claim on the child  do you mean his claim to see her  what else can i mean yes let him see her do god help me now when its too latedo what you ought to have done on that accursed day which will be the blackest day in my calendar to the end of my life  what day do you mean  the day when you remembered the law of man and forgot the law of god the day when you broke the marriage tie the sacred tie by a divorce  she listenednot conscious now of suspense or fear she listened with her whole heart in revolt against him  you are too cruel she declared you can feel for me you can understand me you can pardon me in everything else that i have done but you judge without mercy of the one blameless act of my life since my husband left methe act that protected a mother in the exercise of her rights oh can it be you can it be you  it can be he said sighing bitterly and it is  what horrible delusion possesses you why do you curse the happy day the blessed day which saw me safe in the possession of my child  for the worst and meanest of reasons he answereda selfish reason dont suppose that i have spoken of divorce as one who has had occasion to think of it i have had no occasion to think of it i dont think of it even now i abhor it because it stands between you and me i loathe it i curse it because it separates us for life  separates us for life how  can you ask me  yes i do ask you  he looked round him a society of religious persons had visited the hotel and had obtained permission to place a copy of the bible in every room one of those copies lay on the chimneypiece in catherines room bennydeck brought it to her and placed it on the table near which she was sitting he turned to the new testament and opened it at the gospel of saint matthew with his hand on the page he said  i have done my best rightly to understand the duties of a christian one of those duties as i interpret them is to let what i believe show itself in what i do you have seen enough of me i hope to know though i have not been forward in speaking of it that i am to the best of my poor ability a faithful follower of the teachings of christ i dare not set my own interests and my own happiness above his laws if i suffer in obeying them as i suffer now i must still submit they are the laws of my life  is it through me that you suffer  it is through you  will you tell me how  he had already found the chapter his tears dropped on it as he pointed to the verse  read he answered what the most compassionate of all teachers has said in the sermon on the mount  she read whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery  another innocent woman in her place might have pointed to that first part of the verse which presupposes the infidelity of the divorced wife and might have asked if those words applied to her this woman knowing that she had lost him knew also what she owed to herself she rose in silence and held out her hand at parting  he paused before he took her hand can you forgive me he asked  she said i can pity you  can you look back to the day of your marriage can you remember the words which declared the union between you and your husband to be separable only by death has he treated you with brutal cruelty  never  has he repented of his sin  yes  ask your own conscience if there is not a worthier life for you and your child than the life that you are leading now he waited after that appeal to her the silence remained unbroken do not mistake me he resumed gently i am not thinking of the calamity that has fallen on me in a spirit of selfish despairi am looking to your future and i am trying to show you the way which leads to hope catherine have you no word more to say to me  in faint trembling tones she answered him at last  you have left me but one word to say farewell  he drew her to him gently and kissed her on the forehead the agony in his face was more than she could support she recoiled from it in horror his last act was devoted to the tranquillity of the one woman whom he had loved he signed to her to leave him    chapter liii the largest nature the longest love   mrs presty waited in the garden to be joined by her daughter and captain bennydeck and waited in vain it was past her grandchilds bedtime she decided on returning to the house  suppose we look for them in the sittingroom kitty proposed  suppose we wait a moment before we go in her wise grandmother advised if i hear them talking i shall take you upstairs to bed  why  mrs presty favored kitty with a hint relating to the management of inquisitive children which might prove useful to her in afterlife when you grow up to be a woman my dear beware of making the mistake that i have just committed never be foolish enough to mention your reasons when a child asks why  was that how they treated you grandmamma when you were a child yourself  of course it was  why  they had reached the sittingroom door by this time kitty opened it without ceremony and looked in the room was empty  having confided her granddaughter to the nursemaids care mrs presty knocked at catherines bedroom door may i come in  come in directly where is kitty  susan is putting her to bed  stop it kitty mustnt go to bed no questions ill explain myself when you come back there was a wildness in her eyes and a tone of stern command in her voice which warned her mother to set dignity aside and submit  i dont ask what has happened mrs presty resumed on her return that letter that fatal letter to the captain has justified my worst fears what in heavens name are we to do now  we are to leave this hotel was the instant reply  when  tonight  catherine do you know what time it is  time enough to catch the last train to london dont raise objections if i stay at this place with associations in every part of it which remind me of that unhappy man i shall go mad the shock i have suffered the misery the humiliationi tell you its more than i can bear stay here by yourself if you like i mean to go  she paced with frantic rapidity up and down the room mrs presty took the only way by which it was possible to calm her compose yourself catherine and all that you wish shall be done ill settle everything with the landlord and give the maid her orders sit down by the open window let the wind blow over you  the railway service from sydenham to london is a late service at a few minutes before midnight they were in time for the last train when they left the station catherine was calm enough to communicate her plans for the future the nearest hotel to the terminus would offer them accommodation for that night on the next day they could find some quiet place in the countryno matter where so long as they were not disturbed give me rest and peace and my mind will be easier catherine said let nobody know where to find me  these conditions were strictly observedwith an exception in favor of mr sarrazin while his clients pecuniary affairs were still unsettled the lawyer had his claim to be taken into her confidence                     the next morning found captain bennydeck still keeping his rooms at sydenham the state of his mind presented a complete contrast to the state of catherines mind so far from sharing her aversion to the personal associations which were connected with the hotel he found his one consolation in visiting the scenes which reminded him of the beloved woman whom he had lost the reason for this was not far to seek his was the largest nature and his had been the most devoted love  as usual his letters were forwarded to him from his place of residence in london those addressed in handwritings that he knew were the first that he read the others he took out with him to that sequestered part of the garden in which he had passed the happiest hours of his life by catherines side  he had been thinking of her all the morning he was thinking of her now  his better judgment protested his accusing conscience warned him that he was committing not only an act of folly but with his religious convictions an act of sinand still she held her place in his thoughts the manager had told him of her sudden departure from the hotel and had declared with perfect truth that the place of her destination had not been communicated to him asked if she had left no directions relating to her correspondence he had replied that his instructions were to forward all letters to her lawyer on the point of inquiring next for the name and address bennydecks sense of duty and sense of shame roused at last filled him with a timely contempt for himself in feeling tempted to write to catherinein encouraging fond thoughts of her among scenes which kept her in his memoryhe had been false to the very principles to which he had appealed at their farewell interview she had set him the right example the example which he was determined to follow in leaving the place before he could falter in his resolution he gave notice of his departure the one hope for him now was to find a refuge from himself in acts of mercy consolation was perhaps waiting for him in his home  his unopened correspondence offered a harmless occupation to his thoughts in the meanwhile one after another he read the letters with an attention constantly wandering and constantly recalled until he opened the last of them that remained in a moment more his interest was absorbed the first sentences in the letter told him that the deserted creature whom he had met in the gardenthe stranger to whom he had offered help and consolation in the present and in the futurewas no other than the lost girl of whom he had been so long in search the daughter of roderick westerfield once his dearest and oldest friend  in the pages that followed the writer confided to him her sad story leaving it to her fathers friend to decide whether she was worthy of the sympathy which he had offered to her when he thought she was a stranger  this part of her letter was necessarily a repetition of what bennydeck had read in the confession which catherine had addressed to him that generous woman had been guilty of one and but one concealment of the truth in relating the circumstances under which the elopement from mount morven had taken place she had abstained in justice to the sincerity of sydneys repentance from mentioning sydneys name another instance the captain thought bitterly as he closed the letter of the virtues which might have made the happiness of my life  but he was bound to rememberand he did rememberthat there was now a new interest tenderly associating itself with his life to come the one best way of telling sydney how dear she was to him already for her fathers sake would be to answer her in person he hurried away to london by the first train and drove at once to randals place of abode to ask for sydneys address  wondering what had become of the postscript to his letter which had given bennydeck the information of which he was now in search randal complied with his friends request and then ventured to allude to the report of the captains marriage engagement  am i to congratulate you he asked  congratulate me on having discovered roderick westerfields daughter  that reply and the tone in which it was given led randal to ask if the engagement had been prematurely announced  there is no engagement at all bennydeck answered with a look which suggested that it might be wise not to dwell on the subject  but the discovery was welcome to randal for his brothers sake he ran the risk of consequences and inquired if catherine was still to be found at the hotel  the captain answered by a sign in the negative  randal persisted do you know where she has gone  nobody knows but her lawyer  in that case randal concluded i shall get the information that i want noticing that bennydeck looked surprised he mentioned his motive herbert is pining to see kitty he continued and i mean to help him he has done all that a man could do to atone for the past as things are i believe i shall not offend catherine if i arrange for a meeting between father and child what do you say  bennydeck answered earnestly and eagerly do it at once  they left the house togetherone to go to sydneys lodgings the other on his way to mr sarrazins office     chapter liv let bygones be bygones   when the servant at the lodgings announced a visitor and mentioned his name sydneys memory instead of dwelling on the recollection of the captains kindness perversely recalled the letter that she had addressed to him and reminded her that she stood in need of indulgence which even so good a man might hesitate to grant bennydecks first words told the friendless girl that her fears had wronged him  my dear how like your father you are you have his eyes and his smile i cant tell you how pleasantly you remind me of my dear old friend he took her hand and kissed her as he might have kissed a daughter of his own do you remember me at home sydney when you were a child no you must have been too young for that  she was deeply touched in faint trembling tones she said i remember your name my poor father often spoke of you  a man who feels true sympathy is never in danger of mistaking his way to a womans heart when that woman has suffered bennydeck consoled interested charmed sydney by still speaking of the bygone days at home  i well remember how fond your father was of you and what a bright little girl you were the captain went on you have forgotten i dare say the oldfashioned seasongs that he used to be so fond of teaching you it was the strangest and prettiest contrast to hear your small piping childs voice singing of storms and shipwrecks and thunder and lightning and reefing sails in cold and darkness without the least idea of what it all meant your mother was strict in those days you never amused her as you used to amuse your father and me when she caught you searching my pockets for sweetmeats she accused me of destroying your digestion before you were five years old i went on spoiling it for all that the last time i saw you my child your father was singing the mariners of england and you were on his knee trying to sing with him you must have often wondered why you never saw anything more of me did you think i had forgotten you  i am quite sure i never thought that  you see i was in the navy at the time the captain resumed and we were ordered away to a foreign station when i got back to england miserable news was waiting for me i heard of your fathers death and of that shameful trial poor fellow he was as innocent sydney as you are of the offense which he was accused of committing the first thing i did was to set inquiries on foot after your mother and her children it was some consolation to me to feel that i was rich enough to make your lives easy and agreeable to you i thought money could do anything a serious mistake my dearmoney couldnt find the widow and her children we supposed you were somewhere in london and there to my great grief it ended from time to timelong afterward when we thought we had got the clew in our handsi continued my inquiries still without success a poor woman and her little family are so easily engulfed in the big city years passed more of them than i like to reckon up before i heard of you at last by name the person from whom i got my information told me how you were employed and where  oh captain bennydeck who could the person have been  a poor old brokendown actor sydney you were his favorite pupil do you remember him  i should be ungrateful indeed if i could forget him he was the only person in the school who was kind to me is the good old man still living  no he rests at last i am glad to say i was able to make his last days on earth the happiest days of his life  i wonder sydney confessed how you met with him  there was nothing at all romantic in my first discovery of him i was reading the police reports in a newspaper the poor wretch was brought before a magistrate charged with breaking a window his one last chance of escaping starvation in the streets was to get sent to prison the magistrate questioned him and brought to light a really heartbreaking account of misfortune imbittered by neglect on the part of people in authority who were bound to help him he was remanded so that inquiries might be made i attended the court on the day when he appeared there again and heard his statement confirmed i paid his fine and contrived to put him in a way of earning a little money he was very grateful and came now and then to thank me in that way i heard how his troubles had begun he had asked for a small advance on the wretched wages that he received can you guess how the schoolmistress answered him  i know but too well how she answered him sydney said i was turned out of the house too  and i heard of it the captain replied from the woman herself everything that could distress me she was ready to mention she told me of your mothers second marriage of her miserable death of the poor boy your brother missing and never heard of since but when i asked where you had gone she had nothing more to say she knew nothing and cared nothing about you if i had not become acquainted with mr randal linley i might never have heard of you again we will say no more of that and no more of anything that has happened in the past time from today my dear we begin a new life and please god a happier life have you any plans of your own for the future  perhaps if i could find help sydney said resignedly i might emigrate pride wouldnt stand in my way no honest employment would be beneath my notice besides if i went to america i might meet with my brother  my dear child after the time that has passed there is no imaginable chance of your meeting with your brotherand you wouldnt know each other again if you did meet give up that vain hope and stay here with me be useful and be happy in your own country  useful sydney repeated sadly your own kind heart captain bennydeck is deceiving you to be useful means i suppose to help others who will accept help from me  i will for one the captain answered  you  yes you can be of the greatest use to meyou shall hear how  he told her of the founding of his home and of the good it had done you are the very person he resumed to be the good sisterfriend that i want for my poor girls you can say for them what they cannot always say to me for themselves  the tears rose in sydneys eyes it is hard to see such a prospect as that she said and to give it up as soon as it is seen  why give it up  because i am not fit for it you are as good as a father to those lost daughters of yours if you give them a sisterfriend she ought to have set them a good example have i done that will they listen to a girl who is no better than themselves  gladly your sympathy will find its way to their hearts because it is animated by something that they can all feel in commonsomething nearer and dearer to them than a sense of duty you wont consent sydney for their sakes will you do what i ask of you for my sake  she looked at him hardly able to understandor as it might have been perhaps afraid to understand him he spoke to her more plainly  i have kept it concealed from you he continuedfor why should i lay my load of suffering on a friend so young as you are so cruelly tried already let me only say that i am in great distress if you were with me my child i might be better able to bear it  he held out his hand even a happy woman could hardly have found it in her heart to resist him in silent sympathy and respect sydney kissed the hand that he had offered to her it was the one way in which she could trust herself to answer him  still encouraging her to see new hopes and new interests in the future the good captain spoke of the share which she might take in the management of the home if she would like to be his secretary with this view he showed her some written reports relating to the institution which had been sent to him during the time of his residence at sydenham she read them with an interest and attention which amply justified his confidence in her capacity  these reports he explained to her are kept for reference but as a means of saving time the substance of them is entered in the daily journal of our proceedings come sydney venture on a first experiment in your new character i see pen ink and paper on the table try if you can shorten one of the reports without leaving out anything which it is important to know for instance the writer gives reasons for making his statement very well expressed no doubt but we dont want reasons then again he offers his own opinion on the right course to take very creditable to him but i dont want his opinioni want his facts take the pen my secretary and set down his facts never mind his reflections  proud and pleased sydney obeyed him she had made her little abstract and was reading it to him at his request while he compared it with the report when they were interrupted by a visitor randal linley came in and noticed the papers on the table with surprise is it possible that i am interrupting business he asked  bennydeck answered with the assumed air of importance which was in itself a compliment to sydney you find me engaged on the business of the home with my new secretary  randal at once understood what had happened he took his friends arm and led him to the other end of the room  you good fellow he said add to your kindness by excusing me if i ask for a word with you in private  sydney rose to retire after having encouraged her by a word of praise the captain proposed that she should get ready to go out and should accompany him on a visit to the home he opened the door for her as respectfully as if the poor girl had been one of the highest ladies in the land  i have seen my friend sarrazin randal began and i have persuaded him to trust me with catherines present address i can send herbert there immediately if you will only help me  how can i help you  will you allow me to tell my brother that your engagement is broken off  bennydeck shrank from the painful allusion and showed it  randal explained i am grieved he said to distress you by referring to this subject again but if my brother is left under the false impression that your engagement will be followed by your marriage he will refuse to intrude himself on the lady who was once his wife  the captain understood say what you please about me he replied unite the father and childand you may reconcile the husband and wife  have you forgotten randal asked that the marriage has been dissolved  bennydecks answer ignored the law i remember he said that the marriage has been profaned     chapter lv leave it to the child   the front windows of brightwater cottage look out on a quiet green lane in middlesex which joins the highroad within a few miles of the market town of uxbridge through the pretty garden at the back runs a little brook winding its merry way to a distant river the few rooms in this pleasant place of residence are well too well furnished having regard to the limits of a building which is a cottage in the strictest sense of the word watercolor drawings by the old english masters of the art ornament the diningroom the parlor has been transformed into a library from floor to ceiling all four of its walls are covered with books their old and wellchosen bindings seen in the mass present nothing less than a feast of color to the eye the library and the works of art are described as heirlooms which have passed into the possession of the present proprietorone more among the hundreds of englishmen who are ruined every year by betting on the turf  so sorely in need of a little ready money was this victim of gamblingtacitly permitted or conveniently ignored by the audacious hypocrisy of a country which rejoiced in the extinction of baden and which still shudders at the name of monacothat he was ready to let his pretty cottage for no longer a term than one month certain and he even allowed the elderly lady who drove the hardest of hard bargains with him to lessen by one guinea the houserent paid for each week he took his revenge by means of an ironical compliment addressed to mrs presty what a saving it would be to the country maam if you were chancellor of the exchequer with perfect gravity mrs presty accepted that wellearned tribute of praise you are quite right sir i should be the first official person known to the history of england who took proper care of the public money  within two days of the time when they had left the hotel at sydenham catherine and her little family circle had taken possession of the cottage  the two ladies were sitting in the library each occupied with a book chosen from the wellstocked shelves catherines reading appeared to be more than once interrupted by catherines thoughts noticing this circumstance mrs presty asked if some remarkable event had happened and if it was weighing heavily on her daughters mind  catherine answered that she was thinking of kitty and that anxiety connected with the child did weigh heavily on her mind  some days had passed she reminded mrs presty since the interview at which herbert linley had bidden her farewell on that occasion he had referred to her proposed marriage never to be a marriage now in terms of forbearance and generosity which claimed her sincerest admiration it might be possible for her to show a grateful appreciation of his conduct devotedly fond of his little daughter he must have felt acutely his long separation from her and it was quite likely that he might ask to see kitty but there was an obstacle in the way of her willing compliance with that request which it was impossible to think of without remorse and which it was imperatively necessary to remove mrs presty would understand that she alluded to the shameful falsehood which had led the child to suppose that her father was dead  strongly disapproving of the language in which her daughter had done justice to the conduct of the divorced husband mrs presty merely replied you are kittys mother i leave it to youand returned to her reading  catherine could not feel that she had deserved such an answer as this did i plan the deception she asked did i tell the lie  mrs presty was not in the least offended you are comparatively innocent my dear she admitted with an air of satirical indulgence you only consented to the deception and profited by the lie suppose we own the truth you are afraid  catherine owned the truth in the plainest terms  yes i am afraid  and you leave it to me  i leave it to you  mrs presty complacently closed her book i was quite prepared to hear it she said all the unpleasant complications since your divorceand heaven only knows how many of them have presented themselveshave been left for me to unravel it so happensthough i was too modest to mention it prematurelythat i have unraveled this complication if one only has eyes to see it there is a way out of every difficulty that can possibly happen she pushed the book that she had been reading across the table to catherine turn to page two hundred and forty she said there is the way out  the title of the book was disasters at sea and the page contained the narrative of a shipwreck on evidence apparently irresistible the drowning of every soul on board the lost vessel had been taken for grantedwhen a remnant of the passengers and crew had been discovered on a desert island and had been safely restored to their friends having read this record of suffering and suspense catherine looked at her mother and waited for an explanation  dont you see it mrs presty asked  i cant say that i do  the old ladys excellent temper was not in the least ruffled even by this  quite inexcusable on my part she acknowledged i ought to have remembered that you dont inherit your mothers vivid imagination age has left me in full possession of those powers of invention which used to amaze your poor father he wondered how it was that i never wrote a novel mr prestys appreciation of my intellect was equally sincere but he took a different view beware my dear he said of trifling with the distinction which you now enjoy you are one of the most remarkable women in englandyou have never written a novel pardon me i am wandering into the region of literary anecdote when i ought to explain myself now pray attend to thisi propose to tell kitty that i have found a book which is sure to interest her and i shall direct her attention to the lamentable story which you have just read she is quite sharp enough there are sparks of my intellectual fire in kitty to ask if the friends of the poor shipwrecked people were not very much surprised to see them again to this i shall answer very much indeed for their friends thought they were dead ah you dear dull child you see it now  catherine saw it so plainly that she was eager to put the first part of the experiment to an immediate trial  kitty was sent for and made her appearance with a fishingrod over her shoulder im going to the brook she announced expect some fish for dinner today  a wary old hand stopped catherine in the act of presenting disasters at sea to kittys notice and a voice distinguished by insinuating kindness said to the child when you have done fishing my dear come to me i have got a nice book for you to readhow very absurd of you catherine mrs presty continued when they were alone again to expect the child to read and draw her own conclusions while her head is full of fishing if there are any fish in the brook she wont catch them when she comes back disappointed and says what am i to do now the disasters at sea will have a chance i make it a rule never to boast but if there is a thing that i understand its the management of children why didnt i have a large family  attended by the faithful susan kitty baited her hook and began to fish where the waters of the brook were overshadowed by trees  a little arbor covered by a thatched roof and having walls of wooden latticework hidden by creepers climbing over them inside and out offered an attractive place of rest on this sheltered side of the garden having brought her work with her the nursemaid retired to the summerhouse and diligently plied her needle looking at kitty from time to time through the open door the air was delightfully cool the pleasant rippling of the brook fell soothingly on the ear the seat in the summerhouse received a sitter with the softlyyielding submission of elastic wires susan had just finished her early dinner in mind and body alike this good girl was entirely and deservedly at her ease by finely succeeding degrees her eyelids began to show a tendency downward her truant needlework escaped from her fingers and lay lazily on her lap she snatched it up with a start and sewed with severe resolution until her thread was exhausted the reel was ready at her side she took it up for a fresh supply and innocently rested her head against the leafy and flowery wall of the arbor was it thought that gradually closed her eyes again or was it sleep in either case susan was lost to all sense of passing events and susans breathing became musically regular emulous of the musical regularity of the brook  as a lesson in patience the art of angling pursued in a shallow brook has its moral uses kitty fished and waited and renewed the bait and tried again with a command of temper which would have been a novelty in susans experience if susan had been awake but the end which comes to all things came also to kittys patience leaving her rod on the bank she let the line and hook take care of themselves and wandered away in search of some new amusement  lingering here and there to gather flowers from the beds as she passed them kitty was stopped by a shrubbery with a rustic seat placed near it which marked the limits of the garden on that side the path that she had been following led her further and further away from the brook but still left it well in view she could see on her right hand the clumsy old wooden bridge which crossed the stream and served as a means of communication for the servants and the tradespeople between the cottage and the village on the lower ground a mile away  the child felt hot and tired she rested herself on the bench and spreading the flowers by her side began to arrange them in the form of a nosegay still true to her love for sydney she had planned to present the nosegay to her mother offering the gift as an excuse for returning to the forbidden subject of her governess and for asking when they might hope to see each other again  choosing flowers and then rejecting them trying other colors and wondering whether she had accomplished a change for the better kitty was startled by the sound of a voice calling to her from the direction of the brook  she looked round and saw a gentleman crossing the bridge he asked the way to brightwater cottage  there was something in his voice that attracted herhow or why at her age she never thought of inquiring eager and excited she ran across the lawn which lay between her and the brook before she answered the gentlemans question  as they approached each other his eyes sparkled his face flushed he cried out joyfully here she isand then changed again in an instant a horrid pallor overspread his face as the child stood looking at him with innocent curiosity he startled kitty not because he seemed to be shocked and distressed she hardly noticed that but because he was so likealthough he was thinner and paler and olderoh so like her lost father  this is the cottage sir she said faintly  his sorrowful eyes rested kindly on her and yet it seemed as if she had in some way disappointed him the child ventured to say do you know me sir  he answered in the saddest voice that kitty had ever heard my little girl what makes you think i know you  she was at a loss how to reply fearing to distress him she could only say you are so like my poor papa  he shook and shuddered as if she had said something to frighten him he took her hand on that hot day his fingers felt as cold as if it had been winter time he led her back to the seat that she had left im tired my dear he said shall we sit down it was surely true that he was tired he seemed hardly able to lift one foot after the other kitty pitied him i think you must be ill she said as they took their places side by side on the bench  no not ill only weary and perhaps a little afraid of frightening you he kept her hand in his hand and patted it from time to time my dear why did you say poor papa when you spoke of your father just now  my father is dead sir  he turned his face away from her and pressed both hands on his breast as if he had felt some dreadful pain there and was trying to hide it but he mastered the pain and he said a strange thing to hervery gently but still it was strange he wished to know who had told her that her father was dead  grandmamma told me  do you remember what grandmamma said  yesshe told me papa was drowned at sea  he said something to himself and said it twice over not her mother thank god not her mother what did he mean  kitty looked and looked at him and wondered and wondered he put his arm round her come near to me he said dont be afraid of me my dear she moved nearer and showed him that she was not afraid the poor man seemed hardly to understand her his eyes grew dim he sighed like a person in distress he said your father would have kissed you little one if he had been alive you say i am like your father may i kiss you  she put her hands on his shoulder and lifted her face to him in the instant when he kissed her the child knew him her heart beat suddenly with an overpowering delight she started back from his embrace thats how papa used to kiss me she cried oh you are papa not drowned not drowned she flung her arms round his neck and held him as if she would never let him go again dear papa poor lost papa his tears fell on her face he sobbed over her my sweet darling my own little kitty  the hysterical passion that had overcome her father filled her with piteous surprise how strange how dreadful that he should crythat he should be so sorry when she was so glad she took her little handkerchief out of the pocket of her pinafore and dried his eyes are you thinking of the cruel sea papa no the good sea the kind bright beautiful sea that has given you back to me and to mamma  they had forgotten her motherand kitty only discovered it now she caught at one of her fathers hands hanging helpless at his side and pulled at it as if her little strength could force him to his feet come she cried and make mamma as happy as i am  he hesitated she sprang on his knee she pressed her cheek against his cheek with the caressing tenderness familiar to him in the first happy days when she was an infant oh papa are you going to be unkind to me for the first time in your life  his momentary resistance was at an end he was as weak in her hands now as if he had been the child and she had been the man  laughing and singing and dancing round him kitty led the way to the window of the room that opened on the garden some one had closed it on the inner side she tapped impatiently at the glass her mother heard the tapping her mother came to the window her mother ran out to meet them since the miserable time when they left mount morven since the long unnatural separation of the parents and the child those three were together once more    after the story    1the lawyers apology   that a woman of my wifes mature years should be jealous of one of the most exemplary husbands that the records of matrimony can produce is to say the least of it a discouraging circumstance a man forgets that virtue is its own reward and asks what is the use of conjugal fidelity  however the motto of married life is or ought to be peace at any price i have been this day relieved from the condition of secrecy that has been imposed on me you insisted on an explanation some time since here it is at last  for the tenthousandth time my dear in our joint lives you are again right that letter marked private which i received at the domestic teatable was what you positively declared it to be a letter from a ladya charming lady plunged in the deepest perplexity we had been well known to each other for many years as lawyer and client she wanted advice on this occasion alsoand wanted it in the strictest confidence was it consistent with my professional duty to show her letter to my wife mrs sarrazin says yes mrs sarrazins husband says no  let me add that the lady was a person of unblemished reputation and that she was placed in a false position through no fault of her own in plain english she was divorced ah my dear to speak in the vivid language of the people do you smell a rat  yes my client was mrs norman and to her pretty cottage in the country i betook myself the next day there i found my excellent friend randal linley present by special invitation  stop a minute why do i write all this instead of explaining myself by word of mouth my love you are a member of an old and illustrious family you honored me when you married me and you have as your father told me on our wedding day the high and haughty temper of your race i foresee an explosion of this temper and i would rather have my writingpaper blown up than be blown up myself  is this a cowardly confession on my part all courage mrs sarrazin is relative the bravest man living has a cowardly side to his character though it may not always be found out some years ago at a public dinner i sat next to an officer in the british army at one time in his life he had led a forlorn hope at another time he had picked up a wounded soldier and had carried him to the care of the surgeons through a hailstorm of the enemys bullets hot courage and cool courage this true hero possessed both i saw the cowardly side of his character he lost his color perspiration broke out on his forehead he trembled he talked nonsense he was frightened out of his wits and all for what because he had to get on his legs and make a speech  well mrs norman and randal linley and i sat down to our consultation at the cottage  what did my fair client want  she contemplated marrying for the second time and she wanted my advice as a lawyer and my encouragement as an old friend i was quite ready i only waited for particulars mrs norman became dreadfully embarrassed and said i refer you to my brotherinlaw  i looked at randal once her brotherinlaw no doubt i said but after the divorce my friend stopped me there after the divorce he remarked i may be her brotherinlaw again  if this meant anything it meant that she was actually going to marry herbert linley again this was too ridiculous if its a joke i said i have heard better fun in my time if its only an assertion i dont believe it  why not randal asked  saying i do want you in one breathand i dont want you in anotherseems to be a little hard on divorce i ventured to suggest  dont expect me to sympathize with divorce randal said  i answered that smartly no ill wait till you are married  he took it seriously dont misunderstand me he replied where there is absolute cruelty or where there is deliberate desertion on the husbands part i see the use and the reason for divorce if the unhappy wife can find an honorable man who will protect her or an honorable man who will offer her a home society and law which are responsible for the institution of marriage are bound to allow a woman outraged under the shelter of their institution to marry again but where the husbands fault is sexual frailty i say the english law which refuses divorce on that ground alone is right and the scotch law which grants it is wrong religion which rightly condemns the sin pardons it on the condition of true penitence why is a wife not to pardon it for the same reason why are the lives of a father a mother and a child to be wrecked when those lives may be saved by the exercise of the first of christian virtuesforgiveness of injuries in such a case as this i regret that divorce exists and i rejoice when husband and wife and child are one flesh again reunited by the law of nature which is the law of god  i might have disputed with him but i thought he was right i also wanted to make sure of the facts am i really to understand i asked that mr herbert linley is to be this ladys husband for the second time  if there is no lawful objection to it randal saiddecidedly yes  my good wife in all your experience you never saw your husband stare as he stared at that moment here was a lady divorced by her own lawful desire and at her own personal expense thinking better of it after no very long interval and proposing to marry the man again was there ever anything so grossly improbable where is the novelist who would be bold enough to invent such an incident as this  never mind the novelist how did it end  of course it could only end in one way so far as i was concerned the case being without precedent in my experience i dropped my professional character at the outset speaking next as a friend i had only to say to mrs norman the law has declared you and mr herbert linley to be single people do what other single people do buy a license and give notice at a churchand by all means send wedding cards to the judge who divorced you  said and in another fortnight done mr and mrs herbert linley were married again this morning and randal and i were the only witnesses present at the ceremony which was strictly private    2the lawyers defense    i wonder whether the foregoing pages of my writingpaper have been torn to pieces and thrown into the wastepaper basket you wouldnt litter the carpet no i may be torn in pieces but i do you justice for all that  what are the objections to the divorced husband and wife becoming husband and wife again mrs presty has stated them in the following order am i wrong in assuming that on this occasion at least you will agree with mrs presty  first objection nobody has ever done such a thing before  second objection penitent or not penitent mr herbert linley doesnt deserve it  third objection no respectable person will visit them  first reply the question is not whether the thing has been done before but whether the doing of the thing is right in itself there is no clause in the marriage service forbidding a wife to forgive her husband but there is a direct prohibition to any separation between them it is therefore not wrong to forgive mr herbert linley and it is absolutely right to marry him again  second reply when their child brings him home and takes it for granted that her father and mother should live together because they are her father and mother innocent kitty has appealed from the law of divorce to the law of nature whether herbert linley has deserved it or whether he has not there he is in the only fit place for himand there is an end of the second objection  third reply a flat contradiction to the assertion that no respectable person will visit her mrs sarrazin will visit her yes you will my dear not because i insist upon itdo i ever insist on anything no you will act on your own responsibility out of compassion for a misguided old woman judge for yourself when you read what follows if mrs presty is not sadly in need of the good example of an ornament to her sex  the evil genius of the family joined us in the cottage parlor when our consultations had come to an end i had the honor of communicating the decision at which we had arrived mrs presty marched to the door and from that commanding position addressed a few farewell remarks to her daughter  i have done with you catherine you have reached the limits of my maternal endurance at last i shall set up my own establishment and live againin memorywith mr norman and mr presty may you be happy i dont anticipate it  she left the roomand came back again for a last word addressed this time to randal linley  when you next see your friend captain bennydeck give him my compliments mr randal and say i congratulate him on having been jilted by my daughter it would have been a sad thing indeed if such a sensible man had married an idiot goodmorning  she left the room again and came back again for another last word addressed on this occasion to me her better nature made an effort to express itself not altogether without success  i think it is quite likely mr sarrazin that some dreadful misfortune will fall on my daughter as the punishment of her undutiful disregard of her mothers objections in that case i shall feel it my duty to return and administer maternal consolation when you write address me at my bankers i make allowances for a lawyer sir i dont blame you  she opened the door for the third timestepped out and stepped back again into the roomsuddenly gave her daughter a fierce kissreturned to the doorshook her fist at mrs linley with a theatricallythreatening gesturesaid unnatural childand after this exhibition of her better nature and her worse left us at last when you visit the remarried pair on their return from their second honeymoon take mrs presty with you    3the lawyers last word   when you force this ridiculous and regrettable affair on my attention i think i hear mrs sarrazin say the least you can do is to make your narrative complete but perhaps you propose to tell me personally what has become of kitty and what welldeserved retribution has overtaken miss westerfield  no i propose in this case also to communicate my information in writingat the safe distance from home of lincolns inn fields  kitty accompanies her father and mother to the continent of course but she insisted on first saying goodby to the dear friend once the dear governess whom she loves randal and i volunteered to take her with her mothers ready permission to see miss westerfield try not to be angry try not to tear me up  we found captain bennydeck and his pretty secretary enjoying a little rest and refreshment after a long mornings work for the good of the home the captain was carving the chicken and sydney by his side was making the salad the housecat occupied a third chair with her eyes immovably fixed on the movements of the knife and fork perhaps i was thinking of sad past days anyway it seemed to me to be as pretty a domestic scene as a man could wish to look at the arrival of kitty made the picture complete  our visit was necessarily limited by a due remembrance of the hour of departure by an early tidal train kittys last words to sydney bade her bear their next meeting in mind and not be melancholy at only saying goodby for a time like all children she asks strange questions when we were out in the street again she said to her uncle do you think my nice captain will marry syd  randal had noticed in captain bennydecks face signs which betrayed that the bitterest disappointment of his life was far from being a forgotten disappointment yet if it had been put by any other person poor kittys absurd question might have met with a bitter reply as it was her uncle only said my dear child that is no business of yours or mine  not in the least discouraged kitty turned to me what do you think samuel  i followed randals lead and answered how should i know  the child looked from one to the other of us shall i tell you what i think she said i think you are both of you humbugs
