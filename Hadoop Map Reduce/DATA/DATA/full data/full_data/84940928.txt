moving off as she hurried upon the platform old matthews the stout and chubbycheeked  stationmaster seized her most unceremoniously  by the left arm and bundled her into a carriage  he had known her from a child so he could venture upon such liberties  second class miss yes miss here yare  look sharp please any more goin on all right tom go ahead there and lifting his left hand he whistled a shrill signal to the guard to start her  as for elma somewhat hot in the face with the wild rush for her ticket and grasping her uncounted change pence and all in her little gloved hand she found herself thrust haphazard at the very last moment into the last compartment of the last carriage alonewith an artist  now you and i to be sure most proverbially courteous and intelligent reader might never have guessed at first sight from the young mans outer aspect the nature of his occupation the gross and clumsy male intellect which works in accordance with the stupid laws of inductive logic has a queer habit of requiring something or other in the way of definite evidence before it commits itself offhand to the distinct conclusion but elma clifford was a woman and therefore she knew a more excellent way her habit was rather to look things once fairly and squarely in the face and then with the unerring intuition of her sex to make up her mind about them firmly at once and for ever thats one of the many glorious advantages  of being born a woman you dont need to learn in order to know you know instinctively and yet our girls want to go to girton and train themselves up to be senior wranglers  elma clifford however had not been to girton so as she stumbled into her place she snatched one hurried look at cyril wirings face and knew at a glance he was a landscape painter  now this was clever of her even in a woman for cyril waring as he fondly imagined was travelling that line that day disguised as a stockbroker in other words there was none of the brown velveteen affectation about his easy getup he was an artist to be sure but he hadnt assiduously and obtrusively dressed his character instead of cutting his beard to a vandyke point or enduing his body in a titianesque  coat or wearing on his head a slouched rembrandt hat stuck carelessly just a trifle on one side in artistic disorder he was habited for all the world like anybody else in the grey tweed suit of the common british tourist surmounted by the light felt hat or bowler to match of the modern english country gentleman  even the soft silk necktie of a delicate aesthetic hue that adorned his open throat didnt proclaim him at once a painter by trade it showed him merely as a man of taste with a decided eye for harmonies of colour  so when elma pronounced her fellowtraveller  immediately in her own mind a landscape artist she was exercising the familiar feminine prerogative of jumping as if by magic to a correct conclusion its a provoking way they have those inscrutable women which no mere male human being can ever conceivably fathom  she was just about to drop down as propriety demands into the corner seat diagonally opposite  toand therefore as far as possible away fromher  handsome companion when the stranger rose and with a very flushed face said in a hasty though markedly deferential and apologetic tone  i beg your pardon butexcuse me for mentioning iti think youre going to sit down uponurpray dont be frighteneda rather large snake of mine  there was something so comically alarmed in the ring of his toneas of a naughty schoolboy detected in a piece of mischiefthat propriety to the contrary notwithstanding elma couldnt for the life of her repress a smile she looked down at the seat where the stranger pointed and there sure enough coiled up in huge folds with his glossy head in attitude to spring at her a great banded snake lay alert and openeyed  dear me elma cried drawing back a little in surprise but not at all in horror as she felt she ought to do a snake how curious i hope hes not dangerous  not at all the young man answered still in the same halfguilty tone of voice as before hes of a poisonous kind you know but his fangs have been extracted he wont do you any injury hes perfectly harmless arent you sardanapalus eh eh my beauty but i oughtnt to have let him loose in the carriage of course he added after a short pause  its calculated to alarm a nervous passenger only i thought i was alone and nobody would come in so i let him out for a bit of a run between the stations  its so dull for him poor fellow being shut up in his box all the time when hes travelling  elma looked down at the beautiful glossy creature with genuine admiration his skin was like enamel his banded scales shone bright and silvery she didnt know why but somehow she felt she wasnt in the least afraid of him i suppose one ought to be repelled at once by a snake she said taking the opposite seat and keeping her glance fixed firmly upon the reptiles eye but then this is such a handsome one i cant say why but i dont feel afraid of him at all as i ought to do every rightminded person detests snakes dont they and yet how exquisitely flexible and beautiful he is oh pray dont put him back in his box for me hes basking in the sun here  i should be sorry to disturb him  cyril waring looked at her in considerable surprise  he caught the creature in his hands as he spoke and transferred it at once to a tin box with a perforated lid that lay beside him go back sardanapalus he said in a very musical and pleasant voice forcing the huge beast into the lair with gentle but masterful hands go back and go to sleep sir its time for your nap  oh no i couldnt think of letting him out any more in the carriage to the annoyance of others im ashamed enough as it is of having unintentionally alarmed you but you came in so  unexpectedly you see i hadnt time to put my queer pet away and when the door opened i was afraid he might slip out or get under the seats so all i could do was just to soothe him with my hand and keep him quiet till the door was shut to again  indeed i wasnt at all afraid of him elma answered slipping her change into her pocket and looking prettier through her blush than even her usual self on the contrary i really liked to see him  hes such a glorious snake the lights and shades on his back are so glancing and so wonderful hes a perfect model of course youre painting him  the stranger started im painting himyes thats true he replied with a look of sudden surprise but why of course please how on earth could you tell i was an artist even  elma glanced back in his face and wondered to herself too now she came to think of it how did she know that handsome young man with the charming  features and the expressive eyes and the neatlycut  brown beard and the attractive manner was an artist at all or anything like it and how did she know the snake was his model for the life of her she couldnt have answered those questions herself  i suppose i just guessed it she answered after a short pause blushing still more deeply at the sudden way she had thus been dragged into conversation with the goodlooking stranger elmas skin was darka clear and creamy olivebrown complexion such as one sometimes sees in southern europe though rarely in england and the effect of the blush through it didnt pass unnoticed by cyril warings artistic eye he would have given something for the chance of  transferring that delicious effect to canvas the delicate transparency of the blush threw up those piercing dark eyes and reflected lustre even on the glossy black hair that fringed her forehead not an english type of beauty at all elma cliffords he thought to himself as he eyed her closely rather spanish or italian or say even hungarian  well you guessed right at any rate he went on settling down in his seat once more after boxing his snake but this time face to face with her im working at a beautiful bit of fern and foliagequite tropical in its wayin a wood hereabout and ive introduced sardanapalus coiled up in the foreground  just to give life to the scene dont you know and an excuse for a title i mean to call it the rajahs rest behind great ferns and a mossy bank in front sardanapalus after tiffin rolled spirally round and taking his siesta  this meeting was a longwishedfor occasion elma had never before met a real live painter now it was the cherished idea of her youth to see something some day of that wonderful nonexistent fantastic world which we still hope for and dream about and call bohemia she longed to move in literary and artistic circles she had fashioned to herself like many other romantic girls a rosecoloured picture of bohemian existence not knowing indeed that bohemia is now alas an extinct province since belgravia and  kensington swallowed it bodily down digested and  assimilated it so this casual talk with the handsome young artist in the secondclass carriage on the great southern line was to elma as a charming and delightful glimpse of an enchanted region she could never enter it was paradise to the peri she turned the conversation at once therefore with resolute intent upon art and artists determined to make the most while it lasted of this unique opportunity and since the subject of self with an attentive listener is always an attractive one even to modest young men like cyril waringespecially when its a pretty girl who encourages you to dilate upon itwhy the consequence was that before many minutes were over the handsome young man was discoursing from his full heart to a sympathetic soul about his chosen art its hopes and its ideals accompanied by a running fire of thumbnail illustrations he had even got so far in the course of their intimacy as to take out the portfolio which lay hidden under the seatout of deference to his disguise as a stockbroker no doubtand to display before elmas delighted eyes with many explanatory comments as to light and shade or perspective and foreshortening the studies for the picture he had just then engaged upon  byandby as his enthusiasm warmed under elmas encouragement the young artist produced sardanapalus himself once more from his box and with deftly persuasive fingers coiled him gracefully round on the opposite seat into the precise attitude he was expected to take up when he sat for his portrait in the mossy foreground  elma couldnt say why but that creature fascinated her the longer she looked at him the more intensely he interested her not that she was one bit afraid of him as she might reasonably have expected to be according to all womanly precedent on the contrary  she felt an overwhelming desire to take him up in her own hands and stroke and fondle him he was so lithe and beautiful his scales so glistened at last she stretched out one dainty gloved hand to pet the spotted neck  take care the painter cried in a warning voice dont be frightened if he springs at you hes vicious at times but his fangs are drawn he cant possibly hurt you  the warning however was quite unnecessary sardanapalus  instead of springing seemed to recognise a friend he darted out his forked tongue in rapid vibration  and licked her neat grey glove respectfully then lifting his flattened head with serpentine deliberation he coiled his great folds slowly slowly with sinuous curves round the girls soft arm till he reached her neck in long winding convolutions there he held up his face and trilled his swift sibilant tongue once more with evident pleasure he knew his place he was perfectly at home at once with the pretty oliveskinned  lady his master looked on in profound surprise  why youre a perfect snakecharmer he cried at last regarding her with open eyes of wonder i never saw sardanapalus behave like that with a stranger before hes generally by no means fond of new acquaintances you must be used to snakes perhaps youve kept one youre accustomed of old to their ways and manners  no indeed elma cried laughing in spite of herself  a clear little laugh of feminine triumph for she had made a conquest she saw of sardanapalus i never so much as touched one in all my life before  and i thought i should hate them but this one seems quite tame and tractable im not in the least afraid of him he is so soft and smooth and his movements are all so perfectly gentle  ah thats the way with snakes always cyril waring put in with an admiring glance at the pretty fearless brunette and her strange companion they know at once whether people like them or not and they govern themselves accordingly i suppose its instinct when they see youre afraid of them they spring and hiss but when they see you take to them by nature they make themselves perfectly at home in a moment they dont wait to be asked  theyve no false modesty well then you see he went on drawing imaginary lines with his ticket on the sketch he was holding up i shall work in sardanapalus  just there like that coiled round in a spire  you catch the idea dont you  as he spoke elmas eye following his hand while it moved chanced to fall suddenly on the name of the station printed on the ticket with which he was pointing  she gave a sharp little start  warnworth she cried flushing up with some slight embarrassment in her voice why thats ever so far back were long past warnworth we ran by it  three or four stations behind in fact its the next place to chetwood where i got in at  cyril waring looked up with a halfguilty smile as embarrassed as her own  oh yes he said quietly i knew that quite well  im down here often its halfway between chetwood and warnworth im painting but i thoughtwell if youll excuse me saying it i thought i was so  comfortable and so happy where i was that i might just as well go on a station or two more and then pay the difference and take the next train back to warnworth  you see he added after a pause with a still more apologetic and penitent air i saw you were so interested  inwell in snakes you know and pictures  gentle as he was and courteous and perfectly frank with her elma nevertheless felt really half inclined to be angry at this queer avowal that is to say at least she knew it was her bounden duty as an english lady to seem so and she seemed so accordingly with most britannic severity she drew herself up in a very stiff style and stared fixedly at him while she began slowly and steadily to uncoil sardanapalus from her imprisoned arm with profound dignity  im sorry i should have brought you so far out of your way she said in a studied cold voicethough that was quite untrue for as a matter of fact she had enjoyed their talk together immensely and besides youve been wasting your valuable time when you ought to have been painting youll hardly get any work done  now at all this morning i must ask you to get out at the very next station  the young man bowed with a crestfallen air no time could possibly be wasted he began with native politeness that was spent then he broke off quite suddenly i shall certainly get out wherever you wish he went on more slowly in an altered voice and i sincerely regret if ive unwittingly done  anything to annoy you in any way the fact is the talk carried me away it was art that misled me i didnt mean im sure to obtrude myself upon you  and even as he spoke they whisked unawares into the darkness of a tunnel       chapter ii  twos company      elma was just engaged in debating with herself internally  how a young lady of perfect manners and impeccable  breeding travelling without a chaperon ought to behave under such trying circumstances after having allowed herself to be drawn unawares into familiar conversation with a most attractive young artist when all of a sudden a rapid jerk of the carriage succeeded in extricating her perforce and against her will from this awkward dilemma something sharp pulled up their train unexpectedly she was aware of a loud noise and a crash in front almost instantaneously followed by a thrilling jara low dull thuda sound of broken glassa quick blank stoppage next instant she found herself flung wildly forward into her neighbours arms while the artist for his part with outstretched hands was vainly endeavouring to break the force of the fall for her  all she knew for the first few minutes was merely that there had been an accident to the train and they were standing still now in the darkness of the tunnel  for some seconds she paused and gasped hard for  breath and tried in vain to recall her scattered senses  then slowly she sank back on the seat once more vaguely conscious that something terrible had happened to the train but that neither she nor her companion were seriously injured  as she sank back in her place cyril waring bent forward towards her with sympathetic kindliness  youre not hurt i hope he said holding out one hand to help her rise stand up for a minute and see if youre anything worse than severely shaken  no thats right then thats well as far as it goes but im afraid the nervous shock must have been very rough on you  elma stood tip with tears gathering fast in her eyes  shed have given the world to be able to cry now for the jar had half stunned her and shaken her brain but before the artists face she was ashamed to give free play to her feelings so she only answered in a careless  sort of tone  oh its nothing much i think my head feels rather queer but ive no bones broken a collision i suppose oughtnt we to get out at once and see whats happened to the other people  cyril waring moved hastily to the door and letting  down the window tried with a violent effort to turn the handle from the outside but the door wouldnt open as often happens in such accidents the jar had jammed it he tried the other side and with some difficulty at last succeeded in forcing it open  then he descended cautiously on to the sixfootway and held out his hand to help elma from the carriage  it was no collision he saw at once but a far more curious and unusual accident  looking ahead through the tunnel all was black as night a dense wall of earth seemed to block and fill in the whole space in front of them part of one broken and shattered carriage lay tossed about in wild confusion on the ground close by their own had escaped all the rest was darkness  in a moment cyril rightly divined what must have happened to the train the roof of the tunnel had caved in on top of it at least one carriagethe one immediately in front of themhad been crushed and shattered by the force of its fall their own was the last and it had been saved as if by a miracle it lay just outside the scene of the subsidence  one thought rose instinctively at once in the young mans mind they must first see if any one was injured in the other compartments or among the débris of the broken carriage and then they must make for the open mouth of the tunnel through which the light of day still gleamed bright behind them  he peered in hastily at the other three windows  not a soul in any one of the remaining compartments  it was a very empty train he had noticed himself when he had got in at tilgate the one solitary occupant of the front compartment of their carriage a fat old lady with a big black bag had bundled out at chetwood  they were alone in the tunnelat this end of the train at least their sole duty now was to make haste and save themselves  he gazed overhead the tunnel was bricked in with an arch on top the way through in front was blocked of course by the fallen mass of waterlogged sandstone  he glanced back towards the open mouth a curious circumstance halfway down to the opening attracted at once his keen and practised eye  strange to say the roof at one spot was not a true arc of a circle it bulged slightly downwards in a flattened arch as if some superincumbent weight were pressing hard upon it great heavens what was this  another trouble in store he looked again still more earnestly and started with horror  in the twinkling of an eye his reason told him beyond the shadow of a doubt what was happening at the bulge a second fall was just about to take place close by them clearly there were two weak points m the roof of the tunnel one had already given way in front the other was on the very eve of giving way behind them if it fell they were imprisoned between two impassable walls of sand and earth without one instants delay he turned and seized his companions hand hastily  quick quick he cried in a voice of eager warning  run run for your life to the mouth of the tunnel here come youve only just time its going its going  but elmas feminine instinct worked quicker and truer than even cyril warings manly reason she didnt know why she couldnt say how but in that one indivisible moment of time she had taken in and grasped to the full all the varying terrors of the  situation instead of running however she held back her companion with a nervous force she could never before have imagined herself capable of exerting  stop here she cried authoritatively wrenching his arm in her haste if you go youll be killed theres no time to run past itll be down before youre there  see see its falling  even before the words were well out of her mouth another great crash shook the ground behind them  with a deafening roar the tunnel gave way in a second place beyond dust and sand filled the air confusedly  for a minute or two all was noise and smoke and darkness  what exactly had happened neither of them could see but now the mouth of the tunnel was blocked at either end alike and no daylight was visible  so far as cyril could judge they two stood alone in the dark and gloom as in a narrow cell shut in with their carriage between two solid walls of fallen earth and crumbling sandstone  at this fresh misfortune elma sat down on the footboard  with her face in her hands and began to sob bitterly the artist leaned over her and let her cry for a while in quiet despair the poor girls nerves it was clear were now wholly unstrung she was brave as women go undoubtedly brave but the shock and the terror of such a position as this were more than enough to terrify the bravest at last cyril ventured on a single remark  how lucky he said in an undertone i didnt get out at warnworth after all it would have been dreadful if youd been left all alone in this position  elma glanced up at him with a sudden rush of gratitude by the dim light of the oil lamp that still flickered feebly in the carriage overhead she could see his face and she knew by the look in those truthful eyes that he really meant it he really meant he was glad hed come on and exposed himself to this risk which he might otherwise have avoided because he would be sorry to think a helpless woman should be left alone by herself in the dark to face it and frightened as she was she was glad of it too to be alone would be awful this was preeminently one of those many positions in life in which a woman prefers to have a man beside her  and yet most men she knew would have thought to themselves at once what a fool i was to come on beyond my proper station and let myself in for this beastly scrape just because id go a few miles further with a pretty girl i never saw in my life before and will probably never see in my life again if i once get well out of this precious predicament  but that they would ever get out of it at all seemed to both of them now in the highest degree improbable  cyril by reason elma by instinct argued out the whole situation at once and correctly there had been much rain lately the sandstone was waterlogged it had caved in bodily before them and behind them a little isthmus of archway still held out in isolation just above their heads at any moment that isthmus might give way too and falling on their carriage might crush them beneath its weight their lives depended upon the continued resisting power of some fifteen yards or so of dislocated masonry  appalled at the thought cyril moved from his place for a minute and went forward to examine the fallen block in front then he paced his way back with groping steps to the equally ruinous mass behind them  elmas eyes growing gradually accustomed to the darkness  and the faint glimmer of the oil lamps followed his action with vague and tearful interest  if the roof doesnt give way he said calmly at last when he returned once more to her and if we can only let them know were alive in the tunnel they may  possibly dig us out before we choke theres air enough here for eighteen hours for us  he spoke very quietly and reassuringly as if being shut up in a fallen tunnel between two masses of earth were a matter that neednt cause one the slightest  uneasiness but his words suggested to elmas mind a fresh and hitherto unthoughtof danger  eighteen hours she cried horrorstruck do you mean to say we may have to stop here all alone for eighteen hours together oh how very dreadful  how long how frightening and if they dont dig us out before eighteen hours are over do you mean to say we shall die of choking  cyril gazed down at her with a very regretful and sympathetic face  i didnt mean to frighten you he said at least not more than youre frightened already but of course theres only a certain amount of oxygen in the space thats left us and as were using it up at every breath itll naturally hold out for a limited time only  it cant be much more than eighteen hours still i dont doubt theyll begin digging us out at once and if they dig through fast they may yet be in time even so to save us  elma bent forward with her face in her hands again and rocking herself to and fro in an agony of despair gave herself vip to a paroxysm of utter misery this was too too terrible to think of eighteen hours in that gloom and suspense and then to die at last gasping hard for breath in the poisonous air of that pestilential tunnel  for nearly an hour she sat there broken down and speechless while cyril waring taking a seat in silence by her side tried at first with mute sympathy to comfort and console her then he turned to examine the roof and the block at either end to see if perchance any hope remained of opening by main force an exit anywhere  he even began by removing a little of the sand at the side of the line with a piece of shattered board from the broken carriage in front but that was clearly no use  more sand tumbled in as fast as he removed it he saw there was nothing left for it but patience or despair  and of the two his own temperament dictated rather patience  he returned at last wearied out to elmas side elma still sitting disconsolate on the footboard rocking herself up and down and moaning low and piteously looked up as he came with a mute glance of inquiry she was very pretty that struck him even now it made his heart bleed to think she should be so cowed and terrified  im sorry to bother you he said after a pause half afraid to speak but there are four lamps all burning hard in these four compartments and using up the air we may need byandby for our own breathing if i were to climb to the top of the carriagewhich i can easily doi could put them all out and economize our oxygen it would leave us in the dark but itd give us one more chance of life dont you think id better get up and turn them off or squash them  elma clasped her hands in horror at the bare suggestion  oh dear no she cried hastily please please dont do that its bad enough to choke slowly like this in the gloom but to die in the darkthat would be ten times more terrible why its a perfect black hole of calcutta even now if you were to turn out the lights i could never stand it  cyril gave a respectful little nod of assent  very well he answered as calm as ever thats just as you will i only meant to suggest it to you  my one wish is to do the best i can for you perhapsand he hesitatedperhaps id better let it go on for an hour or two more and then whenever the air begins to get very oppressivei mean when one begins to feel its really failing usone person you know could live on so much longer than two it would be a pity not to let you stand every chance perhaps i might  elma gazed at him aghast in the utmost horror she knew what he meant at once she didnt even need that he should finish his sentence  never she said firmly clenching her small hand hard its so wrong of you to think of it even i could never permit it its your duty to keep yourself alive at all hazards as long as ever you can you should remember your mother your sisters your family  why thats just it cyril answered a little  crestfallen and feeling he had done quite a wicked thing in venturing to suggest that his companion should have every chance for her own life ive got no mother you see no sisters no family nobody on earth would ever be one penny the worse if i were to die except my twin brother hes the only relation i ever had in my life and even he i dare say would very soon get over it whereas youhe paused and glanced at her compassionatelythere are probably many to whom the loss would be a very serious one if i could do anything  to save you he broke off suddenly for elma looked up at him once more with a little burst of despair  if you talk like that she cried with a familiarity that comes of association in a very great danger i dont know what i shall do i dont know what i shall say to you why i couldnt bear to be left alone here to die by myself if only for my sake now were boxed up here together i think you ought to wait and do the best you can for yourself  very well cyril answered once more in a most obedient tone if you wish me to live to keep you company in the tunnel ill live while i may you have only to say what you wish im here to wait upon you  in any other circumstances such a phrase would have been a mere piece of conversational politeness at that critical moment elma knew it for just what it wasa simple expression of his real feeling       chapter iii  cyril warings brother      it was nine oclock that selfsame night and two men sat together in a comfortable sittingroom under the gabled roofs of staple inn holborn it was as cosy a nook as any to be found within the fourmile radius and artistic withal in its furniture and decorations  in the biggest armchair by the empty grate a young man with a flute paused for a moment irresolute he was a handsome young man expressive eyes and a neatlycut brown beardfor all the world like cyril warings indeed if elma clifford could that moment have been transported from her gloomy prison in the lavington tunnel to that cosy room at staple inn holborn she would have started with surprise to find the young man who sat in the armchair was to all outer appearance the selfsame person as the painter she had just left at the scene of the accident for the two warings were truly as like as two peas a photograph of one might almost have done duty for the photograph of the other  the other occupant of the room who leaned carelessly against the mantelshelf was taller and older though he too was handsome but with the somewhat cynical and unprepossessing handsomeness of a man of the world his forehead was high his lips were thin his nose inclined toward the roman pattern his black moustache was carefully curled and twisted at the extremities moreover he was musical for he held in one hand the bow of a violin having just laid down the instrument itself on the sofa after a plaintive duet with guy waring  seen this evenings paper by the way guy he asked after a pause in a voice that was all honeyed charm and seductiveness i brought the st jamess gazette for you but forgot to give you it i was so full of this new piece of mine been an accident this morning i see on the great southern line somewhere  down cyrils way too hes painting near chetwood wonder whether he could possibly by any chance have been in it  he drew the paper carelessly from his pocket as he spoke and handed it with a graceful air of inborn courtesy to his younger companion everything that montague nevitt did indeed was naturally graceful and courteous  guy waring took the printed sheet from his hands without attaching much importance to his words and glanced over it lightly  at ten oclock this morning the telegram said a singular catastrophe occurred in a portion of the lavington tunnel on the great southern railway as the 915 waytrain from tilgate junction to guildford was passing through a segment of the roof of the tunnel collapsed under pressure of the dislocated rock on top and bore down with enormous weight upon the carriages beneath it the engine tender and four front waggons escaped unhurt but the two hindmost it is feared were crushed by the falling mass of earth  it is not yet known how many passengers if any may have been occupying the wrecked compartments but every effort is now being made to dig out the débris  guy read the paragraph through unmoved to the outer eye though with a whitening face and then took up the dogeared bradshaw that lay close by upon the little oak writingtable his hand trembled one glance at the map however set his mind at rest  i thought so he said quietly cyril wouldnt be there its beyond his beat lavingtons the fourth station this way on the upline from chetwood cyrils stopping at tilgate town you knowi heard from him on saturdayand the bit hes now working ats in chetwood forest he couldnt get lodgings at chetwood  itself so hes put up for the present at the white lion at tilgate and runs over by train every day to warnworth its three stations awayfour off lavington  hed have been daubing for an hour in the wood by that time  well i didnt attach any great importance to it myself nevitt went on unconcerned i thought most likely cyril wouldnt be there but still i felt youd like at any rate to know about it  oh of course guy answered still scanning the map in bradshaw close he couldnt have been there but one likes to know i think indeed to make sure ill telegraph to tilgate naturally when a mans got only one relation in the whole wide worldwithout being a sentimentalistthat one relation means a good deal in life to him and cyril and i are more to one another of course than most ordinary brothers he bit his thumb still i cant imagine how he could possibly be there he went on glancing at bradshaw once more you see if he went to work hed have got out at warnworth and if he meant to come to town to consult his dentist hed have taken the 930 express straight through from tilgate which gets up to london twentyfive minutes earlier  well but why to consult his dentist in particular nevitt asked with a smile he had very white teeth and he smiled accordingly perhaps a little oftener than was quite inevitable you warings are so absolute  i never knew any such fellows in my life as you are  you decide things so beforehand why mightnt he have been coming up to town for example to see a friend or get himself fresh colours  oh i said to consult his dentist guy answered in the most matteroffact voice on earth suppressing a tremor because you know ive had toothache off and on myself one day with another for the whole last fortnight and its a tooth that never ached with either of us beforethis one you seehe lifted his lip with his forefingerthe second on the left after the one weve lost if cyril was coming up to town at all im pretty sure itd be his tooth he was coming up to see about i went to eskell about mine myself last wednesday  the elder man seated himself and leaned back in his chair with his violin in his lap then he surveyed his friend long and curiously  it must be awfully odd guy he said at last after a good hard stare to lead such a queer sort of duplicate  life as cyril and you do just fancy being the counterfoil to some other mans cheque just fancy being bound to do and think and speak and wish as he does just fancy having to get a toothache in the very same tooth and on the very same day just fancy having to consult the identical dentist that he consults simultaneously itd drive me mad why its clean rideeklous  guy waring looked up hastily from the telegraph form he was already filling in and answered with some warmth  no no not quite so it isnt like that you mistake the situation were both cheques equally and neither is a counterfoil cyril and i depend for our characters as everybody else does upon our father and mother and our remoter progenitors only being twins and twins cast in very much the same sort of mould were naturally the product of the same two parents at the same precise point in their joint life history and therefore were practically all but identical  as he rose from his desk with the telegram in his hand the porter appeared at the door with letters guy seized them at once with some little impatience the first was from cyril he tore it open in haste and skimmed it through rapidly montague nevitt meanwhile sat languid in his chair striking a pensive note now and again on his violin with his eyes half closed and his lips parted guy drew a sigh of relief as he skimmed his note  just what i expected he said slowly cyril couldnt have been there he writes last nightthe letters marked delayed in transmission no doubt by the accidenti shall come up to town on friday or saturday morning to see the dentist one of my teeth is troublesome i suppose youve had the same the second on the left from the one weve lost been aching a fortnight i want it stopped but tomorrow i really cant leave work ive got well into the swing of such a lovely bit of fern with sardanapalus just gleaming like gold in the foreground so that settles matters somewhat he cant have been there though i think even so ill just telegraph for safetys sake and make things certain  nevitt struck a chord twice with a sweep of his hand listened to it dreamily for a minute with faraway eyes and then remarked once more without even looking up the same tooth lost he says you both had it drawn and now another one aches in both of you alike how very remarkable how very very curious  well that was queer guy replied relaxing into a smile queer even for us i wont deny it for it happened this way i was over in brussels at the time as correspondent for the sphere at the international  workmens congress and cyril was away by himself just then on his holiday in the orkneys we both got toothache in the selfsame tooth on the selfsame night and we both lay awake for hours in misery early in the morning we each of us got upfive hundred miles away from one another rememberand as soon as we were dressed i went into a dentists in the montagne de la cour and cyril to a local doctors at larwick and we each of us had it out instanter the dentists both declared they could save them if we wished but we each preferred the loss of a tooth to another such night of abject misery  nevitt stroked his moustache with a reflective air  this was almost miraculous well i should think he said at last after close reflection where such sympathy as that exists between two brothers if cyril had really been hurt in this accident you must surely in some way have been dimly conscious of it  guy waring standing there telegram in hand looked down at his companion with a somewhat contemptuous smile  oh dear no he answered with commonsense confidence for he loved not mysteries you dont believe any nonsense of that sort do you theres nothing in the least mystical in the kind of sympathy that exists between cyril and myself its all purely physical were very like one another but thats all theres none of the corsican brothers sort of hocuspocus about us in any way the whole thing is a simple caste of natural causation  then you dont believe in brainwaves nevitt suggested with a gracefully appropriate undulation of his small white hand  guy laughed incredulously all rubbish my dear fellow he answered all utter rubbish if any man knows its myself and cyril were as near one another as any two men on earth could possibly be but when we want to communicate our ideas each to each we have to speak or write just like the rest of you every man is like a clock wound up to strike certain hours accidents may happen events may intervene the clock may get smashed and all may be prevented but bar accidents itll strike all right under ordinary circumstances when the hour arrives for it well cyril and i as i always say are like two clocks wound up at the same time to strike together and we strike with very unusual regularity but thats the whole mystery if i get smashed by accident theres no reason on earth why cyril shouldnt run on for years yet as usual and if cyril got smashed theres no reason on earth why i should ever know anything about it except from the newspapers       chapter iv  inside the tunnel      and indeed if brainwaves had been in question at all they ought without a doubt to have informed guy waring that at the very moment when he was going out to send off his telegram his brother cyril was sitting disconsolate with dark blue lips and swollen eyelids on the footboard of the railway carriage in the lavington tunnel cyril was worn out with digging by this time for he had done his best once more to clear away the sand towards the front of the train in the vague hope that he might succeed in letting in a little more air to their narrow prison through the chinks and interstices of the fallen sandstone besides a man in an emergency must do something if only to justify his claim to manlinessespecially when a lady is looking on at his efforts  so cyril waring had toiled and moiled in that deadly atmosphere for some hours in vain and now sat wearied out and faint from foul vapours by elmas side on the damp cold footboard by this time the air had almost failed them they gasped for breath their heads swam vaguely a terrible weight seemed to oppress their bosoms even the lamps in the carriages flickered low and burned blue the atmosphere of the tunnel loaded from the very beginning with sulphurous smoke was now all but exhausted  death stared them in the face without hope of respitea ghastly slow death by gradual stifling  you must take a little water elma murmured pouring out the last few drops for him into the tin cupfor cyril had brought a small bottleful that morning for his painting as well as a packet of sandwiches for lunch youre dreadfully tired i can see your lips are parched and dry with digging  she was deathly pale herself and her own eyes were livid for by this time she had fairly given up all hope of rescue and besides the air in the tunnel was so foul and stupefying she could hardly speak indeed her tongue clung to her palate but she poured out the last few drops into the cup for cyril and held them up imploringly with a gesture of supplication these two were no strangers to one another now they had begun to know each other well in those twelve long hours of deadly peril shared in common  cyril waved the cup aside with a firm air of dissent  no no he said faintly you must drink it yourself  your need is greater far than mine  elma tried to put it away in turn but cyril would not allow her so she moistened her mouth with those scanty last drops and turned towards him gratefully  theres no hope left now she said in a very resigned voice we must make up our minds to die where we stand but i thank you oh i thank you so much so earnestly  cyril for his part could hardly find breath to speak  thank you he gasped out in one last despairing effort things look very black but while theres life theres hope they may even still perhaps come up with us  as he spoke a sound broke unexpectedly on the silence of their prison a dull thud seemed to make itself faintly heard from beyond the thick wall of sand that cut them off from the daylight cyril stared with surprise it was a noise like a pickaxe stooping hastily down he laid his ear against the rail beside the shattered carriage  theyre digging he cried earnestly finding words in his joy theyre digging to reach us i can hear them i can hear them  elma glanced up at him with a certain tinge of halfincredulous surprise  yes theyre digging of course she said quickly  i knew theyd dig for us naturally as soon as they missed us but how far off are they yet thats the real question will they reach us in time are they near or distant  cyril knelt down on the ground as before in an agony of suspense and struck the rail three times distinctly with his walkingstick then he put his ear to it and listened and waited in less than half a minute  three answering knocks rang dim but unmistakable along the buried rail he could even feel the vibration on the iron with his face  they hear us they hear us he cried once more in a tremor of excitement i dont think theyre far off theyre coming rapidly towards us  at the words elma rose from her seat still paler than ever but strangely resolute and took the stick from his hand with a gesture of despair she was almost stifled but she raised it with method knocking  the rail twice she bent down her head and listened in turn once more two answering knocks rang sharp along the connecting line of metal elma shook her head ominously  no no theyre a very long way off still she murmured in a faltering tone i can hear it quite well they can never reach us  she seated herself on a fragment of the broken carriage and buried her face in her hands once more in silence  her heart was full her head was very heavy she gasped and struggled then a sudden intuition seized her after her kind if the rail could carry the sound of a tap surely it might carry the human voice as well inspired with the idea she rose again and leant forward  a second time she knocked two quick little taps ringing sharp on the rail as if to bespeak attention then putting her mouth close to the metals she shouted aloud along them with all the voice that was left her  hallo there do you hear come soon come fast  were alive but choking  quick as lightning an answer rang back as if by magic along the conducting line of the raila strange unexpected answer  break the pipe of the wires it said and then subsided instantly  cyril who was leaning down at her side at the moment with his ear to the rail couldnt make out one word of it but elmas sharp senses now quickened by the crisis were acute as an orientals and keen as a beagles  break the pipe of the wires they say she exclaimed  starting back and pondering what on earth can they mean by that what on earth can they be driving at break the pipe of the wires i dont understand them  hardly had she spoken when another sharp tap resounded still more clearly along the rail at her feet  she bent down her head once more and laid her eager ear beside it in terrible suspense a rough mans voicea navvys no doubt or a firemanscame speeding along the metal and it said in thick accents  do you hear what i say if you want to breathe freer break the pipe of the wires and youll get fresh air from outside right through it  cyril this time had caught the words and jumped up with a sudden air of profound conviction it was very dark and the lamps were going out but he took his fuseebox from his pocket and struck a light hastily  sure enough on the lefthand side of the tunnel half buried in rubbish an earthenware pipe ran along by the edge near the wall of the archway cyril raised his foot and brought his heel down upon it sharply with all the strength and force he had still left in him  the pipe broke short and cyril saw within it a number of telegraph wires for the railway service the tube communicated directly with the air outside they were saved they were saved air would come through the pipe he saw it all now he dimly understood it  at the selfsame moment another sound of breaking was heard more distinctly at the opposite end some thirty or forty feet off through the tunnel then a voice rang far clearer as if issuing from the tube in short sharp sentences  well pump you in air how many of you are there are you all alive is any one injured  cyril leant down and shouted back in reply  were two both alive not hurt but sick and half dead with stifling send us air as soon as ever you can and if possible pass us a bottle of water  some minutes elapsedthree long slow minutes of itintense anxiety elma now broken down with terror  and want of oxygen fell half fainting forward towards the shattered tube cyril held her up in his supporting arms and watched the pipe eagerly it seemed an age but after a time he became conscious of a gust of air blowing cold on his face the keen freshness revived him  he looked about him and drew a deep breath cool air was streaming in through the broken place quick as thought he laid elmas mouth as close as he could lay it to the reviving current her eyes were closed after a painful interval she opened them languidly cyril chafed her hands with his but his chafing seemed to produce very little effect she lay motionless now with her eyelids half shut and the whites of her eyes alone showing through them the close foul air of that damp and confined spot had worked its worst and had almost asphyxiated her cyril began to fear the slight relief had arrived five minutes too late and it must still in all probability be some hours at least before they could be actually disentombed from that living vault or restored to the open air of heaven  as he bent over her and held his breath in speechless suspense the voice called out again more loudly than ever  look out for the ball in the tube were sending you water  cyril watched the pipe closely and struck another light in a minute a big glass marble came rattling through with a string attached to it  pull the string the voice cried and cyril pulled with a will now and again the object attached to it struck against some projecting ledge or angle where the pipes overlapped but at last with a little humouring it came through in safety at the end was a large indiarubber bottle full of fresh water and a flask of brandy the young man seized them both with delight and avidity and bathed elmas temples over and over again with the refreshing spirit then he poured a little into the cup and filling it up with water held it to her lips with all a womans tenderness elma gulped the draught down unconsciously and opened her eyes at once for a moment she stared about her with a wild stare of surprise  then of a sudden she recollected where she was and why and seizing cyrils hand pressed it long and eagerly  if only we can hold out for three hours more she cried with fresh hope returning im sure theyll reach us im sure theyll reach us       chapter v  gkatitude      there were only two of you then in the last carriage guy asked with deep interest the very next morning as cyril none the worse for his long imprisonment sat quietly in their joint chambers at staple inn recounting  the previous days adventures  yes only two of us it was awfully fortunate  and the carriage that was smashed had nobody at all except in the first compartment which escaped being buried so there were no lives lost by a miracle you may say but several of the people in the front part of the train got terribly shaken  and you and the other man were shut up in the tunnel there for fifteen hours at a stretch guy went on reflectively  at least fifteen hours cyril echoed without attempting  to correct the slight error of sex for no man he thought is bound to criminate himself even in a flirtation  it was two in the morning before they dug us quite out and my companion by that time was more dead than alive i can tell you with watching and terror  was he poor fellow guy murmured with a sympathetic face for cyril had always alluded casually to his fellowtraveller in such general terms that guy was as yet unaware there was a lady in the case and is he all right again now do you know have you heard anything more about him  but before cyril could answer there came a knock at the door and the next moment mr montague nevitt without his violin entered the room in some haste all agog with excitement his face was eager and his manner cordial it was clear he was full of some important tidings  why cyril my dear fellow he cried grasping the painters hand with much demonstration of friendly warmth and wringing it hard two or three times over how delighted i am to see you restored to us alive and well once more this is really too happy what a marvellous escape and what a romantic story all the clubs are buzzing with it a charming girl youll have to marry her of course thats the necessary climax you and the young lady are the staple of news i see in very big print in all the evening papers  guy drew back at the words with a little start of surprise young lady he cried aghast a charming  girl nevitt then the person who was shut up with you for fifteen hours in the tunnel was a girl cyril  cyrils handsome face flushed slightly before his brothers scrutinizing gaze but he answered with a certain little illconcealed embarrassment  oh i didnt say so didnt i well she was a girl then of course a certain miss clifford she got in at chetwood her people live somewhere down there near tilgate at least so i gathered from what she told me  nevitt stared hard at the painters eyes which tried without success to look unconscious  a romance he said slowly scanning his man with deep interest a romance i can see young rich and beautiful my dear cyril i only wish id had half your luck what a splendid chance and what a magnificent introduction beauty in distress a lady in trouble you console her alone in a tunnel for fifteen hours by yourself at a stretch heavens what a teteatete did british propriety ever before allow a man such a glorious opportunity for chivalrous devotion to a lady of family face and fortune  was she pretty guy asked coming down at once to a more realistic platform  cyril hesitated a moment well yes he answered somewhat curtly after a short pause shes distinctly goodlooking and he shut his mouth sharp but he had said quite enough  when a man says that of a girl and nothing more in an unconcerned voice as if it didnt matter twopence to him you may be perfectly sure in your own mind hes very deeply and seriously smitten  and young guy continued  i should say about twenty  and rich beyond the utmost dreams of avarice montague nevitt put in with a faintly cynical smile  well i dont know about that cyril answered truthfully i havent the least idea who she is even  she and i had other things to think about you may be sure boxed up there so long in that narrow space and choking for want of air than minute investigations into one anothers pedigrees  weve got no pedigree guy interposed with a bitter smile so the less she investigates about that the better  but she has i expect nevitt put in hastily and if i were you cyril id hunt her up forthwith while the irons hot and find out all there is to find out about her cliffordclifford i wonder whether by any chance shes one of the devonshire cliffords now for if so she might really be worth a mans serious attetion theyre very good business they bank at our place and theyre by no means paupers for nevitt was a clerk in the wellknown banking firm of drummond coutts and barclay limited and being a man who didnt mean as he himself said to throw himself away on any girl for nothing he kept a sharp lookout on the current account of every wealthy client with an only daughter  ten minutes later as the talk ran on some further light was unexpectedly thrown upon this interesting topic by the entrance of the porter with a letter for cyril  the painter tore it open and glanced over it as nevitt observed with evident eagerness it was short and curt but in its own way courteous  mr reginald clifford cmg desires to thank mr  cyril waring for his kindness and consideration to miss clifford during her temporary incarceration  incarcerations good isnt it how much does he charge a thousand for that sort i wonder  during her temporary incarceration in the lavington tunnel yesterday mrs and miss clifford wish also to express at the same time their deep gratitude to mr  waring for his friendly efforts and trust he has experienced  no further ill effects from the unfortunate accident to which he was subjected  craighton tilgate thursday morning  she might have written herself cyril murmured half aloud he was evidently disappointed at this very short measure of correspondence on the subject  but montague nevitt took a more cheerful view  oh reginald clifford of craighton he cried with a smile his invariable smile i know all about him  hes a friend of colonel kelmscotts down at tilgate park cmg indeed what a ridiculous old peacock he was administrator of st kitts once upon a time i believe or was it nevis or antigua i dont quite recollect im afraid but anyhow some comical little speck of a sugary niggery west indian island and he was made a companion of st michael and st george when his term was up just to keep him quiet dont you know for he wanted a knighthood and to shelve him from being appointed to a firstclass post like barbados  or trinidad if its elma clifford you were shut up with in the tunnel cyril you might do worse theres no doubt and you might do better shes an only daughter and theres a little money at the back of the family i expect but i fancy the companion of the fighting saints lives mainly on his pension which of course is purely personal and so dies with him  cyril folded up the note without noticing nevitts words and put it in his pocket somewhat carefully and obtrusively thank you he said in a very quiet tone i didnt ask you about miss cliffords fortune  when i want information on that point ill apply for it plainly but meanwhile i dont think any ladys name should be dragged into conversation and bandied about like that by an absolute stranger  oh now you neednt be huffy nevitt answered with a still sweeter smile showing all those pearly teeth of his to the greatest advantage i didnt mean to put your back up and ill tell you what ill do for you ill heap coals of fire on your head you ungrateful  man ill return good for evil you shall have an invitation to mrs holkers garden party on saturday week at chetwood court and there youll be almost sure to meet the beautiful stranger  but at that very moment at craighton tilgate mr  reginald clifford cmg a stiff little witheredup official briton half mummified by long exposure to tropical suns was sitting in his drawingroom with mrs clifford his wife and discussingwhat subject of all others on earth but the personality of cyril waring  well it was an awkward situation for elma of course i admit he was chirping out cheerfully with his back turned by pure force of habit to the empty grate and his hands crossed behind him i dont deny it was an awkward situation still theres no harm done i hope and trust elmas happily not a fanciful or foolishly susceptible sort of girl she sees its a case for mere ordinary gratitude and gratitude in my opinion towards a person in his position is sufficiently expressed once for all by letter theres no reason on earth she should ever again see or hear any more of him  but girls are so romantic mrs clifford put in doubtfully with an anxious air she herself was by no means romantic to look at being indeed a person of a certain age with a plump matronly figure and very staid of countenance yet there was something in her eye for all that that recalled at times the vivid keenness of elmas and her cheek had once been as delicate and creamy a brown as her pretty daughters  girls are so romantic mrs clifford repeated once more in a dreamy way and she was evidently impressed by him  well im glad i made inquiries at once about these two young men anyhow the companion of st michael and st george responded with fervour clasping his wizened little hands contentedly over his narrow waistcoat  its a precious odd story and a doubtful story and not at all the sort of story one likes ones girl to be any way mixed up with for my part i shall give them a very wide berth indeed in future and theres no reason why elma should ever knock up against them  who told you they were nobodies mrs clifford inquired drawing a wistful sigh  oh tom clark was at school with them the exadministrator continued with a very cunning air and he knows all about themhas heard the whole circumstances  very odd very odd never met anything so queer in all my life most mysterious and uncanny  they never had a father they never had a mother they never had anybody on earth they could call their own they dropped from the clouds as it were one rainy day without a friend in the world plump down into the charterhouse there they were well supplied with money and spent their holidays with a person at brighton who wasnt even supposed to be their lawful guardian looks fishy doesnt it their names are cyril and guy waringand thats all they know of themselves they were educated like gentlemen till they were twentyone years old and then they were turned loose upon the world like a pair of young bears with a couple of hundred pounds of capital apiece to shift for themselves with uncanny very i dont like the look of it not at all the sort of people an impressionable girl like our elma should ever be allowed to see too much of  i dont think she was very much impressed by him mrs clifford said with confidence ive watched her to see and i dont think shes in love with him  but by tomorrow reginald i shall be able im sure to tell you for certain  the companion of the militant saints glanced rather uneasily across the hearthrug at his wife its a marvellous gift to be sure this intuition of yours louisa he said shaking his head sagely and swaying himself gently to and fro on the stone kerb of the fender  i frankly confess my dear i dont quite understand it and elmas got it too every bit as bad as you have  runs in the family i supposeruns somehow in the family after living with you now for twentytwo yearsyes twentytwo last aprilin every part of the world and every grade of the service im compelled to admit that your intuition in these matters is really remarkablesimply remarkable  mrs clifford coloured through her olivebrown skin exactly like elma and rose with a somewhat embarrassed  and halfguilty air avoiding her husbands eyes as if afraid to meet them  elma had gone to bed early wearied out as she was with her long agony in the tunnel mrs clifford crept up to her daughters room with a silent tread like some  noiseless oriental and putting her ear to the keyhole listened outside the door in profound suspense for several minutes  not a sound from within not a gentle footfall on the carpeted floor for a moment she hesitated then she turned the handle slowly and peering before her peeped into the room thank heaven no snake signs  elma lay asleep with one arm above her head as peacefully as a child after her terrible adventure her bosom heaved but slowly and regularly the mother drew a deep breath and crept down the stairs with a palpitating heart to the drawingroom again  reginald she said with perfect confidence relapsing  once more at a bound into the ordinary everyday british matron theres no harm done im sure she doesnt think of this young man at all you may dismiss him from your mind at once and for ever  shes sleeping like a baby       chapter vi  two strange meetings      mrs hugh holker at home saturday may 29th 3 to 630 chetwood court tennis  cyril waring read it out with a little thrill of triumph to be sure it was by no means certain that elma would be there but still chetwood court was well within range of tilgate town and montague nevitt felt convinced he said the holkers were friends of the cliffords and the kelmscotts  for my part guy remarked balancing a fragment of fried sole on his fork as he spoke im not going all that way down to chetwood merely to swell mrs  holkers triumph  i wouldnt if i were you cyril answered with quiet incisiveness he hadnt exactly fallen in love with elma at first sight but he was very much interested in her and it struck him at once that what interested him was likely also to interest his twin brother and this is just one of those rare cases in life where a man prefers that his interest in a subject should not be shared by any other person  before saturday the 29th arrived however guy had so far changed his mind in the matter that he presented himself duly with nevitt at waterloo to catch the same train to chetwood station that cyril went down by  after all he said to nevitt as they walked together from the club in piccadilly i may as well see what the girls like anyhow if shes got to be my sisterinlawwhich seems not unlikely nowid better have a look at her beforehand so to speak on approbation  the holkers grounds were large and well planted with velvety lawns on the slope of a wellwooded hill overlooking the boundless blue weald of surrey  nevitt and the warings were late to arrive and found most of the guests already assembled before them  after a time guy found himself to his intense chagrin told off by his hostess to do the honours to an amiable old lady of high tonnage and great conversational powers who rattled on uninterruptedly in one silvery stream about everybody on the ground their histories and their pedigrees she took the talking so completely off his hands however that after a very few minutes guy who was by nature of a lazy and contemplative disposition had almost ceased to trouble himself about what she said interposing indeeds and reallys with automatic politeness at measured intervals when suddenly the old lady coming upon a bench where a mother and daughter were seated in the shade settled down by their sides in a fervour of welcome and shook hands with them both effusively in a most demonstrative fashion  the daughter was prettyyes distinctly pretty she attracted guys attention at once by the piercing keenness of her lustrous dark eyes and the delicate olivebrown of her transparent complexion her expression was merry but with a strange and attractive undertone he thought of some mysterious charm a more taking girl indeed now he came to look close he hadnt seen for months he congratulated himself on his garrulous old ladys choice of a bench to sit upon if it helped him to an introduction to the beautiful stranger  but before he could even be introduced the pretty girl with the olivebrown complexion had held out her hand to him frankly and exclaimed in a voice as sunny as her face  i dont need to be told your friends name im sure mrs godfrey hes so awfully like him i should have known him anywhere of course youre mr  warings brother arent you  guy smiled and bowed gracefully he was always graceful  i refuse to be merely mr warings brother he answered with some amusement as he took the proffered hand in his own warmly if it comes to that im mr waring myself and cyril whom you seem to know already is only my brother  ah but my mr waring isnt here today is he the olivebrown girl put in looking around with quite an eager interest at the crowd in the distance  naturally to me hes the mr waring of course and you are only my mr warings brother  elma my dear what on earth will mr waring think of you her mother put in with the conventional shocked face of british propriety you know she went on turning round quickly to guy were all so grateful to your brother for his kindness to our girl in that dreadful accident the other day at lavington that we cant help thinking and talking of him all the time as our mr waring im sorry he isnt here himself this afternoon to receive our thanks it would be such a pleasure to all of us to give them to him in person  oh he is about somewhere guy answered carelessly still keeping his eye fixed hard on the pretty girl ill fetch him round byandby to pay his respects in due form hell be only too glad and this i suppose must be miss clifford that ive heard so much about  as he said those words a little gleam of pleasure shot through elmas eyes her painter hadnt forgotten her then he had talked much about her  yes i knew who you must be the very first moment i saw you she answered blushing youre so much like him in some ways though not in all and he told me that day he had a twin brother  so much like him in some ways guy repeated much amused why i wonder you dont take me for cyril himself at once youre the very first person i ever knew in my life except a few old and very intimate friends who could tell at all the difference between us  elma drew back almost as if shocked and hurt at the bare suggestion  oh dear no she cried quickly scanning him over at once with those piercing keen eyes of hers youre like him of coursei dont deny the likenessas brothers may be like one another your features are the same and the colour of your hair and eyes and all that sort of thing but still i knew at a glance you werent my mr waring i could never mistake you for him the expression and the look are so utterly different  you must be a very subtle judge of faces the young man answered still smiling if you knew us apart at first sight for i never before in my life met anybody whod seen my brother once or twice and who didnt take me for him or him for me the very first time he saw us apart but then he added after a short pause with a quick dart of his eyes you were with him in the tunnel for a whole long day and in that time of course you saw a good deal of him  elma blushed again and guy noticed in passing that she blushed very prettily  and hows sardanapalus she asked in a somewhat hurried voice making an inartistic attempt to change the subject  oh sardanapalus is all right guy answered laughing cyril told me you had made friends with him and werent one bit afraid of him most people are so dreadfully frightened of the poor old creature  but he isnt old elma exclaimed interrupting him with some warmth hes in the prime of life hes so glossy and beautiful i quite fell in love with him  and who is sardanapalus mrs clifford asked with a vague maternal sense of discomfort and doubt  a dog or a monkey  oh sardanapalus motherdidnt i tell you about him elma cried enthusiastically why hes just lovely and beautiful hes such a glorious green and yellowbanded snake and he coiled around my arm as if hed always known me  mrs clifford drew back with a horrorstricken face darting across at her daughter the same stealthy sort of look she had given her husband the night after elmas adventure  a snake she repeated aghast a snake oh elma why you never told me that and he coiled round your arm how horrible  but elma wasnt to be put down by exclamations of horror  why youre not afraid of snakes yourself you know mother she went on undismayed i remember papa saying that when you were at st kitts with him you never minded them a bit but caught them in your hands like an indian juggler and treated them as playthings so i wasnt afraid either i suppose its hereditary  mrs clifford gazed at her fixedly for a few seconds with a very pale face  i suppose it is she said slowly and stiffly with an evident effort most things are in fact in this world we live in but i didnt know you at least had inherited it elma  just at that moment they were relieved from the temporary embarrassment which the mention of sardanapalus seemed to have caused the party by the approach of a tall and very handsome man who came forward with a smile towards where their group was standing he was military in bearing and had dark brown hair with a white moustache but he hardly looked more than fifty for all that as guy judged at once from his erect carriage and the singular youthfulness of both face and figure that he was a born aristocrat one could see in every motion of his wellbuilt limbs his mien had that ineffable air of grace and breeding which sometimes marks the members of our old english families very much like cyril too guy thought to himself in a flash of intuition very much like cyril the way he raised his hat and then smiled urbanely on mrs clifford and elma but it was cyril grown old and prematurely white and filled full with the grave haughtiness of an honoured aristocrat  why heres colonel kelmscott mrs clifford exclaimed with a sigh of relief not a little set at ease by the timely diversion were so glad youve come colonel and lady emily too shes over yonder is she ah well ill look out for her we heard you were to be here oh how kind of you thank you no elmas none the worse for her adventure thank heaven  just a little shaken thats all but not otherwise injured  and this gentlemans the brother of the kind friend who was so good to her in the tunnel im not quite sure of the name i think its  guy waring the young man interposed blandly  hardly any one who looked at colonel kelmscotts eyes could even have perceived the profound surprise this announcement caused him he bowed without moving a muscle of that military face guy himself never noticed the intense emotion the introduction aroused in the distinguished stranger but mrs clifford and elma each scanning him closely with those keen grey eyes of theirs observed at once that unmoved as he appeared a thunderbolt falling at colonel kelmscotts feet could not more thoroughly or completely have stunned him for a second or two he gazed in the young mans face uneasily his colour came and went his bosom heaved in silence then he roped his moustache with his trembling fingers and tried in vain to pump up some harmless remark appropriate to the occasion but no remark came to him mrs clifford darted a furtive glance at elma and elma darted back a furtive glance at mrs clifford neither said a word and each let her eyes drop to the ground at once as they met the others but each knew in her heart that something passing strange had astonished colonel kelmscott and each knew too that the other had observed it  mother and daughter indeed needed no spoken words to tell these things plainly to one another the deep intuition that descended to both was enough to put them in sympathy at once without the need of articulate language  yes mr guy waring mrs clifford repeated at last breaking the awkward silence that supervened upon the group the brother of mr cyril waring who was so kind the other day to my daughter in the tunnel  the colonel started imperceptibly to the naked eye again  oh indeed he said forcing himself with an effort to speak at last ive read about it of course it was in all the papers andehis your brother here too this afternoon mr waring       chapter vii  kelmscott of tilgate      to both elma and her mother this meeting between colonel kelmscott and guy waring was full of mystery  for the kelmscotts of tilgate park were the oldest county family in all that part of surrey and colonel kelmscott himself passed as the proudest man of that haughtiest house in southern england what therefore could have made him give so curious and almost imperceptible a start the moment guy warings name was mentioned in conversation not a word that he said to be sure implied to guy himself the depth of his surprise but elma with her marvellous insight could see at once for all that by the very haze in his eyes that he was fascinated by guys personality somewhat as she herself had been fascinated the other day in the train by sardanapalus nay more he seemed to wish with all his heart to leave the young mans presence and yet to be glued to the spot in spite of himself by some strange compulsion  it was with a dreamy faraway tone in his voice that the colonel uttered those seemingly simple words and is your brother here too this afternoon mr waring  yes hes somewhere about guy answered carelessly  hell turn up byandby no doubt hes pretty sure to find out sooner or later miss cliffords here and then hell come round this way to speak to her  for some time they stood talking in a little group by the bench colonel kelmscott meanwhile thawing by degrees and growing gradually interested in what guy had to say while elma looked on with a devouring curiosity  your brothers a painter you say the colonel murmured once under that heavy white moustache of his yes i think i remember a rising painter had a capital landscape in the grosvenor last year i recollect and another in the academy this spring if i dont mistakeskiedskied unfairly yet a very pretty thing too at the home of the curlews  hes painting a sweet one now elma put in quickly down here close by in chetwood forest  he told me about it it must be simply lovelyall fern and mosses with oh such a beautiful big snake in the foreground  i should like to see it colonel kelmscott said slowly not without a pang if its painted in the forestand by your brother mr waringthat would give it to me a certain personal value he paused a moment then he added in a little explanatory undertone im lord of the manor you know at chetwood and i shoot the forest  cyril would be delighted to let you see the piece when its finished guy answered lightly if youre ever up in town our wayweve rooms in staple inn  i dare say you know itthat quaint oldfashioned looking place with big lattice windows that overhangs holborn  colonel kelmscott started and drew himself up still taller and stiffer than before  i may have some opportunity of seeing it some day in one of the galleries he answered coldly as if not to commit himself to tell you the truth i seldom have time to lounge about in studios it was merely the coincidence of the picture being painted in chetwood forest that made me fancy for a moment i might like to see it but im no connoisseur mrs clifford may i take you to get a cup of tea tea i think is laid out in the tent behind the shrubbery  it was said in a tone to dismiss guy politely and guy taking the hint accepted it as such and fell back a pace or two to his garrulous old lady but before colonel kelmscott could walk off mrs clifford and her daughter to the marquee for refreshments elma gave a sudden start and blushed faintly pink through that olivebrown skin of hers  why theres my mr waring she exclaimed in a very pleased tone holding out her hand with a delicious smile and as she said it cyril and montague nevitt strolled up from behind a great clump of lilacs beside them  two pairs of eyes watched those young folks closely as they shook hands once moreguys and mrs  cliffords guy observed that a little red spot rose on cyrils cheek he had rarely seen there and that his voice trembled slightly as he said how do you do to his pretty fellowtraveller of the famous adventure  mrs clifford observed that the faint pink faded out of the olivebrown skin as elma took cyril warings hand in hers and that her face grew pale for three minutes afterwards and colonel kelmscott looking on with a quietly observant eye remarked to himself that cyril waring was a very creditable young man indeed as handsome as guy and as like as two peas but if anything perhaps even a trifle more pleasing  for the rest of that afternoon they six kept constantly together  elma noted that colonel kelmscott was evidently ill at ease a thing most unusual with that proud  selfreliant aristocrat he held himself to be sure as straight and erect as ever and moved about the grounds with that same haughty air of perfect supremacy as of one who was monarch of all he surveyed in the county of surrey but elma could see for all that that he was absentminded and selfcontained he answered all questions in a distant unthinking way some inner trouble was undoubtedly consuming him  his eyes were all for the two warings they glanced nervously right and left every minute in haste but returned after each excursion straight to guy and cyril  the colonel noted narrowly all they said and did and elma was sure he was very much pleased at least with her painter how could he fail to be indeedfor mr  waring was charming elma wished she could have strolled off with him about the lawn alone were it only ten paces in front of her mother but somehow the fates that day were unpropitious the party held together as by some magnetic bond and mrs cliffords eye never for one moment deserted her  the colonel glowered the colonel was moody his speech was curt he occupied himself mainly in listening to guy and cyril a sort of mesmeric influence seemed to draw him towards the two young men  he drew them out deliberately yet the start he had given as either young man came up towards his side was a start not of mere neutral surprise but of positive disinclination and regret at the meeting nay even now he was angling hard with all the skill of a strategist to keep the warings out of lady emilys way but the more he talked to them the more interested he seemed it was clear he meant to make the most of this passing chanceand never again if he could help it elma felt certain to see them  once and once only granville kelmscott his son strolled casually up and joined the group by pure chance for a few short minutes the heir of tilgate park was tall and handsome though less so than his father and mrs clifford was not wholly indisposed to throw him and elma together as much as possible  younger by a full year than the two warings granville kelmscott was not wholly unlike them in face and manner as a rule his father was proud of him with a passing great pride as he was proud of every other kelmscott possession but today elmas keen eye observed that the colonels glance moved quickly in a rapid dart from cyril and guy to his son granville and back again from his son granville to guy and cyril what was odder still the hasty comparison seemed to redound not altogether to granvilles credit the colonel paused and stifled a sigh as he looked then in spite of mrs cliffords profound attempts to retain the heir by her side he sent the young man off at a moments notice to hunt up lady emily now why on earth did he want to keep granville and the warings apart mrs clifford and elina racked their brains in vain they could make nothing of the mystery  it was a long afternoon and elma enjoyed it though she never got her teteatete after all with cyril waring  just a rapid look a dart from the eyes a faint pressure of her hand at partingthat was all the romance she was able to extract from it so closely did mrs clifford play her part as chaperon but as the two young men and montague nevitt hurried off at last to catch their train back to town the colonel turned to mrs clifford with a sigh of relief  splendid young fellows those he exclaimed looking after them im not sorry i met them ought to have gone into a cavalry regiment early in life what fine leaders theyd have made to be sure in a dash for the guns or a charge against a battery but they seem to have done well for themselves in their own way carved out their own fortunes each after his fashion very plucky young fellows one of thems a painter and ones a journalist and both of them are making their mark in their own world i really admire them  and on the way to the station that moment mr  montague nevitt as he lit his cigarette was saying to cyril with an approving smile your miss cliffords pretty  yes cyril answered drily shes not bad looking  she looked her best today and shes capital company  but guy broke out unabashed into a sudden burst of speech  not bad looking he cried contemptuously is that all you have to say of her and you a painter too why shes beautiful shes charming if cyril was shut up in a tunnel with her  he broke off suddenly  and for the rest of the way home he spoke but seldom it was all too true the two warings were cast in the selfsame mould what attracted one it was clear no less surely and certainly attracted the other  as they went to their separate rooms in staple inn that night guy paused for a moment candle in hand by his door and looked straight at cyril  you neednt fear me he said in a very low tone  shes yours you found her i wouldnt be mean enough for a minute to interfere with your find but im not surprised at you i would do the same myself if i could have seen her first i wont see her again  i couldnt stand it shes too beautiful to see and not to fall in love with       chapter viii  elma breaks out      mrs clifford returned from chetwood court that clay in by no means such high spirits as when she went there in the first place she hadnt succeeded in throwing elma and granville kelmscott into one anothers company at all and in the second place elma had talked much under her very nose for halfanhour at a stretch with the unknown young painter fellow  when elma was asked out anywhere else in the country for the next six weeks or so mrs clifford made up her mind strictly to inquire in private before committing herself to an acceptance whether that dangerous young man was likely or not to be included in the party  for mrs clifford admitted frankly to herself that cyril was dangerous as dangerous as they make them  he was just the right age he was handsome he was clever his tawny brown beard had the faintest little touch of artistic redness and was trimmed and dressed with provoking nicety he was an artist too and girls nowadays you know have such an unaccountable way of falling in love with men who can paint or write verses or play the violin or do something foolish of that sort instead of sticking fast to the solid attractions  of the london stock exchange or of ancestral acres  mrs clifford confided her fears that very night to the sympathetic ear of the companion of the militant and guardian saints of the british empire  reginald she said solemnly i told you the other day when you asked about it elma wasnt in love  and at the time i was right or very near it but this afternoon ive had an opportunity of watching them both together and ive half changed my mind  elma thinks a great deal too much altogether im afraid about this young mr waring  how do you know mr clifford asked staring her hard in the face and nodding solemnly  the british matron hesitated how do i know anything she answered at last driven to bay by the question i never know how i only know i know it but whatever we do we must be careful not to let elma and the young man get thrown together again i should say myself it wouldnt be a bad plan if we were to send her away somewhere for the rest of the summer but i can tell you better about all this tomorrow  elma for her part had come home from chetwood court more full than ever of cyril waring he looked so handsome and so manly that afternoon at the holkers elma hoped shed be asked out where he was going to be again  she sat long in her own bedroom thinking it over with herself while the candle burnt down in its socket very low and the house was still and the rain pattered hard on the roof overhead and her father and mother were discussing her by themselves downstairs in the drawingroom  she sat long on her chair without caring to begin undressing she sat and mused with her hands crossed on her lap she sat and thought and her thoughts were all about cyril waring  for more than an hour she sat there dreamily and told herself over one by one in long order the afternoons events from beginning to the end of them she repeated every word cyril had spoken in her ear she remembered every glance every look he had darted at her she thought of that faint pressure of his hand as he said farewell the tender blush came back to her brown cheek once more with maidenly shame as she told it all over he was so handsome and so nice and so very very kind and perhaps after this she might never again meet him her bosom heaved  she was conscious of a new sense just aroused within her  presently her heart began to beat more violently  she didnt know why it had never beaten in her life like that beforenot even in the tunnel nor yet when cyril came up today and spoke first to her slowly slowly she rose from her seat the fit was upon her could this be a dream some strange impulse made her glide forward and stand for a minute or two irresolute in the middle of the room then she turned round once twice thrice half unconsciously she turned round wondering to herself all the while what this strange thing could mean faster faster faster her heart within her beating at each turn with more frantic haste and speed than ever for some minutes she turned glowing with red shame yet unable to stop and still more unable to say to herself why or wherefore  at first that was all she merely turned and panted  but as she whirled and whirled new moods and figures seemed to force themselves upon her she lifted her hands and swayed them about above her head gracefully she was posturing she knew but why she had no idea it all came upon her as suddenly and as uncontrollably as a blush she was whirling around the room now slow now fast but always with her arms held out lissom like a dancinggirls sometimes her body bent this way and sometimes  that her hands keeping time to her movements meanwhile in long graceful curves but all as if compelled by some extrinsic necessity  it was an instinct within her over which she had no control surely surely she must be possessed a spirit that was not her seemed to be catching her round the waist and twisting her about and making her spin headlong over the floor through this wild fierce dance it was terrible terrible yet she could not prevent it  a force not her own seemed to sustain and impel her  and all the time as she whirled she was conscious also of some strange dim need a sense of discomfort oppressed her arms she hadnt everything she required for this solitary orgy something more was lacking her something essential vital but what on earth it could be she knew not she knew not  byandby she paused and as she glanced right and left the sense of discomfort grew clearer and more vivid it was her hands that were wrong her hands were empty she must have something to fill them  something alive lithe curling sinuous these wavings and swayings to this side and to that seemed so  meaningless and voidwithout some life to guide them  there was nothing for her to hold nothing to tame and subdue nothing to cling and writhe and give point to her movements oh heavens how horrible  she drew herself up suddenly and by dint of a fierce brief effort of will repressed for awhile the mad dance that overmastered her the spirit within her if spirit it were kept quiet for a moment awed and subdued by her proud determination then it began once more and led her resistlessly forward she moved over to the chest of drawers still rhythmically and with set steps but to the phantom strain of some unheard low music the music was running vaguely through her head all the timewild aeolian musicit sounded like a rude tune on a harp or zither and surely the cymbals  clashed now and again overhead and the timbrel rang clear and the castanets tinkled keeping time with the measure she stood still and listened no no not a sound save the rain on the roof it was the music of her own heart beating irregularly and fiercely to an intermittent lilt like a hungarian waltz or a roumanian tarantella  by this time elina was thoroughly frightened was she going mad she asked herself or had some evil spirit taken up his abode within her what made her spin and twirl about like thisirresponsibly unintentionally irrepressibly meaninglessly oh what would her mother say if only she knew all and what on earth would cyril waring think of her  cyril waring cyril waring it was all cyril waring and yet if he knewoh mercy mercy  still in spite of these doubts misgivings fears she walked over towards the chest of drawers with a firm and rhythmical tread to the bars of the internal music that rang loud through her brain and began opening one drawer after another in an aimless fashion she was looking for somethingshe didnt know what and she never could rest now until shed found it  drawer upon drawer she opened and shut wearily but nothing that her eyes fell upon seemed to suit her mood dresses and jackets and underlinen were there she glanced at them all with a deep sense of profound contempt none of these gewgaws of civilized life could be of any use to supply the vague want her soul felt so dimly and yet so acutely they were dead dead dead so close and clinging go further go further at last she opened the bottom drawer of all and her eye fell askance upon a feather boa curled up at the bottomsoft smooth and long a winding coiling serpentine boa in a second she had fallen upon it bodily with greedy hands and was twisting it round her waist and holding it high and low and fighting fiercely at times and figuring with it like a posturant some dormant impulse of her race seemed to stir in her blood with frantic leaps and bounds at its first conscious awakening  she gave herself up to it wildly now she was mad she was mad she was glad she was happy  then she began to turn round again slowly slowly slowly as she turned she raised the boa now high above her head now held it low on one side now stooped down and caressed it at times as she played with it the lifeless thing seemed to glide from her grasp in curling folds and elude her at others she caught it round the neck like a snake and twisted it about her arm or let it twine and encircle her writhing body  like a snake like a snake that idea ran like wildfire  through her burning veins it was a snake indeed she wanted a real live snake what would she not have given if it were only sardanapalus  sardanapalus so glossy so beautiful so supple that glorious green serpent with his large smooth coils and his silvery scales and his darting red tongue and his long lithe movements sardanapalus sardanapalus sardanapalus the very name seemed to link itself with the music in her head it coursed with her blood  it rang through her brain and another as well cyril waring cyril waring cyril waring cyril waring  oh great heavens what would cyril waring say now if only he could see her in her mad mood that moment  and yet it was not she not she not she but some spirit some weird some unseen power within her it was no more she than that boa there was a snake a real live snake oh for a real live snake and then she could dancetarantel tarantellaas the spirit within her prompted her to dance it  faster faster said the spirit and she answered him back faster  faster faster faster faster she whirled round the room the boa grew alive it coiled about her it strangled her her candle failed the wick in the socket flickered and died but elma danced on unheeding  in the darkness dance dance dance dance never mind for the light oh what madness was this what insanity had come over her would her feet never stop must she go on till she dropped  must she go on for ever  ashamed and terrified with her maidenly sense overawed  and obscured by this hateful charm yet unable to stay herself unable to resist it in a transport of fear and remorse she danced on irresponsibly check herself  she couldnt let her do what she would her whole being seemed to go forth into that weird wild dance  she trembled and shook she stood aghast at her own shame she had hard work to restrain herself from crying aloud in her horror  at last a lull a stillness a recess her limbs seemed to yield and give way beneath her she half fainted with fatigue she staggered and fell too weary to undress she flung herself upon the bed just as she was clothes and all her overwrought nerves lost consciousness  at once in three minutes she was asleep breathing  fast but peacefully       chapter ix  and after      when elma woke up next morning it was broad daylight she woke with a start to find herself lying upon the bed where she had flung herself for a minute or two she couldnt recollect or recall to herself how it had all come about it was too remote from anything in her previous waking thought too dreamlike too impossible then an unspeakable horror flashed over her unawares her face flushed hot  shame and terror overcame her she buried her head in her hands in an agony of awe her own selfrespect was literally outraged it wasnt exactly remorse it wasnt exactly fear it was a strange creeping feeling of ineffable disgust and incredulous astonishment  there could be but one explanation of this impossible episode she must have gone mad all at once she must be a frantic lunatic  a single thought usurped her whole soul if she was going madif this was really maniashe could never never nevermarry cyril waring  for in a flash of intuition she knew that now she knew she was in love she knew he loved her  in that wild moment of awakening all the rest mattered nothing the solitary idea that ran now through her head as the impulse to dance had run through it last night was the idea that she could never marry cyril waring and if cyril waring could have seen her just then her cheeks burned yet a brighter scarlet at that thought than even before one virginal blush suffused her face from chin to forehead the maidenly sense of shame consumed and devoured her  was she mad was she mad and was this a lucid interval  presently as she lay still on her bed all dressed and with her face in her hands trembling for very shame a little knock sounded tentatively at the door of her bedroom it was a timid small knock very low and soft and as it were inquiring it seemed to say in an apologetic sort of undertone i dont know whether youre awake or not just yet and if youre still asleep pray dont let me for a moment disturb or arouse you  whos there elma mustered up courage to ask in a hushed voice of terror hiding her head under the bedclothes  its me darling mrs clifford answered very softly and sweetly elma had never heard her mother speak in so tender and gentle a tone before though they loved one another well and were far more sympathetic than most mothers and daughters and besides that knock was so unlike mammas why so soft and low  had mamma discovered her with a despairing sense of being caught she looked down at her telltale clothes and the unsleptin bed  oh what shall i ever do she thought to herself confusedly i cant let mamma come in and catch me like this shell ask why on earth i didnt undress last night and then what could i ever say how could i ever explain to her  the awful sense of shamefacedness grew upon her still more deeply than ever she jumped up and whispered through the door in a very penitent voice oh mother i cant let you in just yet do you mind waiting five minutes come again byandby iiim so awfully tired and queer this morning somehow  mrs cliffords voice had an answering little ring of terror in it as she replied at once in the same soft tone  very well darling thats all right stay as long as you like dont trouble to get up if youd rather have your breakfast in bed and dont hurry yourself at all ill come back byandby and see whats the matter  elma didnt know why but by the very tone of her mothers voice she felt dimly conscious something strange had happened mrs clifford spoke with unusual gentleness yet with an unwonted tremor  thank you dear elma answered through the door going back to the bedside and beginning to undress in a tumult of shame come again byandby in just five minutes it would do her good she knew in spite of her shyness to talk with her mother  then she folded her clothes neatly one by one on a ohair hid the peccant boa away in its own lower drawer buttoned her neat little embroidered nightdress  tightly round her throat arranged her front hair into a careless disorder and tried to cool down her fiery red cheeks with copious bathing in cold water  when mrs clifford came back five minutes later everything  looked to the outer eye of a mere casual observer exactly as if elma had laid in bed all night curled up between the sheets in the most orthodox fashion  but all these elaborate preparations didnt for one moment deceive the mothers watchful glance or the keen intuition shared by all the women of the clifford family she looked tenderly at elmaelma with her face half buried in the pillows and the telltale flush still crimsoning her cheek in a single round spot then she turned for a second to the clothes too neatly folded on the chair by the bedside as she murmured low  youre not well this morning my child youd better not get up ill bring you a cup of tea and some toast myself you dont feel hungry of course ah no i thought not just a slice of dry toastyes yes  i have been there some eau de cologne on your forehead  dear there there dont cry elma youll be better byandby stop in bed till lunchtime i wont let lucy come up with the tea of course youd rather be alone you were tired last night dont be afraid my darling itll soon pass off theres nothing on earth nothing at all to be alarmed at  she laid her hand nervously on elmas arm half dead with shame as she was elma noticed it trembled  she noticed too that mamma seemed almost afraid to catch her eye when their glance met for an instant the mothers eyelids fell and her cheek too burned bright red almost as red elma felt as her own that nestled hot so deep in the pillow neither said a word to the other of what she thought or felt but their mute sympathy itself made them more shamefaced than ever in some dim indefinite instinctive fashion elma knew her mother was vaguely aware what she had done last night her gaze fell half unconsciously on the bottom drawer with quick insight mrs cliffords  eye followed her daughters then it fell as before elma looked up at her terrified and burst into a sudden flood of tears her mother stooped down and caught her wildly in her arms cry cry my darling ahe murmured clasping her hard to her breast cry cry itll do you good theres safety in crying nobody  but i shall come near you today nobody else shall know dont be afraid of me have not i been there too its nothing nothing  with a burst of despair elma laid her face in her mothers bosom some minutes later mrs clifford went down to meet her husband in the breakfastroom  well the father asked shortly looking hard at his wifes face which told its own tale at once for it was white and pallid  well mrs clifford answered with a preoccupied air elmas not herself this morning at all had a nervous turn after she went to her room last night i know what it is i suffered from them myself when i was about her age her eyes fell quickly and she shrank from her husbands searching glance she was a plumpfaced and wellfavoured british matron now but once many years before as a slim young girl she had been in love with somebodysomebody whom by superior parental wisdom she was never allowed to marry being put off instead with a wellconnected match young mr clifford of the colonial office that was all no more romance than that the common romance of every womans heart a forgotten love  yet she tingled to remember it  and you think mr clifford asked laying down his newspaper and looking very grave  i dont think i know his wife answered hastily  i was wrong the other day and elmas in love with that young man cyril waring i know more than that reginald i know you may crush her i know you may kill her but if you dont want to do that i know she must marry him whether we wish it or whether we dont theres nothing else to be done as things stand now its inevitable unavoidable shell never be happy with anybody elseshe must have himand i for one wont try to prevent her  mr reginald clifford cmg sometime administrator  of the island of st kitts gazed at his wife in blank astonishment she spoke decidedly he had never heard her speak with such firmness in his life before it fairly took his breath away he gazed at his wife blankly as he repeated to himself in very slow and solemn tones each word distinct you for one wont try to prevent her  no i wont mrs clifford retorted defiantly assured in her own mind she was acting right  elmas really in love with him and i wont let elmas life be wreckedas some lives have been wrecked and as some mothers would wreck it  mr clifford leaned back in his chair one mass of astonishment and let the japanese paperknife he was holding in his right hand drop clattering from his fingers if i hadnt heard you say it yourself louisa he answered with a gasp i could never have believed it i couldneverhavebelieved it  i dont believe it even now its impossible incredible  but its true mrs clifford repeated elma must marry the man shes in love with  meanwhile poor elma lay alone in her bedroom upstairs that awful sense of remorse and shame still making her cheeks tingle with unspeakable horror  mrs clifford brought up her cup of tea herself elma took it with gratitude but still never dared to look her mother in the face mrs clifford too kept her own eyes averted it made elmas selfabasement even profounder than before to feel that her mother instinctively knew everything  the poor child lay there long with a burning face and tingling ears too ashamed to get up and dress herself and face the outer world too ashamed to go down before her fathers eyes till long after lunchtime  then there came a noise at the door once more the rustling of a dress a retreating footstep somebody  pushed an envelope stealthily under the door  elma picked it up and examined it curiously it bore a penny stamp and the local postmark it must have come then by the two oclock delivery without a doubt but the address why the address was written in some unknown hand and in printing capitals elma tore it open with a beating heart and read the one line of manuscript it contained which was also written in the same printlike letters  dont be afraid the letter said it will do you no harm resist it when it comes if you do you will get the better of it  elma looked at the letter over and over again in a fever of dismay she was certain it was her mother had written that note but she read it with tears only halfreassuredand then burnt it to ashes and proceeded to dress herself  when she went down to the drawingroom mrs  clifford rose from her seat and took her hand in her own and kissed her on one cheek as if nothing out of the common had happened in any way the talk between them was obtrusively commonplace but all that day long elma noticed her mother was far tenderer to her than usual and when she went up to bed mrs clifford held her fingers for a moment with a gentle pressure and kissed her twice upon her eyes and stifled a sigh and then broke from the room as if afraid to speak to her       chapter x  colonel kelmscotts repentance      elma clifford wasnt the only person who passed a terrible night and suffered a painful awakening on the morning after the holkers gardenparty colonel kelmscott too had his bad halfhour or so before he finally fell asleep and he woke up next day to a sense of shame and remorse far more definite and therefore more poignant and more real than elmas  hour after hour indeed he lay there on his bed afraid to toss or turn lest he should wake lady emily but with his limbs all fevered and his throat all parched thinking over the strange chance that had thus brought him face to face on the threshold of his honoured age with the two lads he had wronged so long and so cruelly  the shock of meeting them had been a sudden and a painful one to be sure the colonel had always felt the time might come when his two eldest sons would cross his path in the intricate maze of london society  he had steeled himself as he thought to meet them there with dignity and with stoical reserve he had made up his mind that if ever the names he had imposed upon them were to fall upon his startled ears no human being that stood by and looked on should note for one second a single tremor of his lips a faint shudder of surprise an almost imperceptible flush or pallor on his impassive countenance and when the shock came indeed he had borne it as he meant to bear it with military calmness not even mrs clifford he thought could have discovered from any undertone  of his voice or manner that the two lads he received  with such wellbred unconcern were his own twin sons the true heirs and inheritors of the tilgate park property  and yet the actual crisis had taken him quite by surprise and shaken him far more than he could ever have conceived possible for one thing though he quite expected that some day he would run up unawares against guy and cyril he did not expect it would be down in the country and still less within a few miles drive of tilgate in london of course all things are possible sooner or later there everybody hustles and clashes against everybody for that reason he had tried to suggest by indirect means when he launched them on the world that the twins should tempt their fortune in india or the colonies  he would have liked to think they were well out of his way and out of granvilles too but against his advice they had stayed on in england so he expected  to meet them some day at the academy private view perhaps or in mrs bouverie bartons literary saloon but certainly not on the close sward of the holkers lawn within a few short miles of his own home at tilgate  and now he had met them his conscience that had lain asleep so long woke up of a sudden with a terrible start and began to prick him fiercely  if only they had been ugly misshapen vulgar if only they had spoken with coarse rough voices or irritated him by their inferior social tone or shown themselves unworthy to be the heirs of tilgatewhy then the colonel might possibly have forgiven himself  but to see his own two sons the sons he had never set eyes on for twentyfive years or more grown up into such handsome wellset noblelooking fellowsso clever so bright so able so charmingto feel they were in every way as much gentlemen born as granville  himself and to know he had done all three an irreparable wrong oh that was too much for him for he had kept two of his sons out of their own all these years only in order to make the position and prospects of the third at last certainly doubtful and perhaps wretched  there was much to excuse him to himself no doubt he cried to his own soul piteously in the night watches  proud man as he was he could not so wholly abase himself even to his inmost self as to admit he had sinned without deep provocation he thought it all over in his heart just there exactly as it all happened that simple and natural tale of a common wrong that terrible secret of a lifetime that he was still to repent in sackcloth and ashes  it was so long beforeall those twentysix years or was it twentyeightsince his regiment had been quartered away down in devonshire he was a handsome  subaltern then with a frank open faceharry kelmscott of the greysjust such another man he said to himself in his remorse as his son granville nowor rather perhaps as guy and cyril waring for he couldnt conceal from himself any longer the patent fact that lucy warings sons were like his own old self and sturdier handsomer young fellows into the bargain than lady emily kelmscotts boy granville whom he had made into the heir of the tilgate manors the moor where the greys were quartered that summer was as dull as ditchwater no society no dances no hunting no sport what wonder a man of his tastes spoiling for want of a drawingroom to conquer should have kept his hand in with pretty lucy waring  but he married herhe married her he did her no wrong in the end he hadnt that sin at least to lay to his conscience  ah well poor lucy he had really been fond of her as fond as a kelmscott of tilgate could reasonably be expected ever to prove towards the daughter of a simple dartmoor farmer it began in flirtation of course as such things will begin and it ended as they will end too in love at least on poor lucys side for what can you expect from a kelmscott of tilgate and indeed indeed he said to himself earnestly he meant her no harm though he seemed at times to be cruel to her  as soon as he gathered how deeply she was entangledhow seriously she took it allhow much she was in love with himhe tried hard to break it off he tried hard to put matters to her in their proper light he tried to show her that an officer and a gentleman a kelmscott  of tilgate could never really have dreamed of marrying the halfeducated halfpeasant daughter of a devonshire farmer though to be sure she was a lady in her way too poor lucy as much of a lady in manner and in heart as emily herself whose father was an earl and whose mother was a marquiss eldest daughter  so much a lady in her way in deed in thought and all thatone of natures gentlewomenthat when lucy cried and broke her heart at his halting explanations he was unmanned by her sobs and did a thing no kelmscott of tilgate should ever have stooped to doyes promised to marry her of course he didnt attempt in his own heart to justify that initial folly as lie thought it to himself he didnt pretend to condone it he only allowed he had acted like a fool a kelmscott  of tilgate should have drawn back long before or else having gone so far should have told the girl plainlyat whatever cost to herhe could go no further and have no more to say to her  to be sure that would have killed the poor thing outright but a kelmscott you know should respect his order and shouldnt shrink for a moment from these trifling sacrifices  however his own heart was better in those days than his class philosophy he couldnt trample on poor lucy waring so he made a fool of himself in the endand married lucy ah well ah well every man makes a fool of himself once or twice in his life and though the colonel was ashamed now of having so far bemeaned his order as to marry the girl why if the truth must out he would have been more ashamed still in his heart of hearts even then if he hadnt married her he was better than his creed he could never have crushed her  married her yes but not publicly of course at least he respected public decency he married her under his own name to be sure but by special licence and at a remote little village on the far side of the moor where nobody knew either himself or lucy in those days he hadnt yet come into possession of the tilgate estates and if his father had known of itwell the admiral was such a despotic old man that hed have insisted on his sons selling out at once and going off to australia or heaven knows where on a journey round the world and breaking poor lucys heart by his absence partly for her sake the colonel said to himself  now in the silent night and partly for his own he had concealed the marriagefor the time beingfrom the admiral  and then came that horrible embroilmentoh how well he remembered it ah me ah me it seemed but yesterdaywhen his father insisted he was to marry lady emily croke lord aldeburghs daughter and he dared not marry her of course having a wife already and he dared not tell his father on the other hand why he couldnt marry her it was a hateful time he shrank from recalling it he was keeping lucy then his own wedded wife as mrs waring in small rooms in plymouth and yet he was running up to town now and again on leave as the gay young bachelor the heir of tilgate parkand meeting emily croke at every party he went to in londonand braving the admirals wrath by refusing to propose to her what he would ever have done if lucy had lived he couldnt imagine  but there lucy didnt live so he was saved that bother poor child it brought tears to his eyes even now to think of her he brushed them furtively away lest he should waken lady emily  and yet it was a shock to him the night lucy died  just then he could hardly realize how lucky was the accident he sat there by her side the day the twins were born to see her safely through her trouble for he had always done his duty after a fashion by lucy  when a girl of that class marries a gentleman dont you see and consents too mind you to marry him privately she cant expect to share much of her husbands company she cant expect he should stultify himself by acknowledging her publicly before his own class and indeed he always meant to acknowledge her in the endafter his fathers death when there was no fear of the admirals cutting off his allowance  but how curiously events often turn out of themselves  the twins were born on a friday morning and by the saturday night poor lucy was lying dead a pale sweet corpse in her own little room near the hoe at plymouth it was a happy release for him though he really loved her but still when a mans fool enough to love a girl below his own station in lifethe colonel paused and broke off it was twentyseven years ago now yet he really loved her he couldnt find it in his heart even then to indorse to the full the common philosophy of his own order  so there he was left with the two boys on his hands but free if he liked to marry lady emily no reason on earth of course why he shouldnt marry her now  so naturally he married herafter a fortnights interval the admiral was all smiles and paternal blessings at this sudden change of front on his sons part why the dickens harry hadnt wanted to marry the girl before to be sure he couldnt conceive hankering  after some missy in the country he supposed that silly rot about what they call love no doubt but now that harry had come to his senses at last and taken the earls lass why the admiral was indulgence and munificence itself the young people should have an ample allowance and my daughterinlaw lady emily should live on the best that tilgate and chetwood could possibly afford her  what would you have the colonel asked piteously in the dead of night of his own conscience how else could he have acted he said nothing that was all mind you he declared to himself more than once in his own soul he told no lies he made no complications while the admiral lived he brought up lucys sons quite privately at plymouth and as soon as ever the admiral died he really and truly meant to acknowledge them  but fathers never diein entailed estates the admiral lived so longquite quite too long for guy and cyril granville was born and grew to be a big boy and was treated by everybody as the heir to tilgate and now the colonels difficulties gathered thicker around him at last in the fulness of time the admiral died and slept with his fathers whose elizabethan ruffs were the honour and glory of the chancel at tilgate and then the day of reckoning was fairly upon him how well he remembered that awful hour he couldnt he couldnt he knew it was his duty to acknowledge his rightful sons and heirs but he hadnt the courage things had all altered so much  meanwhile guy and cyril had gone to charterhouse as nobodys wards and been brought up in the expectation  of earning their own livelihood so no wrong he said casuistically had been done to them at any rate  and granville had been brought up as the heir of tilgate lady emily naturally expected her son to succeed his father he had gone too far to turn back at last and yet  and yet in his own heart disguise it as he might he knew he was keeping his lawful sons out of their own in the end and it was his duty to acknowledge them as the heirs of tilgate       chapter xi  a family jar      hour after hour the unhappy man lay still as death on his bed and reasoned in vain with his accusing conscience to be sure he said to himself no man was bound by the law of england to name his heir  it is for the eldest son himself to come forward and make his claim if guy and cyril could prove their title to the tilgate estates when he himself was dead that was their private business he wasnt bound to do anything special to make the way easy for them beforehand  but still when he saw them his heart arose and smote him his very class prejudices fought hard on their behalf these men were gentlemen the eldest sons of a kelmscott of tilgatetrue kelmscotts to the corehandsome courtly erect of bearing guy was the very image of the kelmscott of tilgate park who bled for king charles at marston moor cyril had the exact mien of sir rupert kelmscott knight of chetwood  the ablest of their race whose portrait by kneller hung in the great hall between his father the admiral and his uncle sir frederick they had all the qualities the colonel himself associated with the kelmscott name they were strong brave vigorous able to hold their own against all comers to leave them out in the cold was not only wrongit was also he felt in his heart of hearts a treason to his order  at last after long watching he fell asleep but he slept uneasily when he woke it was with a start  he found himself murmuring to himself in his troubled sleep break the entail and settle a sum on the two that will quiet them  it was the only way left to prevent public scandal and to save lady emily and his son granville from a painful disclosure while at the same time it would to some extent satisfy the claims of his conscience  compromise compromise theres nothing like compromise  colonel kelmscott had always had by temperament a truly british love of compromise  to carry out his plan indeed it would be necessary to break the entail twice once formally and once again really he must begin by getting granvilles consent to the proposed arrangement so as to raise ready money with which to bribe the young men and as soon as granvilles consent was obtained he must put it plainly to guy and cyril as an anonymous benefactor that if they would consent to accept a fixed sum in lieu of all contingencies then the secret of their birth would be revealed to them at last and they would be asked to break the entail on the estates as eldest sons of a gentleman of property  it was a hard bargain a very hard bargain but then these boys would jump at it no doubt expecting nothing as they did theyd certainly jump at it its a great point you see to come in suddenly when you expect nothing to a nice lump sum of five or six thousand  so much so indeed that the real difficulty he thought would rather lie in approaching granville  after breakfast that morning however he tapped his son on the shoulder as he was leaving the table and said to him in his distinctly business tone granville will you step with me into the library for ten minutes talk theres a small matter of the estate i desire to discuss with you  granville looked back at him with a curiously amused air  why yes he said shortly its a very odd coincidence but do you know i was going this morning myself to ask for a chance of ten minutes talk with you  he rose and followed his father into the oakpanelled library the colonel sat down on one of the uncomfortable  library chairs especially designed with their knobs and excrescences to prevent the bare possibility of serious study granville took a seat opposite him across the formal oak table colonel kelmscott paused and cleared his throat nervously then with military promptitude he darted straight into the very thick of the fray  granville he said abruptly i want to speak with you about a rather big affair the fact of it is im going to break the entail i want to raise some money  the son gave a little start of surprise and amusement  why this is very odd he exclaimed once more in an astonished tone thats just the precise thing i wanted to talk about with you  colonel kelmscott eyed him with an answering start  not debts he said slowly my boy my boy this is bad not debts surely granville i never suspected it  oh dear no granville answered frankly no debts you may be sure but i wanted to feel myself on a satisfactory basisas to income and so forth and i was prepared to pay for my freedom well to tell you the truth outright i want to marry  colonel kelmscott eyed him close with a very puzzled look not elma clifford my boy he said again quickly for of course if it is her granville i need hardly say  the young man cut him short with a hasty little laugh elma clifford he repeated with some scorn in his musical voice oh dear no not her if it had been her you may be sure thered be no reason of any sort for breaking the entail but the fact is this i dislike allowances one way or the other i want to feel once for all im my own master i want to marrynot this girl or that but whom ever i will i dont care to coine to you with my hat in my hand asking how much youll be kind enough to allow me if i venture to take miss soandso or miss whatyoumaycallit and as i know you want money yourself for this new wing youre thinking of why im prepared  to break the entail at once and sell whatever building land you think right and proper  the father held his breath what on earth could this mean and who is the girl granville he asked with unconcealed interest  you wont care to hear his son answered carelessly  colonel kelmscott looked across at him with a very red face not some girl wholl bring disgrace upon your mother i hope he said with a halfpang of remorse remembering lucy not some young woman beneath your own station in life for to that you may be sure ill never consent under any circumstances  granville drew himself up proudly with a haughty smile he was a kelmscott too as arrogant as the best of them  no thats not the difficulty he answered looking rather amused than annoyed or frightened my tastes are not low i hope i know better than to disgrace my family the lady i want to marry and for whose sake i wish you to make some arrangement beforehand isdont be surprisedwell gwendoline gildersleeve  gwendoline gildersleeve his father echoed astonished for there was feud between the families that rascally landgrabbing barristers daughter  why how on earth do you come to know anything of her granville nobody in surrey ever had the  impertinence yet to ask me or mine to meet the  gildersleeves anywhere since that disgraceful behaviour of his about the boundary fences and i didnt suppose youd ever even seen her  nobody in surrey ever did ask me to meet her granville answered somewhat curtly but you cant expect every one in london society to keep watch over the quarrels of every country parish in provincial england it wouldnt be reasonable i met gwendoline  if you want to know at the bertrams in berkeley square and she and i got on so well together that wevewell weve met from time to time in the park since our return from town and we think by this time we may consider ourselves informally engaged to one another  colonel kelmscott gazed at his son in a perfect access of indignant amazement gilbert gildersleeves daughter that rascally qcs at any other moment such a proposal would have driven him forthwith into open hostilities if granville chose to marry a girl like that why granville might have lived on what his father would allow him  just now however with this keen fit of remorse quite fresh upon his soul about poor lucys sons colonel kelmscott was almost disposed to accept the opening thus laid before him by granvilles proposal  so he temporized for awhile nursing his chin with his hand and then after much discussion yielded at last a conditional consentconditional upon their mutual agreement as to the terms on which the entail was to be finally broken  and what sort of arrangement do you propose i should make for your personal maintenance and this gildersleeve girls household the colonel asked at length with a very red face descending to details  his son without appearing to notice the implied slight to gwendoline named the terms that he thought would satisfy him  thats a very stiff sum the master of tilgate retorted but perhaps i could manage it perhaps i could manage it we must sell the dowlands farm at once thats certain and i must take the twelve thousand or so the land will fetch for my own use absolutely and without restriction  to build the new wing with the son put in with a gesture of assent  to build the new wing with why certainly not his father answered angrily am i to bargain with my son what use im to make of my own property  mark my words i wont submit to interference to do precisely as i choose with sir to roll in if i like  to fling into the sea if the fancy takes me  granville kelmscott stared hard at him twelve thousand pounds what on earth could his father mean by this whim he wondered twelve thousand pounds is a very big sum to fling away from the estate without a question asked he retorted growing hot it seems to me you too closely resemble our ancestors who came over from holland in matters of business you know the fault of the dutch is giving too little and asking too much  his father glared at him thats the worst of this huckstering and higgling with your own flesh and blood you have to put up with such intolerable insults but he controlled himself and continued the longer he talked however the hotter and angrier he became by degrees and what made him the hottest and angriest of all was the knowledge meanwhile  that he was doing it every bit for granvilles own sake nay more that consideration for granville alone had brought him originally into this peck of trouble  at last he could contain himself with indignation no longer his temper broke down he flared up and out with it take care what you do he cried  take care what you say granville im not going to be bearded with impunity in my den if you press me too hard remember ill ruin all i can cut you off with a shilling sir if i choosecut you off with a shilling yes and do justice to others ive wronged for your sake dont provoke me too far i say if you do youll repent it  cut me off with a shilling sir his son answered angrily rising and staring hard at him why what do you mean by that you know you cant do it my interest in the estates as good as your own im the eldest son  he broke off suddenly for at those fatal words colonel kelmscotts face fiery red till then grew instantly blanched and white with terror oh what have i done the unhappy man cried seeing his sons eyes read some glimpse of the truth too clearly in his look oh what have i said forget it granny forget it i didnt mean to go so far as i did in my anger i was a foola fool i gave way too much  for heavens sake my boy forget it forget it  the young man looked across at him with a dazed and puzzled look yet very full of meaning i shall never forget it he said slowly i shall learn what it means i dont know how things stand but i see you meant it do as you like about the entail its no business of mine take your pound of flesh your twelve thousand down and pay your hushmoney  i dont know whom you bribe and i have nothing to say to it i never dragged the honour of the kelmscotts in the dust i wont drag it now i wash my hands clean from it i ask no questions i demand no explanations i only say this until i know what you meanknow whether im lawful heir to tilgate park or not i wont marry the girl i meant to marry  i have too much regard for her and for the honour of our house to take her on what may prove to be false expectations break the entail i say raise your twelve thousand pay off your bloodhounds but never expect me to touch a penny of your money henceforth and for ever till i know whether it was yours and mine at all to deal with  colonel kelmscott bent down his proud head meekly  as you will granville he answered quite broken with remorse and silenced by shame my boy my boy i only wanted to save you       chapter xii  in silence and tears      when he had time to think colonel kelmscott determined  in his own mind that he would still do his best to save granville whether granville himself wished it or otherwise so he proceeded to take all the necessary steps for breaking the entail and raising the money he needed for guy and cyril  in all this granville neither acquiesced nor dissented  he signed mechanically whatever documents his father presented to him and he stood by his bargain with a certain sullen undeviating hardfeatured loyalty but he never forgot those few angry words in which his father had half let out his longguarded life secret  thinking the matter over continually with himself however he came in the end to the natural conclusion that one explanation alone would fit all the facts he was not his fathers eldest son at all colonel kelmscott  must have been married to some one else before his marriage with lady emily that some one elses son was the real heir of tilgate and it was to him that his father in his passionate penitence proposed after many years to do onesided justice now granville kelmscott though a haughty and somewhat headstrong fellow after the fashion of his race was a young man of principle and of honour the moment this hideous doubt occurred to his mind he couldnt rest in his bed till he had cleared it all up and settled it for ever one way or the other if tilgate wasnt his by law and right he wanted none of it if his father was trying to buy off the real heir to the estate with a pitiful pittance in order to preserve the illgotten remainder for lady emilys son why granville for his part would be no active party to such a miserable  compromise if some other man was the colonels lawful heir let that other man take the property and enjoy it but he granville kelmscott would go forth upon the world an honest adventurer to seek his fortune with his own right hand wherever he might find it  still he could take no active step on the other hand to hunt up the truth about the colonels real or supposed first marriage for here an awful dilemma blocked the way before him if the colonel had married before and if by that former marriage he had a son or sonshow could granville be sure the supposed first wife was dead before the second was married  and supposing for a moment she was not deadsupposing his father had been even more criminal and more unjust than he at first imaginedhow could he take the initiative himself in showing that his own mother lady emily kelmscott was no wife at all in the sight of the law that some other woman was his fathers lawful consort the bare possibility of such an issue was too horrible for any son on earth to face undismayed so tortured and distracted by his divided duty granville kelmscott shrank alike from action or inaction  in the midst of such doubts and difficulties however one duty shone out clear as day before him till the mystery was cleared up till the problem was solved he must see no more of gwendoline gildersleeve he had engaged himself to her as the heir of tilgate she had accepted him under that guise and looked forward to an early and happy marriage now all was changed  he was or might be a beggar and an outcast to be sure he knew gwendoline loved him for himself but how could he marry her if he didnt even know he had anything of his own in the world to marry upon the park and fallow deer had been a part of himself without  them he felt he was hardly even a kelmscott it was his plain duty now for gwendolines sake to release her from her promise to a man who might perhaps be penniless and who couldnt even feel sure he was the lawful son of his own father and yetfor lady emilys sakehe mustnt hint even to gwendoline the real reason which moved him to offer her this release he must throw himself upon her mercy without cause assigned and ask her for the time being to have faith in him and to believe him  so a day or two after the interview with his father in the library the selfdisinherited heir of tilgate took the path through the glade that led into the dell beyond the boundary fencethat dell which had once been accounted a component part of tilgate park but which gilbert gildersleeve had proved in his coldblooded documentary legal way to belong in reality to the grounds of woodlands it was in the dell that granville  sometimes ran up against gwendoline he sat down on the broken ledge of ironstone that overhung the little brook it was eleven oclock gone by eleven oclock three mornings in the week chancepure chancethe patron god of lovers brought gwendoline into the dell to meet him  presently a light footfall rang soft upon the path and next moment a tall and beautiful girl with a wealth of auburn hair and a bright colour in her cheeks tripped lightly down the slope as if strolling through the wood in maiden meditation fancy free unexpecting any one  what you here mr kelmscott she exclaimed as she saw him her pink cheek deepening as she spoke to a still profounder crimson  yes im here gwendoline granville kelmscott answered with a smile of recognition at her maidenly pretence of an undesigned coincidence and im here to say the truth because i quite expected this morning to meet you  he took her hand gravely gwendoline let her eyes fall modestly on the ground as if some warmer greeting were more often bestowed between them the young man blushed with a certain manly shame no not today dear he said with an effort as she held her cheek aside half courting and half deprecating the expected kiss oh gwendoline i dont know how to begin i dont know how to say it but ive got very sad news for younews that i cant bear to breakthat i cant venture to explainthat i dont even properly understand myself i must throw myself upon your faith i must just ask you to trust me  gwendoline let him seat her unresisting upon the ledge by his side and her cheek grew suddenly ashy pale as she answered with a gasp forgetting the mr  kelmscott at this sudden leap into the stern realities of life why granville what do you mean you know i can trust you you know whatever it may be i believe you implicitly  the young man took her hand in his with a tender pressure it was a terrible message to have to deliver  he bungled and blundered on with many twists and turns through some inarticulate attempt at an indefinite explanation it wasnt that he didnt love heroh devotedly eternally she must know that well she never could doubt it it wasnt that any shadow had arisen between him and her it wasnt anything he could speak about or anything she must say to any soul on earthoh for his mothers sake he hoped and trusted she would religiously keep his secret inviolate  but something had happened to him within the last few dayssomething unspeakable indefinite uncertain vague yet very full of the most dreadful possibilities something that might make him unable to support a wife something that at least must delay or postpone for an unknown time the longhopedfor prospect of his claiming her and marrying her some day perhapshe broke off suddenly and looked with a wistful look into her deep grey eyes his resolution failed him one kiss he said gwendoline his voice was choking the beautiful girl turning towards him with a wild sob fell yielding herself on his breast and cried hot tears of joy at that evident sign that in spite of all he said he still really loved her  they sat there long hand in hand and eye on eye talking it all over as lovers will with infinite delays yet getting no nearer towards a solution either way  gwendoline for her part didnt care of coursewhat true woman doeswhether granville was the heir of tilgate or not she would marry him all the more she said if he were a penniless nobody all she wanted was to love him and be near him let him marry her now marry her today and then go where he would in the world to seek his livelihood but granville poor fellow alarmed at the bare suggestionfor his mothers sakethat tilgate might really not be his checked her at once in her outburst with a grave silent look he was still he said calmly the inheritor of tilgate it wasnt that at least not as she took it he didnt know precisely what it was himself she must have faith in him and trust him she must wait and see  in the end he hoped he would come back and marry her  and gwendoline made answer with many tears that she knew it was so and that she loved him and trusted him so after sitting there long hand locked in hand and heart intent on heart the two young people rose at last to go protesting and vowing their mutual love on either side as happy and as miserable in their divided lives as two young people in all england that moment over and over again they kissed and said goodbye then they stood with one anothers fingers clasped hard in their own unwilling to part and unable to loose them after that they kissed again and declared once more they were brokenhearted and could never leave one another but still granville added half aside he must make up his mind not to see gwendoline againhonour demanded that sacrificetill he could come at last a rich man to claim her meanwhile she was free and hehe was ever hers devotedly wholesouledly but they were no longer engaged he was hers in heart only let her try to forget him he could never forget her  and gwendoline sobbing and tearful but believing him implicitly retreated with slow steps looking back at each turn of the zigzag path and sending the ghosts of dead kisses from her fingertips to greet him  below in the dell granville stood still and watched her depart in breathless silence then in an agony of despair he flung himself down on the ground and burst into tears and sobbed like a child over his broken daydream  gwendoline coming back to make sure saw him lying and sobbing so and womanlike felt compelled to step down just one minute to comfort him granville in turn refused her proffered comfortit was better sohe mustnt listen to her any more he must steel himself to say no he must remember it was dishonourable  of him to drag a delicately nurtured girl into a penniless marriage then they kissed once more and made it all up again and they sobbed and wept as before and broke it off for ever and they said goodbye for the very last time and they decided they must never meet till granville came back and they hoped they would sometimes catch just a glimpse of one another in the outer world and whatever the other one said or did they would each in their hearts be always true to their first great love and they were more miserable still and they were happier than they had ever been in their lives before and they parted at last with a desperate effort each perfectly sure of the others love and each vowing in soul they would never never see one another again but each for all that perfectly certain that some day or other they would be husband and wife though tilgate and the wretched little fallow deer should sink unwept to the bottom of the ocean       chapter xiii  business first      the manager at messrs drummond coutts and barclays  limited received colonel kelmscott with distinguished consideration a courteous conciliatory sort of man that manager with his closeshaven face and his spotless shirtfront  five minutes my dear sir he exclaimed with warmth motioning his visitor blandly into the leathercovered chair half an hour if you wish it we always have leisure to receive our clients any service we can render them were only too happy  but this is a very peculiar bit of business colonel kelmscott answered humming and hawing with obvious hesitation it isnt quite in the regular way of banking  i believe perhaps indeed i ought rather to have put it into the hands of my solicitor but even if you cant manage the thing yourself you may be able to put me in the way of finding out how best i can get it managed elsewhere  the manager bowed his smile was a smile of genuine satisfaction colonel kelmscott of tilgate was in a most gracious humour the manager with deference  held himself wholly at his clients disposition  so the colonel proceeded to unfold his business  there were two young men now knocking about town of the names of guy and cyril waringthe one a journalist the other a painterand they had rooms in staple inn holborn which would doubtless form a sufficient clue by which to identify them colonel kelmscott desired unobtrusively to know where these young men bankedif indeed they were in a position to keep an account and when that was found out he wished messrs drummond coutts and barclay limited to place a sum of money at their bankers to their credit without mentioning the name of the person so placing it as well as to transmit to them a sealed envelope containing instructions as to the use to be made of the money in question  the manager nodded a cautious acquiescence to place the money to the credit of the two young men indeed would be quite in their way but to send the sealed envelope without being aware of its contents or the nature of the business on which it was despatched would be much less regular perhaps the colonel might find some other means of managing without their aid that portion of the business arrangement  the colonel for his part fell in readily enough with this modest point of view it amply sufficed for him if the money were paid to the young mens credit and a receipt forwarded to him in due course under cover of a number to the care of the bankers  very well the manager answered rubbing his hands contentedly our confidential clerk will settle all that for you a most sagacious person our  confidential clerk no eyes no ears no tongue for anything but our clients interests  the colonel smiled and sat a little longer giving further details as the precise amount he wished sent and the particular way he wished to send itthe whole sum to be in fact twelve thousand pounds amount of the purchase money of the dowlands farms whereof only six thousand had as yet been paid down and that six thousand he wished to place forthwith to the credit of cyril waring the painter the remaining six thousand to be settled as agreed in five weeks time he would then make over under the selfsame conditions to the other brother guy waring the journalist it had gone a trifle too cheap that land at dowlands the colonel opined but still in days like these he was very glad indeed to find a purchaser for the place at anything like its value  i think a miss ewes was the fortunate bidder wasnt she the manager asked just to make a certain decent show of interest in his clients estate  yes miss elma ewes of kenilworth the colonel answered letting loose for a moment his tongue that unruly member shes the composer you knowwrites songs and dances remotely connected with reginald clifford the man who was governor of some west indian dutchovenst kitts i think or antiguahe lives down our way and hes a neighbour of mine at tilgate or rather shes connected with mrs clifford  the governors wife who was one of the younger branch a miss ewes of worthing daughter of the ewes who was dean of dorchester elmas been a family name for years with all the lot of eweses good bad or indifferent came down to them dont you know from that roumanian ancestress  indeed the manager answered now beginning to be really interestedfor the cliffords were clients too and it behoves a banker to know everything about everybodys business so mrs clifford had an ancestress  who was a roumanian had she well ive noticed at times her complexion looked very southern and gipsylikedistinctly unenglish  oh they call it roumanian colonel kelmscott went on in a confidential tone roping his white  moustache and growing more and more conversational they call it roumanian because it sounds more respectable but i believe if you go right down to the very bottom of the thing it was much more like some kind of oriental gipsy sir michael ewes the founder of the house in george the seconds time was ambassador  for awhile at constantinople he began life indeed i believe as a turkey merchant well at pera one day so the story goesyoull find it all in horace walpoles diaryhe picked up with this darkskinned gipsywoman who was a wonderful creature in her way a sort of mesmeric sorceress who belonged to some tribe of far eastern serpent charmers it seems that women of this particular tribe were regularly trained by the men to be capering priestessesor fortunetellers if you likewho performed some  extraordinary sacred antics of a mystical kind much after the fashion of the howling dervishes however that may be sir michael at any rate pacing the streets of pera saw the woman that she was passing fair and fell in love with her outright at some dervish entertainment  but being a very wellbehaved old man combining a liking for orientals with a british taste for the highest respectability he had the girl baptized and made into a proper christian first and then he married her offhand and brought her home with him as my lady ewes to england she was presented at court to george the second and lady mary wortley montagu stood her sponsor on the occasion  but how did it all turn out the manager asked with an air of intelligent historical interest  turn out well it turned out in a thumping big family of thirteen children the colonel answered most of whom happily for the father died young but the five who survived and who married at last into very good connections all had one peculiarity which they transmitted to all their female descendants  very odd these hereditary traits to be sure very singular very singular  ah to be sure the manager answered turning over a pile of letters and what was the hereditary trait handed down as you say in the family of the roumanian lady  why in the first place the colonel continued leaning back in his chair and making himself perfectly comfortable all the girls of the ewes connection to the third and fourth generation have olivebrown  complexions creamy and soft but clear as crystal then again theyve all got most extraordinary intuitiona perfectly marvellous gift of reading faces by george sir the colonel exclaimed growing hot and red at the memory of that afternoon on the holkers lawn i dont like to see those womens eyes fixed upon my cheek when theres anything going on i dont want them to know a mans transparent like glass before them they see into his very soul they look right through him  if the lady who founded the family habits was a fortuneteller the manager interposed with a scientific air thats not so remarkable for fortunetellers must always be quickwitted people keen to perceive the changes of countenance in the dupes who employ them and prompt at humouring all the fads and fancies of their customers mustnt they  quite so the colonel echoed youve hit it on the nail and this particular ladyesmeralda they call her so that elma which is short for esmeralda understand has come to be the regular christian name among all her women descendantsthis particular lady belonged to what you might call a caste or priestly family as it were of hereditary fortunetellers every one of whose ancestors had been specially selected for generations for the work till a kind of transmissible mesmeric habit got developed among them and they do say the colonel went on lowering his voice a little more to a confidential whisper that all the girls descended from madame esmeraldalady ewes of charlwood as she was in englandretain to this day another still odder and uncannier mark of their peculiar origin but of course its a story that would be hard to substantiate though ive heard it discussed more than once among the friends of the family  dear me whats that the manager asked in a tone of marked curiosity  why they do say the colonel went on now fairly launched upon a piece of afterdinner gossip that the eastern snakedance of madame esmeraldas people is hereditary even still among the women of the family and that sooner or later it breaks out unexpectedly in every one of them when the fit comes on they shut themselves up in their own rooms ive been told and twirl round and round for hours like dancing dervishes with anything they can get in their hands to represent a serpent till they fall exhausted with the hysterical effort even if a woman of esmeraldas blood escapes it at all other times its sure to break out when she first sees a real live snake or falls in love for the first time  then the dormant instincts of the race come over her with a rush at the very dawn of womanhood all quickened and aroused as it were in the general awakening  thats very curious the manager said leaning back in his chair in turn and twirling his thumbs very curious indeed and yet in its way very probable very probable for habits like those must set themselves deep in the very core of the system dont you think colonel if this woman now was descended from a whole line of ancestresses who had all been trained for their work into a sort of ecstatic fervour the ecstasy and all that went with it must have got so deeply ingrained  i beg your pardon the colonel interrupted consulting  his watch and seizing his hat hastilyfor as a kelmscott he refused pointblank to be lecturedive an appointment at my club at halfpast three and i must not wait any longer well youll get these young mens address for me then at the very earliest possible opportunity  the manager pocketed the snub and bowed his farewell  oh certainly he answered trying to look as pleased and gracious as his features would permit our confidential clerk will hunt them up immediately  were delighted to be of use to you good morning good morning  and as soon as the colonels back was turned the manager rang twice on his sharp little bell for the  confidential clerk to receive his orders  mr montague nevitt immediately presented himself in answer to the summons  mr nevitt the manager said with a dry small cough heres a bit of business of the most domestic kindstrict seal of secrecy not a word on any account  colonel kelmscott of tilgate wants to know where two young men named guy and cyril waring keep their banking account if any and as soon as he knows he wishes to pay in a substantial sum quite privately to their credit  mr montague nevitt bowed a bow of assent without the faintest sign of passing recognition guy and cyril waring he repeated to himself looking close at the scrap of paper his chief had handed him guy and cyril waring staple inn holborn i can find out today sir if you attach any special and pressing  importance to promptitude in the matter       chapter xiv  music hath power      for mr montague nevitt was a cautious cool and calculating person he knew better than most of us that knowledge is power so when the manager  mentioned to him casually in the way of business the names of guy and cyril waring mr montague nevitt didnt respond at once oh dear yes one of thems my most intimate personal friend and the others his brother as a man of less discretion might have been tempted to do for in the first place by finding out or seeming to find out the facts about the warings that very afternoon he could increase his character with his employers for zeal and ability and in the second place if he had let out too soon that he knew the warings personally he might most likely on that very account have been no further employed in carrying into execution this delicate little piece of family business  so nevitt held his peace discreetly like a wise man that he was and answered merely in a most submissive  voice ill do my best to ascertain where they bank at once as if he had never before in his life heard the name of waring  for the selfsame reason mr montague nevitt didnt hint that evening to guy that he had become possessed during the course of the day of a secret of the first importance to guys fortune and future of course a man so astute as montague nevitt jumped at once at the correct conclusion that colonel kelmscott must be the two warings father but he wasnt going to be fool enough to chuck his chance away by sharing that information with any second person a secret is far too valuable a lever in life to be carelessly flung aside by a man of ambition and montague nevitt saw this secret in particular was doubly valuable to him he could use it wedgewise with both the warings in all his future dealings by promising to reveal to one or other of them a matter of importance and probable moneyvalue and he could use it also as a perpetual threat to hold over colonel kelmscott if ever it should be needful to extort blackmail from the possessor of tilgate or to thwart his schemes by some active  interference  so when nevitt strolled round about nine oclock that night to staple inn violincase in hand and cigarette in mouth he gave not a sign of the curious information he had that day acquired to the person most interested in learning the truth as to the precise genealogy of the waring family  there was no great underlying community of interests between the clever young journalist and his banking companion a common love for music was the main bond of union between the two men yet montague nevitt exercised over guy a strange and fatal fascination  which cyril always found positively unaccountable  and on this particular evening as nevitt stood swaying himself to and fro upon the hearthrug before the empty grate with his eyes half closed drawing low weird music with his enchanted bow from those submissive strings guy leaned back on the sofa and listened entranced with a hopeless feeling of utter inability ever to approach the wizardlike and supreme execution of that masterly hand and those superhuman fingers  how he twisted and turned them as though his bones were indiarubber his palms were all joints and his eyes all ecstasy he seemed able to do what he liked with his violin he played on his instrument indeed as he played on guywith the consummate art of a skilful executant  thats marvellous nevitt guy broke out at last never heard even sarasate himself do anything quite so wild and weird as that whats the piece called  it seems to have something almost impish or spritelike in its wailing music its hungarian of course or polish or greek i detect at once the oriental tinge in it  wrong for once my dear boy nevitt answered smiling its english pure english and by a lady whats moreone of the eweses of kenilworth shes a distant relation of cyrils miss clifford i believe  an elma too name runs in the family but she composes wonderfully everything she writes is in that mystic key it sounds like a reminiscence of some dim and lamplit eastern temple the sort of thing a nautchgirl might bo supposed to compose to sing to the clash and clang of cymbals while she was performing  the snakedance before some juggernaut idol  exactly guy answered shutting his eyes dreamily  thats just the very picture it brings up before my minds eyeas you render it nevitt i seem to see vague visions of some vast and dimlylighted rockhewn cavern with long vistas of pillars cut from the solid stone while darklimbed priestesses clad in white muslin robes swing censers in the foreground to solemn music upon my word the power of sound is something  simply wonderful theres almost nothing i believe good music wouldnt drive me toor rather lead me to for it sways one and guides even more than it impels one  and yet nevitt mused in slow tones to himself taking up his violin again and drawing his bow over the chords with halfclosed eyes in a seemingly listless aimless manner i dont believe musics your real first love guy you took it up only to be different from cyril the artistic impulse in both of you is the same at bottom if youd let it have its own way youd have taken not to this im sure but to painting but cyril painted so to make yourself different you went in for music thats you all over you always have such a hankering after being what you are not  well hang it all a man wants to have some individuality  guy answered apologetically he doesnt like to be a mere copy or repetition of his brother  nevitt reflected quietly to himself that cyril never wanted to be different from guy his was by far the stronger nature of the two he was content to be himself  without regard to his brother but nevitt didnt say so indeed why should he he merely went on playing a few disconnected bars of a very lively hopeful utopian sort of a tunea tune all youth and health and go and gaietyas he interjected from time to time some brief financial remarks on the numerous good strokes hed pulled off of late in his transactions in the city  cant do them in my own name you know he observed lightly at last laying down his bow and replacing the dainty white rose in his left top buttonhole  not official for a bank employe to operate on the stock exchange the chiefs object to it so i do my little ventures in toms name instead my brotherinlaw  tom whitleys those cedulas went up another eighth yesterday well hit again im always lucky  and that was a good thing i put you on last week too wasnt it did you sell out today theyre up at 96 and you bought in at 80  no i didnt sell today guy answered with a yawn im holding on still for a further rise i thought id sell out when they reached the even hundred  my dear fellow youre wrong nevitt put in eagerly you ought to have sold today its the top of the market theyll begin to decline soon and when once they begin theyll come down with a crash as pls did on saturday you take my advice and sell out first thing tomorrow morning youll clear sixteen pounds on each of your shares thats enough for any man you bought ten shares i think didnt you well there you are you see a hundred and sixty offhand for you on your bargain  guy paused and reflected a doubtful moment yes ill sell out tomorrow nevitt he said after a struggle or what comes to the same thing you can sell out for me but do you know my dear fellow i sometimes  fancy im a fool for my pains going in for all this silly speculation better stick to my guinea a column in the morning mail the risks are so great and the gains so small i dont believe outsiders ought to back their luck at all like this on the stock exchange  montague nevitt acquiesced with cheerful promptitude  i agree with you down to the ground he said lighting a cigarette and puffing away at it vigorously  outsiders ought not to back their luck on the stock exchange that i take it is a selfevident proposition  but the point is here that youre not an outsider and you dont back your luck which alters the case youll admit somewhat you embark on speculations on my advice only and im in a position to judge as well as any other expert in the city of london what things are genuine and what things are not worth a wise mans attention  he stretched himself on the sofa with a lazy luxurious air and continued to puff away in silence at his cigarette for another ten minutes then he drew unostentatiously from his pocket a folded sheet of foolscap paper printed after the fashion of the common company prospectus for a second or two he read it over to himself in silence till guys curiosity was sufficiently roused by his mute proceeding  what have you got there the journalist asked at last eyeing it inquiringly as the fly eyes the cobweb  oh nothing nevitfc answered folding the paper up neatly and returning it to his pocket youve sworn off now so it does not concern you just the prospectus of a little fresh thing coming out next weeka very exceptional chancebut you dont want to go in for it i mean to apply for three hundred shares myself im so certain of its success and i had thought of advising you to take a hundred and fifty on your own account as well with that hundred and fifty you cleared over the cordova cattle bonds theyre tenpound shares at a merely nominal priceten bob on application and ten on allotmentyou could take a hundred and fifty as easy as look at it no further calls will ever be made its really a most remarkable investment  let me see the prospectus guy murmured faltering  the fever of speculation once more getting the better of him  nevitt pretended to hang back like a man with fine scruples its the rio negro diamond and sapphire mine limited he said with a deprecatory air but youd better not go in for it i expect to make a pot out of the thing myself its a unique occasion still no doubt youre right and i dont like the responsibility of advising any other fellow though you can see for yourself what the promoters say very firstclass names and klink thinks most highly of it  he handed guy the paper and took up his violin as if by pure accident while guy scanned it closely  the journalist bent over the prospectus with eager eyes and nevitt poured forth strange music as he read music like the murmur of the stream of pactolus it was an inspiring strain the violin seemed to possess the true midas touch gold flowed like water in liquid rills from its catgut guy finished and rose and dipped a pen in the inkpot all right he said low half hesitating still ill give you an order to sell out at once and ill fill up this application for three hundred shareswhy not three hundred i may as well go as many as you do if its really such a good thing as you say why shouldnt i profit by it send this to klink tomorrow early strike while the irons hot and get the thing finished  nevitt looked at the paper with an attentive eye  how curious it is he said regarding the signature narrowly that you and cyril who are so much alike in everything else should write so differently i should have expected your hands to be almost identical  oh dont you know why that is guy answered with an innocent smile i do it on purpose cyril writes sloping forward the ordinary way so i slope backward just to prevent confusion and i form all my letters as unlike his as i can though if i follow my own bent they turn out the same his way is more natural to me in fact than the way i write myself  but i must do something to keep our letters apart  thats why we always bank at a different bankers if i liked i could write exactly like cyril see heres his own signature to his letter this morning and heres my imitation of it written offhand in my own natural manner no forger on earth could ever need anything more absolutely identical  montague nevitt took it up and examined it with interest well this is wonderful he said comparing the two stroke for stroke with the practised eye of an expert the signatures are as if written by the selfsame hand any cashier in england would accept your cheque at sight for cyrils  he didnt add aloud that such similarity was very convenient but none the less in his own mind he thought so       chapter xv  the path of duty      down at tilgate meanwhile elma clifford had met more than once with cyril waring at friends houses around for ever since the accident society had made up its mind that elma ought to marry her companion in the tunnel and when society once makes up its mind on a question of this sort why it does its level best in the long run to insure the fulfilment of its own prediction  wherever elma had met her painter however during those few short weeks she had seen him only before the quizzing eyes of all the world and though she admitted to herself that she liked him very much she was nevertheless so thoroughly frightened by her own performance after the holkers party that she almost avoided him in spite of officious friendspartly it is true from a pure feeling of maidenly shame but partly also from a deeperseated and profoundly moral belief that with this fierce mad taint upon her as she naturally thought it would be nothing short of wrong in her even to marry she couldnt meet cyril now without thinking at once of that irresistible impulse which had seized her by the throat as it were and bent her to its wild will in her own room after their interview at the holkers and the thought did far more than bring a deep blush into her rich brown cheekit made her feel most acutely she must never dream of burdening him with that terrible uncertainty and all it might enclose in it of sinister import  for elma felt sure she was mad that night and if so oh how could she poison cyril warings life with so unspeakable an inheritance for himself and his children  she didnt know what any psychologist might at once have told her that no one with the fatal taint of madness in her blood could ever even have thought of that righteous selfdenial such scruples have no place in the selfish insane temperament they belong only to the highest and purest types of moral nature  one morning however a few weeks later elma had strolled off by herself into chetwood forest without any intention of going anywhere in particular save for a solitary walk when suddenly a turn round the corner of a devious path brought her face to face all at once with a piece of white canvas stretched opposite her on an easel at the other side of which to her profound dismay an artist in a grey tweed suit was busily working  the artist as it happened didnt see her at once for the canvas stretched between them shutting her out from his eyes and elmas light footstep on the mossy ground hadnt aroused his attention so the girls first impulse was to retrace her way unobtrusively without exchanging a word and retire round the corner again before cyril could recognise her but somehow when she came to try she couldnt her feet refused point blank to obey her will and this time in her own heart she knew very well why for there in the background coiled up against the dense wall of rock and fern sardanapalus lay knotted in sleepy folds with his great ringed back shining blue in the sunlight that struggled in round patches through the shimmering foliage more consciously now than even in the train the beautiful deadly creature seemed to fascinate elma and bind her to the spot for a moment she hesitated unable to resist the strange inexplicable attraction that ran in her blood that brief interval settled it even as she paused cyril glanced round at the snake to note the passing effect of a gleam of light that fell slantwise through the leaves to dapple his spotty backand caught sight of elma the poor girl gave a start it was too late now to retreat she stood there rooted  cyril moved forward to meet her with a frankly outstretched hand good morning miss clifford he said in his cheery manly voice so youve dropped down by accident upon my lair here have you well im glad youve happened to pass by today for this do you know is my very last morning im putting the finishing touches upon my picture now before i take it back to town i go away tomorrow perhaps to north wales perhaps to scotland  elma trembled a little at those words in spite of resolution for though she could never never never marry him it was nice of course to feel he was near at hand and to have the chance of seeing him and avoiding him as far as possible on other peoples lawns at garden parties she trembled and turned pale she could never marry him to be sure but then she could never marry any one else either and that being so she liked to see him now and again on neutral ground as it were and to know he was somewhere that she could meet him occasionally wales and scotland are so distant from surrey elma showed in her face at once that she thought them both unpleasantly remote from craighton tilgate  with timid and shrinking steps she came in front of the picture and gazed at it in detail long and attentively  never before did she know how fond she was of art  its beautiful she said after a pause i like it immensely that moss is so soft and the ferns are so delicate and how lovely that patch of rich golden light is on sardanapaluss shoulder  the painter stepped back a pace or two and examined  his own handicraft with his head on one side in a very critical attitude i dont know that im quite satisfied after all with the colourscheme he said glancing askance at elma i fancy its perhaps just a trifle too green it looks all right of course out here in the open but the question is when its hung in the academy surrounded by warm reds and purples and blues wont it look by comparison much too cabbagey and too grassy  elma drew a deep breath  oh mr waring she cried in a deprecating tone holding her breath for awe  it pained her that anybodyeven cyril himselfshould speak so lightly about so beautiful a picture  then you like it cyril asked turning round to her full face and fronting her as she stood there all beautiful blushes through her creamy white skin  like it i love it elma answered enthusiastically  apart from its being yours i think it simply beautiful  and you like me too then the painter asked once more making a sudden dash at the question that was nearest to both their hearts after all that moment  he was going away tomorrow and this was a last opportunity who could tell how soon somebody might come up through the woods and interrupt their interview he must make the best use of his time  he must make haste to ask her  elma let her eyes drop and her heart beat hard  she laid her hand upon the easel to steady herself as she answered slowly you know i like you mr  waring i like you very very much indeed you were so kind to me in the tunnel and i felt your kindness you could see that day i wasvery very grateful to you  when i asked you if you liked my picture elma the young man said reproachfully taking her other hand in his and looking straight into her eyes you said like it i love it but when i ask you if you like meask you if you will take meyou only say youre very very grateful  elma let him take her hand all trembling in his  she let him call her by her name she let him lean forward and gaze at her loverlike her heart throbbed high she couldnt refuse him she knew she loved him but to marry himoh no that was quite another thing there duty interposed it would be cruel unworthy disgraceful wicked  she drew herself back a little with maidenly dignity as she answered low mr waring we two saw into one anothers hearts so deep in the tunnel that day we spent together that it would be foolish for us now to make false barriers between us ill tell you the plain truth she trembled like an aspenleaf i love you i think but i can never marry you  she said it so simply yet with such an earnestness of despair that cyril knew with a pang she really meant it  why not he cried eagerly raising her hand to his lips and kissing it with fervour if you tell me you love me elma all the rest must come say that and you say all so long as ive gained your heart i dont care for anything  elma drew her hand away with stately reserve i mean it mr waring she said slowly sitting down on the bank and gasping a little for air just as she had done in the tunnel i really mean it i liked you in the train that day i was grateful to you in the accident i knew i loved you the afternoon we met at the holkers there ive told you that plainlymore plainly than i thought i ever could tell it to any man on earthbecause we knew one another so well when we thought we were dying side by side and becausebecause i can see you really love me well it can never be i can never marry you  she gazed at him wistfully cyril sat down by her side and talked it all over with her from a hundred points of view he pressed his suit hard till elma felt if words could win her painter would have won her but she couldnt yield she said for his sake a thousand times more than for her own she must never marry as the man grew more earnest the girl in turn grew more frank and confiding she could never marry him to be sure she said fervently but then she could never never never marry any one else if she married at all she would marry cyril he took her hand again without one shadow of resistance she let him take it and hold it yes yes he might love her if he liked no harm at all in that and she she would always always love him all her life through she cried letting her passionate southern nature get the better of her at last she would love him every hour of every day in the year and love him only but she could never marry him why she must never say  it was no use his trying to read her secret he must never find it out never never never but she for her part could never forget it  so cyril eagerly pressing his suit with every art he knew was forced in the end to content himself with that scanty measure she would love him she would write to him even but she would never marry him  at last the time came when they must really part or she would be late for lunch and mamma would know all mamma would read everything he looked her wistfully in the face elma held out her lips obedient to that mute demand with remorseful blush of maidenly shame on her cheek only once she murmured just to seal our compact for the first and last time you go away tomorrow  that was before you said you loved me cyril cried with delight emboldened by success maynt i stay on now just one little week longer  at the proposal elma drew back her face in haste before he had time to kiss it and answered in a very serious voice  oh no dont ask me after this i darent stand the strain of seeing you againat least not just nownot so very very soon please please dont ask me  go tomorrow as you said if you dont i cant let you she blushed and held out her blushing face once more only if you promise me to go tomorrow mind she said with a halfcoquettish halftearful smile at him  cyril hesitated for a second he was inclined to temporize those are very hard terms he said  then impulse proved too much for him he bent forward and pressed his lips just once on that olivebrown cheek but i may come back again very soon he murmured pushing home his advantage  elma seized his hand in hers wrung it hard and tremulously and then turned and ran like a frightened fawn without pausing to look back down the path homeward yet she whispered one broken sentence through her tears for all that before she went  i shall love you always but spare me spare me  and cyril was left behind by himself in the wood completely mystified       chapter xvi  struggle and victory      elma hurried home full of intense misgivings she dreaded having to meet her mothers eye how on earth could she hide from that searching glance the whole truth as to what had happened in the wood that morning when she reached home however she learned to her relief from the maid who opened the door to her that their neighbour mr gilbert gildersleeve  the distinguished qc had dropped in for lunch and this chance diversion supplied elma with a little fresh courage to face the inevitable she went straight up to her own room the moment she entered the house without seeing her mother and there she waited bathing her face copiously till some minutes after the lunch bell had rung for she felt sure she would blush crimson when she met her mother but as she blushed habitually when strangers came in the cause of it might thus perhaps she vainly flattered herself escape even those lynxlike eyes of mrs  cliffords  the great qc a big overbearing man with a pair of huge burly hands that somehow seemed to form his chief feature was a little bit blustering in his talk as usual the more so because he had just learned incidentally that something had gone wrong between his daughter gwendoline and granville kelmscott  for though that little episode of private wooing had run its course nominally without the knowledge or consent of either family mr gilbert gildersleeve at least had none the less been aware for many weeks past of the frequent meetings between gwendoline and granville in the dell just beyond the disputed boundary line and as mr gildersleeve disliked colonel kelmscott of tilgate park for a pigheaded esquire almost as cordially as colonel kelmscott disliked mr gildersleeve in return for a rascally lawyer it had given the great qc no little secret satisfaction in his own soul to learn that his daughter gwendoline was likely to marry the colonels son and heir directly against the wishes and consent of his father  only that very morning however poor mrs gildersleeve that tired crushed wife had imparted to her lord and master in fear and trembling the unpleasant intelligence that so far as she could make out there was something wrong between granville and gwendoline  and this something wrong she ventured to suggest was no mere lovers tiff of the ordinary  kissandmakeitup description but a really serious difficulty in the way of their marriage so mr gildersleeve thus suddenly deprived of his expected triumph took it out another way by more than even his wonted boisterousness of manner in talking about the fortunes of the kelmscott family  i fancy myself you know mrs clifford he was saying very loud as elma entered theres a screw loose just now in the kelmscott affairssomething rotten somewhere in the state of denmark that young fellow granville whos by no means such a bad lot as his father all roundtoo good for the family in fact too good for the familygranvilles been accustomed of late to come over into my grounds beyond the boundary wall and being anxious above all things to cultivate friendly relations with all my neighbours in the county ive allowed him to comeive allowed him and i may even say to a certain extent ive encouraged him there at times hes met by accident my daughter gwendoline oh dear nowith uplifted hand and deprecating lipsi assure you nothing of that sort my dear mrs clifford gwendolines far too young and i couldnt dream of allowing her to marry into colonel kelmscotts family but however be that as it may hes been in the habit of coming there till very recently when all of a sudden only a week or ten days back to my immense surprise he ceased at once and ever since has dropped into the defensive exactly as he used to do and i interpret it to mean  elma heard no more of that pompous speech her knees shook under her for she was aware only of mrs cliffords eyes fixed mildly and calmly upon her face not in anger as she feared or reproach but rather in infinite pity for a second their glances met in mute intercourse of soul then each dropped their eyelashes  as suddenly as before through the rest of that lunch elma sat as in a maze hearing and seeing nothing  what she ate or drank or talked about she knew not  mr gildersleeves pungent and embellished anecdotes of the kelmscott family and their unneighbourly pride went in at one ear and out at the other all she was conscious of was her mothers sympathetic yet unerring eye she felt sure that at one glance that wonderful thoughtreader had divined everything and seen through and through their interview that morning  after lunch the two men strolled upon the lawn to enjoy their cigars and elma and her mother were left alone in the drawingroom  for some minutes neither could make up her mind to break the ice and speak they sat shamefaced beside one another on the sofa like a pair of shy and frightened maidens at last mrs clifford braced  herself up to interrupt the awkward silence youve been in chetwood forest elma she murmured low looking down and averting her eyes carefully from her trembling daughter  yes mother elma answered all aglow with conscious blushes in chetwood forest  and you met him dear the mother spoke tenderly and sympathetically  elmas heart stood still yes mother i met him  and he had the snake there  elma started in surprise why dwell upon that seemingly  unimportant detail oh yes she answered still redder and hotter than ever he had it there  he was painting it  mrs clifford paused a minute then she went on with pain and he asked you elma  elma bowed her head yes he asked meand i refused him she answered with a terrible wrench  oh darling i know it mrs clifford cried seizing both cold hands in hers and i know why too  but elma believe me you neednt have done it my daughter my daughter you might just as well have taken him  no never elma cried rising from her seat and moving towards the door in an agony of shame i couldnt i darent it would be wrong it would be cruel but mother dont speak to me of it dont mention it again even before you it makes me more wretched and ashamed than i can say to allude to it  she rushed from the room with cheeks burning like fire come what might she never could talk to any living soul again about that awful episode  but mrs clifford sat on on the sofa where elma left her and cried to herself silently silently silently  what a mother should do in these hateful circumstances she could hardly even guess she only knew she could never speak it out and even if she did elma would never have the courage or the heart to listen to her  that same evening when elma went up to bed a strange longing came across her to sit up late and think over to herself again all the painful details of the mornings interview she seated herself by her bedside in her evening dress and began to think it all out again exactly as it happened as she did so the picture of sardanapalus on his bed of fern came up clear in her mind just as he lay coiled round in cyril warings landscape beautiful sardanapalus so sleek and smooth and glossy if only she had him here nowshe paused and hesitated in a moment the wild impulse rushed upon her once more it clutched her by the throat it held her fast as in a vice she must get up and dance she must obey the mandate she must whirl till she fell in that mystical ecstasy  she rose and seemed for a moment as though she must yield to the temptation the boathe boa was in the lower drawer reluctantly remorsefully she opened the drawer and took it out in her hands fluff and feathers fluff and feathersnothing more than that but oh how soft how smooth how yielding how serpentine with a violent effort she steadied herself and looked round for her scissors they lay on the dressingtable she took them up with a fixed and determined air if thy right hand offend thee cut it off she thought to herself then she began ruthlessly hacking the boa into short little lengths of a few inches each which she gathered up in her hands as soon as she had finished and replaced with care in the drawer where she had originally found them  after that her mind felt somewhat more at ease and a trifle less turbulent she loved cyril waringoh yes she loved him with all her heart it was hard to give him up hard not to yield to that pressing impulse in such a moment of doubt and despondency the boa had said to her as it were come dance go mad and forget your trouble but she had resisted the temptation  and now  why now she would undress and creep into bed like any other good english girl under similar circumstances  and cry herself asleep with thoughts of cyril  and so she did in truth she let her emotion take its natural outlet she lay awake for an hour or two till her eyes were red and sore and swollen then at last she dropped off for very weariness and slept soundly an unbroken sleep till morning  at eight oclock mrs clifford knocked her tentative little knock at the door come in mother elma cried starting up in her surprise and her mother much wondering turned the handle and entered  when she reached the bed she gave a little cry of amazement why elma she exclaimed staring her hard and long in the face my darling whats this  your eyes are red how strange youve been crying  yes mother elma answered turning her face to the wall but a thousand times less ashamed than she had been the day before when her mother spoke to her  i couldnt help it dearest she took that soft white hand in hers and pressed it hard in silence its no wonder you know she said at last after a long deep pause hes going away from chetwood todayand it was so very very hard to say goodbye to him for ever  oh yes i know darling mrs clifford answered eyeing her harder than ever now with a halfincredulous look i know all that butyouve had a good night in spite of everything elma  elma guessed what she meant they two could converse together quite plainly without words well yes a better night she answered hesitating and shutting her eyes under the bedclothes for very shame  a little disturbeddont you knowjust at first but i had a good cry very soon and then that mended everything  her mother still looked at her half doubting and half delighted a good crys the right thing she said slowly in a very low voice the exact right thing perfectly proper and normal a good cry never did any girl on this earth one atom of harm its the best safetyvalve youre lucky elma my child in being able to get one  yes dear elma answered with her head still buried very lucky indeed so i think too mother  mrs cliffords eye fell aimlessly upon certain tiny bits of feathery fluff that flecked the floor here and there like floating fragments of thistledown in a second her keen instinct divined what they meant  without one word she rose silently and noiselessly and opened the lower drawer where the boa usually reposed among the furs and feathers one glimpse of those mangled morsels showed her the truth at a glance she shut the drawer again noiselessly and silently as she had opened it but elma lying still with her eyes closed tight yet knew perfectly well how her mother had been occupied  mrs clifford came back and stooping over her daughters bed kissed her forehead tenderly elma darling she said while a hot tear or two fell silently upon the girls burning cheek youre very very brave im so pleased with you so proud of you i couldnt have done it myself youre strongerminded than i am my child he kissed you for goodbye yesterday you neednt say yes you neednt say no  i read it in your face no need for you to tell me of it well darling it wasnt goodbye after all im certain of that believe me my child hell come back some day and youll know you can marry him  never elma cried hiding her face still more passionately and wildly than before beneath great folds of the bedclothes dont speak to me of him any more mother never never never       chapter xvii  visions of wealth      cyril waring thus dismissed and as in honour bound hurried up to london with a mind preoccupied by many pressing doubts and misgivings he thought much of elma but he thought much too of sundry strange events that had happened of late to his own private fortunes for one thing he had sold and sold mysteriously at a very good price the picture of sardanapalus in the glade at chetwood a wellknown london dealer had written down to him at tilgate making an excellent offer for the unfinished work as soon as it should be ready on behalf of a customer whose name he didnt happen to mention and who could that customer be cyril thought to himself but colonel kelmscott but that wasnt all the dealer who had offered him a round sum down for the rajahs rest had also at the same time commissioned him to go over to the belgian ardennes to paint a picture or two at a specified price of certain selected scenes upon the meuse and its tributaries the price offered for the work was a very respectable one and yethe had some internal misgivings somehow about this mysterious commission could it be to get rid of him he had an uncomfortable suspicion in the back chambers of his mind that whoever had commissioned the pictures might be more anxious to send him well away from tilgate than to possess a series of picturesque sketches on the meuse and its tributaries  and who could have an interest in keeping him far from tilgate that was the question was there anybody  whom his presence there could in any way incommode  could it be elmas father who wanted to send him so quickly away from england  and what was the meaning of elmas profound resolution so strangely and strongly expressed never never to marry him  a painful idea flitted across the young mans puzzled brain had the cliffords alone discovered the secret of his birth and was that secret of such a disgraceful sort that elmas father shrank from owning him as a prospective  soninlaw while even elma herself could not bring herself to accept him as her future husband if so what could that ghastly secret be were he and guy the inheritors of some deadly crime had their origin been concealed from them more in mercy than in cruelty only lest some hideous taint of murder or of madness might mar their future and make their whole lives miserable  when he reached staple inn he found guy and montague nevitt already in their joint rooms and arrears of three days correspondence awaiting him  a close observerlike elma cliffordmight perhaps have noted in montague nevitts eye certain wellrestrained symptoms of suppressed curiosity but cyril waring in his straightforward simple english manliness  was not sharp enough to perceive that nevitt watched him close while he broke the envelopes and glanced over his letters or that nevitts keen anxiety grew at once far deeper and more carefully concealed as cyril turned to one big missive with an officiallooking seal and a distinctly important legal aspect on the contrary to the outer eye or ear all that could be observed in montague nevitts manner was the nervous way he went on tightening his violin strings with a tremulous hand and whistling low to himself a few soft and tender bars of some melancholy scrap from miss ewess refectory  as cyril read through that letter however his breath came and went in short little gasps and his cheek flushed hotly with a sudden and overpowering flood of emotion  whats the matter guy asked looking over his shoulder curiously and cyril almost faint with the innumerable ideas and suspicions that the tidings conjured up in his brain at once said with an evident effort read it guy read it  guy took the letter and read montague nevitt gazing at it by his side meanwhile with profound interest  as soon as they had glanced through its carefullyworded sentences each drew a long breath and stared hard at the other then cyril added in a whirl and heres a letter from my own bankers saying theyve duly received the six thousand pounds and put it to my credit  guys face was pale but he faltered out none the less with ashy lips staring hard at the words all the time it isnt only the money of course one thinks about cyril but the clue it seems to promise us to our father and mother  exactly cyril answered with a responsive nod  the money i wont take i dont know what it means  but the clue ill follow up till ive run to earth the whole truth about who we are and where we come from  montague nevitt glanced quickly from one to the other with an incredulous air not take the money he exclaimed in cynical surprise why of course youll take it twelve thousand pounds isnt to be sneezed at in these days i can tell you and as for the clue why there isnt any clue not a jot or a tittle a ghost or a shadow of it the unnatural parent whoever  he may befor i take it for granted the unnatural parents the person at the bottom of the offertakes jolly good care not to let you know who on earth he is  he wraps himself up in a double cloak of mystery drummonds pay in the money to your account at your own bank you see and while theyre authorized to receive your acknowledgment of the sum remitted they are clearly not authorized to receive to the senders credit any return cheque for the amount or cash in repayment the unnatural parent evidently intends to remain for the present at least strictly anonymous  couldnt you find out for us at drummond coutts and barclays who the sender is guy asked with some hesitation still turning over in his hand the mysterious letter  nevitt shook his head with prompt decision no certainly not he answered assuming an air of the severest probity it would be absolutely impossible  the secrets in a bank are secrets of honour we are the depositaries of tales that might ruin thousands and we never say a word about one of them to anybody  as for cyril he felt himself almost too astonished for words it was long before he could even discuss the matter quietly the whole episode seemed so strange so mysterious so uncanny and no wonder he hesitated  for the unknown writer of the letter with the legal seal had proposed a most curious and unsatisfactory arrangement six thousand pounds down on the nail to cyril six thousand more in a few weeks to guy but not for nothing as in all law business valuable consideration  loomed large in the background they were both to repair on a given day at a given hour to a given office in a given street where they were to sign without  inquiry and even without perusal whatever documents  might then and there be presented to them this course the writer pointed out with perspicuous plainness  was all in the end to their own greater advantage  for unless they signed they would get nothing more and it would be useless for them at attempt the unravelling  of the mystery but if they consented to sign then the writer declared the anonymous benefactor at whose instigation he wrote would leave them by his will a further substantial sum not one penny of which would ever otherwise come to them  and montague nevitt as a man of business looking the facts in the face without sentiment or nonsense advised them to sign and make the best of a good bargain  for montague nevitt saw at once in his own mind that this course would prove the most useful in the end for his own interests both as regards the warings and colonel kelmscott  the two persons most concerned however viewed the matter in a very different light to them this letter with its obscure halfhints opened up a chance of solving at last the mystery of their position which had so long oppressed them they might now perhaps find out who they really were if only they could follow up this pregnant clue and the clue itself suggested so many things  whatever else it shows guy said emphatically it shows we must be the lawful sons of some person of property or else why should he want us to sign away our rights like this all blindfold and whatever the rights themselves may be they must be very considerable or else why should he bribe us so heavily to sign ourselves out of them depend upon it nevitt its an entailed estate and the man who dictated that letter is in possession of the property which ought to belong to cyril and me for my part im opposed to all bargaining in the dark ill sign nothing and ill give away nothing without knowing what it is and thats what i advise cyril to write back and tell him  cyril however was revolving in his own mind meanwhile  a still more painful question could it be any bloodrelationship between himself and elma unknown to him but just made known to her that gave rise to her firm and obviously recent determination never to marry him a week or two since he was sure elma knew of no cause or just impediment why they should not be joined together in holy matrimony could she have learned it meanwhile before she met him in the wood and could the fact of her so learning it have thus pricked the slumbering conscience of their unknown  kinsman or their supposed supplanter  they sat there long and late discussing the question from all possible standpointssave the one thus silently started in his own mind by cyril but in the end cyrils resolution remained unshaken he would leave the six thousand pounds in the bank untouched but he would write back at once to the unknown sender declining plainly once for all to have anything to do with it or with the proposed transactions if anything was his by right he would take it as of right but he would be no party to such holeandcorner renunciations of unknown contingencies as the writer suggested  if the writer was willing to state at once all the facts of the case in clear and succinct language and to come to terms thus openly with himself and his brother why then cyril averred he was ready to promise they would deal with his claims in a spirit of the utmost generosity and consideration but if this was an attempt to do them out of their rights by a fraudulent bribe he for one would have nothing to say to it he would therefore hold the six thousand pounds paid in to his account entirely at his anonymous correspondents disposition  and as there isnt any use in my wasting the summer guy he said in conclusion i wont let this redherring trailed across my path prevent me from going over at once as i originally intended to dinant and spa and fulfilling the commission for those pictures of dale and nortons you and nevitt can see meanwhile  what its possible for us to do in the matter of hunting up this family mystery you can telegraph if you want me and ill come back at once but more than ever now i feel the need of redeeming the time and working as hard as i can go at my profession  well yes guy answered as if both their thoughts ran naturally in the selfsame channel i agree with you there shes been accustomed to luxury no man has a right to marry any girl if he cant provide for her in the comfort and style shes always been used to  and from that point of view when one looks it in the face cyril six thousand pounds would come in handy       chapter xviii  gentle wooer      mr montague nevitt rubbed his hands with delight in the sacred privacy of his own apartment mr nevitt indeed had laid his plans deep he had everybodys secrets all round in his hands and he meant to make everybody pay dear in the end for his information  mr nevitt was free his holidays were on at  drummond coutts and barclays limited he loved the sea the sun and the summer he was off that day on a projected series of short country runs in which it was his intention strictly to combine business and pleasure dartmoor for example as everybody knows is a most delightful and bracing tourist district but what more amusing to a man of taste than to go a round of the moor with its heatherclad tors and at the same time hunt up the parish registers of the neighbourhood for the purpose of discovering if possible the supposed marriage record of colonel kelmscott of tilgate with the warings mother for that there was a marriage montague nevitt felt certain in his own wise mind and having early arrived at that correct conclusion why he had quietly offered forthwith in plymouth papers a considerable reward to parish clerks and others who would supply him with any information as to the births marriages or deaths of any person or persons of the name of waring for some eighteen months or so before or after the reputed date when guy and cyril began their earthly pilgrimage  for deaths nevitt said to himself with a sinister smile were every bit as important to him as births or marriages he knew the date of colonel kelmscotts wedding with lady emily croke and if at that date wife number one was not yet dead when the colonel took to himself wife number two who now did the honours of tilgate park for him why there you had as clear and convincing a case of bigamy as any man could wish to find out against another and to utilize some day for his own good purposes  as he thought these thoughts montague nevitt gave the last delicate twirl the final touch of art to the wirelike ends of his waxed moustache in front of his mirror and after surveying the result in the glass with considerable satisfaction proceeded to set out on very good terms with himself for his summer holiday  devonshire however wasnt his first destination  montague nevitt besides being a man of business and a man of taste was also in due season a man of feeling  a heart beat beneath that white rosebud in his left top buttonhole all his thoughts were not thoughts of greed and of gain he was bound to tilgate today and to see a lady  it isnt so easy in england to see a lady alone but fortune favours the brave luck always attended mr  montague nevitts most unimportant schemes hardly had he got into the field path across the meadows between tilgate station and the grounds of woodlands than at the seat by the bend what should he see but a lady sitting down in an airy white summer dress her head leaning on her hand most pensive and melancholy  montague nevitts heart gave a sudden bound  in luck once more it was gwendoline gildersleeve  good morning he said briskly coming up before gwendoline had time to perceive himand fly this is really most fortunate ive run down from town today on purpose to see you but hardly hoped i should have the good fortune to get a teteatete with youat least so easily im so glad im in time now dont look so cross you must at any rate admit you know my persistence is flattering  i dont feel flattered by it mr nevitt gwendoline answered coldly holding out her gloved hand to him with marked disinclination i thought last time i had said goodbye to you for good and for ever  nevitt took her hand and held it in his own a trifle longer than was strictly necessary now dont talk like that gwendoline he said coaxingly dont crush me quite flat remember at least that you once were kind to me it isnt my fault surely if i still recollect it  gwendoline withdrew her hand from his with yet more evident coolness circumstances alter cases she said severely that was before i really knew you  that was before you knew granville kelmscott you mean nevitt responded with an unpleasantly knowing air oh yes you neednt wince ive heard all about that its my business to hear and find out everything but circumstances alter cases as you justly say gwendoline and ive discovered some circumstances about granville kelmscott that may alter the case as regards your opinion of that rich young man whose estate weighed down a poor fellow like me in what youve graciously pleased to call your affections  gwendoline rose and looked down at the man contemptuously  mr nevitt she said in a chilling voice youve no right to call me gwendoline any longer now youve no right to speak to me of mr granville kelmscott i refused your advances not for any one elses sake or any one elses estate but simply and solely because i came to know you better than i knew you at first and the more i knew of you the less i liked you i am not engaged to mr  granville kelmscott i dont mean to see him again  i dont mean to marry him  nevitt took his cue at once like a clever hand that he was and followed it up remorselessly well im glad to hear that anyhow he answered assuming a careless air of utter unconcern for your sake as well as for his miss gildersleeve for granville kelmscott as i happen to know in the course of business is a ruined mana ruined man this moment he isnt and never was the heir of tilgate and im sure it was very honourable of him the minute he found he was a penniless beggar to release you from such an unequal engagement  he had played his card well he had delivered his shot neatly gwendoline though anxious to withdraw from his hateful presence couldnt help but stay and learn more about this terrible hint of his a light broke in upon her even as the fellow spoke was it this then that had made granville talk so strangely to her that morning by the dell in the woodlands  was it this which as he told her rendered their marriage impossible why if that were allgwendoline drew a deep breath and clasped her hands together in a sudden access of mingled hope and despair oh what do you mean mr nevitt she cried eagerly what can granville have done  dont keep me in suspense do tell me what you mean by it  montague nevitt still seated looked up at her with a smile of quiet satisfaction he played with her for a moment as a cat plays with a mouse she was such a beautiful creature so tall and fair and graceful and she was so awfully afraid and he was so awfully fond of her that he loved to torture her thus and hold her dangling in his power no gwendoline he said slowly drawing his words out by driblets so as to prolong her suspense i oughtnt to have mentioned it at all its a professional secret i retract what i said forget that i said it excuse me on the ground of my natural reluctance to see a woman i still love so deeply and so purelywhatever she may happen to think of methrow herself away on a man without a name or a penny however as kelmscott seems to have done the honourable thing of his own accord and given you up the minute he knew he couldnt keep you in the way youve been accustomed towhy theres no need of course of any warning from me ill say no more on the subject  his studied air of mystery piqued and drew on his victim gwendoline knew in her own heart she ought to go at once her own dignity demanded it and she should consult her dignity but still she couldnt help longing to know what nevitts halfhints and innuendoes might mean after all she was a woman  oh do tell me she cried clasping her hands in suspense once more what have you heard about mr kelmscott im not engaged to him i dont want to know for that but she broke down blushing crimson and montague nevitt gazing fixedly at her delicate peachlike cheek remarked to himself how extremely well that blush became her  no but remember he said in a very grave voice in his favourite impersonation of the man of honour whatever i tell youif i give way at all and tell you anythingyou must hear in confidence and must repeat to nobody if you do repeat it youll get me into very serious trouble and not only so but as nobody knows it except myself youll as good as proclaim  to all the world that you heard it from me if i tell you what i know will you promise me thisnot to breathe a syllable of what i say to anybody  gwendoline glancing down and thoroughly ashamed of herself yet answered in a very low and trembling voice ill promise mr nevitt  then the facts are these the man of feeling went on with an undercurrent of malicious triumph in his musical voice kelmscott is not his fathers eldest son hes not and never was the heir of tilgate  more than that nobody knows these facts but myself and i know the true heirs and i can prove their title  well now miss gildersleeveif its to be miss gildersleeve  stillthis is the circumstance that alters the case as regards granville kelmscott i have it in my hands to ruin kelmscott and what ive taken the trouble to come down and say to you today is simply this for your own advantage beware at least how you throw yourself away upon a penniless man with neither name nor fortune when youve quite got over that dream youll be glad to return to the man you threw overboard for the rich squires son no circumstances have ever altered him he loved you from the first and he will always love you  gwendoline looked him back in the face again as pale as death mr nevitt she said scornfully unmoved  by his tale i do not love you and i will never love you you have no right to say such things to me as this im glad youve told me for i now know what mr kelmscott meant and if he was as poor as a church mouse id marry him tomorrowi said just now i didnt mean to marry him i retract that word circumstances alter cases and what youve just told me alters this one i withdraw what i said ill marry granville kelmscott tomorrow if he asks me  she looked down at him so proudly so defiantly so haughtily that montague nevitt sitting there with his cynical smile on his thin red lips flinched and wavered before her he saw in a moment the game was up he had played the wrong card he had mistaken  his woman and tried false tactics it was too late now to retreat an empty revenge was all that remained to him very well he said sullenly looking  her back in the face with a nasty scowlfor indeed he loved that girl and was loath to lose herremember your promise and say nothing to anybody youll find it best so for your own reputation in the end but mark my words be sure i wont spare granville kelmscott  now ill play my own game ill ruin him ruthlessly hes in my power i tell you and ill crush him under my heel well thats settled at last im off to devonshire tomorrowon the hunt of the recordsto the skirts of dartmoor to a place in the wilds by the name of mambury he raised his hat and curling his lip maliciously walked away without even so much as shaking hands with her he knew it was all up that game was lost and being a man of feeling he regretted it bitterly  gwendoline for her part hurried home all aglow with remorse and excitement when she reached the house she went straight up in haste to her own bedroom  in spite of her promise all woman that she was she couldnt resist sitting down at once and inditing a hurried note to granville kelmscott  dearest granville it said in a very shaky hand not unblurred by tears i know all now and i wonder you thought it could ever matter i know youre not the eldest son and that somebody else is the heir of tilgate and i care for all that a great deal less than nothing i love you ten thousand times too dearly to mind one pin whether youre rich or poor and rich or poor whenever you like ill marry you  yours ever devotedly and unalterably  gwendoline  she sealed it up in haste and ran out with it all tremors to the post by herself her hands were hot  she was in a high fever but mr montague nevitt that man of feeling thus balked of his game walked off his disappointment as well as he could by a long smart tramp across the springy downs lunching at a wayside inn on bread and cheese and beer and descending as the evening shades drew in on the guildford station thence he ran up to town by the first fast train and sauntered sulkily across waterloo bridge to his rooms on the embankment as he went a poster caught his eye on the bridge it riveted his attention by one fatal phrase financial news collapse of the rio negro diamond and sapphire mines  he stared at the placard with a dim sense of disaster  what on earth could this mean it fairly took his breath away the mines were the best things out this season he held three hundred shares on his own account if this rumour were true he had let himself in for a loss of a clear three thousand  but being a person of restricted sympathies he didnt reflect till several minutes had passed that he must at the same time have let guy waring in for three thousand also       chapter xix  self or bearer      at charing cross station montague nevitt bought a financial news and proceeded forthwith to his own rooms to read of the sudden collapse of his pet speculation  it was only too true the rio negro diamond and sapphire mines had gone entirely in one of the periodical south american crashes which involved them in the liabilities of several other companies a call would be made at once to the full extent of the nominal capital and he would have to find three thousand pounds down to meet the demand on his credit immediately  nevitt hadnt three thousand pounds in the world to pay the little he possessed beyond his salary was locked up here and there in speculative undertakings where he couldnt touch it except at long notice it was a crushing blow he had need of steadying  some men would have flown in such a plight to brandy  montague nevitt flew instead to the consolations of music  for some minutes indeed he paced his room up and down in solemn silence then his eye fell by accident  on the violin case in the corner ah that would do  that beloved violin would inspire him with ideas was it suicide or fraud or some honest way out be it this plan or that the violin would help him screwing up the strings for a minute with those deft long doublejointed fingers of his he took the bow in his right hand and still pacing the room with great strides like a wild beast in its cage began to discourse low passionate music to himself from one of those serpentine pieces of miss ewess of leamington  as he played and played his whole soul in his fingers a plan began to frame itself vaguely dimly at first then more and more definitely by slow degreesshape form and featuresas it grew and developed  a beautiful chord that last oh how subtle how beautiful it seemed to curl and glide on like a serpent through the grass leaving strange trails behind as of a flowing signature a flowing signature with bold twirls and flourishestwirls and flourishestwirls and flourishestwirls twirls twirls and flourishes the signature to a cheque to a cheque for money three thousand pounds at drummond coutts and barclays  it ran through his head keeping time with the bars  four thousand pounds five thousand six thousand  the longer he played the clearer and sharper the plan stood out he saw his way now as clear as daylight  and his way too to make a deal more in the end by it  pay self or bearer six thousand pounds six thousand pounds signed cyril waring  for hours he paced up and down there playing long and low oh music how he loved it it seemed to set everything straight all at once in his head with bow in hand and violin at rest he surpassed himself that evening in ingenuity of fingering he trembled to think of his own cleverness and skill what a miracle of device what a triumph of cunning not an element was overlooked it was safe as houses  he could go to bed now and drop off like a child having arranged before he went to make guy waring his cats paw and turn this sad stroke of illluck in the end to his own ultimate greater and wider advantage  and he was quite right too he did sleep as he expected next morning he woke in a very good humour and proceeded at once to guy warings rooms the moment after breakfast  he found guy as he expected in a tumult of excitement  having only just that moment received by post the final call for the rio negro capital  when other men are excited the wise man takes care to be perfectly calm montague nevitt was calm under this crushing blow he pointed out blandly that everything would yet go well all was not lost they had other irons in the fire and even the rio negros themselves were not an absolute failure the diamonds the diamonds themselves he insisted were  still there and the sapphires also they studded the soil they were to be had for the picking every bit of their money would come back to them in the end  it was a question of meeting an immediate emergency only  but i havent three thousand pounds in the world to meet it with guy exclaimed in despair i shall be ruined of course i dont mind about that but i never shall be able to make good my liabilities  nevitt lighted a cigarette with a philosophical smile  the hotter guy waxed the faster did he cool down  neither have i my dear boy he said in his most careless voice puffing out rings of smoke in the interval between his clauses but i dont therefore go mad  i dont tear my hair over it though to be sure im a deal worse off than you my positions at stake if drummonds were to hear of itsacksack instanter  as to making yourself responsible for what you dont possess thats simply speculation everybody on the stock exchange always does it if they didnt thered be no such thing as enterprise at all you cant make a fortune by risking a hapenny  but what am i to do guy cried wildly however am i to raise three thousand pounds i should be ashamed to let cyril know id defaulted like this if i cant find the money i shall go mad or kill myself  montague nevitt played him gently as an experienced angler plays a plunging trout before proceeding to land him at last after offering guy much sympathetic advice and suggesting several intentionally feeble schemes only to quash them instantly he observed with a certain apologetic air of unobtrusive friendliness well if the worst comes to the worst youve one thing to fall back upon theres that sixthousand of course coming in byandby from the unknown benefactor  guy flung himself down in his easychair with a look of utter despondency upon his handsome face  but i promised cyril he exclaimed with a groan id never touch that if i were to spend it i dont know how i could ever face cyril  i was told yesterday nevitt answered with a bitter little smile and by a lady too many times over that circumstances alter cases till i began to believe it when you promised cyril you werent face to face with a financial crisis if you were to use the money temporarilymind i say only temporarily for to my certain knowledge rio negros will pull through all right in the endif you were to use it temporarily in such an emergency as this no blame of any sort could possibly attach to you the unknown benefactor wont mind whether your moneys at your bankers or employed for the time being in paying your debts  your creditors will if i were you therefore id use it up in paying them  you would guy inquired glancing across at him with a faint gleam of hope in his eye  nevitt fixed him at once with his strange cold stare he had caught his man now he could play upon him as readily as he could play his violin  why certainly i would he answered with confidence striking the new chord full cyril himself would do the same in your place ill bet you and the proof that he would is simply thisyou yourself will do it depend upon it if you can do anything under given circumstances cyril would do it too in the same set of conditions and if ever cyril feels inclined to criticise what youve done you can answer him back i know your heart as you know mine in my place i know youd have acted as i did  cyril and i are not absolutely identical guy answered slowly his eyes still fixed on montague nevitts sometimes i feel he does things i wouldnt do  he has more initiative than you nevitt answered as if carelessly though with deep design in his heart  he acts where you debate youre often afraid to take a serious step cyril never hesitates you draw back and falter cyril goes straight ahead but all the more reason accordingly that cyril should admit the lightness of whatever you do for if you do  anythinganything in the nature of a definite step i meanwhy far more readily then would cyril in like case have done it  you think he has more initiative guy asked with a somewhat nettled air he hated to be thought less individual than cyril  of course he has my dear boy nevitt answered smiling hed use the money at once without a seconds hesitation  but i havent got the money to use guy continued after a short pause  cyril has though nevitt responded with a significant nod  guy perused his boots and made no immediate answer nevitt wanted none just then he waited some seconds humming all the while an appropriate tune then he caught guys eye again and fixed him a second time  its a pity we dont know cyrils address in belgium he said in a musing tone we might telegraph across for leave to use his money meanwhile  remember im just as deeply compromised as you or even more so its a pity we should both be ruined with six thousand pounds standing at this very moment to cyrils account at the london and west country  but it cant be helped theres no time to lose the money must be paid in sharp by this evening  by this evening guy exclaimed starting up excitedly  nevitt nodded assent yes by this evening of course he answered unperturbed or we become ipso facto defaulters and bankrupts  that was a lie to be sure but it served his purpose  guy was a child at business and believed whatever nonsense nevitt chose to foist upon him  the journalist rose and paced the room twice or thrice with a frantic air of unspeakable misery  i shall lose my place at our bank no doubt nevitt went on in a resigned tone but that doesnt much matter though a temporary loani could pay every penny in six weeks if id timea temporary loan would set things all straight again  i wish to heaven cyril was here guy exclaimed in piteous tones  he is practically when youre here nevitt answered with a knowing smile you can act as his deputy  how do you mean guy asked turning round upon him openmouthed  nevitt paused and smiled sweetly  this is his chequebook i think he replied in the oblique retort picking it up and looking at it he tore out a cheque as if pensively and by accident  thats a precious odd thing he went on that you showed me the other day dont you know about your signature and cyrils being so absolutely identical  guy gazed at him in horror oh dont talk about that he cried running his hand through his hair  if i were even to entertain such an idea for a moment my selfrespect would be gone for ever  exactly so nevitt put in with a satirical smile  i said so just now youve no initiative cyril wouldnt be afraid knowing the interests at stake hed take a firm stand and act offhand on his own discretion  do you think so guy faltered in a hesitating voice  nevitt held him with his eye  do i think so he echoed do i think so i know it look here guy you and cyril are practically one if cyril were here wed ask him at once to lend us the money if we knew where cyril was wed telegraph across and get his leave like a bird but as he isnt here and as we dont know where he is we must show some initiative we must act for once on our own responsibility exactly as cyril would its only for six weeks at the end of that time the unknown benefactor stumps up your share you neednt even tell cyril if you dont like of this little transaction see heres his cheque you fill it in and sign it nobody can tell the signature isnt cyrils you take the money and release us both in six weeks time you get your own share of the unnatural parents bribe you pay it in to his credit and not a living soul on earth but ourselves need ever be one penny the wiser  guy tried to look away but he couldnt he couldnt  nevitt held him fixed with his penetrating gaze guy moved uneasily he felt as if he had a stiff neck so hard was it to turn nevitt took a pen and dipped it quick in the ink  just as an experiment he said firmly yet in a coaxing voice sit down and sign let me see what it looks like there write it just here write cyril waring  guy sat down as in a maze and took the pen from his hand like an obedient schoolboy for a second the pen trembled in his vacillating fingers then he wrote on the cheque in a free and flowing hand where the signature ought to be his brothers name he wrote it without stopping  capital capital nevitt cried in delight looking over his shoulder its a splendid facsimile now date and amount if you please six thousand pounds  its your own natural hand after all ah capital capital  as he spoke guy framed the fatal words like one dreaming or entranced on the slip of paper before him  pay self or bearer six thousand pounds l6000 cyril waring  nevitt looked at it critically thatll do all right he said with his eye still fixed in between whiles on guys bloodless face now the only one thing you have still left to do is to take it to the bank and get it cashed instanter       chapter xx  montague nevitt finesses      guy rose mechanically and followed him to the door  nevitt still held the forged cheque in his hand guy thought of it so to himself in plain terms as the forgery yet somehow he knew not why he followed that sinister figure through the passage and down the stairs like one irresistibly and magnetically drawn forward why he couldnt let any one go forth upon the streets of londonwith the cheque he himself had forged in his handsunwatched and unshadowed  nevitt called a cab and jumped in and beckoned him guy still as in a dream jumped after him hastily  to the london and west country bank in lombard street nevitt called through the flap  the cab drove off and guy waring leaned back all trembling and irresolute with his head on the cushions  at last after a short drive during which guys head seemed to be swimming most dreamily they reached the bankthat crowded bank in lombard street  nevitt thrust the cheque bodily into his companions hand  take it in now and cash it he said with an authoritative air do you hear what i say take it inand cash it  guy as if impelled by some superior power walked inside the door and presented it timidly  the cashier glanced at the sum inscribed on the cheque with no little surprise  its a rather large amount mr waring he said scanning his face closely how will you take it  guy trembled violently from head to foot as he answered in a voice half choked with terror bank of england hundreds if you please it is a large sum as you say but im placing it elsewhere  the cashier retired for a few minutes then he returned once more bringing a big roll of notes and a second clerk by his sidejust to prevent mistakestared hard at the customer all square the second clerk said in a halfwhispered aside its him right enough  and the cashier proceeded to count out the notes with oftwetted fingers  guy took them up mechanically like a drunken man counted them over one by one in a strange dazed way and staggered out at last to the cab to nevitt  nevitt leaned forward and took the bundle from his hands guy stood on the pavement and looked vacantly in at him thats right nevitt said clasping the bundle tight rio negro diamond and sapphire mines cabby 127 knatchbull street cheapside  the cabman whipped up his horse and disappeared round the corner leaving guy waring alonelike a foolon the pavement  for a minute or two the dazed and dazzled journalist stood there awaking by degrees as from some trance or stupefaction at first he could only stand still and gaze vacantly down the street after the disappearing cab but as his brain cleared slowly and the mist that hung over his mind dispelled itself bit by bit he was able to walk a few steps at a time towards the nearest shops where he looked in at the windows intently with a hollow stare and tried to collect his scattered wits for a great effort at understanding this strange transaction  all at once as he looked the full folly of his deed burst in its true light upon his muddled brain he had handed nevitt six thousand pounds in bank of england notes to waste or lose or speculate or run away with  sixthousandpounds of cyrils money not that for one moment he suspected nevitt guy waring was too innocent to suspect anybody but as he woke up more fully now to the nature of his own act a horrible sense of guilt and pollution crept slowly over him he put his hand ito his forehead cold sweat stood in clammy small drops upon his brow bit by bit the hateful truth dawned clearly upon him nevitt had lured him by strange means he knew not how into hateful crimeinto a disgraceful conspiracy word by word the selfaccusing sentence framed itself upon his lips  he spoke it out aloud whythisis forgery  dazzled and stunned by the intensity of that awful awaking from some weird possession or suggestion of evil by a stronger mind guy waring began to walk on in a feverish fashion fast fast oh so fast not knowing where he went but conscious only that he must keep moving lest an accusing conscience should gnaw his very heart out  whither he hadnt as yet the faintest idea his whole being for the moment was centred and summed up in that unspeakable remorse he had done a great wrong he had made himself a felon and now in the first recoil of his revolted nature he must go after the man who held the evidences of his guilt and by force or persuasion demand them at once from him  those notes were cyrils he must get them he must get them  possessed by this one idea with devouring force but still in a very nebulous and hazy form guy began walking towards the strand and the embankment at the hot top of his speed to get the notes backat montague nevitts chambers he had walked with fiery zeal in that wrong direction for nearly a mile his heart burning within him all the way and his brain in a whirl before it began to strike him in a flash of common sense that montague nevitt wouldnt be there at all he had driven off to the office guy clapped his hand to his forehead once more in an agony of remorse great heavens what folly he had heard him tell the cabman the address himself127 knatchbull street cheapside  even now he hadnt sense enough to hail a cab and go after him his faculties were still numbed and entranced by that horrible spell of montague nevitts eye he had but one thoughtto walk on walk hastily he tramped along the streets in the direction of cheapside straining every muscle to arrive at the office before nevitt had parted with cyrils six thousandbut he never even thought of saving the precious moments by driving the distance between instead of walking it montague nevitts personality still weighed down half his brain and rendered his mind almost childish or imbecile  hurrying on so through the crowded streets now walking now running now pausing now panting knocking up here against a little knot of wayfarers and delayed again there by an untimely block at some crowded crossing he turned the corner at last with a beating heart into the narrow pavement of an alley marked up as knatchbull street number 127 was visible from afar  a mob of excited people marked its site by loitering about the door two policemen held off the angrier spirits among the shareholders but nothing daunted by the press guy forced his way in and looked around the room trembling for montague nevitt too late  too late nevitt wasnt there the unhappy dupe turned to the clerk in charge  has mr montague nevitt been here he asked in a voice all tremulous with emotion  mr montague nevitt the clerk responded  just gone ten minutes ago came to settle mr  whitleys callhis brotherinlaws went off in a cab can i do anything for you  hes paid in six thousand pounds guy gasped out interrogatively  the clerk gazed at him hard with a suspicious glance are you a shareholder he asked with one eye on the policeman what do you want to know for  yes im a shareholder unfortunately guy answered still in a maze i hold three hundred original shares my names guy waring youve got me on your books mr nevitt has paid three thousand in mr whitleys name and three thousand for me that was our arrangement  the clerk glanced hard at him again waring he repeated turning over the leaves of his big book for further verification waring waring waring  ah here it is waring guy journalist 22 staple inn 300 shares three hundred pounds paid then we call up to three thousand no mr nevitt didnt settle for you sir he paid mr whitleys call in full  that was all nothing else youre still our debtor  he didnt pay up guy exclaimed clapping his hands to his head all the black guile and treachery of the man coining home to him at once at one fell blow  he didnt pay up for me oh this is too too terrible  he paused for a moment floods of feeling rushed over him he knew now that he had committed that forgery for nothing cyrils money was gone and montague nevitt had stolen the three thousand guy intrusted to him at the bank for the second payment  yet guy knew he had no legal remedy save by acknowledging the forgery this was almost more than human nature could stand if montague nevitt had been by his side that moment guy would have leapt at his throat and it would have gone hard with him if he had left the villain living  he clapped his hands to his ears in the horror and agony of that hideous disclosure  the thief he cried aloud in a choking voice  did he pay what he paid from a big roll of notes and did he take the rest of the notes in the roll away with him  yes just so the clerk answered calmly he didnt mention your name but perhaps hes coming back byandby to settle for you  guy knew better he saw through the mans whole black nature at once  ive been robbed he said slowly ive been robbed and deserted i must follow the man and compel him to disgorge when ive got the cash back ill return and pay you  no i wont though i forgot ill take it home to the bank for cyril  the clerk gazed at him with a smile of pitying contempt  mad mad quite mad the loss of his fortune had no doubt unhinged this shareholders reason but guy never heeding him rushed out into the street and hailed a passing cab  temple flats he cried aloud and drove to nevitts chambers too late once more the housekeeper told him mr nevitt was out hed just started off portmanteau and all as hard as a hansom could drive to waterloo station  waterloo then guy shouted in wild despair to the cabman we must follow this man post haste  alive or dead i wont rest till i catch him  it was an unhappy phrase in the events that came after it was remembered against him       chapter xxi  colonel kelmscotts punishment      while montague nevitt was thus congenially engaged in pulling off his treble coup of settling his own share in the rio negro deficit pocketing three thousand pounds pro tem for incidental expenses and getting guy waring thoroughly into his power by his knowledge of a forgery two other events were taking place elsewhere which were destined to prove of no small importance to the future of the twins and their immediate surroundings things generally were converging towards a crisis in their affairs colonel kelmscotts wrongdoing was bearing firstfruit abundantly  for as soon as granville kelmscott received that strangelyworded note from gwendoline gildersleeve he proceeded as was natural straight down in his doubt to his fathers library there bursting into the room with gwendolines letter still crushed in his hand in the side pocket of his coat and a face like thunder he stood in the attitude of avenging fate before his fathers chair and gazed down upon him angrily  what does this mean he asked in a low but fuming voice brandishing the note before his eyes as he spoke is every one in the county to be told it but i is everybody else to hear my business before you tell me a word of it a letter comes to me this morningno matter from whomand heres what it says i know youre not the eldest son and that somebody else is the heir of tilgate surely if anybody was to know i should have known it first  surely if im to be turned adrift on the world after being brought up to think myself a man of means so long i should at least be turned adrift with my eyes open  colonel kelmscott gazed at him openmouthed with horror  did gwendoline gildersleeve write that to you he cried overpowered at once by remorse and awe  did gwendoline gildersleeve write that to you  well if gwendoline gildersleeve knows it its all up with the scheme that rascally lawyer her father has found out everything these two young men must have put their case in the fellows hands he must be hunting up the facts he must be preparing to contest it my boy my boy were ruined were ruined  these two young men granville repeated with a puzzled air of surprise what two young men i dont know them i never heard of them then suddenly one of those flashes of intuition burst in upon him that burst in upon us all at moments of critical importance to our lives father father he cried loaning forward in his anguish and clutching the oak chair you dont mean to tell me those fellows the warings that we met at chetwood court are your lawful sonsand that that was why you bought the landscape with the snake in it  kelmscott of tilgate bent his proud head down to the table unchecked my son my son he cried in his despair you have said it yourself your own mouth has suggested it what use my trying to keep it from you any longer these ladsare kelmscotts  andmy mother granville kelmscott burst out in a very tremulous voice the question was almost more than a man dare ask but he asked it in the first bitterness of a terrible awakening  your mother colonel kelmscott answered lifting his head once more with a terrible effort and looking his son pointblank in the faceyour mother is just what i have always called hermy lawful wifelady emily kelmscott the mother of these lads to whom i was also once duly married died before my marriage with my present wifethank god i can say so i may have acted foolishly cruelly criminally but at least i never acted quite so basely and so ill as you impute to me granville  thank heaven for that his son answered fervently with one hand on his breast drawing a deep sigh as he spoke youre my father sir and it isnt for me to reproach you but if you had only done thatoh my mother my mother i dont know sir im sure how i could ever have forgiven you i dont know how i could ever have kept my hands off you  colonel kelmscott straightened himself up and looked hard at his son a terrible pathos gleamed in his proud brown eyes his white moustache had more dignity than ever  granville he said slowly like a broken man i dont ask you to forgive me you can never forgive me i dont ask you to sympathise with me a father knows better than to accept sympathy from a son but i do ask you to bear with me while i try to explain myself  he braced himself up and with many long pauses and many inarticulate attempts to set forth the facts in the least unfavourable aspect told his story all through in minute detail to that hardest of all critics his own dispossessed and disinherited boy  if youre hard upon me granville he cried at last as he finished looking wistfully for pity into his sons face you should remember at least it was for your sake i did it my boy it was for your sake i did ityours yours and your mothers  granville let him relate his whole story in full to the bitter end though it was with difficulty at times that that proud and greyhaired man nerved himself up to tell it then as soon as all was told he looked in his fathers face once more and said slowly with the pitilessness of sons in general towards the faults and failings of their erring parents  its not my place to blame you i know you did it i suppose as you say so for me and my mother  but it is my place to tell you plainly father that i for one will have nothing at all to do with the fruits of your deception i was no party to the fraud i will be no party either to its results or its clearing up i too have to think as you say of my mother for her sake i wont urge you to break her heart at once by disinheriting her son now and here too openly you can make what arrangements you like with these bloodsucking warings you can do as you will in providing them with hushmoney let them take their blackmail youve handed them over half the sum you got for dowlands already i suppose you can buy them off for awhile by handing them over the remainder twelve thousand will do leeches as they are that will surely content them at least for the present  colonel kelmscott raised one hand and tried hard to interrupt him but granville would not be interrupted  no no he went on sternly shaking his head and frowning ill have my say for once and then for ever keep silence this is the first and last time as long as we both live i will speak with you on the subject so we may as well understand one another once and for ever for my mothers sake as i said there need be just at present no open disclosure you have years to live yet and as long as you live these waring people have no claim upon the estate in any way youve given them as much as theyve any right to expect let them wait for the rest till in the course of nature they come into possession as for me i will go to carve out for myself a place in the world elsewhere by my own exertions perhaps before my mother need know her son was left a beggar by the father who brought him up like the heir to a large estate i may have been able to carve out that place for myself so well that she need never really feel the difference im a kelmscott and can fight the world on my own account but in any case i must go  tilgates no longer a fit home for me i leave it to those who have a better right to it  he rose as if to depart with the air of a man who sets forth upon the world to seek his fortune colonel kelmscott rose too and faced him all broken  granville he said in a voice scarcely audible through the stifled sobs he was too proud to give vent to youre not going like this youre not going without at least shaking hands with your father  youre not going without saying goodbye to your mother  granville turned with hot tears standing dim in his eyeslike his father he was too proud to let them trickle down his cheekand taking the colonels weatherbeaten hand in his wrung it silently for some minutes with profound emotion  then he looked at the white moustache the grizzled hair the bright brown eyes suffused with answering dimness and said almost remorsefully father goodbye you meant me well no doubt you thought you were befriending me but i wish to heaven in my soul you had meant me worse it would have been easier for me to bear in the end if youd brought me up as a nobodyas a younger sons accustomed he paused and drew back for he could see his words were too cruel for that proud mans heart then he broke off suddenly  but i cant say goodbye to my mother he went on with a piteous look if i tried to say goodbye to her i must tell her all id break down in the attempt ill write to her from the cape itll be easier so she wont feel it so much then  from the cape colonel kelmscott exclaimed drawing back in horror oh granville dont tell me youre going away from us to africa  where else his son asked looking him back in the face steadily africa it is thats the only opening left nowadays for a man of spirit there i may be able to hew out a place for myself at last worthy of lady emily kelmscotts son i wont come back till i come back able to hold my own in the world with the best of them these warings shant crow over the younger son goodbye once more father he wrung his hand hard think kindly of me when im gone and dont forget altogether i once loved tilgate  he opened the door and went up to his own room again his mind was resolved he wouldnt even say goodbye to gwendoline gildersleeve hed pack a few belongings in a portmanteau in haste and go forth upon the world to seek his fortune in the south african diamond fields  but colonel kelmscott sat still in the library bowed down in his chair with his head between his hands in abject misery a strange feeling seemed to throb through his weary brain he had a sensation as though his skull were opening and shutting great veins on his forehead beat black and swollen the pressure was almost more than the vessels would stand he held his temples between his two palms as if to keep them from bursting all ahead looked dark as night the ground was cut from under him the punishment of his sin was too heavy for him to bear how could he ever tell emily now that granville was gone a horrible numbness oppressed his brain oh mercy  mercy his head was flooded       chapter xxii  cross purposes      at the gildersleeves too the house that day was alive with excitement  gwendoline had thrown herself into a fever of alarm as soon as she had posted her letter to granville kelmscott she went up to her own room flung herself wildly on the hed and sobbed herself into a halfhysterical halfdelirious state long before dinnertime she hardly knew herself at first how really ill she was her hands were hot and her forehead burning  but she disregarded such mere physical and medical details as those by the side of a heart too full for utterance she thought only of granville and of that horrid man who had threatened with such evident spite and rancour to ruin him  she lay there some hours alone in a high fever before her mother came up to her room to fetch her mrs gildersleeve was a subdued and softvoiced woman utterly crushed so people said by the stronger individuality of that blustering domineering  headstrong man her husband and to say the truth the eminent qc had taken all the will out of her in twentythree years of obedient slavery she was pretty still to be sure in a certain faded jaded unassuming way but her patient face wore a constant expression of suppressed terror as if she expected every moment to be the victim of some terrible and unexplained exposure and that feature at least in her idiosyncrasy could hardly be put down to gilbert gildersleeves account for hectoring and strongminded as the successful qc was known to be nobody could for a moment accuse him in any definite way of deliberate unkindness to his wife or daughter on the contrary he was tender and indulgent to them to the last degree as he understood those virtues it was only by constant assertion of his own individuality and constant repression or disregard of theirs that he had broken his wifes spirit and was breaking his daughters he treated them as considerately as one treats a pet dog doing everything for them that care and money could effect except to admit for a moment their claim to independent opinions and actions of their own or to allow the possibility of their thinking and feeling on any subject on earth one nails breadth otherwise than as he himself did  at sight of gwendoline mrs gildersleeve came over to the bed with a scared and startled air felt her daughters face tenderly with her hands for a moment and then cried in alarm why gwennie whats this  your cheeks are burning who on earth has been here has that horrid man come down again from london to worry you  gwendoline looked up and tried to prevaricate but conscience was too strong for her the truth would out for all that yes mother she cried after a pause and he said oh he saidi could never tell you what dreadful things he said but hes so wicked so cruel you never knew such a man he thinks i want to marry granville kelmscott and so he told me she broke off of a sudden unable to proceed and buried her face in her hands sobbing long and bitterly  well what did he tell you dear mrs gildersleeve asked with that frightened air as of a startled wild thing growing deeper than ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question  he told meoh he told mei cant tell you what he told me but he threatened to ruin ushe threatened it so dreadfully it was a hateful threat  he seemed to have found out something that he knew would be our ruin he frightened me to death i never heard any one say such things as he did  mrs gildersleeve drew back in profound agitation  found out something that would be our ruin she cried with white face all aghast oh gwennie what do you mean didnt he tell you what it was didnt he try to explain to you hes a wicked wicked man so cruel so unscrupulous he gets ones secrets into his hands by underhand means and then uses them to make one do whatever he chooses i see how it is he wants to force us into letting him marry youinto making you marry him oh gwennie this is hard didnt he tell you at all what it was he knew didnt he give you a hint what sort of secret he was driving at  gwendoline looked up once more and murmured low through her sobs no he didnt say what it was hes too cunning for that but i thinki think it was something about granville mother i never told you but you know i love him i think it was something about him though i cant quite make sure some secret about somebody not being properly married or something of that sort i didnt quite understand  you see he was so discreetly vague and reticent  mrs gildersleeve drew back her face all aghast with horror some secretabout somebodynot being properly married she repeated slowly with wild terror in her eyes  yes mother gwendoline gasped out with an effort once more it was about somebody not being really the proper heir he made me promise i wouldnt tell but i dont know how to keep it he was immensely full of it it was an awful secret and he said he would ruin usruin us ruthlessly he said we were in his power and hed crush us under his heel and oh when he said it you should have seen his face it was horrible horrible ive seen nothing else since it dogs meit haunts me  mrs gildersleeve sat down by the bedside wringing her hands in silence its too late tonight she said at last after a long deep pause and in a voice like a woman condemned to death too late to do anything but tomorrow your father must go up to town and try to see him at all costs we must buy him off he knows everythingthats clear hell ruin us hell ruin us  its no use papa going up to town though gwendoline answered half dreamily that dreadful man said he was going away for his holiday to the country at once hell be gone tomorrow  gone gone where mrs gildersleeve cried in the same awestruck voice  to devonshire gwendoline replied shutting her eyes hard and still seeing him  mrs gildersleeve echoed the phrase in a startled cry  to devonshire gwendoline to devonshire did he say to devonshire  yes gwendoline went on slowly trying to recall his very words to the skirts of dartmoor i think he said to a place in the wilds by the name of mambury  mambury  the terror and horror that frail and faded woman threw into the one word fairly startled gwendoline  she opened her eyes and stared aghast at her mother  and well she might for the effect was electrical mrs  gildersleeve was sitting there transfixed with awe and some unspeakable alarm her figure was rigid her face was dead white her mouth was drawn down with a convulsive twitch she clasped her bloodless hands on her knees in mute agony for a moment she sat there like a statue of flesh then as sense and feeling came back to her by slow degrees she could but rock her body up and down in her chair with a short swaying motion and mutter over and over again to herself in that same appalled and terrified voice mamburymamburymamburymambury  that was the name im sure gwendoline went on almost equally alarmed on a hunt after records he said on a hunt after records whatever it was he wanted to prove i suppose he knew that was the place to prove it  mrs gildersleeve rose or to speak with more truth staggered slowly to her feet and steadying herself with an effort made blindly for the door groping her way as she went like some faint and wounded creature  she said not a word to gwendoline she had no tongue left for speech or comment she merely stepped on pale and white pale and white like one who walks in her sleep and clutched the doorhandle hard to keep her from falling gwendoline now thoroughly alarmed followed her close on her way to the top of the stairs there mrs gildersleeve paused turned round to her daughter with a mute look of anguish and held up one hand palm outward appealingly as if on purpose to forbid her from following farther at the gesture gwendoline fell back and looked after her mother with straining eyes mrs gildersleeve staggered on erect yet to all appearance almost incapable of motion and stumbled down the stairs and across the hall and into the drawingroom opposite the rest gwendoline neither saw nor heard nor guessed at  she crept back into her own room and flinging herself on her bed alone as she stood cried still more piteously and miserably than ever  down in the drawingroom however mrs gildersleeve found the famous qc absorbed in the perusal of that days paper she came across towards him pale as a ghost and with ashen lips gilbert she said slowly blurting it all out in her horror without one word of warning that dreadful man nevitt has seen gwennie again and hes told her he knows all and he means to ruin us and hes heard of the marriage and hes gone down to mambury to hunt up the records  the eminent qc let the paper drop from his huge red hands in the intensity of his surprise while his jaw fell in unison at so startling and almost incredible a piece of intelligence nevitt knows all he exclaimed half incredulous he means to ruin us  and he told this to gwendoline gone down to mambury oh no minnie impossible you must have made some mistake what did she say exactly  did she mention mambury  she said it exactly as ive said it now to you mrs gildersleeve persisted with a stony stare hes gone down to devonshire she said to the borders of dartmoor on a hunt after the records to a place in the wilds by the name of mambury those were her very words i could stake my life on each syllable  i give them to you precisely as she gave them to me  mr gildersleeve gazed across at her with the countenance which had made so many a nervous witness quake at the old bailey are you quite sure of that minnie he asked in his best crossexamining tone quite sure she said mambury all of her own accord quite sure you didnt suggest it to her or supply the name or give her a hint of its whereabouts or put her a leading question  is it likely id suggest it to her the meekest of women answered aroused to retort for once and with her face like a sheet is it likely id tell her is it likely id give my own girl the clue she said it all of herself i tell you without one word of prompting she said it just as i repeated itto a place in the wilds by the name of mambury  gilbert gildersleeve whistled inaudibly to himself  twas his way when he felt himself utterly nonplussed  this was very strange news he didnt really understand it but he rose and confronted his wife anxiously  that overbearing big man was evidently stirred by this untoward event to the very depths of his nature  then gwennie knows all he cried the blood rushing purple into his ruddy flushed cheeks the wretch the brute he must have told her everything  oh gilbert his wife answered sinking into a chair in her horror even he couldnt do thatnot to my own very daughter and he didnt do it im sure  he didnt darecoward as he is he couldnt be quite so cowardly she doesnt guess what it means she thinks its something i believe about granville kelmscott shes in love with young kelmscott as i told you long ago and everything to her mind takes some colour from that fancy i dont think it ever occurred to her from what she says this has anything at all to do with you or me gilbert  the qc reflected he saw at once he was in a tight corner that boisterous man with the burly big hands looked quite subdued and crestfallen now he could hardly have snubbed the most unassuming junior  this was a terrible thing indeed for a man so unscrupulous and clever as montague nevitt to have wormed out of the registers how he could ever have wormed it out gilbert gildersleeve hadnt the faintest idea why who on earth could have shown him the entry of that fatal marriageminnies first marriagethe marriage with that wretch who died in portland prisonthe marriage that was celebrated at st marys at mambury he couldnt for a moment conceive for nobody but themselves he fondly imagined had ever identified mrs gilbert gildersleeve the wife of the eminent qc with that unhappy mrs read the convicts widow the convicts widow ah there was the rub for she was really a widow in name alone when gilbert gildersleeve married her  and montague nevitt that human ferret with his keen sharp eyes and his sleek polite ways had found it all out in spite of themhad hunted up the date of reads death and their marriage and had bragged how he was going down to mambury to prove it  all the warings and reads always got married at widdicombe or mambury there were lots of them on the books there that was one comfort anyhow hed have a good search to find his needle in such a pottle of hay but to think the fellow should have had the doubledyed cruelty to break the shameful secret first of all to gwendoline that was his vile way of trying to force a poor girl into an unwilling consent gilbert gildersleeve lifted his burly big hands in front of his capacious waistcoat and pressed them together angrily  if only he had that rascals throat well between them at that moment hed crush the fellows windpipe till he choked him on the spot though he answered for it before the judges of assize tomorrow  theres only one thing possible for it minnie he said at last drawing a long deep breath i must go down to mambury tomorrow to be beforehand with him and i must either buy him off or else if that wont do  or else what gilbert  she trembled like an aspen leaf  or else get at the books in the vestry myself the qc muttered low between his clenched teeth before the fellow has time to see them and prove it       chapter xxiii  guy in luck      guy waring reached waterloo ten minutes too late  nevitt had gone on by the west of england express  the porter at the labelling place minded the gentleman well he was a sharplooking gentleman with a queer look about the eyes and a dark moustache curled round at the corners  yes yes guy cried eagerly thats him right enough the eyes mark the man and where was he going to  he had his things labelled the porter said for plymouth  and when does the next train start guy inquired all on fire  the porter consulting the timetable in the muddleheaded way peculiar to railway porters and stroking his chin with his hand to assist cerebration announced after a severe internal struggle that the 345 down slow was the earliest train available  there was nothing for it then guy perceived but to run home to his rooms possessing his soul in patience pack up a few things in his gladstone bag and return at his leisure to catch the down train thus unfavourably introduced to his critical notice  if guy had dared to be sure he might have gone straight to a policestation and got an inspector to telegraph along the line to stop the thief with his booty at basingstoke or salisbury but guy didnt dare for to interfere with nevitt now by legal means would be to risk the discovery of his own share in the forgery and from that risk the startled and awakened young man shrank for a thousand reasons though the chief among them all was certainly one that never would have occurred to any one but himself as even probable  he didnt wish elma clifford to know that the man she loved and the man who loved her had become that day a forgers brother  to be sure he had only seen elma oncethat afternoon at the holkers gardenparty but as cyril himself knew he had fallen in love with her at first sightfar more immediately indeed than even cyril himself had done blood as usual was thicker than water  the points that appealed to one brother appealed also to the other but with this characteristic difference that guy who was the more emotional and less strongwilled of the two yielded himself up at the very first glance to the beautiful stranger while cyril required some further acquaintance before quite giving way and losing his heart outright to her and from that first meeting forward guy had carried elma cliffords image engraved upon his memoryas he would carry it he believed to his dying day not to be sure that he ever thought for a moment of endeavouring to win her away from his brother she was cyrils discovery and to cyril therefore he yielded her up as of prior right though with a pang of reluctance but now that he stood face to face at last with his own accomplished crime the first thought that rose in his mind spontaneous was for elmas happiness he must never let elma clifford know that the man she loved and would doubtless marry was now by his acta forgers brother  three fortyfive arrived at last and guy set off all trembling on his fatal quest as he sped along indignant  at heart with nevitts black treachery on the line to plymouth he had plenty of time to revolve these things abundantly in his own soul and when after a long and dusty drive he reached plymouth late at night he could learn nothing for the moment about montague nevitts movements so he was forced to go quietly for the evening to the duke of devonshire hotel and there wait as best he might to see how events would next develop themselves  a day passed awaytwo daysbut nothing turned up guy wasted much time in plymouth making various inquiries before he learnt at last that a man with a queer look about the eyes and a moustache with waxed ends had gone down a night or so earlier by the other line to a station at the foot of dartmoor by the name of mambury  no sooner however had he learnt this promising news than he set off at once hot at heart as ever to pursue the robber that wretch shouldnt get away scot free with his booty guy would follow him and denounce him to the other end of the universe when he reached mambury he went direct to the village inn and asked with trembling lips if mr montague nevitt was at present staying there the landlord shook his head with a stubborn rustic negative no we arnt agot no gentleman o thik there name in the house he said fact is zur to tell ee the truth we arnt ahad nobody stoppin in the arms at all lately cep it might be a gentleman come down from london an it was day afore yesterday as he did come an he do call unself mcgregor  quick as lightning guy suspected nevitt might be passing under a false name what more likely indeed seeing he had made off with guys three thousand pounds  and what sort of a man is this mcgregor he asked hastily putting his suspicion into shape what age what height what kind of a person to look at  wull hes a vine upstandin zart of a gentleman the landlord answered glibly in his own dialect as proper a gentleman as youd wish to zee in a days march med be about your height zur or a trifle more has his moustaches curled round zame as if it med be a bellicks harns an a strange zart o a look about his eyes too as if ur could zee right drew an drew ee  thats him guy exclaimed with a start in profound excitement thats the fellow sure enough i know him i know him and where is he now landlord  is he in the house can i see him  well no ee cant zee him zur the landlord answered eyeing the stranger askance he be out jest at present he do go vur a walk mostly down yonner in the bottom alongside the brook mebbe if you was to vollow by riverbank you med come up wi him byanby  and mebbe agin you mednt  ill follow him guy exclaimed growing more excited than ever now this quarry was almost well within sight ill follow him till i find him the confounded rascal ill follow him to his grave he shant get away from me  the landlord looked at him with a dubious frown  that one could smile and smile and be a villain didnt enter into his simple rustic philosophy  hes a pleasantspoken gentleman is maister mcgregor the honest devonian said with a tinge of disapprobation in his thick voice what vur do ee want to vind un thats what i wants to know he dont look like one as did ever hurt a vlea such a soft zart of a voice an he do play on the viddle that beautifulthat beautiful why tis the zame if he war a angel from heaven viddler moore he wur up here wi his music last night an maister mcgregor he took the instrument vrom un an let me have a try my vrend says he all modest and unassoomin and vi that he wounded it up an he begun to play lard how he did play never heard nothing like it in all my barn days it is the zame vor all the world as you do hear they viddler chaps that plays by themselves in the albert hall up to london depend upon it zur there aint no harm in him a vullow as can play on the viddle like thik there why he couldnt do no hurt not to child nor chicken  guy turned away from the door fretting and fuming inwardly he knew better than that nevitts consummate mastery of his chosen instrument was but of a piece after all with the way he could play on all the world as on a familiar gamut it was the very skill of the man that made him so dangerous and so devilish  guy felt that under the spell of nevitts eye he himself was but as clay in the hands of the potter  but nevitt should never so trick him and twist him again to that his mind was now fully made up he would never let that cold eye hold him fixed as of yore by its steely glance once for all nevitt had proved his power too well guy would take good care he never subjected himself in future to that uncanny influence  one forgery was enough henceforth he was adamant  and yet and yet he was going to seek out nevitt going to stand face to face with that smiling villain again going to tax him with his crime going to ask him what he meant by this doubledyed treachery  the landlord had told him where nevitt was most likely to be found he followed that direction at a gate that turned by the riverbank twenty minutes from the inn a small boy was seated he was a devonshire boy of the poorest moorland type short squat and thick set as guy reached the gate the boy rose and opened it pulling his forelock twice or thrice expectant of a hapenny has anybody gone down here guy asked in an excited voice  and the boy answered promptly yes thik there gentleman whats stoppin at the talbot arms and another gentleman too ony tother one come after and went tother way round a big zart o a gentleman wi ands vit vor two he axed me the zame question had anybody gone by this is dree of ee as has come zince ive been a zitting here  guy paid no attention to the secondnamed gentleman with the hands fit for two or to his inquiries after who might have gone before him he fastened at once on the really important and serious information that the person who was stopping at the talbot arms had shortly before turned down the side footpath  all right my boy he said tossing the lad sixpence the first coin he came across in his waistcoat pocket  the boy opened his eyes wide and pocketed it with a grin so unexpected a largess sufficed to impress the handsome stranger firmly on his memory he didnt forget him when a few days later he was called on to give evidenceat a coroners inquest  but guy unsuspicious of the harm he had done himself walked on all on fire down the woodland path  it was a shady path and it led through a deep dell arched with hazels on every side while a little brawling brook ran along hard by more heard than seen in the bottom of the dingle thick bramble obscured the petty rapids from view and half trailed their lush shoots here and there across the pathway it was just such a mossy spot as cyril would have loved to paint and guy himself half an artist by nature would in any other mood have paused to gaze delighted on its tangled greenery  as it was however he was in no mood to loiter long over ferns and mosses he walked down that narrow way where luxuriant branches of fresh green blackberry bushes encroached upon the track still seething in soul and full of the bitter wrong inflicted upon him by the man he had till lately considered his dearest friend  at each bend of the footpath as it threaded its way through the tortuous dell following close the elbows of the bickering little stream he expected to come full in sight of nevitt but gaze as he would no nevitt appeared he must have gone on guy thought and come out at the other end into the upland road of which the porters at mambury station had told him  at last he arrived at a delicious green nook where the shade of the trees overhead was exceptionally dense and where the ferns by the side were somewhat torn and trodden casting his eye on the ground to the left a metal clasp gleaming silvery among the bracken happened to attract his cursory attention something about that clasp looked strangely familiar he paused and stared hard at it surely surely he had seen those metal knobs before a flash of recognition ran electric through his brain why yes it was the fastener of montague nevitts pocketbookthe pocketbook in which he carried his most private documents the pocketbook that must have held cyrils stolen six thousand guy stooped down to pick it up with a whirling sense of surprise great heavens what was this not only the clasp but the pocketbook itselfthe pocketbook filled full and crammed to bursting with papers ah mercy what papers yes incrediblethe money hundredpound notes not a doubt upon earth of it the whole of the stolen and restolen three thousand  for a minute or two guy stood there unable to believe his own swimming eyes what on earth could have happened was it chance or design had nevitt deliberately thrown away his illgotten gains were detectives on the track was he anxious to conceal his part in the theft had remorse got the better of him or was he frightened at last thinking guy was on his way to recover and restore cyrils stolen property  but no the pocketbook was neither hidden in the ferns nor yet studiously thrown away from the place where it lay guy felt confident at once it had fallen unperceived from nevitts pocket and been trodden by his heel unawares into the yielding leafmould  had he pulled it out accidentally with his handkerchief very likely guy thought but then how strange and improbable that a man so methodical and calculating as nevitt should carry such valuable belongings as those in the selfsame pocket it was certainly most singular however guy congratulated himself after a moments pause that so much at least of the stolen property was duly recovered he could pay back onehalf of the purloined sum now to cyrils credit  so he went on his way through the rest of the wood in a somewhat calmer and easier frame of mind to be sure he had still to hunt down that villain nevitt and to tax him to his face with his doubledyed treachery  but it was something nevertheless to have recovered a part at any rate of the stolen money and nevitt himself need never know by what fortunate accident he had happened to recover it  he emerged on the upland road and struck back towards mambury all the way round he never saw his man weary with walking he returned in the end to the talbot arms had mr mcgregor come back no not yet but he was sure to be home for dinner  then guy would wait and dine at the inn as well  he might have to stop all night but he must see mcgregor  as the day wore on however it became gradually clear to him that montague nevitt didnt mean to return at all hour after hour passed by but nothing was heard of him the landlord good man began to express his doubts and fears most freely he hoped no harm hadnt come to the gentleman in the parlour he had a powerful zight o money on un for a man to carry about the landlord had zeen it when he took out his book from his pocket to pay the porter volks didnt ought to go about with two or dree hundred pound or more in the lonely lanes on the edge of the moorland  but guy for his part put a different interpretation on the affair at once in some way or other montague nevitt he thought must have found out he was being tracked and fearing for his safety must have dropped the pocketbook and made off without note or notice given on his own sound legs for some other part of the country  so guy made up his mind to return next morning by the very first train direct to plymouth and there inquire once more whether anything further had been seen of the noticeable stranger       chapter xxiv  a slight misunderstanding      on the very same day that guy waring visited mambury where his mother was married montague nevitt had hunted up the entry of colonel kelmscotts wedding in the church register  nevitts behaviour to say the truth wasnt quite so black as guy waring painted it he had gone off with the extra three thousand in his pocket to be sure but he didnt intend to appropriate it outright to his own uses he merely meant to give guy a thoroughly good fright as it wasnt really necessary the call should be met for another fortnight and then as soon as hed found out the truth about colonel kelmscott and his unacknowledged sons he proposed to use his knowledge of the forgery as a lever with guy so as to force him to come to advantageous terms with his supposed  father nevitts idea was that guy and cyril should drive a hard bargain on their own account with the colonel and that he himself should then receive a handsome commission on the transaction from both the brothers under penalty of disclosing the true facts about the cheque by whose aid guy had met their joint liability to the rio negro diamond mines  it was with no small joy therefore that nevitt saw at last in the parish register of st marys at mambury the interesting announcement june 27th henry lucius kelmscott of the parish of plymouth bachelor private in the regiment of scots greys to lucy waring spinster of this parish  he saw at a glance of course why kelmscott of tilgate had chosen to describe himself in this case as a private soldier but he also saw that the entry was an official document and that here he had one firm hold the more on colonel kelmscott who must falsely have sworn to that incorrect description the great point of all however was the signature to the book and though nearly thirty years had elapsed since those words were written it was clear to nevitt when he compared the autograph in the register with one of colonel kelmscotts recent business letters brought with him for the purpose that both had been penned by one and the same person  he chuckled to himself with delight to think how great a benefactor he had proved himself unawares to guy and cyril at that very moment no doubt his misguided young friend whom he had compelled to assist him with the sinews of war for this important campaign was reviling and objurating him in revengeful terms as the blackest and most infamous of doubledyed traitors ah well ah well the good are inured to gross ingratitude guy little knew as he montague nevitt stood there triumphant in the vestry blandly rewarding the expectant clerk for his pains with a whole bank of england fivepound notethe largest sum that functionary had ever in his life received all at once in a single paymentguy little knew that nevitt was really the chief friend and founder of the family fortunes and was prepared to compel the unknown benefactor for a moderate commission to recognise his unacknowledged firstborn sons before all the world as the heirs to tilgate but yesterday they were nameless waifs and strays of uncertain origin ashamed of their birth and ignorant even whether they had been duly begotten in lawful wedlock today they were the legal inheritors of an honoured name and a great estate the first and foremost among the landed gentry of a wealthy and beautiful english county  he smiled to think what a good turn he had done unawares to those ungrateful youthsand how little credit as yet they were prepared to give him for it  in such a mood he returned to the inn to lunch his spirits were high this was a good days work and he could afford indeed to make merry with his host over it he ordered in a bottle of winesuch wine as the little country cellar could produce and invited that honest man the landlord to step in and share it with him he had tasted worse sherry on london dinnertables and he told his host so an affable man with inferiors mr montague nevitt then he strolled out by himself down the path by the brook it was a pleasant walk with the water making music in little trickles by its side and montague nevitt as a man of taste found it suited exactly with his temper for the moment he noted an undercurrent of rejoicing and triumphant cheeriness in the tone of the stream as it plashed among the pebbles on its precipitous bed that suggested to his mind some bars of a symphony which he determined to compose as soon as he got home again to his beloved fiddle  so he walked along by himself elate and with a springy step on thoughts of ambition intent till he came at last to a cool and shadowy place where as yet the ferns were not broken down and trampled underfoot though guy waring found them so some twenty minutes later  at that spot he looked up and saw advancing along the path in the opposite direction the burly figure of a man in a light tourist suit whom he hadnt yet observed since he came to mambury the very first point he noticed about the man long before he recognised him was a pair of overgrown obtrusive hands held somewhat awkwardly in front of himjust like gilbert gildersleeves the likeness indeed was so ridiculously close that montague nevitt smiled quietly to himself to observe it if hed been in the tilgate district now hed have declared without the slightest hesitation that the man on the path was gilbert gildersleeve  one second later he pulled himself up with a jerk in alarmed surprise great heavens he cried to himself a weird sense of awe creeping over him piecemeal either this is a dream or else it is it must be gilbert gildersleeve  and so indeed it was gilbert gildersleeve himself in his proper person but the eminent qc better versed in the wiles of time and place than guy waring in his innocence had not come obtrusively to mambury village or asked pointblank at the talbot arms by his own right name for the man he was in search of  such simplicity of procedure would never even have occurred to that practised hand at the old bailey  mr gilbert gildersleeve appeared on that woodland path in the general guise of the common pedestrian tourist with his headquarters at ivybridge walking about on the congenial outskirts of the moor in search of the picturesque and coming and going by mere accident through mambury he had hovered around the neighbourhood for two days off and on in search of his man and now by careful watching like an amateur detective he had run his prey to earth by a dexterous flankmovement and secured an interview with him where he couldnt shirk or avoid it  to montague nevitt however the meeting seemed at first sight but the purest accident he had no reason to suppose indeed that gilbert gildersleeve had any special interest in his visit to mambury further than might be implied in its possible connection with granville kelmscotts affairs and he didnt believe gwendoline in her fear of her father that blustering man would ever have communicated to him the personal facts of their interview at tilgate so he advanced to meet his old acquaintance the barrister with frankly outstretched hand  mr gildersleeve he exclaimed in some surprise  no it cant be you well this is indeed an unexpected pleasure  gilbert gildersleeve gazed down upon him from the towering elevation of his six feet four montague nevitt was tall enough as men go in england but with his slim tailormade form and his waxed moustaches he looked by the side of that bigbuilt giant like a bond street exquisite before some prizefighting goliath  the barrister didnt hold out his huge hand in return  on the contrary he concealed it as far as was possible behind his burly back and looking down from the full height of his contempt upon the sinister smirking creature who advanced to greet him with that false smile on his face he asked severely  what are you doing here thats what i have to ask what foxy ferreting have you come down to mambury for  foxy ferreting montague nevitt repeated drawing back as if stung and profoundly astonished why what do you mean by that mr gildersleeve i dont understand you the homethrust was too trueafter the great crossexaminers wellknown bullying manner not to pierce him to the quick who dares to say i go anywhere ferreting  i do gilbert gildersleeve answered with assured confidence i say it and i know it you pitiful sneak dont deny it to me you were in the vestry this morning looking up the registers even you with your false eyes sir darent look me in the face and tell me you werent i saw you there myself and i know you found in the books what you wanted for you paid the clerk an extravagant fee  whats that you rat dont try to interrupt me dont try to bully me  it never succeeds montague nevitt i tell you i wont be bullied and the great qc put his foot down on the path with an elephantine solidity that made the prospect of bullying him seem tolerably unlikely i know the facts and ill stand no prevarication now tell me what vile use did you mean to make of your discovery this morning  montague nevitt drew back fairly nonplussed for the moment by such a vigorous and unexpected attack on his flank resourceful as he was even his cunning mind came wholly unprepared to this sudden crossquestioning he felt his own physical inferiority to the big qc more keenly just then than he could ever have conceived it possible for a man of his type to feel it after all mind doesnt always triumph over matter  montague nevitt was aware that that mountain of a man with his six feet four of muscular humanity fairly cowed and overawed him at such very close quarters  i dont see what business it is of yours mr gildersleeve  he murmured in a somewhat apologetic voice  i may surely be allowed to hunt up questions of pedigree of service in the end to myself and my friends without your interference  gilbert gildersleeve glared at him and flared up all at once with righteous indignation  of service in the end to yourself and your friends he cried with unfeigned scorn putting his own  interpretation as was natural on the words why you cur you reptile you unblushing sneak do you mean to say openly you avow your intention of threatening and blackmailing me herealoneto my face you extortionate wretch i wouldnt have believed even you in your heart would descend to such meanness  montague nevitt flurried and taken aback as he was yet reflected vaguely with some wonder as he listened and looked what this sudden passion of  disinterested zeal could betoken why such burning solicitude for colonel kelmscotts estate on the part of a man who was his avowed enemy even if gwendoline meant to marry the young fellow granville with her fathers consent how could nevitt himself levy blackmail upon gilbert gildersleeve by his knowledge of the two warings claim to the property a complication surely was there not some unexpected intricacy here which the cunning schemer himself didnt yet understand but which might redound if unravelled to his greater advantage  blackmail you mr gildersleeve he cried with a righteously indignant air thats an ugly word i blackmail nobody and least of all the father of a lady whom i still regard in spite of all she can say or do to make my life a blank with affection and respect as profound as ever how can my inquiries into the two warings affairs  gilbert gildersleeve crushed him with a sudden outburst of indignant wrath  you cad he cried growing red in the face with horror and disgust you dare to speak so to me and to urge such motives but youve mistaken your man  i wont be bullied if what you want is to use this vile knowledge youve so vilely ferreted out as a lever to compel me to marry my daughter to you against her willi can only tell you you sneak youre on the wrong tack i will never consent to it you may do your worst but you will never bend me im not a man to be bent or bulliedi wont be put down ill withstand you and defy you you may ruin me if you like but youll never break me i stand here firm expose me and ill fight you to the bitter end ill fight you and ill conquer you  he spoke with a fiery earnestness that nevitt was only just beginning to understand there was something in this here was a clue indeed to follow up and investigate surely a menace to granville kelmscotts prospects could never have moved that heavy phlegmatic pachydermatous man to such an outburst of anger and suppressed fear  expose you nevitt repeated in a dazed and startled voice expose you my dear sir i assure you in truth i dont understand you  the barrister gazed down upon him with immeasurable scorn you liar he broke forth almost choking at the words how dare you so pretend and prevaricate to my face i know its not true my own daughter told me she told me what you said to herevery word of your vile threats you had the incredible meanness to terrify a poor helpless and innocent girl by threatening to expose her mothers disgrace publicly only you could have done it but you did it you abject thing you did it she told me with her own lips you threatened to come down to mambury to hunt up the records and she told me the truth for ive seen you doing it  a light broke slowly upon montague nevitts mind  he drew a deep breath this was good luck incredible  what gilbert gildersleeve meant he hadnt as yet to be sure the faintest conception but it was clear they two were at crossquestions with one another the secret gilbert gildersleeve thought he had come down to mambury to discover was not the secret he had actually found out in the register that morning it was nothing about the kelmscotts or guy and cyril waring it was something about the great qc and his wife themselvespresumably some unknown and disgraceful fact in mrs gilbert gildersleeves early history  and here was the cleverest lawyer at the english criminal bar just giving himself awaygiving himself away unawares and telling him the secret bit by bit unconsciously  this chance was too valuable for mr montague nevitt to lose at all risks he must worm it out he paused and temporized his cue was now not to let gilbert gildersleeve see he didnt know his secret he must draw on the qc by obscure half hints till he was inextricably entangled in a complete confession  i had no intention of terrifying miss gildersleeve im sure he said in his blandest voice with his best company smile now recovering his equanimity exactly in proportion as the barrister grew angrier i merely desired to satisfy myself as to the salient facts and to learn their true bearing upon the family history if i spoke to her at all as to any knowledge i might possess with regard to any other ladys early antecedents  gilbert gildersleeves brow was black as night his great hands trembled and twitched convulsively was ever blackguard so cynically candid in his avowal of the basest crimes as this finespoken specimen of the culture of pall mall in his open confession of that disgusting insult to a young girls innocence gilbert gildersleeve who was at heart an honest man loathed and despised and scorned and detested him  do you dare to hint to me then he cried every muscle of his body quivering with just horror that you told my own daughter you thought you had reason to suspect her own mothers early antecedents  montague nevitt looked up at him with a quietly sarcastic smile alls fair in love and war you know he said not caring to commit himself  that smile sealed his fate with an irrepressible impulse gilbert gildersleeve sprang upon him he didnt mean to hurt the man he sprang upon him merely as the sole outlet for his own incensed and outraged feelings those great hands seized him for a second by the dainty white throat and flung him back in anger montague nevitt fell heavily on a thick mass of bracken there was a gurgle a gasp then his head lolled senseless he was very much hurt that at least was certain the barrister stood over him for a minute still purple in the face montague nevitt was whitevery white and deathlike  all at once it occurred to the big strong man that his handsthose great handswere very fierce and powerful  he had clutched nevitt by the throat half unconsciously with all his might just to give him a purchase as he flung the man from him he looked at him again great heavenswhat was this it burst over him at once he awoke to it with a wild start the fellow was dead and this was clearly manslaughter  justifiable homicide if the jury knew all but no jury now could ever know all and he had killed him unawares a great horror came over him the man was deadthe man was dead and he gilbert gildersleeve had unconsciously choked him  he had no time to think he had no time to calculate his wrath was still hot though rapidly cooling down before this awful discovery hide it  hide it hide it that was all he could think he lifted the body in his arms as easily as most men would lift a baby then he laid it down among the brambles close beside the stream something heavy fell out of the pocket as he carried it the barrister took no heed little matter for that he laid it down in fear and trembling as soon as it was hidden he fled for his life by trackless ways he walked over the moor and returned to ivybridge unseen very late in the evening ten minutes after he left the spot guy waring passed by and picked up the pocketbook       chapter xxv  lead trumps      naturally under these circumstances it was all in vain that guy waring pursued his investigations into montague nevitts whereabouts neither at plymouth nor anywhere else along the skirts of dartmoor could he learn that anything more had been seen or heard of the man who called himself mr mcgregor and yet guy felt sure nevitt wouldnt go far from mambury as things stood just then for as soon as he missed the pocketbook containing the three thousand pounds he would surely take some steps to recover it  two days later however gilbert gildersleeve sat in the hotel at plymouth where he had moved from ivybridge afterwell as he phrased it to himself after that unfortunate accident the blustering qc was like another man now for the first time in his life he knew what it meant to be nervous and timid  every sound made him suppress an involuntary start for as yet he had heard no whisper of the body being  discovered he couldnt leave the neighbourhood however till the murder was out dangerous as he felt it to remain on the spot some strange spell seemed to bind him against his will to dartmoor he must stop and hear what local gossip had to say when the body came to light and above all for the present he hadnt the courage to go home he dared not face his own wife and daughter  so he stayed on and lounged and pretended to interest himself with walks over the hills and up the tamar valley  as he sat there in the billiardroom that day a young fellow entered whom he remembered to have seen once or twice in london at evening parties with montague nevitt he turned pale at the sightgilbert gildersleeve turned pale that great red man  at first he didnt even remember the young fellows name but it came back to him in time that he was one guy waring it was a hard ordeal to meet him but gilbert gildersleeve felt he must brazen it out to slink away from the young man would be to rouse suspicion so they sat and talked for a minute or two together on indifferent subjects neither to say truth being very well pleased to see the other under such peculiar circumstances then guy who had the least reason for concealment of the two sauntered out for a stroll with his heart still full of that villain nevitt whose name of course he had never mentioned to gilbert gildersleeve and gilbert gildersleeve for his part had had equal cause for a corresponding reticence as to their common acquaintance  just as guy left the room the landlord dropped in and began to talk with his guest about the latest new sensation  heard the news sir this morning he asked with an important air inspectors just told me a case very much in your line of business dead bodys been discovered at mambury choked and then thrown among the brake by the river name of mcgregora visitor from london and they do say the police have a clue to the murderer person who did it  gilbert gildersleeves heart gave a great bound within  him and then stood stockstill but by an iron effort of will he suppressed all outer sign of his profound emotion he seemed to the observant eye merely interested and curious as the landlord finished his sentence carelesslyperson who did its supposed to be a young man who was at mambury this week of the name of waring  gilbert gildersleeves heart gave another bound still more violent than before but again he repressed with difficulty all external symptoms of his profound agitation this was very strange news then somebody  else was suspected instead of himself in one way that was bad for gilbert gildersleeve had a conscience and a sense of justice but in another way why it would save time for the moment and divert attention from his own personality better anything now than immediate suspicion in a week or two more every trace would be lost of his presence at mambury  waring he said thoughtfully turning over the name to himself as if he attached it to no particular individual waringwaringwaring  he paused and looked hard ha so far good it was clear the landlord didnt know waring was the name of the young man who had just left the billiardroom this was lucky indeed for if he had known it now and had taxed guy then and there before his own very face with being the murderer of this unknown person at mambury gilbert gildersleeve felt no course would have been open for him save to tell the whole truth on the spot unreservedly try as he would he couldnt see another man arrested before his very eyes for the crime he himself had really though almost unwittingly committed  waring he repeated slowly like one who endeavoured to collect his scattered thoughts what sort of person was he do you know and how did the police come to get a clue to him  the landlord nothing loth went off into a long and circumstantial story of the discovery of the body with minute details of how the innkeeper at mambury had traced the supposed murdererwho gave no nameby an envelope which hed left in his bedroom that evening the county was up in arms about the affair today  all dartmoor was being searched and it was supposed the fellow was in hiding somewhere in the neighbourhood of tavistock or oakhampton theyd catch him by tonight the landlord wouldnt be surprised indeed now he came to think on it if his truest himselfhere a very long pausewere retained byandby for the prosecution  gilbert gildersleeve drew a deep breath unperceived  that was all was it the pause had unnerved him  he talked some minutes as unconcernedly as he could though trembling inwardly all the while about the murder and the murderer the landlord listened with profound respect to the words of legal wisdom as they dropped from his lips for he knew mr gildersleeve by common repute as one of the ablest and acutest of criminal lawyers in all england then after a short interval the big burly man moving his guilty fingers nervously over the seal on his watchchain and assuming as much as possible his ordinary air of blustering selfassertion asked in an offhand fashion by the way let me see ive some business to arrange whats the number of my friend mr billingtons bedroom  the landlord looked up with a little start of surprise  mr billington he said hesitating weve got no mr billington  gilbert gildersleeve smiled a sickly smile it was neck or nothing now he must go right through with it oh yes he answered with prompt conviction playing a dangerous card wellfor how could he know what name this young man waring might possibly be passing under the gentleman who was talking to me when you came in just now his names billingtonthough perhaps he added after a pause with a reflective air he may have given you another one young men will be young men theyve often some reason when travelling for concealing their names  though billingtons not the sort of fellow to be sure whos likely to be knocking about anywhere incognito  the landlord laughed oh weve plenty of that sort he replied goodhumouredly both ladies and gentlemen it all makes trade but your friend aint one of em to tell you the truth he didnt give any name at all when he came to the hotel and we didnt ask any billington is it ah billington billington  i knew a billington myself once a trainer at  newmarket well hes a very pleasant young man nicespoken and that but i dont fancy hes quite right in his head somehow  with instinctive cleverness gilbert clildersleeve snatched at the opening at once ah no poor fellow he said shaking his head sympathetically  youve found that out already have you well hes subject to delusions a bit mere harmless delusions  but hes not at all dangerous excitable very when anything odd turns up hell be calling himself waring and giving himself in charge for this murder i dare say when he comes to hear of it but as goodhearted a fellow as ever lived though only a trifle obstinate if youve any difficulty with him at any time just send for me ive known him from a boy  hell do anything i tell him  it was a critical game but gilbert gildersleeve saw something definite must be done and he trusted to bluster and a wellknown name to carry him through with it and indeed he had said enough from that moment forth the landlords suspicions were never even so much as aroused by the innocent young man with the preoccupied manner who knew mr gildersleeve  the great qcs word was guarantee enoughfor any one but himself and the great qc himself knew it why a chance word from his lips was enough to protect guy waring from suspicion who would ever believe then anything so preposterously improbable as that the great qc himself was the murderer  not the police you may be sure nor the plymouth landlord  he went out into the town with his mind now filled full of a curious scheme a plan of campaign loomed up visibly before him waring was suspected therefore waring must somehow have given cause for suspicion  well waring was a friend of montague nevitts and had evidently been at mambury either with him or without him immediately before thehmthe unfortunate accident but as soon as waring came to learn of the discovery of the body which he would be sure to do from the paper that evening at latest he would see at once the full strength of whatever suspicions might tell against him now gilbert gildersleeves experience of criminal cases had abundantly shown him that a suspected person even when innocent always has one fixed desire in his headto gain time anyhow so waring would naturally wish to gain time at whatever cost there were evidently circumstances connecting waring with the crime there were none at all known to the outer world connecting the eminent lawyer therefore the eminent lawyer argued to himself as coolly almost as if it had been somebody elses case not his own he was conductingtherefore if an immediate means of escape is provided for waring waring will almost undoubtedly fall blindfold into it  not that he meant to let guy pay the penalty in the end for his own rash crime he was no hardened villain he had still a conscience if the worst came to the worst he said to himself he would tell all openly rather than let an innocent man suffer but like every one else in accordance with his own inference from his observation of others he too wanted to gain time anyhow and if he could but gain time by kindly helping guy to escape for the present why he would gladly do so an innocent man may be suspected for the moment gilbert gildersleeve thought to himself with a lawyers blind confidence but under our english law he need never at least fear that the suspicion will be permanent for lawyers repeat their own incredible commonplaces about the absolute perfection of english law so often that at last by a sort of retributive nemesis they really almost come to believe them  filled with these ideas then which rose naturally up in his mind without his taking the trouble as it were definitely to prove them gilbert gildersleeve hurried on through the crowded streets of plymouth town till he reached the office of the london and south african steamship company there he entered with an air of decided business and asked to take a passage to cape town at once by the steamer cetewayo due to call at plymouth outward bound that evening  he had looked up particulars of sailing in the papers at the hotel and asked now as if for himself for a large and roomy berth with all his usual selfpossession and boldness of manner the clerk gazed at him  carelessly that big and burly man with the great awkward hands raised no picture in his brain of the supposed murderer of mcgregor in the wood at mambury as that murderer had been described to him by the police that morning from a verbal portrait after the landlord of the talbot arms this colossal redfaced loudspoken person who required a large and roomy berth was certainly not the rather slim young man a little above the medium height with a dark moustache and a gentle musical voice whom the innkeeper had seen in an excited mood on the hunt for mcgregor along the slopes of dartmoor  what name the clerk asked briskly after gilbert gildersleeve had selected his stateroom from the plan with some show of interest as to its being well amidships and not too near the noise of the engines  billington the barrister answered without a glimmer of hesitation arthur standish billington if you want the full name thirtytwo will suit me very well i think and ill pay for it now go aboard when shes sighted i suppose nine oclock or thereabouts  the clerk made out the ticket in the name he was told yes nine oclock he said curtly all luggage to be on board the tender by eight sharp  youve left taking your passage very late mr billington  lucky weve a room thatll suit you im sure it isnt often we have berths left amidships like this on the day of sailing  gilbert gildersleeve pretended to look unconcerned once more no i suppose not he answered in a careless voice people generally know their own minds rather longer beforehand but id a telegram from the cape this morning that calls me over immediately  he folded up his ticket and put it in his pocket  then he pulled out a roll of notes and paid the amount in full the clerk gave him change promptly nobody could ever have suspected so solid a man as the great qc of any more serious crime or misdemeanour than shirking the second service on sunday evening there was a ponderous respectability about his portly build that defied detection the agents of all the steamboat companies had been warned that morning that the slim young man of the name of waring might try to escape at the last moment but who could ever suspect this colossal pile in the british churchwarden style of human architecture of aiding and abetting the escape of the young man waring from the pervasive myrmidons of english justice the very idea was absurd gilbert gildersleeves waistcoat was above suspicion  and when guy waring returned to his room at the duke of devonshire hotel half an hour later in  complete ignorance as yet of the bare fact of the murder he found on his table an envelope addressed in an unknown hand guy waring esq while below in the corner twice underlined were the importunate words immediate important  guy tore it open in wonder what on earth could this mean he trembled as he read could cyril have learnt all or had nevitt that doubledyed traitor now trebled his treachery by informing against the man whom he had driven into a crime guy couldnt imagine what it all could be driving at for there before his eyes in a round schoolboy hand very carefully formed without the faintest trace of anything like character were the words of this strange and startling message whose origin and intent were alike a mystery to him  guy waring a warrant is out for your  apprehension fly at once or things may be worse for you it is something always to gain time for the moment you will avoid suspicion public scandal trial enclosed find a ticket for cape town by the cetewayo tonight she sails at nine  luggage to be on board the tender by eight sharp if you go all can yet be satisfactorily cleared up if you stay the danger is great  and may be very serious ticket is taken and paid for in the name of arthur standish billington settle your account at the hotel in that name and go  yours in frantic haste  a sincere wellwisher  guy gazed at the strange missive long and dubiously  a warrant is out he scarcely knew what to do  oh for time time time had cyril sent this or was it some final device of that fiend nevitt       chapter xxvi  a chance meeting      there wasnt much time left however for guy to make up his mind in he must decide at once  should he accept this mysterious warning or not pure fate decided it as he hesitated he heard a boy crying in the street it was the specialeditionfiend calling his evening paper the words the boy said guy didnt altogether catch  but the last sentence of all fell on his ear distinctly he started in horror it was an awful sound warrant issued today for the  apprehension of waring  then the letter whoever wrote it was not all a lie  the forgery was out cyril or the bankers had learnt the whole truth he was to be arrested today as a common felon all the world knew his shame he hid his face in his hands come what might he must accept the mysterious warning now he would take the ticket and go off to south africa  in a moment a whole policy had arisen like a cloud and framed itself in his mind he was a forger he knew and by this time cyril too most probably knew it but he had the three thousand pounds safe and sound in his pocket and those at least he could send back to cyril with them he could send a cheque on his own banker for three thousand more  not that there were funds there at present to meet the demand but if the unknown benefactor should pay in the six thousand he promised within the next few weeks then cyril could repay himself from that hypothetical fortune  on the other hand guy didnt disguise from himself the strong probability that the unknown  benefactor might now refuse to pay in the six thousand in that case  guy said to himself with a groan he would take to the diamond fields and never rest day or night in his selfimposed task till he had made enough to repay cyril in full the missing three thousand and to make up the other three thousand he still owed the creditors of the rio negro company  after which he would return and give himself up like a man to stand his trial voluntarily for the crime he had committed  it was a young mans scheme very fond and youthful  but with the full confidence of his age he  proceeded at once to put it in practice  indeed  now he came to think upon it  he fancied to himself he saw something like a solution of the mystery in the presence of the great qc at plymouth that morning  cyril had found out all and had determined to save him the bankers had found out all and had  determined to prosecute they had consulted gildersleeve  gildersleeve had come down on a holiday trip and run up against him at plymouth by pure accident  indeed guy remembered now that the great qc  looked not a little surprised and excited at meeting him clearly gildersleeve had communicated with the police at once  hence the issue of the warrant  at the same time the writer of the letter whoever he might beand guy now believed he was sent down by cyril or in cyrils interestthe writer had found out the facts betimes and had taken a passage for him in the name of billington  uncertain as he felt about the minor details guy was sure this interpretation must be right in the main for elmas sakefor the honour of the familycyril wished him for the present to  disappear cyrils wish was sacred he would go to south africa  the great point was now to avoid meeting gildersleeve  before the ship sailed so he would pay his bill quietly put his things in his portmanteau stop in his room till dusk and then drive off in a close cab to the landingstage  but first of all he must send the three thousand direct to cyril  he sat down in a fit of profound penitence and penned a heartbroken letter of confession to his brother  it was vague of course such letters are always vague no man even in confessing likes to allude in plain terms to the exact nature of the crime he has committed and besides guy took it for granted that cyril knew all about the main features of the case already he didnt ask his brother to forgive him he said he didnt try to explain for explanation would be impossible  how he came to do it he had no idea himself  a sudden suggestiona strange unaccountable  impulsea minute or two of indecisionand almost before he knew it under the spell of that strange eye the thing was done irretrievably done for ever  the best he could offer now was to express his profound and undying regret at the wrong he had committed and by which he had never profited himself a single farthing  nevitt had deceived him with incredible meanness  he could never have believed any man would act as nevitt had acted nevitt had stolen three thousand pounds of the sum and applied them to paying off his own debt to the rio negro creditors the remaining three thousand sent herewith guy had recovered almost by a miracle from that false creatures grasp and he returned them now in proof of the fact in montague nevitts own pocketbook which cyril would no doubt immediately recognise  for himself he meant to leave england at once at least for the present  where he was going he wouldnt as yet let cyril know he hoped in a new country to recover his honour and rehabilitate his name meanwhile it was mainly for cyrils sake that he fledand for one other persons tooto avoid a scandal he hoped cyril would be happy with the woman of his choice for it was to insure their joint happiness that he was accepting the offer of escape so unexpectedly tendered him  he sealed up the letterthat incriminating letter that might mean so much more than he ever put into itand took it out to the post with the three thousand pounds and montague nevitts pocketbook in a separate packet proud kelmscott as he was by birth and nature he slunk through the streets like a guilty man fancying all eyes were fixed suspiciously upon him  then he returned to the hotel in a burning heat went into the smoking room on purpose like an honest man and rang the bell for the servant boldly  bring my bill please he said to the waiter who answered it i go at seven oclock  yes sir the waiter replied with official promptitude  directly sir what number  i forget the number guy answered with a beating heart but the names billington  yes sir the waiter responded once more in the selfsame unvaried tone and went off to the office  guy waited in profound suspense half expecting the waiter to come back for the number again but to his immense surprise and mystification the fellow didnt  instead of that he returned some minutes later all respectful attention bringing the bill on a salver duly headed and lettered mr billington number 40 in unspeakable trepidation guy paid it and walked away  never before in all his life had he been surrounded so close on every side by a thick hedge of impenetrable and inexplicable mystery  then a new terror seized him was he running his head into a noose blindfold who was the billington he was thus made to personate and who must really be staying at the very same time in the duke of devonshire was this just another of nevitts wily tricks had he induced his victim to accept without question the name and character of some still more open criminal  there was no time now however to drawback or to hesitate the die was cast he must stand by its arbitrament he had decided to go and on that hasty decision had acted in a way that was practically irrevocable  he put his things together with trembling hands called a cab by the porter and drove off alone in a turmoil of doubt to the landingstage in the harbour  policemen not a few were standing about on the pier and in the streets as he drove past openly but in spite of the fact that a warrant had been issued for his apprehension none of them took the slightest apparent notice of him he wondered much at this but there was really no just cause for wonder for at least an hour earlier the police had ceased to look out any longer for nevitts murderer and the reason they had done so was simply this a telegram had come down from scotland yard in the most positive terms waring arrested this afternoon at dover the murdered man mcgregor is now certainly known to be montague nevitt a bank clerk in london endeavour to trace warings line of retreat from mambury to dover by inquiry of the railway officials we are sure of our man photographs will be forwarded you by post immediately  and as a matter of fact at the very moment when guy was driving down to the tender in order to escape from an imaginary charge of forgery his brother cyril to his own immense astonishment was being conveyed from dover pier to tavistock under close police escort on a warrant charging him with the wilful murder of montague nevitt two days before at mambury in devon  if guy had only known that he would never have fled but he didnt know it how could he indeed in his turmoil and hurry he didnt even know montague nevitt was dead he had been too busy that day to look at the papers and the few facts he knew from the boys crying in the street he naturally misinterpreted by the light of his own fears and personal dangers he thought he was wanted for the yet undiscovered forgery not for the murder of which he was wholly ignorant  nevertheless we can never in this world entirely escape our own personality as guy went on board believing himself to have left his identity on shore he heard somebody in a voice that he fancied he knew ask a newsboy on the tender for an evening paper  guy was the only passenger who embarked at plymouth and this person unseen was the newsboys one customer  guy couldnt discover who he was at the moment for the call for a paper came from the upper deck he only heard the voice and wasnt certain at first that he recognised even that any more than in a vague and indeterminate reminiscence no doubt the sense of guilt made him preternaturally suspicious but he began to fear that somebody might possibly recognise him and he had bought the paper with news about the warrant that was bad but twas too late to draw back again now the tender lay alongside a while discharging her mails and then cast loose to go the cetewayos screw began to move through the water  with a dim sense of horror guy knew they were off  he was well under way for far distant south africa  but he did not know or reflect that while he ploughed his path on over that trackless sea day after day without news from england there would be ample time for cyril to be tried and found guilty and perhaps hanged as well for the crime that neither of them had really committed  the great ship steamed out cutting the waves with her prow and left the harbour lights far far behind her guy stood on deck and watched them disappearing  with very mingled feelings everything had been so hurried he hardly knew himself as yet how his flight affected all the active and passive characters in this painful drama he only knew he was irrevocably committed to the voyage now there would be no chance of turning till they reached cape town or at the very least madeira  he stood on deck and looked back somebody else in an ulster stood not far off near a light by the saloon conversing with an officer guy recognised at once the voice of the man who had asked in the harbour for an evening paper at that moment a steward came up as he stood there on the lookout for the new passenger  theyd just taken in youre in thirtytwo sir i think he said and your name  is billington guy answered with a faint tremor of shame at the continued falsehood  the man who had bought the paper turned round sharply and stared at him their eyes met in one quick flash of unexpected recognition guy started in horror this was an awful meeting he had seen the man but once before in his life yet he knew him at a glance it was granville kelmscott  for a minute or two they stood and stared at one another blankly those unacknowledged halfbrothers of whom one now knew while the other still ignored the real relationship that existed between them then granville kelmscott turned away without one word of greeting guy trembled in his shame he knew he was discovered but before his very eyes granville took the paper he had been reading by that uncertain light and raising it high in his hand flung it over into the sea with spasmodic energy it was the special edition containing the account of the man mcgregors death and guy warings supposed connection  with the murder granville kelmscott indeed couldnt bring himself to denounce his own halfbrother he stared at him coldly for a second with a horrified face  then he said in a very low and distant voice i know your identity mr billington with a profoundly sarcastic accent on the assumed name and i will not betray it i know your secret too and i will keep that inviolate only during the rest of this voyage do me the honour i beg of you not to recognise me or speak to me in any way at any time  guy slunk away in silence to his own cabin  never before in his life had he known such shame  he felt that his punishment was indeed too heavy for him       chapter xxvii  something to their advantage      at tilgate and chetwood next morning two distinguished  households were thrown into confusion by the news in the papers to colonel kelmscott and to elma clifford alike that news came with crushing force and horror a murder said the times had been committed in devonshire in a romantic dell on the skirts of dartmoor no element of dramatic interest was wanting to the case persons place and time were all equally remarkable the victim of the outrage was mr montague nevitt confidential clerk to messrs  drummond coutts and barclay the wellknown bankers and himself a familiar figure in musical society in london the murderer was presumably a young journalist mr guy waring not unknown himself  in musical circles and brother of that rising landscape  painter mr cyril waring whose pictures of wild life in forest scenery had lately attracted considerable attention at the academy and the grosvenor  mr guy waring had been arrested the day before on the pier at dover where he had just arrived by the ostend packet it was supposed by the police that he had hastily crossed the channel from plymouth to cherbourg soon after the murder to escape detection and after journeying by crosscountry routes through france and belgium had returned via ostend to the shores of england it was a triumphant vindication of our much maligned detective system that within a few hours after the discovery of the body on dartmoor  the supposed criminal should have been recognised  arrested and detained among a thousand others in a busy port at the very opposite extremity of southern england  colonel kelmscott that day was strangely touched even before he took up his morning paper a letter from granville posted at plymouth had just reached him by the early mail to tell him that the only son he had ever really loved or cared for on earth had sailed the day before a disinherited outcast to seek his fortune in the wild wastes of africa how he could break the news to lady emily he couldnt imagine the colonel twisting his white moustache with a quivering hand on his tremulous lip hardly dared to realize what their future would seem like  and thenhe turned to the paper and saw to his horror this awful tale of a coldblooded and cowardly murder committed on a friend by one who however little he might choose to acknowledge it was after all his own eldest son a kelmscott of tilgate as much as granville himself in lawful wedlock duly begotten  the proud but broken man gazed at the deadly announcement in blank amaze and agony his nemesis had come guy waring was his own sonand guy waring was a murderer  he tried to argue with himself at first that this tragic result in some strange way justified him after the event for his own long neglect of his parental responsibilities  the young man was no true kelmscott at heart he was sure or such an act as that would have revolted and appalled him he was no true son in reality his order disowned him base blood flowed in his veins and made crimes like these conceivable  i was right after all the colonel thought not to acknowledge these half lowborn lads as the heirs of tilgate bad blood will out in the endand this is the result of it  and then with sudden revulsion he thought once moregod help him how could he say such things in his heart even now of her his pure trustful lucy  she was better than him in her soul he knewten thousand times better if bad blood came in anywhere it came in from himself not from that simplehearted innocent little countrybred angel  and perhaps if hed treated these lads as he ought and brought them up to their own and made them kelmscotts indeed instead of nameless adventurers they might never have fallen into such abysses of  turpitude but he had let them grow up in ignorance of their own origin with the vague stain of a possible illegitimacy hanging over their heads and what wonder if they forgot in the end how noblesse oblige and sank at last into foul depths of vice and criminality  as he read on his head swam with the cumulative evidence of that deliberately planned and cruelly executed yet brutal murder the details of the crime gave him a sickening sense of loathing and incredulity  impossible that his own son could have schemed and carried out so vile an attack upon a helpless person who had once been his nearest and dearest companion  and yet the account in the paper gave him no alternative but to believe it nevitt and guy waring had been inseparable friends they had dined together supped together played duets in their own rooms gone out to the same parties belonged to the same club in all things been closer than even the two twin brothers  some quarrel seemed to have arisen about a matter of speculations in which both had suffered they separated at onceseparated in anger nevitt went down to devonshire by himself for his holiday then waring followed him without any pretence at concealment inquired for him at the village inn with expressions of deadly hate tracked him to a lonely place in the adjacent wood choked him apparently with some form of garotte or twisted ropefor the injuries seemed greater than even the most powerful man could possibly inflict with the hands alone and hid the body of his murdered friend at last in a mossy dell by the bank of the streamlet nor was that all for with callous effrontery he had returned to the inn still inquiring after his victim and had gone off next morning early with a lie on his lips pretending even then to nurse his undying wrath and to be bent on following up with coarse threats of revenge his stark and silent enemy  so far the times but to colonel kelmscott reading in between the lines as he went there was more in it than even that he saw though dimly some hint of a motive for it was at mambury that all these things had taken place and it was at mambury that the secret of guy warings descent lay buried as he thought in the parish registers what it all meant colonel kelmscott couldnt indeed wholly understand but many things he knew which the writer of the account in the times knew not he knew that nevitt was a clerk in the bank where he himself kept his account and to which he had given orders to pay in the six thousand to cyrils credit at cyrils bankers  he knew therefore that nevitt might thus have been led to suspect the real truth of the case as to the two socalled warings he knew that cyril had just received the six thousand trying to put these facts together and understand their meaning he utterly failed but this much at least was clear to him he thoughtthe reason for the murder was something connected with a search for the entry of his own clandestine marriage  he looked down at the paper again great heavens what was this it is rumoured that a further inducement to the crime may perhaps be sought in the fact that the deceased gentleman had a large sum of money in his possession in bank of england notes at the time of his death these notes he carried in a pocketbook about his person where they were seen by the landlord of the talbot arms at mambury the night before the supposed murder when the body was discovered by the side of the brook two days later the notes were gone the pockets were carefully searched by order of the police but no trace of the missing money could be discovered it is now conjectured that mr guy waring who is known to have lost heavily in the rio negro diamond mines may have committed the crime from purely pecuniary motives in order to release himself from his considerable and very pressing financial embarrassments  the paper dropped from colonel kelmscotts hands  his eyes ceased to see his arm fell rigid this last horrible suggestion proved too much for him to bear  he shrank from it like poison that a son of his own unacknowledged or not should be a criminala murdererwas terrible enough but that he should even be suspected of having committed murder for such base and vulgar motives as mere thirst of gain was more than the blood of the kelmscotts could put up with the unhappy father had said to himself in his agony at first that if guy really killed that prying bank clerk at all it was no doubt in defence of his mothers honour that was a reason a kelmscott could understand that if not an excuse was at least a palliation but to be told he had killed him for a roll of banknotesoh horrible incredible his reason drew back at it that was a depth to which the kelmscott idiosyncrasy could never descend the colonel in his horror refused to believe it  he put his hands up feebly to his throbbing brow  this was a ghastly ideaa ghastly accusation the man called waring had dragged the honour of the kelmscotts through the mud of the street there was but one comfort left he never bore that unsullied name nobody would know he was a kelmscott of tilgate  the colonel rose from his seat and staggered across the floor halfway to the door he reeled and stopped short the veins of his forehead were black and swollen he had the same strange feeling in his head as he experienced on the day when granville leftonly a hundred times worse the two halves of his brain were opening and shutting his temples seemed too full he fancied there was something wrong with his forehead somewhere he reeled once more like a drunken man then he clutched at a chair and sat down his brain was flooded  he collapsed all at once mumbling to himself some inarticulate gibberish half an hour later the servants came in and found him he was seated in his chair still doddering feebly the house was roused a doctor was summoned and the colonel put to bed  lady emily watched him with devoted care but it was all in vain the doctor shook his head the moment he examined him a paralytic stroke he said gravely and a very serious one he seems to have had a slighter attack some time since and to have wholly neglected it a great bloodvessel in the brain must have given way with a rush i can hold out no hope he wont live till morning  and indeed as it turned out about ten that night the colonels loud and stentorious breathing began to fail slowly the intervals grew longer and longer between each recurrent gasp and life died away at last in imperceptible struggles  by two in the morning kelmscott of tilgate lay dead on his bed and his two unacknowledged and unrecognised sons were the masters of his property  but one of them was at that moment being tossed about wildly on the waves of biscay and the other was locked up on a charge of murder in the county jail at tavistock in devonshire  meanwhile at the other house at chetwood where these tidings were being read with almost equal interest elma clifford laid down the paper on the table with a very pale face and looked at her mother mrs clifford all solicitous watchfulness for the effect on elma looked in return with searching eyes at her daughter then elma opened her lips like one who talks in her sleep and spoke out twice in two short disconnected sentences  the first time she said simply he didnt do it i know and the second time with all the intensity of her emotional nature mother mother whatever turns up i must go there  he will be there mrs clifford interposed after a painful pause  and elma answered dreamily with her great eyes far away yes of course i know he will and i must be there too to see how far if at all i can help them  yes darling her mother replied stroking her daughters hair with a caressing hand she knew that when elma spoke in a tone like that no power on earth could possibly restrain her       chapter xxviii  mistaken identity      to cyril waring himself the arrest at dover came as an immense surprise rather a surprise indeed than a shock just at first for he could only treat it as a mistaken identity the man the police wanted was guy not himself and that guy should have done it was clearly incredible  as he landed from the ostend packet recalled to england unexpectedly by the announcement that the rio negro diamond mines had gone with a crashand no doubt involved guy in the common ruincyril was astonished to find himself greeted on the admiralty pier by a policeman who tapped him on the shoulder with the casual remark i think your names waring  cyril answered at once yes my names waring  it didnt occur to him at the moment that the man meant to arrest him  then youre wanted the minion of authority answered seizing his arm rather gruffly weve got a warrant out today against you my friend youd better come along with me quietly to the station  a warrant cyril repeated amazed shaking off the mans hand there must be some mistake somewhere  the policeman smiled oh yes he answered briskly with some humour in his tone theres always a mistake of course in all these arrests you never get a hold of the right man just at first its sure to be a case of his twin brother but there aint no mistake this time dont you fear i knowed you at once when i see you by your photograph though we were looking out for you to be sure going the other way but its you all right there aint a doubt about that warrant in the name of guy waring gentleman wanted for the wilful murder of a man unknown said to be one mcgregor alias montague nevitt on the 27th instant at mambury in devonshire  cyril gave a sudden start at the conjunction of names which naturally increased his captors suspicions  but there is a mistake though he said angrily even on your own showing youve got the wrong man its not i that am wanted my names cyril waring and guy is my brothers though guy cant have murdered mr nevitt either if it comes to that they were most intimate friends however thats neither here nor there im cyril not guy im not your prisoner  oh yes you are though the officer answered holding his arm very tight and calling mutely for assistance by a glance at the other policemen ive got your photograph in my pocket right enough heres the man weve orders to arrest at once i  suppose you wont deny now thats your living image  cyril glanced at the photograph with another start of surprise sure enough it was guy his last new cabinet portrait the police must be acting under some gross misapprehension  that mans my brother he said confidently brushing the photograph aside i cant understand it at all this is extremely odd its impossible my brother can even be suspected of committing murder  the policeman smiled cynically well it aint impossible your brothers brother can be suspected anyhow he said with a quiet air of superior knowledge  the good old double tricks been tried on once too often if i was you i wouldnt say too much  whatever you say may be used as evidence at the trial against you you just come along quietly to the station with metake his other arm jim thats right no violence please prisonerand well pretty soon find out whether youre the man weve got orders to arrest or his twin brother and he winked at his ally he was proud of having effected the catch of the season  but i am his twin brother cyril said half struggling still to release himself you cant take me up on that warrant i tell you its not my name  im not the man youve orders to look for  oh thats all right the constable answered as before with an incredulous smile dont you go trying to obstruct the police in the exercise of their duty if i cant take you up on the warrant as it stands well anyhow i can arrest you on suspicion all the same for looking so precious like the photograph of the man as is wanted twin brothers aint got any call dont you know to sit turn about for one anothers photographs it hinders the administration of justice thats where it is and remember whatever you choose to say may be used as evidence at the trial against you  thus adjured cyril yielded at last to force majeure and walked arm in arm between the two policemen followed by a large and admiring crowd to the nearest station  but the matter was far less easily arranged than at first imagined an innocent man who knows his own innocence taken up in mistake for a brother whom he believes to be equally incapable of the crime with which he is charged naturally expects to find no difficulty at all in proving his identity and escaping from custody on a false charge of murder but the result of a hasty examination at the station soon effectually removed this little delusion his own admission that the photograph was a portrait of guy and his resemblance to it in every leading particular made the authorities decide on the first blush of the thing this was really the man scotland yard was in search of he was trying to escape them on the ridiculous pretext that he was in point of fact his own twin brother the inspector declined to let him go for the night he wasnt going to repeat the mistake that was made in the lefroy case he said very decidedly he would send the suspected person under escort to tavistock  so to tavistock cyril went uncertain as yet what all this could mean and ignorant of the crime with which he was charged if indeed any crime had been really committed all the way down an endless string of questions suggested themselves one by one to his excited mind was nevitt really dead and if so who had killed him was it suicide to escape from the monetary embarrassments brought about by the failure of the rio negro diamond mines or was it accident or mischance or was it in fact a murder  and in any casestrangest of allwhere was guy  why didnt guy come forward and court inquiry for as yet of course cyril hadnt received his brothers letter with the incriminating pocketbook and the three thousand pounds nor indeed for several days after as things turned out was there even a possibility of his ever receiving it  next morning however when cyril was examined before the tavistock magistrates he began to realize the whole strength of the case against him the proceedings were purely formal as the lawyers said yet they were quite enough to make cyrils cheek turn pale with horror one witness after another came forward and swore to him the stationmaster at mambury gave evidence that he had made inquiries on the platform after nevitt by name the innkeeper deposed as to his excited behaviour when he called at the talbot arms and his recognition of mcgregor as the person he was in search of the boy of whom guy had inquired at the gate unhesitatingly set down the  conversation to cyril none of them had the faintest doubt in his own mindeach sworethat the prisoner before the magistrates was the selfsame person who went over to mambury on that fatal day and who followed montague nevitt down the path by the river  as cyril listened one terrible fact dawned clearer and clearer upon his brain every fragment of evidence they piled up against himself made the case against guy look blacker and blacker  the magistrates accepted the proofs thus tendered and cyril as yet unassisted by professional advice was remanded accordingly till next morning  just as he was about to leave the sessions house in a tumult of horror fear and suspense somebody close by tapped him on the shoulder gravely after a few whispered words with the chairman and the magistrates  cyril turned round and saw a burly man with very large hands whom he remembered to have had pointed out to him in london and strange to say by montague nevitt himselfas the eminent qc mr gilbert gildersleeve  the great advocate was pale but very sincere and earnest cyril noticed his manner was completely changed it was clear some overmastering idea possessed  his soul  mr waring he said looking him full in the face i see youre unrepresented this is a case in which i take a very deep interest my conducts unprofessional i knowpointblank against all our recognised etiquettebut perhaps youll excuse it  will you allow me to undertake your defence in this matter  cyril turned round to him with truly heartfelt thanks it was a great relief to him alone and in doubt and much wondering about guy to hear a friendly word from whatever quarter  and cyril knew he was safe in gilbert gildersleeves hands the greatest criminal lawyer of the day in england might surely be trusted to set right such a mere little error of mistaken identity though for guywhenever guy gave himself up to the policecyril felt the position was far more dangerous he couldnt believe indeed that guy was guilty yet the circumstances he could no longer conceal from himself looked terribly black against him  youre too good he cried taking the lawyers hand in his with very fervent gratitude how can i thank you enough im deeply obliged to you  not at all gilbert gildersleeve answered with very blanched lips he was ashamed of his duplicity  youve nothing to thank me for this case is a simple one and id like to see you out of it ive met your brother and the moment i saw you i knew you werent he though youre very like him i should know you two apart wherever i saw you  thats curious cyril cried for very few people know us from one another except the most intimate friends  the qc looked at him with a very penetrating glance i had occasion to see your brother not long since he answered slowly and his features and expression fastened themselves indelibly on my minds eye i should know you from him at a glance this case as you say is one of mistaken identity thats just why im so anxious to help you well through it  and indeed gilbert gildersleeve profoundly agitated as he was saw in the accident a marvellous chance for himself to secure a diversion of police attention from the real murderer the fact was he had passed twentyfour hours of supreme misery as soon as he learned from common report that the murderer was caught and was being brought to tavistock he took it for granted at first that guy hadnt gone to africa at all but had left by rail for the east and been arrested elsewhere that belief filled him full of excruciating terrors for gilbert gildersleeve accidental manslaughterer as he was was not by any means a depraved or wholly heartless person big blustering and gruff he was yet in essence an honest kindhearted unemotional englishman his one desire now was to save his wife and daughter from further misery and if he could only save them he was ready to sacrifice for the moment to a certain extent guy warings reputation  but if guy waring himself had stood before him in the dock he must have stepped forward to confess  the strain would have been too great for him he couldnt have allowed an innocent man to be hanged in his place come what might in that case he must let his wife and daughter go and save the innocent by acknowledging himself guilty so when he looked at the prisoner it gave him a shock of joy to see that fortune had once more befriended him thank heaven thank heaven it wasnt the man they wanted at all  this was the other brother of the twocyril the painter not guy the journalist  in a moment the acute and experienced criminal hand recognised that this chance told unconsciously in his own favour like every other suspected person he wanted time and time would be taken up in proving an alibi for cyril as well as showing by concurrent proof that he was not his brother meanwhile suspicion would fix itself still more firmly upon guy whose flight would give colour to the charges brought against him by the authorities  so the great qc determined to take up cyril warings case as a labour of love and didnt doubt he would succeed in finally proving it       chapter xxix  womans intuition      next morning cyril waring appeared once more in the sessions house for the preliminary investigation on the charge of murder as he entered a momentary hush pervaded the room then suddenly from a seat beneath a womans voice burst forth quite low yet loud enough to be heard by all the magistrates on the bench  why mother it said in a very tremulous tone it isnt guy himself at all dont you see its cyril  the words were so involuntarily spoken and in such hushed awe and amaze that even the magistrates themselves  hard devonshire squires didnt turn their heads to rebuke the speaker as for cyril he had no need to look towards a blushing face in the body of the court to know that the voice was elma cliffords  she sat there looking lovelier than he had ever before seen her cyrils glance caught hers they didnt need to speak he saw at once in her eye that elma at least knew instinctively he was innocent  next moment gilbert gildersleeve stood up to state his defence and gazed at her steadily as he rose in his place elmas eye met his gilbert gildersleeves fell he didnt know why but in that second of time the great blustering man felt certain in his heart that elma clifford suspected him  elma clifford for her part knew still more than that  with the swift intuition she inherited from her long line of oriental ancestry she said to herself at once in categorical terms it was that man that did it i know it was he and he sees i know it and he knows im right and hes afraid of me accordingly but an intuition however valuable to its possessor is not yet admitted as evidence in english courts elma also knew it was no use in the world for her to get up in her place and say so openly  the great qc put his case in a nutshell our client he contended was not the man against whom the warrant in this case had been duly issued he was not the man named guy waring he was not the man whom the witnesses deposed to having seen at mambury he was not the man who had loitered with evil intent around the skirts of dartmoor in short the great qc observed with demonstrative eyeglass it was a very clear case of mistaken identity it would take them time no doubt to prove the conclusive alibi they intended to establish for the gentleman now charged before them he would hope to show hereafter was mr cyril waring the distinguished painter twin brother to mr guy waring the journalist against whom warrant was issued and he was away in belgium during the whole precise time when mr guy waringas to whose guilt or innocence he would make no definite assertionwas prowling round dartmoor on the trail of mcgregor alias montague nevitt therefore  they would consent to an indefinite remand till evidence to that effect was duly forthcoming meanwhile and  here gilbert gildersleeves eyes fell upon elma once more with a quiet forensic smilehe would call one witness on the spur of the moment whom he hadnt thought till that very morning of calling but whom the magistrates would allow to be a very  important onea lady from chetwoodmiss elma clifford  elma taken aback stood up in the box and gave her evidence timidly it amounted to no more than the simple fact that the person before the magistrates was cyril not guy that the two brothers were extremely like but that she had reason to know them easily apart having been associated in a most painful accident in a tunnel with the brother the present mr cyril waring  what she said gave only a presumption of mistaken identity but didnt at all invalidate the positive identification  of all the people who had seen the supposed murderer however from gilbert gildersleeves point of view this delay was doubly valuable in the first place it gave him time to prove his alibi for cyril and bring witnesses from belgium and in the second place it succeeded in still further fastening public suspicion on guy and narrowing the question for the police to the simple issue whether or not they had really caught the brother who was seen at mambury on the day of the murder  the laws delays were as marvellous as is their wont  it was a full fortnight before the barrister was able to prove his point by bringing over witnesses at considerable expense from belgium and elsewhere and by the aid of a few intimate friends in london who could speak with certainty as to the difference between the two brothers at the end of a fortnight however he did sufficiently prove it by tracing cyril in detail from england to the ardennes and back again to dover as well as by showing exactly how guy had been employed in london and elsewhere on every day or night of the intervening period the magistrates at last released cyril convinced by his arguments and on the very same day the coroners inquest on montague nevitts body after adjourning time upon time to await the clearing up of this initial difficulty returned a verdict of wilful murder against guy waring  that evening in town the most completely mystified person of all was a certain cashier of the london and west county bank in lombard street who read in his st jamess this complete proof that cyril had been in belgium through all those days when he himself distinctly remembered cashing over the counter for him a cheque for no less a sum than six thousand pounds to self or bearer had the brothers then been deliberately and nefariously engaged in a deeplaid schemethe cashier asked himself much puzzledto confuse one anothers identity with great care beforehand with a distinct view to the projected murder  for as yet of course nobody on earth except guy waring himself on the waters of biscay knew or suspected anything at all about the forgery  elma clifford and her mother meanwhile had stopped on at tavistock till cyril was released from his close confinement elma never meant to marry him of courseto that prime determination she still remained firm as a rock under all conditionsbut in such straits as those why naturally she couldnt bear to be far away from him so she remained at tavistock quietly till the inquiry was over  on the evening of his release elma met him at the hotel her mother had gone out on purpose to leave them alone elma took cyrils hand in hers with a profound trembling she felt the moment for reserve had long gone past  cyril she said boldly calling him by his christian name because she could call him only as she always thought of him i knew from the first you didnt do it and just because i know you didnt i know guy didnt either though everything looks now so very black against him i can trust you and i can trust him all through ive never had a doubt one moment of either of you  cyril held her hand in his and raised it tenderly to his lips elma looked at him half surprised only her hand how strange of him cyril read the unspoken thought as she would have read it herself and answered quickly never elma now till guy has cleared himself of this deadly accusation i couldnt bear to ask you to accept a man who every one else would call a murderers brother  elma gazed at him steadfastly tears stood in her eyes her voice trembled but she was very firm  we must clear you and him of this dreadful charge she said slowly i know we must do that cyril guy didnt kill him guys wholly incapable of it but where is guy now thats what i dont understand we must clear that all up though even when its cleared up i can only love you as i told you that day at chetwoodand i mean it stillwhatever comes to us two i can never never marry you  not even if i clear this all up cyril asked with a wistful look  not even if you clear this all up elma answered seriously the difficultys on my side dont you see not on yours at all so far as youre concerned cyril clear this up or leave it just where it is id marry you tomorrow id marry you at once and proud to do it if only to show the world openly i trust you both i half faltered just once as you stood there in court whether i wouldnt say yes to you for nothing else but thatto let everybody see how implicitly i trusted you  but i couldnt allow it cyril answered all aglow  as things stand now elma our positions are reversed  while this cloud still hangs so black over guy i couldnt find it in my conscience to ask you to marry me  he gazed at her steadily they were both too profoundly  stirred for tears or emotions a quiet despair gleamed in the eyes of each cyril could never marry her till he had cleared up this mystery elma could never marry him even if it were all cleared up with that terrible taint of madness as she thought it hanging  threateningly for ever over her and her family  she paused for a minute or two with her hand locked in his then she said once more very low no guy didnt do it but why did he run away  that baffles me quite thats the one point of it all that makes it so strange and so terribly mysterious  elma cyril answered with a cold thrill i believe in guy i think i know myself and i think i know him well enough to say that such a thing as murder is impossible for either of us hes weak at times i admit and his will was powerless before the magnetic force of montague nevitts but when i try to face that inscrutable mystery of why if hes innocent  he has run away from this charge i confess my faith begins to falter and tremble he must have seen it in the papers he must have seen i was accused  what can he mean by leaving me to bear it in his stead without ever coming forward to help me fairly out of it  elma looked up at him with another of her sudden flashes of superb intuition he cant have seen it in the papers she said that gives us some clue if hed seen it he must have come forward to help you  but cyril my faith never falters at all and i tell you why not only do i know guy didnt do it but i know who did it the man who murdered montague nevitt iswhy shouldnt i tell youmr gilbert gildersleeve  cyril started back astonished oh elma why do you think so he cried in amazement what possible reason can you have for saying so  none elma answered with a calmly resigned air  i only know it i know it from his eyes i looked in them once and read it like a book but of course thats nothing what we must do now is to try and find out the facts i looked in his eyes and i saw it at a glance and i saw he saw it he knows ive discovered him  cyril half drew away from her with a faint sense of alarm elma he said slowly i believe in guy but really and truly i cant quite believe that you make your intuition tell you far too much in your natural anxiety to screen my brother youve fixed the guilt without proof upon another innocent man im sure mr gildersleeves as incapable as guy of any such action  and im sure of it too elma answered with the instinctive certainty of feminine conviction but still i know for all that he did it perhaps it was all done in a moment of haste but at least he did it  and nothing on earth that anybody could say will ever make me believe he didnt  when mrs clifford came back to the hotel an hour later she scanned her daughters face with a keen glance of inquiry  well he says he wont ask you again she murmured  laying elmas head on her shoulder till this case is cleared up and guy is proved innocent  yes elma answered nestling close and looking red as a rose he knows very well guy didnt do it but he wants all the rest of the world to acknowledge it also  and you know who did it mrs clifford said with a tentative air  yes mother do you  of course i do darling but itll never be proved against him you may be sure i saw it at a glance  its mr gilbert gildersleeve       chapter xxx  fresh discoveries      as cyril drove home from waterloo next day to his lonely rooms in staple inn holborn he turned aside with his cab for a few minutes to make a passing call at the bank in lombard street he was short of ready money and wanted to cash a cheque for fifty pounds for expenses incurred in his defence at tavistock  the cashier stared at him hard then without consulting anybody he said in a somewhat embarrassed tone i dont know whether youre aware of it mr  waring but this overdraws your current account we havent fifty pounds on our books to your credit  he was well posted on the subject in fact for only that morning he had hunted up cyrils balance in the ledger at his side for the gratification of his own pure personal curiosity  cyril stared at him in astonishment in this age of surprises one more surprise was thus suddenly sprung upon him his first impulse was to exclaim in a very amazed voice why ive six thousand odd pounds to my credit surely but he checked himself in time with a violent effort how could he tell what strange things might have happened in his absence if the money was gone and nevitt was murdered and guy in hiding who could say what fresh complications might not still be in store for him so he merely answered with a strenuous endeavour to suppress his agitation will you kindly let me have my balancesheet if you please iuri thought id more money than that still left with you  the cashier brought out a big book and a bundle of cheques which he handed to cyril with a face of profound  interest to him too this little drama was pregnant with mystery and personal implications cyril turned the vouchers over one by one with close attention recognising the signature and occasion of each till he arrived at last at a big cheque which staggered him sadly for a moment he took it up in his hands and examined it in the light pay self or bearer six thousand pounds l6000 cyril waring  oh horrible horrible this then was the secret of guys sudden disappearance  he didnt cry aloud he didnt say a word he looked at the thing hard and knew in a moment exactly what had happened guy had forged that cheque it was guys natural hand written forward like cyrils own instead of backward as usual and no one but himself could possibly have told it from his own true signature but cyril knew it at once for guys by one infallible signa tiny sign that might escape the veriest expertsome faint hesitation about the tail of the capital c which was shorter in guys hand than cyril ever made it and which guy had therefore  deliberately lengthened by an effort or an afterthought to complete the imitation  you cashed that cheque yourself sir over the counter you remember the cashier said quietly on the date it was drawn on  cyril never altered a muscle of his rigid face  ah quite so he answered in a very dry voice not daring to contradict the man he knew just what had happened guy must have come to get the money himself and the cashier must have mistaken him for the proper owner of the purloined six thousand they were so very much alike nobody ever distinguished them  and that was one of the days i think when you proved the alibi in belgium before the devonshire magistrates at tavistock yesterday the clerk went on with a searching glance cyril started this time he saw in a second the new danger thus sprung upon him  if the cashier chose to press the matter home to the hilt he must necessarily arrive at one or other of two results either the alibi would break down altogether or it would be perfectly clear that guy had committed a forgery  so it seems he answered looking his keen interlocutor straight in the eyes so it seems i should say by the date on the face of it  but the cashier did not care to press the matter home any further and for a very good reason it was none of his business to suggest the idea of a forgery after a cheque had been presented and duly cashed if the customer to whose account it was debited in course chose voluntarily to accept the responsibility of honouring it the objection should come first from the customers side if he didnt care to press it then neither did the cashier why should he indeed why saddle his firm with six thousand pounds loss he would only get himself into trouble for having failed to observe the discrepancy in the signatures and the difference between the brothers that after all is what a cashier is for if he doesnt fulfil those first duties of his post why what on earth can be the good of him to anybody in any way  the two men looked at one another across the counter with a strong inscrutable stare of mutual suspicion  then cyril slowly tore up the cheque he had tendered for fifty pounds filled in another for his real balance of twentytwo handed it across to the clerk without another word received the cash in white trembling hands and went out to his cab again in a turmoil of excitement  all the way back to his rooms in staple inn one seething idea alone possessed his soul his faith in guy was beginning to break down and with it his faith in himself almost went the man was his own brotherhis very counterpart he knew could he really believe him capable of committing a murder cyril looked within and said a thousand times no he looked at that forged cheque and his heart misgave him  at staple inn the housekeeper who took care of their joint rooms came out to greet him with no small store of tears and lamentations oh mr cyril she cried seizing both his hands in hers with a tremulous welcome im glad to see you back and to know youre innocent i always said you never could have done it no no not you nor yet mr guy neither  the police has been here time and again to search the rooms but the lord be praised they never found anything  and ive got a letter for you too from mr  guy himself but therei locked it up till you come in my own cupboard at home for fear of the detectives and now youre back and safe in london again ill run home this minute round the corner and get it  cyril sat down in the familiar easychair holding his face in his hands and gazed about him blankly  such a homecoming as this was inexpressibly terrible to him  in a few minutes more the housekeeper came back bringing in her hand guys letter from plymouth  cyril sat for a minute and looked at the envelope in deadly silence then he motioned the housekeeper out of the room with one quivering hand before that good womans face he couldnt open it and read it  as soon as she was gone he tore it apart trembling  as he read and read the suspicion within him deepened quickly into a doubt the doubt into a conviction the conviction into a certainty he clapped his hands to his head oh god what was this guy acknowledged his own guilt he confessed he had done it  cyrils last hope was gone guy himself admitted it  how i came to do it the letter said ive no idea myself a sudden suggestiona strange unaccountable  impulsea prompting as it were pressed upon me from without and almost before i knew the crime was committed  cyril bent his head low upon his knees with shame  he never could hold up that head henceforth no further doubt or hesitation remained he knew the whole truth guy was indeed a murderer  he steeled himself for the worst and read the letter through with a superhuman effort it almost choked him to read the very consecutiveness and coherency of the sentences seemed all but incredible under such awful circumstances a murderer redhanded to speak of his crime so calmly as that and then too this undying anger expressed and felt even after death against his victim nevitt cyril couldnt understand how any manleast of all his own brothercould write such words about the murdered man whose body was then lying all silent and cold under the open sky among the bracken at mambury  and once more this awful clue of the dead mans pocketbook those accursed notes that hateful sum of money how could guy venture to speak of it all in such terms as thosethe one palpable fact that indubitably linked him with that coldblooded murder the three thousand sent herewith i recovered almost by a miracle from that false creatures grasp under  extraordinary circumstances and i return them now in  proof of the fact in montague nevitts own pocketbook which im sure youll recognise as soon as you look at it  cyril saw it all now beyond the shadow of a doubt  he reconstructed the whole sad tale he was sure he understood it but to understand it was hardly even yet to believe it guy had lost heavily in the rio negro mines as the prosecution declared in an evil hour hed been cajoled into forging cyrils name for six thousand montague nevitt had in some way  misappropriated the stolen sum guy had pursued him in a sudden whiteheat of fury had come up with him unawares had killed him in his rage and now calmly returned as much as he could recover of that fateful and twicestolen money to cyril it was all too horrible but all too true in a wild ferment of remorse for his brothers sin the unhappy painter sat down at once and penned a letter of abject selfhumiliation to elma clifford  elmai said to you last night that i could never marry you till i had clearly proved my brother guys innocence well i said what i can never conceivably do since returning to town i received a letter from guy himself what it contained i must never tell you for guys own sake but what i must tell you is thisi can never again see you guy and i are so nearly one in every nerve and fibre of our being that whatever he may have done is to me almost as if i myself  had done it you will know how terrible a thing it is for me to write these words but for your sake i cant refrain from writing them think no more of me  i am not worthy of you i will think of you as long as i live  your ever devoted and heartbroken  cyril  he folded the letter and sent it off to the temporary address at the westend where elma had told him that she and her mother would spend the night in london  very late that evening a ring came at the bell cyril ran to the door it was a boy with a telegram he opened it and read it with breathless excitement  whatever guy may have said you are quite mistaken  theres a mystery somewhere keep his letter and show it to me i may perhaps be able to unravel the tangle im more than ever convinced that what i said to you last night was perfectly true we will save him yet unalterably  elma  but the telegram brought little peace to cyril of what value were elmas vague intuitions now by the side of guys own positive confession with his very own hand guy admitted that he had done it cyril went to bed that night the unhappiest loneliest man in london what guy was he was he felt himself almost like the actual murderer       chapter xxxi  golden joys      the voyage to the cape was long and tedious on the whole way out guy made but few friends and talked very little to his fellow passengers that unhappy recognition by granville kelmscott the evening he went on board the cetewayo poisoned the fugitives mind for the entire passage he felt himself in fact a moral outcast he slunk away from his kind he hardly dared to meet kelmscotts eyes for shame whenever he passed him but for one thing at least he was truly grateful though kelmscott had evidently discovered from the papers the nature of guys crime and knew his real name well it was clear he had said nothing of any sort on the subject to the other passengers only one man on board was aware of his guilt guy believed and that one man he shunned accordingly as far as was possible within the narrow limits of the saloon and the quarterdeck  granville kelmscott of course took a very different view of guy warings position he had read in the paper he bought at plymouth that guy was the murderer of montague nevitt regarding him therefore as a criminal of the deepest dye now flying from justice he wasnt at all surprised at guys shrinking and shunning him what astonished him rather was the mans occasional and incredible fits of effrontery  how that fellow could ever laugh and talk at all among the ladies on deckwith the hangman at his backsimply appalled and horrified the proud soul of a kelmscott granville had hard work to keep from expressing his horror openly at times but still with an effort he kept his peace with the picture of his father and lady emily now strong before his mind he couldnt find it in his heart to bring his own halfbrother however guilty and criminal the man might be to the foot of the gallows  so they voyaged on together without once interchanging a single word all the way from plymouth to the cape colony and the day they landed at port elizabeth it was an infinite relief indeed to guy to think he could now get well away for ever from that fellow kelmscott not being by any means overburdened with ready cash however guy determined to waste no time in the coastwise towns but to make his way at once boldly up country towards kimberley the railway ran then only as far as grahamstown the rest of his journey to the south african golconda was accomplished by road in a twowheeled cart drawn by four small horses which rattled along with a will up hill and down dale over the precarious highways of that semicivilized upland  to guy just fresh from england and the monotonous sea  there was a certain exhilaration in this first hasty glimpse of the infinite luxuriance of subtropical nature at times he almost forgot montague nevitt and the forgery in the boundless sense of freedom and novelty given him by those vast wastes of rolling tableland thickly covered with grass or low thorny acacias and stretching illimitably away in low range after range to the blue mountains in the distance it was strange indeed to him on the wide plains through which they scurried in wild haste to see the springbok rush away from the doubtful track at the first whirr of their wheels or the bolder bustard stand and gaze among the long grass with his wary eye turned sideways  to look at them guy felt for the moment he had left europe and its reminiscences now fairly behind him in this free new world he was free once more himself his shame was cast aside he could revel like the antelopes in the immensity of a land where nobody knew him and he knew nobody  what added most of all however to this quaint new sense of vastness and freedom was the occasional appearance of naked blacks roaming at large through the burntup fields of which till lately they had been undisputed possessors day after day guy drove on along the uncertain roads past queer outlying towns of white wooden housescradock and middelburg and colesberg and otherstill they crossed at last the boundary of orange river into the free state and halted for a while in the main street of philippolis  it was a dreary place guy began now to see the other side of south africa though he had left england in autumn it was springtime at the cape and the winter drought had parched up all the grass leaving the bare red dust in the roads or streets as dry and desolate as the sand of the desert the town itself consisted of some sixty melancholy and distressful houses bare square and flatroofed standing unenclosed along a dismal highroad and with that congenitally shabby look in spite of their newness which seems to belong by nature to all southern buildings  some stagnant pools alone remained to attest the presence after rain of a roaring brook the pits in whose driedup channel they now occupied over their tops hung the faded foliage of a few dustladen trees struggling hard for life with the energy of despair against depressing circumstances it was a picture that gave guy a sudden attack of pessimism if this was the el dorado towards which he was going he earnestly wished himself back again once more forgery or no forgery among the breezy green fields of dear old england  on to fauresmith he travelled with less comfort than before in a rickety buggy of most primitive  construction designed to meet the needs of rough mountain roads and as innocent of springs as guy himself of the murder of montague nevitt it was a wretched drive the drought had now broken the wet season had begun rain fell heavily a piercing cold wind blew down from the nearer mountains and guy began to feel still more acutely than ever that south africa was by no means an earthly paradise as he drove on and on this feeling deepened upon him huge blocks of stone obstructed the rough road intersected as it was by deep cartwheel ruts down which the rainwater now flowed in impromptu torrents the dutch driver too anxious to show the mettle of his coarselimbed steeds persisted in dashing over the hummocky ground at a breakneck pace while guy balanced himself with difficulty on the narrow seat hanging on to his portmanteau for dear life among the jerks and jolts till his ringers were numbed with cold and exposure  they held out against it all before the pelting rain till man and beast were wellnigh exhausted at last about threequarters of the way to fauresmith on the bleak bare hilltops sleety snow began to fall in big flakes and the barking of a dog to be heard in the distance the boer driver pricked up his ears at the sound  that must a house be he remarked in his dutch pigeonenglish to guy and guy felt in his soul that the most miserable and filthy of kaffir huts would just then be a welcome sight to his weary eyes he would have given a sovereign indeed from the scanty store he possessed for a nights lodging in a convenient dogkennel he was agreeably surprised therefore to find it was a comfortable farmhouse where the lights in the casement beamed forth a cheery welcome on the wet and draggled wayfarers from real glass windows the farmer within received them hospitably business was brisk today another traveller he said had just gone on towards fauresmith  a young man like yourself fresh from england the farmer observed scanning guy closely hes off for the diamond diggings i think to dutoitspan  guy rested the right there thinking nothing of the stranger and went on next day more quietly to fauresmith thence to the diamond fields the country became at each step more sombre and more monotonous than ever in the afternoon they rested at jacobsdal another dusty dreary comfortless place consisting of about five and twenty bankrupt houses scattered in bare clumps over a scorchedup desert then on again next day over a drearier and ever drearier expanse of landscape it was ghastly it was horrible at last on the top of a dismal hill range looking down on a deep dale the driver halted in the vast flat below a dull dense fog seemed to envelop the world with inscrutable mists the driver pointed to it with his demonstrative whip  down yonder he said encouragingly as he put the skid on his wheel down yonders the diamond fieldsthats dutoitspan before you  what makes it so grey guy asked looking in front of him with a sinking heart this first view of his future home was by no means encouraging  oh the sand make it be like that the driver answered unconcernedly diamond fields all make up of fine red sand and diggers pile it about around their own claims then the wind comes and blow and make sandstorm always around dutoitspan  guy groaned inwardly this was certainly not the el dorado of his fancy they descended the hill at the same breakneck pace as before and entered the miserable mushroom town of diamondgrubbers amidst the huts in the diggings great heaps of red earth lay piled up everywhere dust and sand rose high on the hot breeze into the stifling air as they reached the encampmentfor dutoitspan then was little more than a campthe blinding mists of solid red particles drove so thick in their eyes that guy could hardly see a few yards before him their clothes and faces were literally encrusted in thick coats of dust the fine red mist seemed to pervade everything  it filled their eyes their nostrils their ears their mouths they breathed solid dust the air was laden deep with it  and this was the diamond fields this was the golconda where guy was to find six thousand pounds ready made to recover his losses and to repay cyril  oh horrible horrible his heart sank low at it  and still they went on and on and on and on through the mist of dust to the place for outspanning  guy only shared the common fate of all newcomers to the fields in feeling much distressed and really ill  the very horses in the cart snorted and sneezed and showed their high displeasure by trying every now and then to jib and turn back again here and there on either side to right and left where the gloom permitted it guy made out dimly a few round or oblong tents with occasional rude huts of corrugated iron a few uncertain figures lounged vaguely in the background on closer inspection they proved to be muchgrimed and halfnaked natives resting their weary limbs on piles of dry dust after their toil in the diggings  it was an unearthly scene guys heart sank lower and lower still at every step the horses took into that howling wilderness  at last the driver drew up with a jolt in front of a long low hut of corrugated iron somewhat larger than the rest but no less dull and dreary the hotel he said briefly and guy jumped out to secure himself a nights lodging or so at this place of entertainment till he could negotiate for a hut and a decent claim and commence his digging  at the bar of the primitive saloon where he found himself landed a man in a grey tweed suit was already seated he was drinking something fizzy from a tall sodawater glass with a sudden start of horror guy recognised him at once oh great heavens what was this it was granville kelmscott  then granville too was bound for the diamond fields like himself what an incredible coincidence  how strange how inexplicable that rich mans son the pampered heir to tilgate what could he be doing here in this outoftheway spot this last resort of poor brokendown men this miserable haunt of wretched gambling moneygrubbers  here curiosity surely must have drawn him to the spot he couldnt have come to dig guy gazed in amazement at that grey tweed suit he must be staying for a day or two in search of adventure no more than just that he couldnt mean to stop here  as he gazed and stood openmouthed in the shadow of the door granville kelmscott who hadnt seen him enter laid down his glass wiped his lips with gusto and continued his conversation with the complacent barman  yes i want a hut here he said and to buy a good claim ive been looking over the kopje down by watsons spare land and i think ive seen a lot thats likely to suit me  guy sould hardly restrain his astonishment and surprise he had come then to dig oh incredible  impossible  but at any rate this settled his own immediate movements guys mind was made up at once if granville kelmscott was going to dig at dutoitspanwhy clearly dutoitspan was no place for him he could never stand the continual presence of the one man in south africa who knew his deadly secret  come what might he must leave the neighbourhood without a moments delay he must strike out at once for the far interior as he paused granville kelmscott turned round and saw him their eyes met with a start each was equally astonished then granville rose slowly from his seat and murmured in a low voice as he regarded him fixedly  you here again mr billington this is once too often i hardly expected this theres no room here for both of us  and he strode from the saloon with a very black brow leaving guy for the moment alone with the barman       chapter xxxii  a new departure      a fortnight later one sultry afternoon granville kelmscott found himself after various strange adventures and escapes by the way in a koranna hut far in the untravelled heart of the savage barolong country  the tenement where he sat or more precisely squatted was by no means either a commodious or sweetscented one yet it was the biggest of a group on the riverbank some five feet high from floor to roof so that a kelmscott couldnt possibly stand erect at full length in it and it was roughly round in shape like an overgrown beehive the framework consisting of branches of trees arranged in a rude circle over whose arching ribs native rush mats had been thrown or sewn with irregular order the door was a hole through which the proud descendant of the squires of tilgate had to creep on all fours a hollow pit dug out in the centre served as the only fireplace smoke and stagnant air formed the staples of the atmosphere a more squalid hovel granville kelmscott had never even conceived as possible it was as dirty and as loathsome as the most vivid imagination could picture the hut of the lowest savages  yet here that delicately nurtured english gentleman was to be cooped up for an indefinite time as it seemed by order of the black despot who ruled over the barolong  with a rod of iron  what had led granville kelmscott into this extraordinary  scrape it would not be hard to say the kelmscott  nature in all its embodiments worked on very simple but very fixed lines the moment granville saw his halfbrother guy at dutoitspan his mind was made up at once as to his immediate procedure he wouldnt stop one dayone hour longer than necessary where he could see that fellow who committed the murder come what might he would make his escape at once into the far interior  as before in england so now in africa both brothers were moved by the selfsame impulses and each carried them out with characteristic promptitude  where could granville go however well it was rumoured at dutoitspan that pebbles had been found far away to the north in the barolong country  pebbles of course is good south african for diamonds and at this welcome news all kimberley and griqualand pricked up their ears with congenial delight for business was growing flat on the oldestablished diamond fields the palmy era of great finds and lucky hits was now long past the day of systematic and prosaic  industry had set in instead for the overstocked diggings it was no longer possible for the luckiest fresh hand to pick up pebbles lying loose on the surface the mode of working had become highly skilled and scientific  machines and scaffolds and washingcradles and lifting apparatus were now required to make the business a success the simple old gambling element was rapidly going out and the capitalist was rapidly coming up in its stead as master of the situation so granville kelmscott being an enterprising young man though destitute of cash and utterly ignorant of south african life determined to push on with all his might and main into the barolong country and to rush for the front among the first in the field in these rumoured new diggings on the extreme north frontier of civilization  he started alone as a kelmscott might do and made his way adventurously without any knowledge of the koranna language or manners through many wild villages of king khatsuas dominions night after night he camped out in the open and day after day he tramped on by himself buying food as he went from the natives for english silver in search of precious stones over that dreary tableland at last on the fourteenth day in a deep alluvial hollow near a squalid group of small barolong huts he saw a tiny round stone much rubbed and waterworn which he picked up and examined with no little curiosity the two days he had spent at dutoitspan had not been wasted  he had learnt to recognise the look of the native gem  once glance told him at once what his pebble was he recognised it at sight as one of those small but muchvalued diamonds of the finest water which diggers know by the technical name of glassstones  the hollow where he stood was in fact an ancient alluvial pit or volcanic mudcrater scoriac rubble filled it in to a very great depth and in the interstices of this rubble were embedded here and there rude blocks of greenstone containing almondshaped chalcedonies and agate and milkquartz with now and then a tiny waterworn spec which an experienced eye would have detected at once as the finest riverstones  here indeed was a prize the solitary englishman recognised in a second that he was the first pioneer of a new and richer kimberley  but as granville kelmscott stood still looking hard at his find through the little pocketlens he had brought with him from england with a justifiable tremor of delight at the pleasant thought that here perhaps he had lighted on the key to something which might restore him once more to his proper place at tilgate he was suddenly roused from his delightful reverie by a harsh negro voice shrill and clear close behind him saying in very tolerable africanenglish  hillo you white man what dat you got there  you come here to barolong land so go look for diamond  granville turned sharply round and saw standing by his side a naked and stalwart black man smiling blandly at his discovery with broad negro amusement  its a pebble the englishman said pocketing it as carelessly as he could and trying to look unconcerned for his new acquaintance held a long native spear in his stout left hand and looked by no means the sort of person to be lightly trifled with  oh dat a pebble mistah white man the barolong said sarcastically holding out his black right hand with a very imperious air den you please hand him over dat pebble you find me got me orders king khatsua no want any diamond digging in barolong land  granville tried to parley with the categorical native but his attempts at palaver were eminently unsuccessful  the naked black man was master of the situation  you hand over dat stone me friend he said assuming a menacing attitude and holding out his hand once more with no very gentle air or me run you trew de body wit me assegaijust so king khatsua him no want any diamond diggings in barolong land  and indeed granville kelmscott couldnt help admitting to himself when he came to think of it that king khatsua was acting wisely in his generation for the introduction of diggers into his dominions would surely have meant as everywhere else the speedy proclamation of a british protectorate and the final  annihilation of king khatsua himself and his dusky fellowcountrymen  there is nothing to say the truth the south african native dreads so much as being eaten up as he calls it by those aggressive english king khatsua knew his one chance in life consisted in keeping the diggers firmly out of his dominions and he was prepared to deny the very existence of diamonds throughout the whole of barolong land until the english by sheer force should come in flocks and unearth them  in obedience to his chiefs command therefore the naked henchman still held out his hand menacingly  dis land king khatsuas he repeated once more in an angry voice all diamonds found on it belong to king khatsua just you hand dat over no steal no tiefee  the instincts of the landowning class were too strong in granville kelmscott not to make him admit at once to himself the justice of this claim the owner of the soil had a right to the diamonds he handed over the stone with a pang of regret the savage grinned to himself and scanned it attentively then extending his spear as one might do to a cow or a sheep he drove granville before him  you come along a me he said shortly in a most determined voice you come along a me king khatsuas orders  granville went before him without one word of remonstrance much wondering what was likely to happen next till he found himself suddenly driven into that noisome hut where he was forced to enter ignominiously on all fours like an eight months old baby  by the light of the fire that burned dimly in the midst of his captors house he could see as his eyes grew gradually accustomed to the murky gloom a strange and savage scene such as he had never before in his life dreamt of in the pit of the hut some embers glowed feebly from whose midst a fleecy object was sputtering and hissing a second glance assured him that the savoury morsel was the head of an antelope in process of roasting two greasy black women naked to the waist were superintending this primitive cookery all round a group of unclad little imps as black as their mothers lounged idly about with their eyes firmly fixed on the chance of dinner  as granville entered the husband and father poking in his head shouted a few words after him another native outside kept watch and ward with a spear at the door meanwhile to prevent his escape against king khatsuas orders  for two long hours the englishman waited there fretting and fuming in that stifling atmosphere  meanwhile the antelopes head was fully cooked and the women and children falling on it like wild beasts tore off the scorched fleece and snatched the charred flesh from the bones with their fingers greedily  it was a hideous sight it sickened him to see it  byandby granville heard a loud voice outside  he listened in surprise it sounded as though barolong had another prisoner there was a pause and a scuffle then all of a sudden somebody else came bundling unceremoniously through the hole that served for a door in the same undignified fashion as he himself had done granvilles eyes now accustomed to the gloom recognised the stranger at once with a thrill of astonishment he could hardly trust his senses at the sight it wasno it couldnt beyes it wasguy waring  guy waring sure enough as before they were companions the kelmscott character had worked itself out exactly alike in each of them they had come independently by the selfsame road to the rumoured diamond fields of the barolong country  it was some minutes however before guy for his part recognised his fellowprisoner in the dark and gloomy hut then each stared at the other in mute surprise they found no words to speak their mutual astonishment this was more wonderful to be sure than even either of their former encounters  for another long hour the two unfriendly englishmen  huddled away from one another in opposite corners of that native hut without speaking a word of any sort in their present straits at the end of that time a voice spoke at the door some guttural sentences in the barolong language the natives inside responded alike in their own savage clicks next the voice spoke in english it was granvilles captor he now knew well  white men you come out king khatsua himself him go to peak to you  they crawled out one at a time in sorry guise through the narrow hole it was a pitiful exhibition  were it not for the danger and uncertainty of the event they could almost themselves have fairly laughed at it king khatsua stood before them a tall fullblooded black in european costume with a round felt hat and a crimson tie surrounded by his naked wives and attendants in his outstretched hand he held before their faces two incriminating diamonds he spoke to them with much dignity at considerable length in the barolong tongue to a running accompaniment  of laudatory exclamationsoh my king oh wise wordsfrom the mouths of his courtiers  neither granville nor guy understood of course a single syllable of the stately address but that didnt in the least disturb the composure of the dusky monarch he went right through to the end with his solemn warning scolding them both roundly as they guessed in his native tongue like a master reproving a pair of naughty schoolboys  as he finished their captor stood forth with great importance to act as interpreter he had been to the kimberly diamond mines himself as a labourer and was therefore accounted by his own people a perfect model of english scholarship  king khatsua say this he observed curtly you very bad men you come to barolong land king khatsua say barolong land for barolong no allow white man dig here for diamonds if white man come him eat up barolong keep white man out keep land for king khatsua  does king khatsua want us to leave his country then granville kelmscott asked with a distinct tremor in his voice for the great chief and his followers looked decidedly hostile  the interpreter threw back his head and laughed a loud long laugh  king khatsua not a fool he answered at last after a rhetorical pause king khatsua no want to give up his land to white man if you two white man go back to kimberley you tell plenty other people diamonds in barolong land you say come along o me to barolong land with gun we show you where to dig um no no king khatsua not a fool king khatsua say this you two white man no go back to kimberley you spies you stop here plenty time along o king khatsua never go back till king khatsua give leave so no let any other white man come along into barolong land  granville looked at guy and guy looked at granville  in this last extremity before those domineering blacks they almost forgot everything save that they were both english what were they to do now the situation was becoming truly terrible  the interpreter went on once more however with genuine savage enjoyment of the consternation he was causing them  king khatsua say this he continued in a very amused tone you stop here plenty days very good in barolong land king khatsua give you hut king khatsua give you claim barolong man bring spear and guard you no do you any harm for fear of governor governor keep plenty guns in cape town  you two white man live in hut together dig diamonds together get plenty pebbles keep one diamond you find for yourself give one diamond after that to king khatsua barolong man bring you plenty food plenty drink but no let you go back you try to go then barolong man spear you  the playful dig with which the savage thrust forward  his assegai at that final remark showed granville kelmscott in a moment this was no idle threat it was clear for the present they must accept the inevitable  they must remain in barolong land and he must share hut and work with that doubly hateful creaturethe man who had deprived him of his patrimony  at tilgate and whom he firmly believed to be the murderer of montague nevitt this was what had come then of his journey to africa truly adversity makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows       chapter xxxiii  time flies      eighteen months passed away in england and nothing more was heard of the two fugitives to africa lady emilys cup was very full indeed on the selfsame day she learned of her husbands death and her sons mysterious and unaccountable disappearance from that moment forth he was to her as if dead after granville left no letter or news of him direct or indirect ever reached tilgate it was all most inexplicable  he had disappeared into space and no man knew of him  cyril too had now almost given up hoping for news of guy slowly the conviction forced itself deeper and still deeper upon his mind in spite of elma that guy was really montague nevitts murderer else how account for guys sudden disappearance and for the fact that he never even wrote home his whereabouts  nay guys letter itself left no doubt upon his mind  cyril went through life now oppressed continually with the terrible burden of being a murderers brother  and indeed everybody elseexcept elma cliffordimplicitly shared that opinion with him cyril was  sure the unknown benefactor shared it too for guys six thousand pounds were never paid in to his creditas indeed how could they since colonel kelmscott who had promised to pay them died before receiving the balance of the purchase money for the dowlands estate cyril slank through the world then weighed down by his shame for guy and he were each others doubles and he always had a deep underlying conviction that as guy was in any particular so also in the very fibre of his nature he himself was  everybody else except elma clifford but in spite of all elma still held out firm in her intuitive way in favour of guys innocence she knew it she said and there the matter dropped and she knew quite equally in her own firm mind that gilbert gildersleeve  was the real murderer  gilbert gildersleeve meanwhile had gone up a step or two higher in the social scale he had been promoted  to the bench on the first vacancy as all the world had long expected but strange to say he took it far more modestly than all the world had ever anticipated indeed before he was made a judge everybody said hed be intolerable in the ermine he was blustering and bullying enough in all conscience as a mere queens counsel but when he came to preside  in a court of his own his insolence would surpass even the wonted insolence of our autocratic british justices in this however everybody was mistaken  a curious change had of late come over gilbert  gildersleeve the big bullying lawyer was growing nervous and diffident where of old he had been coarse and selfassertive and blustering he was beginning at times almost to doubt his own absolute omniscience and absolute wisdom he was prepared half to admit that under certain circumstances a prisoner might possibly be in the right and that all crimes alike did not necessarily deserve the hardest sentence the law of the land allowed him to allot them habitual criminals even began after a while to express a fervent hope as assizes approached they might be tried by old gildersleeve  gilly they said gave a cove a chance he wasnt one of these ere reglar anging judges like sir enery atkins  during those eighteen months too cyril tried as far as he could from a stern sense of duty to see as little as possible of elma clifford he loved elma stillthat goes without sayingmore devotedly than ever and elmas profound belief that cyrils brother couldnt possibly have committed so grave a crime touched his heart to the core by its womanly confidence theres nothing a man likes so much as being trusted but he had declared in the first flush of his horror and despair that he would never again ask elma to marry him till the cloud that hung over guys character had been lifted and dissipated and now that month after month no news came from guy and all hope seemed to fade lie felt it would be wrong of him even to see her or speak with her  on that question however elma herself had a voice as well man proposes woman decides and though elma for her part had quite equally made up her mind never to marry cyril with that nameless terror of expected madness hanging ever over her head she felt on the other hand her very loyalty to cyril and to cyrils brother imperatively demanded that she should still see him often and display marked friendship towards him as openly as possible she wanted the world to see plainly for itself that so far as this matter of guys reputation was concerned if cyril for his part wanted to marry her she on her side would be quite ready to marry cyril  so she insisted on meeting him whenever she could and on writing to him openly from time to time very affectionate notesthose familiar notes we all know so well and prize so dearlyfull of hopeless love and unabated confidence yes good mr stockbroker who do me the honour to read my simple tale smile cynically  if you will you pretend to care nothing for these little sentimentalities but you know very well in your own heart youve a bundle of them at home very brown and yellow locked up in your escritoire and youd let new zealand fours sink to the bottom of the indian ocean and egyptian unified go down to zero before ever youd part with a single faded page of them  what can a man do then even under such painful circumstances when a girl whom he loves with all his  heart lets him clearly see she loves him in return quite as truly cyril would have been more than human if he hadnt answered those notes in an equally ardent and equally desponding strain the burden of both their tales was always thiseven if you would i couldnt because i love you too much to impose my own disgrace upon you  but what elmas mysterious trouble could be cyril was still unable even to hazard a guess he only knew she had some reason of her own which seemed to her a sufficient bar to matrimony and made her firmly determine never in any case to marry any one  about twelve months after guys sudden disappearance  however a new element entered into elmas life  at first sight it seemed to have but little to do with the secret of her soul it was merely that the new purchaser of the dowlands estate had built herself a pretty little queen anne house on the ground and come to live in it  nevertheless from the very first day they met elma took most kindly to this new miss ewes the strange and eccentric musical composer the mistress of dowlands  was a distant cousin of mrs cliffords own so the family naturally had to call upon her at once and elma somehow seemed always to get on from the outset in a remarkable way with her mothers relations  at first to be sure elma could see mrs clifford was rather afraid to leave her alone with the odd newcomer whose habits and manners were as curious and weird  as the sudden twists and turns of her own wayward music but after a time a change came over mrs  clifford in this respect and instead of trying to keep elma and miss ewes apart it was evident to elmawho never missed any of the small byplay of lifethat her mother rather desired to throw them closely together thus it came to pass that one morning about a month after miss ewess arrival in her new home elma had run in with a message from her mother and found the distinguished composer as was often the case at that time of day sitting dreamily at her piano trying over on the gamut strange fanciful chords of her own peculiar witchlike character the music waxed and waned in a familiar lilt  thats beautiful elma cried enthusiastically as the composer looked up at her with an inquiring glance  i never heard anything in my life before that went so straight through one with its penetrating melody  such a lovely gliding sound you know so soft and serpentine and even as she said it a deep flush rose red in the centre of her cheek she was sorry for the words before they were out of her mouth they recalled all at once in some mysterious way that horrid persistent nightmare of the hateful snakedance in a second miss ewes caught the bright gleam in her eye and the deep flush on her cheek that so hastily followed it a meaning smile came over the elder womans face all at once not unpleasantly she was a handsome woman for her age but very dark and gipsylike after  the fashion of the eweses with keen italian eyes and a large smooth expanse of powerful forehead lightly she ran her hand over the keys with a masterly touch and fixed her glance as she did so on elma there was a moments pause miss ewes eyed her closely she was playing a tune that seemed oddly familiar to elmas brain somehowto her brain not to her ears for elma felt certain even while she recognised it most she had never before heard it it was a tune that waxed and waned and curled up and down sinuously and twisted in and out andah yes now she knew itraised its sleek head and darted out its forked tongue and vibrated with swift tremors and tightened and slackened and coiled resistlessly at last in great folds all around her elma listened with eager eyes half starting from her head with clenched nails dug deep into the tremulous palms as her heart throbbed fast and her nerves quivered fiercely oh it was wrong of miss ewes to tempt her like this it was wrong so wrong of her for elma knew what it was at oncethe song she had heard running vaguely through her head the night of the dancethe night she fell in love with cyril waring  with a throbbing heart elma sat down on the sofa and tried with all her might and main not to listen she clasped her hands still tighter she refused to be wrought up she wouldnt give way to it if she had followed her own impulse to be sure she would have risen on the spot and danced that mad dance once more  with all the wild abandonment of an almeh or a zingari  but she resisted with all her might and she resisted successfully  miss ewes never faltering kept her keen eye fixed hard on her with a searching glance as she ran over the keys in ever fresh combinations  faster wilder and stranger the music rose but elma sat still her breast heaving hard and her breath panting yet otherwise as still and motionless as a statue  she knew miss ewes could tell exactly how she felt  she knew she was trying her she knew she was tempting her  to get up and dance and yet she was not one bit afraid of this strange weird woman as shed been afraid that sad morning at home of her own mother  the composer went on fiercely for some minutes more leaning close over the keyboard and throwing her very soul as elma could plainly see into the tips of her fingers then suddenly she rose and came over well pleased to the sofa where elma sat with a motherly gesture she took elmas hand she smoothed her dark hair she bent down with a tender look in those strange grey eyes and printed a kiss unexpectedly on the poor girls forehead  elma she said leaning over her do you know what that was that was the naga snake dance it gave you an almost irresistible longing to rise and hold the snake in your own hands and coil his great folds around you i could see how you felt but you were strong enough to resist that was very well done  you resisted even the force of my music didnt you  elma trembling all over but bursting with joy that she could speak of it at last without restraint to somebody  answered in a very low and tremulous voice yes miss ewes i resisted it  miss ewes leant back in her place and gazed at her long with a very affectionate and motherly air then im sure i dont know she said at last breaking out in a voice full of confidence why on earth you shouldnt marry this young man youre in love with  elmas heart beat still harder and higher than ever  what young man she murmured lowjust to test the enchantress  and miss ewes made answer without one moments hesitation why of course cyril waring  for a minute or two then there was a dead silence  after that miss ewes looked up and spoke again  have you felt it often she asked without one word of explanation  twice before elma answered not pretending to misunderstand once i gave way that was the very first time you see and i didnt know yet exactly what it meant the second time i knew and then i resisted it  somehow before miss ewes she hardly ever felt shy  she was so conscious miss ewes knew all about it without her telling her  the elder woman looked at her with unfeigned admiration  that was brave of you she said quietly i couldnt have done it myself i should have had to give way to it then in you its dying out thats as clear as daylight it wont go any farther i knew it wouldnt of course when i saw you resisted even the naga dance and for you thats excellent for myself i encourage it its that that makes my music what it is its that that inspires me i composed  that naga dance i just played over to you elma but not all out of my own head i couldnt have invented it it comes down in our blood my dear to you and me alike we both inherit it from a common ancestress  tell me all about it elma cried nestling close to her new friend with a wild burst of relief i dont know why but im not at all ashamed of it all before you miss ewesat least not in the way i am before mother  you neednt be ashamed of it miss ewes answered kindly youve nothing to be ashamed of itll never trouble you in your life again it always dies out at last they say in the sixth or seventh generation and when its dying out it goes as it went with you on the night you first fell in love with cyril if after that you resist it never comes back again year after year the impulse grows feebler and feebler and if you can withstand the naga dance you can withstand anything come here and take my hand dear ill tell you all about it  late at night elma sat tearful but happy in her own room at home writing a few short lines to cyril waring this was all she said  theres no reason on my side now dearest cyril  its all a mistake ill marry you whenever and wherever  you will there need be no reason on your side either i love you and can trust you yours ever  elma  when cyril waring received that note next morning he kissed it reverently and put it away in his desk among a bundle of others but he said to himself sternly in his own soul for all that never while guy still rests under that cloud and how its ever to be lifted from him is to me inconceivable       chapter xxxiv  a stroke for freedom      in africa meanwhile during those eighteen months king khatsua had kept his royal word he had held his two european prisoners under close watch and ward in the koranna hut he had assigned them for their residence  like most other negro princes indeed khatsua was a shrewd man of business in his own way and while he meant to prevent the english strangers from escaping seaward with news of the new el dorado they had discovered in barolong land he hadnt the least idea of turning away on that account the incidental advantages to be gained for himself by permitting them to hunt freely in his dominions for diamonds so long as they acquiesced in the roughandready royalty of 50 per cent he had proposed to them when he first decided to detain them in his own territoryone stone for the king and one for the explorersthey were free to pursue their quest after gems to their hearts content in the valleys of barolong land and as the two englishmen  for their part had nothing else to do in africa and as they still went on hoping against hope for some  chance of escape or rescue they dug for diamonds with a will and secured a number of firstclass stones that would have made their fortunes indeedif only they could have got them to the sea or to england  of course they lived perforce in the koranna hut assigned them by the king in pretty much the same way as the korannas themselves did king khatsuas men supplied them abundantly with grain and fruits and game and even at times procured them readymade clothes by exchange with kimberley in other respects they were not illtreated they were merely detained during his majestys pleasure but as his majesty had no intention of killing the goose that laid the golden eggs or of letting them go if he could help it to spread the news of their find among their greedy fellowcountrymen it seemed to them both as if they might go on being detained like this in barolong land for an indefinite period  still things went indifferently with them as they lived and worked together in their native hut by khatsuas village a change began slowly but irresistibly to come over granville kelmscotts feelings towards his unacknowledged halfbrother at first it was with the deepest sense of distaste and loathing that the  dispossessed heir found himself compelled to associate with guy waring in such close companionship but bit by bit as they two saw more and more of one another this feeling of distaste began to wear off piecemeal granville kelmscott was more than half ashamed to admit it even to himself but in process of time he really almost caught himself beginning to likewell to like the man he believed to be a murderer  it was shocking and horrible no doubt but what else was he to do guy formed now his only european society by the side of those savage barolongs whose chief thought nothing of perpetrating the most nameless  horrors before their very eyes for the gratification of mere freaks of passion or jealousy a european murderer of the gentlemanly class seemed almost by comparison a mild and gentle personage granville hardly liked to allow it in his own mind but it was nevertheless the case he was getting positively fond of this man guy waring  besides blood is generally thicker than water  living in such close daily communion with guy and talking with him unrestrainedly at last upon all possible pointssave that one unapproachable one which both seemed to instinctively avoid alluding to in any waygranville began to feel that murderer or no murderer guy was in all essentials very near indeed to him nay more he found himself at times actually arguing the point with his own conscience that after all guy was a very good sort of fellow and if ever he had murdered montague nevitt at allwhich looked very probablehe must have murdered him under considerably extenuating circumstances  there was only one thing about guy that granville didnt like when he got to know him this homicidal halfbrother of his was gentle as a woman tender kindhearted truthful affectionate a gentleman to the core and a jolly good fellow into the bargain buttheres always a buthe was a terrible moneygrubber  even there in the lost heart of africa at such a distance from home with so little chance of ever making any use of his hoarded wealth the fellow used to hunt up those wretched small stones and wear them night and day in a belt round his waist as if he really loved them for their own mere sakesdirty highpriced little baubles granville for his part couldnt bear to see such ingrained love of pelf it was miserable it was mercenary  to be sure he himself hunted diamonds every day of his life just as hard as guy did there was nothing else to do in this detestable place and a man must find something to turn his idle hands to also he carried them like guy bound up in a girdle round his own waist it was a pity they should be lost if ever he should chance to get away safe in the end to england  but then dont you see the cases were so different  guy hoarded up his diamonds for mere wretched gain whereas granville valued his he said to himself often not for the mere worth in money of those shimmering little trinkets but for his mothers sake and  gwendolines and the credit of the family he wanted lady emily to see her son filling the place in the world she had always looked forward with hope to his filling and by heavens help he thought he could still fill it he couldnt marry gwendoline on a beggars pittance and by heavens help he hoped still to be able to marry her  guy on the other hand found himself almost equally surprised in turn at the rapid way he grew really to be fond of granville kelmscott though kelmscott knew as he thought the terrible secret of his halfunconscious crimefor he could feel now how completely he had acted under montague nevitts compelling influenceguy was aware before long of such a profound and deepseated sympathy existing between them that he became exceedingly attached in time to his friendly fellowprisoner in spite of the one barrier they could never break down he spoke freely by degrees to granville of everything else in his whole life and granville in return spoke to him just as freely a good fellow granville when you got to know him  there was only a single trait in his character guy couldnt endure and that was his ingrained love of moneygrubbing for the way the man pounced down upon those dirty little stones when he saw them in the mud and hoarded them up in his belt and seemed prepared to defend them with his very lifeblood guy couldnt conceal from himselfthe fact that he fairly despised him such vulgar commonplace unredeemed love of pelf such mere bourgeois avarice of what use could those wretched pebbles be to him here in the dusty plains of far inland africa  guy himself kept close count of his finds to be sure but then the cases dont you see were so different he wanted his diamonds to discharge the great debt of his life to cyril and to appear an honest man rehabilitated once more before the brother he had so deeply wronged and humiliated whereas granville kelmscott a rich mans son and the heir to a great estate beyond the dreams of avaricethat he should have come risking his life in these savage wilds for mere increase of superfluous wealth why it was simply despicable  so eighteen months wore away in mutual friendship tempered to a certain degree by mutual contempt and little chance of escape came to the captives in barolong land  at last as the second winter came round once more for two or three weeks the englishmen in their huts began to perceive that much bustle and confusion was going on all around in king khatsuas dominions  preparations for a war on a considerable scale were clearly taking place men mustered daily on the dusty plain with firearms and assegais much pombè was drunk many palavers took place a constant drumming of gongs and tomtoms disturbed their ears by day and by night the englishmen concluded some big marauding expedition was in contemplation  and they were quite right king khatsua was about to concentrate his forces for an attack on a neighbouring black monarch as powerful and perhaps as cruel as himself montisive of the bush veldt  slowly the preparations went on all around then the great day came at last and king khatsua set forth on his mighty campaign to the sound of big drums and the blare of native trumpets  when the warriors had marched out of the villages on their way northward to the war guy saw the two prisoners chance of escape had arrived in earnest  they were guarded as usual of course but not so strictly as before and during the night in particular guy noticed with pleasure little watch was now kept upon them the savage indeed cant hold two ideas in his head at once if hes making war on his neighbour on one side he has no room left to think of guarding his prisoners on the other  tonight guy said one evening as they sat together in their hut over their native supper of mealie cakes and springbok venison we must make a bold stroke we must creep out of the kraal as well as we can and go for the sea westward through namaqua land to angra pequena  westward granville answered very dubiously  but why westward waring surely our shortest way to the coast is down to kimberley and so on to the cape itll take us weeks and weeks to reach the sea wont it by way of namaqua land  no matter for that guy replied with confidence  he knew the map pretty well and had thought it all over as soon as the barolong miss us in the morning  theyll naturally think weve gone south as you say towards our own people so theyll pursue us in that direction and try to take us and if they were to catch us after wed once run away you may be sure theyd kill us as soon as look at us but it would never occur to them dont you see we were going away west they wont follow us that way so west well go and strike out for the sea as i say at angra pequena  they sat up through the night discussing plans low to themselves in the dark till nearly two in the  morning then when all was silent around and the  barolong slept they stole quietly out and began  their long march across the country to westward each  man had his diamonds tied tightly round his waist  and his revolver at his belt they were prepared to  face every unknown danger  crawling past the native huts with very cautious steps they made for the open and emerged from the village on to the heights that bounded the valley of the lugura they had proceeded in this direction for more than an hour walking as hard as their legs would carry them when the sound of a man running fast but barefoot fell on their ears from behind in a regular pitapat guy looked back in dismay and saw a naked barolong just silhouetted against the pale sky on the top of a long low ridge they had lately crossed over at the very same instant granville raised his revolver and pointed it at the man who evidently had not yet perceived them with a sudden gesture of horror guy knocked down his hand and prevented his taking aim  dont shoot he cried in a voice of surprised dismay and disapproval we mustnt take his life  how do we know hes an enemy at all he maynt be pursuing us  best shoot on spec anyway granville answered somewhat discomposed alls fair in war the fellows  after us no doubt and at any rate if he sees us he may go and report our whereabouts to the village  what shoot an unarmed man who shows no signs of hostility why it would be sheer murder guy cried with some horror we mustnt make our retreat on those principles kelmscott itd be quite indefensible  i decline to fire except when were attacked  i wont be any party myself to needless bloodshed  granville kclmscott gazed at him there in the grey dawn in unspeakable surprise not shoot at a negro  in such straits too as theirs and this rebuke had come to himfrom the mouth of the murderer  turn it over as he might granville couldnt understand it  the barolong ran along on the crest of the ridge still at the top of his speed without seeming to notice them in the gloom of the valley presently he disappeared  over the edge to southward guy was right after all he wasnt in pursuit of them more likely he was only a runaway slave taking advantage like themselves of king khatsuas absence       chapter xxxv  perils by the way      three weeks later two torn and tattered halfstarved europeans sat under a burning south african sun by the dry bed of a shrunken summer torrent it was in the depths of namaqua land among the stony karoo and the fugitives were straggling helplessly and hopelessly seaward thirsty and weary through a  halfhostile country making their marches as best  they could at dead of night and resting by day where  the natives would permit them  their commissariat had indeed been a lean and hungry one though they carried many thousand pounds worth of diamonds about their persons they had nothing negotiable with which to buy food or shelter from the uncivilized namaquas ivory cloth and beads were the currency of the country no native thereabouts would look for a moment at their little round nobs of waterworn pebbles the fame of the diamond fields hadnt penetrated as yet so far west in the land as to have reached to the huts of the savage namaquas  and now their staying power was almost worn out granville kelmscott lay down on the sandy soil with a wild gesture of despair all around were bare rocks and the dry sweltering veldts covered only with round stones and red sand and low bushy vegetation  waring he said feebly in a very faint voice i wish youd leave me and go on by yourself im no good any more im only a drag upon you this fevers too bad for me to stand much longer i can never pull through to the coast alive ive no energy left were it even to try id like to lie down here and die where i sit do go and leave me  never guy answered resolutely ill never desert you kelmscott while ive a drop of blood left  if i carry you on my back to the coast ill get you there at last or else well both die on the veldt together  granville held his friends hand in his own fevered fingers as he might have held a womans  oh waring he cried once more in a voice half choked with profound emotion i dont know how to thank you enough for all youve done for me youve behaved to me like a brotherlike a brother indeed it makes me ashamed to think when i see how unselfish and good and kind youve beenashamed to think i once distrusted you youve been an angel to me all through without you i dont know how i could ever have lived on through this journey at all  and i cant bear to feel now i may spoil your retreatcant bear to know im a drag and burden to you  my dear fellow guy said holding the thin and fevered hand very tenderly in his dont talk to me like that i feel to you every bit as you feel to me in this matter i was afraid of you at first because i knew you misunderstood me but the more ive seen of you the better weve each of us learned to sympathize  with the other weve long been friends i love you now as you say like a brother  granville hesitated for a moment should he out with it or not then at last the whole longsuppressed truth came out with a burst he seized his companions two hands at once in a convulsive grasp  thats not surprising either he said after allfor guy do you know we are really brothers  guy gazed at him in astonishment for a moment he thought his friends reason was giving way then slowly and gradually he took it all in  are really brothers he repeated in a dazed sort of way do you mean it kelmscott then my father and cyrils  was mine too waring yes i couldnt bear to die without telling you that and i tell it now to you  you two are the heirs of the tilgate estates and the unknown person who paid six thousand pounds to cyril just before you left england was your father and minecolonel henry kelmscott  guy bent over him for a few seconds in speechless surprise words failed him at first how do you know all this kelmscott he said at last faintly  granville told him in as few words as possiblefor indeed he was desperately weak and illby what accident he had discovered his fathers secret but he told him only what he knew himself for of course he was ignorant as yet of the colonels seizure and sudden death on the very day after they had sailed from england  guy listened to it all in profound silence it was a strange and for him a momentous tale then he said at last as granville finished and you never told me this all these long months kelmscott  i always meant to tell you guy his halfbrother answered in a sudden fit of penitence i always meant in the end you and your brother cyril should come into your own at tilgate as you ought i was only waiting  till youd realized enough to make good some part of your personal loss guy suggested not unkindly  oh no granville answered flushing up at the suggestion i wasnt waiting for that dont think me so mercenary i was waiting for you in your turn to extend to me your own personal confidence you know guy he went on dropping into a still more hushed and solemn undertone i saw an evening paper the night we left plymouth  oh i know i know guy cried interrupting him with a very pale face dont speak to me of that i cant bear to think of it kelmscott i was mad when i did that deed i wasnt myself i acted under somebody elses compulsion and influence the man had a sort of hypnotic power over my will i believe i couldnt help doing whatever he ordered me it was he who suggested it it was he that did it and its he who was really and truly guilty  and who was that man granville kelmscott asked with some little curiosity  theres no reason i shouldnt tell you guy answered now weve once broken the ice and im glad in my heart i must say that weve broken it  for a year and a half day and night that barrier has been raised between us always and ive longed to get rid of it but i was afraid to speak of it to you and you to me well the man if you must know was montague nevitt  granville kelmscott looked up at him in credulous surprise but he was too ill and weak to ask the meaning of this riddle montague nevitt what on earth could waring mean by that how on earth could montague nevitt have influenced and directed him in assaulting and murdering montague nevitt  for a long time there was silence each brother was thinking his own thoughts to himself about this double disclosure at last granville lifted his head and spoke again  and youll go home to england now he said under an assumed name i suppose and arrange with your brother cyril for him to claim the kelmscott estates and allow you something out of them in retirement somewhere  oh no guy answered manfully im going home to england now if i go at all under my own proper name that ive always borne to repay cyril in full every penny i owe him to make what reparation i can for the wrong ive done and to give myself up to the police for trial  granville gazed at him more surprised and more admiring than ever  youre a brave man waring he said slowly i dont understand it at all but i know youre right  and i almost believe you i almost believe it was not your fault i should like to get through to england after all if it was only to see you safe out of your troubles  guy looked at him fixedly  my dear fellow he said in a compassionate tone you mustnt talk any more youve talked a great deal too much already i see a hut i fancy over yonder beside that dark patch of brush now you must do exactly as i bid you dont struggle or kick  lie as still as you can ill carry you there on my back and then well see if we can get you anyhow a drop of pure water       chapter xxxvi  deserted      that was almost the last thing granville kelmscott knew some strange shadowy dreams to be sure disturbed the lethargy into which he fell soon after but they were intermittent and indefinite he was vaguely aware of being lifted with gentle care into somebodys arms and of the somebody staggering along with him not without considerable difficulty over the rough stony ground of that south african plateau he remembered also as in a trance some sound of angry voicesa loud expostulationa hasty palavera long slow pausea gradual sense of reconciliation and friendlinessduring all which as far as he could recover the circumstances afterwards he must have been extended on the earth with his back propped against a great ledge of jutting rock and his head hanging listless on his sinking breast thenceforward all was blank or just dimly perceived at long intervals between delirium and unconsciousness he was ill for many days where or how he knew not  in some half dreamy way he was aware too now and again of strange voices by his side strange faces tending him but they were black faces all and the voices spoke in deep guttural tones unlike even the clicks and harsh bantu jerks with which he had grown so familiar in eighteen months among the barolong  this that he heard now or seemed to hear in his delirium like distant sounds of water was a wholly different and very much harsher tonguethe tongue of the namaquas in fact though granville was far too ill and too drowsy just then to think of reasoning about it or classifying it in any way all he knew for the moment was that sometimes when he turned round feebly on his bed of straw and asked for drink or help in a faltering voice no white man appeared to answer his summons black faces allblack black and unfamiliar very intermittently he was conscious of a faint sense of loneliness he knew not why but he thought he could guess guy waring had deserted him  at last one morning after more days had passed than granville could possibly count all of a sudden in a wild whirl he came to himself again at once with that instant revulsion of complete awakening which often occurs at the end of long fits of delirium in malarious fever a light burst in upon him with a flash in a moment his brain seemed to clear all at once and everything to grow plain as day before him  he raised himself on one wasted elbow and gazed around him with profound awe he saw it all now he remembered everything everything  he was alone among savages in the far heart of africa  he lay on his back on a heap of fresh straw in a close and filthy mudbuilt hut under his aching neck a wooden pillow or prop of native make supported his head two women and a man bent over him and smiled their faces though black were far from unkindly they were pleased to see him stare about with such meaning in his eyes they were friendly no doubt they seemed really to take an interest in their patients recovery  but where was guy waring dead dead or run away had his halfbrother in this utmost need then so basely deserted him  for some minutes granville gazed around him half dazed and in a turmoil of surprise yet with a vivid passion of acute inquiry now he was once well awake he must know all immediately but how  who to ask this was terrible terrible he had no means of intercommunication with the people in the hut he knew none of their language nor they of his he was utterly alone among unmitigated savages  meanwhile the man and the women talked loud among themselves in their own harsh speech evidently well pleased and satisfied at their guests improvement  with a violent effort granville began to communicate with them in the language of signs which every savage knows as he knows his native tongue and in which the two englishmen had already made some progress during their stay in barolong land  pointing first to himself with one hand on his breast he held up two fingers before the observant namaqua to indicate that at first there had been a couple of them on the road both white men the latter point he still further elaborated by showing the white skin on his own bare wrist and once more holding up the two fingers demonstratively the namaqua nodded  he had seized the point well he held up two fingers in return himself then looked at his own black wrist and shook his head in dissentthey were not black men after which he touched granvilles fair forearm with his hand yes yes just so he took it in two white men  what had become of the other one granville asked in the same fashion by looking around him on all sides in dumb show inquiringly one finger only was held up now pointing about the hut one hand was laid upon his own breast to show that a single white man alone remained he glanced about him uneasily what had happened to his companion  the namaqua pointed with his finger to the door of the hut as much as to say the other man was gone  he seized every sign at once with true savage quickness  then granville tried once more was his companion dead had he been killed in a fight was that the reason of his absence he lunged forward with his hand holding an imaginary assegai he pressed on upon the foe he drove it through a body then he fell as if dead on the floor with a groan and a shriek  after which picking himself up as well as he was able and crawling back to his straw he proceeded in mute pantomime to bury himself decently  the namaqua shook his head again with a laugh of dissent oh no not like that it had happened quite otherwise the missing white man was well and vigorous a slap on his own chest sufficiently indicated that news he placed his two first fingers in the ground astride like legs and made them walk along fast one in front of the other the white man had gone away he had gone on foot granville nodded acquiescence the savage took water in a calabash and laid it on the floor then he walked once more with his fingers as if on a long and weary march to the waters brink granville nodded comprehension again he understood the signs the white man had gone away alone on footand seaward  at that instant with a sudden cry of terror the invalids hands went down to his waist where he wore the girdle that contained those precious diamondsthe diamonds that were to be the ransom of some fraction of tilgate an awful sense of desertion broke over him all at once he called aloud in his horror it was too much to believe the girdle was gone and the diamonds with it  hypocrite hypocrite thief murderer robber  he had trusted that vile creature that plausible wretch in spite of all the horrible charges he knew against him and this was the sequel of their talk that day  this was how guy waring had requited his confidence  he had stolen the fruits of eighteen months labour  granville turned to the namaqua wild with his terrible loss and pointed angrily to his loins where the diamonds were not the savage nodded looked wise and shook his head pretended to gird himself round the waist with a cloth then went over to granville who lay still in the straw undid an imaginary belt with deliberate care tied it round his own body above the other one with every appearance of prudence and forethought counted the small stones in it one by one in his hand to the exact number with grotesque fidelity and finally set his fingers to walk a second time at a rapid pace in the direction of the calabash which represented the ocean  granville fell back on his wooden pillow with a horrible groan of awakened distrust the man had gone off that was clear and had stolen his diamonds that is what comes of intrusting your life and property to a discovered murderer how could he ever have been such a fool he would never forgive himself  the desertion itself was bad enough in all conscience but it was as nothing at all in granvilles mind to the wickedness of the robbery  he might have known it of course how that fellow toiled and moiled and gloated over his wretched diamonds how little he seemed to think of the stain of blood on his hands and how much of the mere chance of making filthy lucre pah pah it was pitiable the mans whole mind was distorted by a hideous fungoid growththe love of gain which is the root of all evil for a few miserable stones he would plunder his own brother lying helpless and ill in that african hut and make off with the booty himself saving his own skin seaward  if it hadnt been for the unrequited kindness of these mere savage namaquas granville cried to himself in his bitterness he might have died of want in the open desert and now he would go down to the coast after all a ruined man penniless and friendless it was a hard thought indeed for a kelmscott to think he should have been abandoned and robbed by his own halfbrother and should owe his life now to a heathen african the tender mercies of a naked barbarian in a mudbuilt hut were better than the false friendship of his fathers son the true heir of tilgate  it was miserable pitiable the shock of that discovery threw granville back once more into a profound fever for several hours he relapsed into delirium  and the worst of it was the negroes wouldnt let him die quietly in his own plain way in the midst of it all he was dimly aware of a dose thrust down his throat  it was the namaqua administering him a pillsome nauseous native decoction no doubtwhich tasted as if it were made of stiff white paper       chapter xxxvii  aux armes      for a day or two more granville remained seriously ill in the dirty hut at the end of that time weak and wasted as he was he insisted upon getting up and setting out alone on his long march seaward  it was a wild resolve he was utterly unfit for it  the hospitable namaqua whose wives had nursed him well through that almost hopeless illness did his best to persuade the rash englishman from so mad a course by gestures and entreaties in his own mute language but granville was obstinate he would not sit down quietly and be robbed like this of the fruit of his labours  he would not be despoiled he would not be trampled upon he would make for the coast if he staggered in like a skeleton and would confront the robber with his own vile crime be it at angra pequena or cape town or london or tilgate  in short he would do much as guy himself had done when he discovered montague nevitts theft of the six thousand he would follow the villain till he ran him to earth and would tax him at last to his face with the open proofs of his consummate treachery  whats bred in the bone will out in the blood the kelmscott strain worked alike its own way in each of them  the namaqua to be sure tried in vain to explain to granville by elaborate signs that the other white man had given orders to the contrary the other white man had strictly enjoined upon him not to let the invalid escape from his hut on any pretext whatever  the other white man had promised him a reward a very large rewardmoney guns ammunitionif he kept him safely and didnt allow him to escape granville kelmscott smiled to himself a bitter cynical smile poor confiding savage he didnt know guy as well as he his brother did  and yet in the midst of it all in spite of the revulsion granville was conscious now and then of some little ingratitude somewhere to his halfbrothers memory after all guy had shown him time and again no small kindness some excuse should be made for a man who saves his own life first in very dire extremities but none no none for one who has the incredible and inhuman meanness to rob his own brother of his hardearned gams in a strange wild land when he thinks him dying  for it was the robbery not the desertion granville could never forgive the man who was capable of doing that basest of acts was capable also of murder or any crime in the decalogue  so the fevered white man rose at last one morning on his shrunken limbs and staggered as best he might from his protectors hut in a wild impulse of resolution on his mad journey seaward when the namaqua saw nothing on earth would induce him to remain he shouldered his arms and went out beside him fully equipped for fight with matchlock and assegai not that the savage made any undue pretence to a purely personal devotion to the belated white man on the contrary he signified to granville with many ingenious signs that he was afraid of losing the great reward he had been promised if once he let the invalid get out of his sight unattended  granville smiled once more that bitter smile of newborn  cynicism well let the fellow follow him if he liked he would reward him himself if ever they reached the coast in safety and in any case it was better to go attended by a native an interpreter who can communicate in their own tongue with the people through whose territory you are going to pass is always useful in a savage country  how granville got over that terrible journey  seaward he could never tell he crawled on and on supported by the faithful namaqua with unfailing goodhumour over that endless veldt for three long days of wretched footsore marching and for three long nights he slept or lay awake under the clear desert stars on the open ground of barren namaqua land it was a terrible time worn and weary with the fever granville was wholly unfit for any kind of travelling nothing but the iron constitution of the kelmscotts could ever have stood so severe an ordeal  but the son of six generations of soldiers who had commanded in the feverstricken flats of walcheren or followed wellesley through the jungles of tropical india or forced their way with napier into the depths of abyssinia was not to be daunted even by the nameless horrors of that south african desert granville still endured for three days and nights and was ready to march or crawl on once more upon the fourth morning  here however his namaqua guide with every appearance of terror made strong warnings of danger  the country beyond he signified by strange gestures lay in the hands of a hostile tribe hereditarily at war with his fellowclansmen he didnt even know whether the other white man with the diamonds round his waist had got safely through or whether the hostile tribe beyond the frontier had assegaied him and eaten him up as the picturesque native phrase goes  it was difficult enough for even a strong warrior to force his way through that district with a good company of followers impossible for a single weak invalid like granville attended only by one poor illarmed namaqua  so the savage seemed to say in his ingenious pantomime  if they went on theyd be killed and eaten up resistlessly if they stopped they might pull through  they must wait and camp there for what they were to wait granville hadnt the faintest conception but the namaqua insisted upon it and granville was helpless as a child in his hands the man was alarmed apparently for his promised reward if granville insisted he showed in very frank dumb show whya thrust with the assegai explained the rest most persuasively granville still had his revolver to be sure and  a few rounds of ball cartridge but he was too weak to show fight the savage overmastered him  they were seated on a stony ridge or sharp hogs back overlooking the valley of a dry summer stream the watershed on which they sat separated with its chine of rugged rocks the territory of the two rival tribes  but the namaqua was evidently very little afraid that the enemy might transgress the boundaries of his fellowtribesmen he dared not himself go beyond the jagged crest of the ridge but he seemed to think it pretty certain the people of the other tribe wouldnt for their part in turn come across to molest him he sat down there doggedly as if expecting something or other to turn up in the course of time and more than once he made signs to granville which the englishman interpreted to mean that after so many days and nights from some previous event unspecified somebody would arrive on the track from the coast at the point of junction between the hostile races  granville was gazing at the namaqua in the vain attempt to interpret these signs more fully to himself when all of a sudden an unexpected noise in the valley below attracted his attention he pricked up his ears impossible incredible it couldnt beyes it wasthe sharp hiss of firearms  at the very same moment the namaqua leapt to his feet in sudden alarm and shading his eyes with his dusky hand gazed intently in front of him for a minute or so he stood still with brows knit and neck craning then he called out something in an excited tone two or three times over in his own tongue to granville the englishman stared in the same direction but could make out nothing definite just at first in the full glare of the sunlight but the namaqua with a cry of joy held up his two fingers as before to symbolize the two white men and pointed with one of them to his guest while with the other he indicated some object in the valley nodding many times over granville seized his meaning at once could it be true what he said in this strange mute language could relief be at hand  could the firing beneath show that guy was returning  as he looked and strained his eyes peering down upon the red plain under the shadow of his open palm the objects by the watercourse grew gradually clearer  granville could make out now that a party of natives armed with spears and matchlocks was attacking some little encampment on the bank of the dry torrent the small force in the encampment was returning the fire with great vigour and spirit though apparently overpowered by the superior numbers of their swarming assailants even as granville looked their case grew more desperate a whole horde of black men seemed to be making an onset on some small white object most jealously guarded round which the defenders of the camp rallied with infinite energy at the head of the little band of strangers a european in a pith helmet was directing the fire and fighting hard himself for the precious white object the rest were blacks he thought in halfcivilized costume granvilles heart gave a bound as the leader sprang forth upon one approaching savage his action as he leapt stamped the man at once there was kelmscott in the leap granville knew in a second it was indeed guy waring  the namaqua recognised him too and pointed  enthusiastically forward granville saw what he meant to the front to the front if there was fighting to be done let them help their friends let them go forward and claim the great reward offered  next moment with a painful thrill of shame and remorse the englishman saw what was the nature of the object they were so jealously guarding his heart stood still within him it was a sort of sedan chair or invalid litter borne on poles by four native porters  talk about coals of fire granville kelmscott hardly knew how to forgive himself for his unworthy distrust  then guy must have reached the coast in safety after leaving him in charge of the namaqua and fighting his way through and now he was on his way back to the interior again with a sufficient escort and a palanquin to fetch him  even as he looked the assailants closed in more fiercely than ever on the faltering little band one of them thrust out with an assegai at guy in an agony of horror granville cried aloud where he stood surely surely they must be crushed to earth no arms of precision could ever avail them against such a swarm of assailants poured forth over their camp as if from some human anthill  let us run the sick man cried to the namaqua pointing to the fight below and the namaqua comprehending the gesture if not the words set forward to run with him down the slope into the valley  at about a hundred yards off from the crowd granville crouched behind a clump of thorny acacia and signalling to the namaqua to hide at the same time drew his revolver and fired pointblank at the hindmost natives  the effect was electrical in a moment the savages turned and gazed around them astonished one of their number was hit and wounded in the leg granville had aimed so purposely to maim and terrify them  the natives faltered and fell back as they did so granville emerged from the shelter of the acacia bush and fired a second shot from another point at them  at the same instant the namaqua raised a loud native battlecry and brandished his assegai the effect was electrical the hostile tribe broke up in wild panic at once they cried in their own tongue that the namaquas were down upon them under english guidance and quick as lightning they dispersed as if by magic to hide themselves about in the thick bush jungle  two seconds later guy was wringing granvilles hand in a fervour of gratitude each man had saved the others life in the rapid interchange of question and answer that followed one point alone puzzled them both for a minute or two  but why on earth didnt you leave a line to explain what youd done granville cried now thoroughly ashamed of his unbelief if only id known you were coming back to the village it would have saved me so much distress so much sleepless misery  why so i did guy answered still thoroughly out of breath and stained with blood and powder i tore a leaf from my notebook and gave it to the namaqua explaining to him by signs that he was to let you have it at once the moment you were conscious here you sir he went on turning round to their faithful black ally and holding up the notebook before his eyes to refresh his memory why didnt you give it to the gentleman as i told you  the namaqua catching hastily at the meaning from the mere tone of the question as well as from guys instinctive and graphic imitation of the act of writing pulled out from his waistband the last relics of a very brown and tattered fragment of paper on which were still legible in pencil the halfobliterated words my dear granvillei find there is no chance of conveying you to the coast through the territory of the next tribe in your present condition unless  the rest was torn off guy looked at it dubiously  but the namaqua anxious to show he had followed out all instructions to the very letter tore off the next scrap before their eyes rolled it up between his palms into a nice greasy pill and proceeded to offer it for granvilles  acceptance the misapprehension was too absurd guy went off into a hearty peal of laughter at once the namaqua had taken the mysterious signs for a very great medicine and had administered the magical paper accordingly as he understood himself to be instructed at fixed intervals to his unfortunate patient that was the medicine granville remembered having forced down his throat at the moment when he first learned as he thought his halfbrothers treachery       chapter xxxviii  news from the cape      at the holkers at chetwood one evening some days later cyril waring met elma clifford once more the first time for months and had twenty minutes talk in the tearoom alone with her contrary to his rule he had gone to the holkers party that night for a man cant remain a recluse all his life no matter how hard he tries merely because his brothers suspected of having committed a murder in course of time the attitude palls upon him for the first year after guys sudden and mysterious disappearance indeed cyril refused all invitations pointblank except from the most intimate friends the shame and disgrace of that terrible episode weighed him down so heavily that he couldnt bear to go out in the world among unsympathetic  strangers  but the deepest sorrow wears away by degrees and at the end of twelve months cyril found he could mix a little more unreservedly at last among his fellowmen the hangdog air sat ill upon his frank free nature this invitation to the holkers too had one special attraction he knew it was a house where he was almost certain of meeting elma and since elma insisted now on writing to him constantlyshe was a selfwilled young woman was elma and would have her wayhe really saw no reason on earth himself why he shouldnt meet her to meet is one thing dont you knowto marry another at least so fifty generations of young people have deluded themselves under similar circumstances into believing  elma was in the room before him prettier than ever people said in the pale red balldress which exactly suited her gipsylike eyes and creamy complexion as she entered she saw sir gilbert gildersleeve with his wife and gwendoline standing in the corner by the big piano gwendoline looked pale and preoccupied as she had always looked since granville kelmscott disappeared leaving behind him no more definite address for loveletters than simply africa and lady gildersleeve was as usual quite subdued and broken  but the judge himself consoled by his new honours seemed as time wore on to have recovered a trifle of his old blustering manner a knighthood had reassured  him he was talking to mr holker in a loud voice as  elma approached him from behind  yes a very curious coincidence he was just saying in his noisy fashion with one big burly hand held demonstratively before him a very curious and unexplained coincidence they both vanished into space about the selfsame time and nothing more has ever since been heard of them quite an arabian nights affair in its waythe enchanted carpet sort of business dont you knowwafted through the air unawares like sinbad the sailor or the oneeyed calender from london to bagdad or timbuctoo or st petersburg the other young man one understands about of course he had sufficient reasons of his own no doubt for leaving a country which had grown too warm for him but that granville kelmscott a gentleman of means the heir to such a fine estate as tilgate should disappear into infinity leaving no trace behind like a lost cometand at the very moment too when he was just about to come into the family propertywhy i call it  i call it i call it  his jaw dropped suddenly he grew deadly pale  words failed his stammering tongue do what he would he couldnt finish his sentence and yet nothing very serious had occurred to him in any way  it was merely that as he uttered these words he caught elma cliffords eye and saw lurking in it a certain gleam of deadly contempt before which the big blustering  man himself had quailed more than once in many a surrey drawingroom  for sir gilbert gildersleeve knew as well as if she had told him the truth in so many words that elma clifford suspected him of being montague nevitts murderer  elma came forward just to break the awkward pause and shook hands with the party by the piano coldly  sir gilbert tried to avoid her but with the inherited instinct of her race elma cut off his retreat she boxed him in the corner between the piano and the wall  i heard what you were saying just now sir gilbert  she murmured low but with marked emphasis after a few polite commonplaces of conversation had first passed between them and i want to ask you one question only about the matter are you so sure as you seem of what you said this minute are you so sure that mr guy waring had sufficient reasons of his own for wishing to leave the country  before that unflinching eye the great lawyer trembled  as many a witness had trembled of old under his own crossexamination but he tried to pass it off just at first with a little society banter he bowed and smiled and pretended to look archlook arch indeed with that ashen white face of hisas he answered with forced humour  my dear young lady mr guy waring as i understand  is mr cyril warings brother and as by the law of england the king can do no wrong so i suppose  elma cut him short in the middle of his sentence with an imperious gesture he had never cut short an obnoxious and intruding barrister himself with more crushing dignity  mr cyril waring has nothing at all to do with the point one way or the other the girl said severely  attend to my question what i ask is this why do you a judge who may one day be called upon to try the case venture to say on such partial evidence that mr guy waring had sufficient reasons of his own for leaving the country  called upon to try guy warings case the judge paused abashed he was very much afraid of her this girl had such a strange look about the eyes she made him tremble people said the ewes women were the descendants of a witch and there was something truly witchlike in the way elma clifford looked straight down into his eyes she seemed to see into his very soul he knew she suspected him  he shuffled and temporized well everybody says so you know he answered shrugging his shoulders carelessly and what everybody says must be true   besides if he didnt do it who did i wonder  elma pounced upon her opportunity with a womans quickness somebody else who was at mambury that day no doubt she replied with a meaning look it must have been somebody out of the few who were at mambury  that homethrust told the judges colour was livid to look upon what could this girl mean how on earth could she know how had she even found out he was at mambury at all a terrible doubt oppressed his soul had gwendoline confided his movements to elma he had warned his daughter time and again not to mention the fact for fear of misapprehension he said with shuffling eyes askance it was better nobody should know he had been anywhere near dartmoor on the day of the accident  however there was one consolation the law the law she could have no legal proof and intuition goes for nothing in a court of justice all the suspicion went against guy waring and guy waringwell guy waring had fled the kingdom in the very nick of time and was skulking now heaven alone knew where or why in the remotest depths of some far african diggings  and even as he thought it the servant opened the door and in the regulation footmans voice announced mr waring  the judge started afresh for one moment his senses deceived him sadly his mind was naturally full of guy just now and as the servant spoke he saw a handsome young man in evening dress coming up the long drawingroom with the very air and walk of the man he had met that eventful afternoon at the duke of devonshire at plymouth of course it was only cyril and a minute later the judge saw his mistake and remembered with a bitter smile how conscience makes cowards of us all as he had often remarked about shaky witnesses in his admirable perorations but elma hadnt failed to notice either the start or its reason  its only mr cyril she said pointedly not mr guy sir gilbert the name came very pat though  i dont wonder it startled you  she was crimson herself the judge moved away with a stealthy uncomfortable air he didnt half care for this uncanny young woman a girl who can read peoples thoughts like that a girl who can play with you like a cat with a mouse oughtnt to be allowed at large in society she should be shut up in a cage at home like a dangerous animal and prevented from spying out the inmost history of families  a little later elma had twenty minutes talk with cyril alone it was in the tearoom behind where the light refreshments were laid out before supper  she spoke low and seriously  cyril she said in a tone of absolute confidencethey were not engaged of course but still it had got to plain cyril and elma by this timeim surer of it than ever no matter what you say guys perfectly innocent i know it as certainly as i know my own name i cant be mistaken and the man who really did it is as i told you sir gilbert  gildersleeve  my dear child cyril answeredyou call the girl you are in love with my dear child when you mean to differ from her with an air of masculine superiorityhow on earth can that be when as i told you i have guys confession in writing under his own very hand that he really did it  i dont care a pin for that elma cried with a true womans contempt for anything so unimportant as mere positive evidence perhaps sir gilbert made him do it somehowcompelled him or coerced him or willed him or somethingi dont understand these new notionsor perhaps he got him into a scrape and then hadnt the courage or the manliness to get him out of it but at any rate i can answer for one thing i were to go to the stake for itsir gilbert gildersleeve  is the man whos really guilty  as she spoke a great shadow darkened the door of the room for a moment ominously sir gilbert looked in with a lady on his armthe inevitable dowager who refreshes herself continuously at frequent intervals through six hours of entertainment when he saw those two têteàtête he drew back somewhat  disconcerted  dont lets go in there lady knowles he whispered to the dowager by his side a pair of young people discussing their hearts we were once young ourselves  its a pity to disturb them  and he passed on across the hall towards the great refreshmentroom opposite  well i dont know cyril said bitterly as the judge disappeared through the opposite door i wish i could agree with you but i cant i cant the burden of its heavier than my shoulders can bear  guys weak i know and might be led half unawares into certain sorts of crime yet i only knew one man ever likely to lead himand that was poor nevitt himself  not sir gilbert gildersleeve whom he hardly even knew to speak to  as he paused and reflected a servant with a salver came up and looked into cyrils face inquiringly  beg your pardon sir he said hesitating but i think youre mr waring  thats my name cyril answered with a faint blush on his cheek do you want to speak to me  yes sir theres halfacrown to pay for porterage if you please a telegram for you sir  cyril pulled out the halfacrown and tore open the telegram its contents were indeed enough to startle him it was dated cape town and was as brief as is the wont of cable messages at nine shillings a word  coming home immediately to repay everything and stand my trial kelmscott accompanies me all wellguy waring  cyril looked at it with a gasp and handed it on to elma elma took it in her dainty gloved fingers and read it through with keen eyes of absorbing interest  cyril sighed a profound sigh elma glanced back at him all triumph i told you so she said in a very jubilant voice he wouldnt do that if he didnt know he was innocent  at the very same second a blustering voice was heard above the murmur in the hall without  what halfacrown for porterage it exclaimed in indignant tones why thats a clear imposition  the people at my house ought never to have sent it on its addressed to woodlands unimportant unimportant here gwendoline take your messagesome milliners or dressmakers appointment for tomorrow i suppose halfacrown for porterage  theyd no right to bring it  gwendoline took the telegram with trembling hands tore it open all quivers and broke into a cry of astonishment then she fell all at once into her fathers arms elma understood it all it was a similar message from granville kelmscott to tell the lady of his heart he was coming home to marry her  sir gilbert somewhat flustered called for water in haste and revived the fainting girl by bathing her temples at last he took up the cause of the mischief himself as he read it his own face turned white as death elma noticed that too and no wonder it didfor these were the words of that unexpected message  coming home to claim you by the next mail guy waring accompanies megkanville kelmscott       chapter xxxix  a gleam of light      next day but one the companion of st michael and st george came in to craighton with evil tidings he had heard in the village that sir gilbert gildersleeve was illvery seriously ill the judge had come home from the holkers the other evening much upset by the arrival of gwendolines telegram  though why on earth should that upset him mr  clifford continued screwing up his small face with a very wise air is more than i can conceive for im sure the gildersleeves angled hard enough in their time to catch young kelmscott by hook or by crook for their gawky daughter and now that young kelmscott telegraphs over to say hes coming home post haste to marry her miss gwendoline faints away if you please as she reads the news and the judge himself goes upstairs as soon as he gets home and takes to his bed incontinently but there the ways of the world are really inscrutable what reconciles me to life every day i grow older is that its so amusingso intensely amusing you never know whats going to turn up next and what you least expect is what most often happens  elma however received his news with a very grave face  is he really ill do you think papa she asked somewhat anxiously or is he onlywellonly frightened  mr clifford stared at her with a blank leathery face of selfsatisfied incomprehension  frightened he repeated solemnly sir gilbert gildersleeve frightened and of granville kelmscott too thats true wit elma the juxtaposition of the incongruous why what on earth has the man got to be frightened of i should like to know  no no hes really ill very seriously ill humphreys says the case is a most peculiar one and hes telegraphed up to town for a specialist to come down this afternoon and consult with him  and indeed sir gilbert was really very ill this unexpected shock had wholly unmanned him to say the truth the judge had begun to look upon guy waring as practically lost and upon the matter of montague nevitts death as closed for ever waring no doubt had gone to africaunder a false nameand proceeded to the diamond fields direct where he had probably been killed in a lucky quarrel with some brother digger or stuck through with an assegai by some enterprising zulu and nobody had even taken the trouble to mention it  its so easy for a man to get lost in the crowd in the dark continent why there was granville kelmscott  evena young fellow of means and the heir of tilgate about whom gwendoline was always moaning and groaning poor girl and wouldnt be comfortedthere was granville kelmscott gone out to africa and hi presto disappeared into space without a vapour or a trace like a conjurers shilling it was all very queer but then queer things are the way in africa  to be sure sir gilbert had his qualms of conscience too over having thus sent off guy waring as he believed to his grave in cape colony he was not at heart a bad man though he was pushing and selfish and selfseeking and to a certain extent evenof lateunscrupulous he had his bad halfhours every now and again with his own moral consciousness but he had learnt to stifle his doubts and to keep down his terrors after all he had told guy no more than the truth and if guy in his panicterror chose to run away and get killed in south africa that was no fault of hished only tried to warn the fellow of an  impending danger alls well that ends well and today guy waring was lost or dead while he himself was a judge and a knight to boot with all trace of his crime destroyed for ever  so he said to himself rejoicing the very day granville  kelmscotts telegram arrived but now that he stood face to face again with that pressing terror his thoughts on the matter were very different strange to say his first idea was this what a disgraceful shame of that fellow waring to come to life again thus suddenly  on purpose to annoy him he was really angry nay more indignant such shuffling was inexcusable  if waring meant to give himself up and stand his trial like a man why the dickens didnt he do it immediately after thewell the accident what did he mean by going off for eighteen months undiscovered and leaving one to build up fresh plans in life like thisand then coming home on a sudden just on purpose to upset them it was simply disgraceful  sir gilbert felt injured this man waring was wronging  him eighteen months before he was keenly aware that he was unjustly casting a vile and hideous suspicion  on an innocent person but in the intervening period his moral sense had got largely blunted familiarity  with the hateful plot had warped his ideas about it their places were reversed sir gilbert was really aggrieved now that guy waring should turn up again and should venture to vindicate his deeplywronged character  the man was as good as dead well and he ought to have stopped so or else he ought never to have died at all he ought to have kept himself continually in evidence but to go away for eighteen months unknown  and unheard of till ones sense of security had had time to reestablish itself and then to turn up again like this without one minutes warningoh it was infamous scandalous the fellow must be devoid of all consideration for others sir gilbert wiped his clammy brow with those ample hands what on earth was he to do for his wife and for gwendoline  and gwendoline was so happy too over granville kelmscotts return how could he endure that granville  kelmscotts return should be the signal for discovering her fathers sin and shame to her if only he could have married her off before it all came out or if only he could die before the man was triedtried  sir gilberts eyes started from his head with horror  what was that elma clifford suggested the other night whyif the man was arrested he would be arrested at plymouth the moment he landed and would be tried for murder at the western assizes and it was he himself sir gilbert gildersleeve who was that term to take the western circuit  he would be called upon to sit on the bench himself and try guy waring for the murder he had himself committed  no wonder that thought sent him ill to bed at once  he lay and tossed all night long in speechless agony and terror it was an appalling night next morning he was found delirious with fever  when the news reached elma she saw its full and fatal significance cyril had stopped on for three days at the holkers and he came over in the course of the morning to take a walk across the fields with her  elma was profoundly excited cyril could hardly see why  this is a terrible thing she said about sir gilberts illness what im afraid of now is that he may die before your brother returns the shock must have been awful for him mamma noticed it every bit as much as i did and so did miss ewes they both said at once this blow will kill him and they both knew why cyril as well as i did its the ewes intuition weve all of us got it and we all of us say at once and unanimouslyit was sir gilbert gildersleeve  but suppose he did die cyril asked still sceptical as he always was when elma got upon her instinctive consciousness what difference would that make if guys innocent as i suppose in some way he must be from the tone of his telegram hell be acquitted whether sir gilberts alive or not and if hes guilty  he broke off suddenly with an awful pause the other alternative was too terrible to contemplate  but hes not guilty elma answered with confidence  i know it more surely now than ever and the difficultys  this nobody knows the real truth i feel certain except sir gilbert gildersleeve and if sir gilbert dies unconfessed the truth dies with him and then she paused a moment im half afraid she went on with a doubtful sigh your brothers been too precipitate in coming home to face it  but elma cyril cried i cant bear to say ityet one must face the factshow on earth can he be innocent when i tell you again and again he wrote to me himself saying he really did it  you never showed me that letter elma answered with a faint undercurrent of reproach in her tone  how could i cyril replied even to you elma there are some things a man can hardly bear to speak about  i have more faith than you cyril elma answered  ive never given up believing in guy all the time i believe in him stillbecause i know hes your brother  there was a short pause during which neither spoke  they walked along together looking at each others faces with half downcast eyes but with the not unpleasant sense of mute companionship and sympathy in a great sorrow at last elma spoke again  there was one thing in guys telegram she said i didnt quite understand coming home immediately  to repay everything what did he mean by that what has that got to do with mr nevitts disappearance  oh that was quite another matter cyril answered blushing deep with shame for he couldnt bear to let elma know guy was a forger as well as a murderer  that was something purely personal between us two  hehe owed me money  elmas keen eyes read him through at a glance  but he said it all in one sentence she objected as if the two went naturally together coming home immediately to repay everything and stand my trial  cyril cyril youve held something back i believe theres some fearful mistake here somewhere  you think so cyril answered feeling more and more uncomfortable  im sure of it elma replied with a thrill reading his thoughts still deeper oh cyrilshe seized his arm with a convulsive gripfor heavens sake go and get it let me see that letter  i have it here cyril answered pulling it out with some shame from montague nevitts pocketbook which he wouldnt destroy and dared not leave about for prying eyes to light upon ive carried it day and night ever since about with me  elma seized it from his hands and sat down upon a stile and read it through with profound attention  at the end she handed it back and tears stood in her eyes cyril she said half laughing hysterically and half crying as she spoke youve been doing that poor fellow a deep injustice oh dont you seedont you see it that isnt the letter of a man who has committed a murder its the letter of a man who has unwittingly and unwillingly done you some personal wrong and is eager to repair it my darling my darling youve misread it altogether it isnt about montague nevitts death at all its about nothing an earth but some private money matter more than that when it was written guy didnt yet know mr nevitt was dead  he didnt know he was suspected he didnt know anything i wonder you dont see i wish to heaven youd shown me that letter months ago sir gilbert fastened suspicion on the wrong man and this letter has made you accept it too easily guy went to africathats as plain as words can put itto make money of his own to repay what he owed you and its this the purely personal and unimportant charge hes coming home to give himself up upon  a light seemed to burst on cyrils mind as she spoke for the very first time he felt a gleam of hope elma was right after all he believed guy was wholly innocent of the greater crime and his heartbroken letter had only meant to deal with the question of the forgery  but cyril had heard of the murder first and had had that most in his mind when the letter reached him so he interpreted it at once as referring to the capital charge and never dreamt for a moment of its real narrower meaning  that evening when the messenger came back from kind inquiries at woodlands elma asked with hushed awe how sir gilbert was going on  very poorly miss the servant answered the doctor says hes sunk dreadful low and the butler thinks he has something on his mind he cant get out in his wanderings hes in a terrible bad way they wouldnt be astonished if he dont live to morning  so elma went to bed that night trembling most for the result of sir gilberts illness       chapter xl  the bolt falls      all the way home on that long journey from cape town as the two halfbrothers lounged on deck together in their canvas chairs granville kelmscott was wholly at a loss to understand what seemed to him guy warings unaccountable and almost incredible levity the mans conduct didnt in the least resemble that of a person who is returning to give himself up on a charge of wilful murder on the contrary guy showed no signs of remorse or mental agony in any way he seemed rather elated instead at the pleasing thought that he was going home with his diamonds all turned at the cape into solid coin to make his peace once more with his brother cyril  to be sure at times he did casually allude to some expected unpleasantness when he arrived in england yet he treated it granville noticed as though hanging were at worst but a temporary inconvenience granville wondered whether after all he could have some complete and crushing answer to that appalling charge on any other supposition his spirits and his talk were really little short of what one might expect from a madman  and indeed now and again granville did really begin to suspect that something had gone wrong  somewhere with guy warings intellect the more he thought over it the more likely did this seem for guy talked on with the greatest composure about his plans for the future when this difficulty was cleared up as though a trial for murder were a most ordinary occurrencean accident that might happen to any gentleman any day and if so was it possible that guy had gone wrong in his head before the affray with montague nevitt that seemed likely enough for when granville remembered guys invariable gentleness and kindness to himself his devotion in sickness and in the trials of the desert his obvious aversion to do harm to any one and above all his heartfelt  objection to shedding human blood granville was  constrained to believe his newly found halfbrother if ever he committed the murder at all must have  committed it while in a state of unsound mind deserving rather of pity than of moral reprehension he  comforted himself indeed with this consoling ideahe could never believe a kelmscott of tilgate when clothed and in his right mind could be guilty of such a detestable and motiveless crime as the wilful murder of montague nevitt  strangely enough moreover the subject that seemed most to occupy guy warings mind on the voyage home was not his forthcoming trial on a capital charge but the future distribution of the tilgate property  was he essentially a moneygrubber granville wondered to himself as he had thought him at first in the diamond fields in barolong land was he incapable of thinking about anything but filthy lucre no that was clearly not the true solution of the problem for whenever guy spoke to him about the subject it was generally to say one and the selfsame thing  in this matter i feel i can speak for cyril as i speak for myself neither of us would wish to deprive  you now of what youve always been brought up to consider as your own neither of us would wish to dispossess lady emily the most we would desire is thisto have our position openly acknowledged and settled before the world we should like it to be known we were the lawful sons of a brave man and an honest woman and if you wish voluntarily to share with us some part of our fathers estate well be willing to enter into a reasonable arrangement by which yon yourself can retain tilgate park and the mass of the property that immediately appertains to it im sure cyril would no more wish to be grasping in this matter than i am and after all that you and i have gone through together granville i dont think yon need doubt the sincerity of my feelings towards you  he spoke so sensibly he spoke so manfully he spoke so kindly always with a bright gleam in those tender eyes that granville hardly knew what to make of his evident confidence surely a man couldnt be mad who could speak like that and yet whenever he alluded in any way to his return to england it was always as though he ignored the gravity and heinousness of the charge brought against him it was as though murder was an accident for which one was hardly responsible  granville couldnt make him out at all the fellow was an enigma to him there was so much that was good in him and yet there must be so much that was bad as well he was such a delicate considerate selfeffacing  gentlemanand yet if one could believe what he himself more than once as good as admitted he was a criminal a felon an open murderer  still even so granville couldnt turn his back upon the brother who had seen him so bravely across the terrors of namaqua land he thought of how he had misjudged him once before and how much he had repented it whether guy was a murderer or not granville felt the man he had saved at least could never forsake him  the night before their arrival at plymouth guy was in unusually high spirits his mirth was contagious  everybody on board was delighted at the prospect of reaching land but guy was more delighted and more sanguine than anybody he was sure in his own mind this difficulty must have blown over long before now cyril must have explained nevitt must have confessed  everything must have been set right and his own good name satisfactorily rehabilitated for more than eighteen months he had heard nothing from england tomorrow he would see cyril and account for everything he had money to set all righthis hardearned money got at the risk of his own life in the dreary deserts of barolong land all would yet be well and cyril would marry and elma clifford would be the mistress of nearly half the tilgate property  it was all so different granville he said to his friend confidentially as they paced the deck after supper cigar in mouth when you first went out and we didnt know one another then i distrusted you and you distrusted me we didnt understand one anothers characters but now we can settle it all as a family affair men who have camped out together under the open sky on the african veldt who have run the gauntlet of korannas and barolong and namaqua who have stood by one another in sickness and in fight neednt be afraid of disagreeing about their money matters in england cyril will meet us tomorrow and talk it all over and im not the least troubled about the result either for you or for him the same blood runs in all our veins alike whatever you propose  hell be ready to agree to hes the very best fellow that ever lived and when he hears what i have to say about you hell welcome you as a brother and be as fond of you as i am  next morning early they reached plymouth harbour  as they entered the mouth of the breakwater the tender came alongside to convey them ashore guy looked over the bulwarks and saw cyril waiting for him in a fervour of delight at the sight of the green fields and the soft hills of old englandthe beautiful hoe and the solid stone houses and the familiar face turned up to welcome himguy waved his handkerchief  round and round his head in triumph to which demonstration cyril as he fancied responded but coldly  a chill fell upon his heart this was bad but still after all he could hardly expect cyril to know intuitively  under what sinister influence he had signed that fatal cheque and yet he was disappointed his heart had jumped so hard at sight of cyril he could hardly believe cyril wasnt glad to see him  as he stepped into the tender from the gangway just ready to rush up and shake cyrils hand fervently a resolutelooking man by the side of the steps laid a very firm grip on his shoulder with an air of authority  guy waring he said interrogatively  and guy turning pale answered without flinching  yes my names guy waring  then youre my prisoner the man said in a very firm voice im an inspector of constabulary  on what charge guy exclaimed half taken aback at this promptitude  i have a warrant against you sir the inspector answered as you are no doubt aware for the wilful murder of montague nevitt on the 17th of august year before last at mambury in devonshire  the words fell upon guys ears with all the suddenness  and crushing force of an unexpected thunderbolt  wilful murder he cried taken aback by the charge wilful murder of montague nevitt at mambury  oh no you cant mean that montague nevitt dead montague nevitt murdered and at mambury too there must be some mistake somewhere  no theres no mistake at all this time the inspector said quietly slipping a pair of handcuffs unobstrusively into his pocket as he spoke if you come along with me without any unnecessary noise we wont trouble to iron you but youd better say as little as possible about the charget just now for whatever you say may be used in evidence at the trial against you  guy turned to cyril with an appealing look  cyril he cried what does all this mean is nevitt dead its the very first word ive ever heard about it  cyrils heart gave a bound of wild relief at those words the moment guy said it his brother knew he spoke the simple truth  why guy he answered with a fierce burst of joy then youre not a murderer after all youre innocent youre innocent and for eighteen months all england has thought you guilty and ive lived under the burden of being universally considered a murderers brother  guy looked him back in the face with those truthful grey eyes of his  cyril he said solemnly im as innocent of this charge as you or granville kelmscott here i never even heard one whisper of it before i dont know what it means i dont know who they want till this moment i thought montague nevitt was still alive in england  and as he said it granville kelmscott too saw he was speaking the truth impossible as he found it in his own mind to reconcile those strange words with all that guy had said to him in the wilds of namaqua land he couldnt look him in the face without seeing at a glance how profound and unexpected was this sudden surprise to him he was right in saying im as innocent of this charge as you or granville kelmscott  but the inspector only smiled a cynical smile and answered calmly  thats for the jury to decide we shall hear more of this then youll be tried at the assizes meanwhile  the less said the sooner mended       chapter xli  what judge      for many days meanwhile sir gilbert had hovered between life and death and elma had watched his illness daily with profound and absorbing interest  for in her deep intuitive way she felt certain to herself  that their one chance now lay in sir gilberts own sense of remorse and repentance she didnt yet know to be surewhat sir gilbert himself knewthat if he recovered he would in all probability have to sit in trial on another man for the crime he had himself committed but she did feel thisthat sir gilbert would surely never stand by and let an innocent man die for his own transgression  if he recovered that was to say but perhaps he would not recover perhaps his life would flicker out by degrees in the midst of his delirium and he would go to his grave unconfessed and unforgiven perhaps even for his wifes and daughters sake he would shrink from revealing what elma felt to be the truth and would rest content to die leaving guy waring to clear himself at the trial as best he might from this hateful accusation  it would be unjust it would be criminal yet sir gilbert might do it  elma had a bad time therefore during all those long days even before guy returned to england she knew his life hung by a slender thread which sir gilbert gildersleeve might cut short at any moment  but her anxiety was as nothing compared to sir gilberts own that unhappy man a moral coward at heart in spite of all his blustering lay writhing in his own room now very ill and longing to be worse longing to die as the easiest way out of this impossible difficulty for his wifes sake for gwendolines sake it was better he should die and if only he could he would have left guy waring to his fate contentedly  his anger against guy burnt so bright now at last that he would have sacrificed him willingly provided he was not there himself to see and know it what did the man mean by living on to vex him over and over again the unhappy judge wished himself dead and prayed to be taken but that powerful frame though severely broken by the shock seemed hardly able to yield up its life merely because its owner was anxious to part with it  after a fortnights severe illness hovering all the time between hope and fear the doctor came one day and looked at him hard  how is he lady gildersleeve asked seeing him hold his breath and consider  to her great surprise the doctor answered better against all hope better and indeed sir gilbert was once more convalescent a week or two abroad it was said would restore him completely  then elma had another terrible source of doubt  would the doctors order sir gilbert abroad so long that he would be out of england when the trial took place  if so he might miss many pricks of remorse she must take some active steps to arouse his conscience  sir gilbert himself now recovering fast fought hard as well he might for such leave of absence he was quite unfit he said to return to his judicial work so soon though he had said nothing about it in public before this was the tenor of his talk he was a man of profound but restrained feelings and he had felt he would admit the absence of gwendolines loverespecially when combined with the tragic death of colonel kelmscott the father and the memory of the unpleasantness that had once subsisted through the colonels blind obstinacy between the two houses  this sudden news of the young mans return had given him a nervous shock of which few would have believed him capable you wouldnt think to look at me sir gilbert said plaintively smoothing down his bedclothes with those elephantine hands of his i was the sort of man to be knocked down in this way and the great specialist from london gazing at him with a smile admitted to himself that he certainly would not have thought it  oh nonsense my dear sir the specialist answered however to all his appeals this is the merest passing  turn i assure you i couldnt conscientiously say youd be unfit for duty by the time the assizes come round again its clear to me on the contrary with a physique like yours youll pull yourself together in something less than no time with a week or so at spa  before youre due in england to take up harness again youll be walking miles at a stretch over those heathery hills there convalescence with a man like you is a rapid process in a fortnight from today ill venture to guarantee youll be in a fit condition to swim the channel on your back or to take one of your famous fiftymile tramps across the bogs of dartmoor ill give you a tonic thatll set your nerves all right at once youll come back from spa as fresh as a daisy  to spa accordingly sir gilbert went and from spa came trembling letters now and again between gwendoline  and elma gwendoline was very anxious papa should  get well soon she said for she wanted to be home before the cape steamer arrived you know why elma but sir gilbert didnt return before guys arrival in england for all that the papers continued to give bulletins of his health and to speculate  on the probability of his returning in time to do the western circuit elma remained in a fever of doubt and anxiety to her much depended now on the question of sir gilberts presence or absence for if he was indeed to try the case she felt certain to herself it must work upon his remorse and compel confession  meanwhile preparations went on in england for guys approaching trial the magistrates committed the grand jury of course found a true bill all england rang with the strange news that the man guy waring the murderer of mr montague nevitt some eighteen months before had returned at last of his own free will and had given himself up to take his trial  gildersleeve was to be the judge they said or if he were too ill atkins atkins was as sure as a gun to hang him people thoughtthat was atkinss wayand besides the evidence against the man though in a sense circumstantial was so absolutely overwhelming that acquittal seemed impossible  five to two was freely offered on change that theyd hang him  the case was down for first hearing at the assizes  the night before the trial elma clifford who had hurried to devonshire with her mother to see and hear allshe couldnt help it she said she felt she must be presentelma clifford looked at the evening paper with a sickening sense of suspense and anxiety a paragraph caught her eye we understand that after all mr justice gildersleeve still finds himself too unwell to return to england for the western assizes and his place will therefore most probably be taken by mr justice atkins the calendar is a heavy one and includes the interesting case of mr guy waring charged with the wilful murder of montague nevitt at mambury in devonshire  elma laid down the paper with a swimming head  too ill to return she wasnt at all surprised at it  it was almost more than human nature could stand for a man to sit as judge over another to investigate the details of the crime he had himself committed but the suggestion of his absence ruined her peace of mind she couldnt sleep that night she felt sure now there was no hope left guy would almost certainly  be convicted of murder  next morning she took her seat in court with her mother and cyril as soon as the assize hall was opened to the public but her cheek was very pale and her eyes were weary places had been assigned them by the courtesy of the authorities as persons interested in the case and elma looked eagerly towards the door in the corner by which as the usher told her the judge was to enter there was a long interval and the usual unseemly turmoil of laughing and talking went on among the spectators in the well below  some of them had operaglasses and stared about them freely others quizzed the counsel the officers and the witnesses then a hush came over them and the door opened cyril was merely aware of the usual formalities and of a judicial wig making its way with slow dignity to the vacant bench but elma leaned forward in a tumult of feeling her face all at once turned scarlet with excitement  whats the matter darling her mother asked in a sympathetic tone noticing that something had profoundly  stirred her  and elma answered with bated breath in almost inarticulate tones dont you see dont you see mother just look at the judge its himself its sir gilbert  and so indeed it was against all hope he had come over at the very last moment a telegram had been handed to the convalescent at spa  fallen from my horse a nasty tumble  sustained severe internal injuries impossible to go the  western circuit relieve me if you can wire replyatkins  sir gilbert as he received it had just come in from a long ride across the wild moors that stretch away from spa towards han and looked the picture of health robust and fresh and ruddy he glowed with bodily vigour no suspense could kill him refusal under such circumstances was clearly impossible he saw he must go or resign his post at once so with an agitated heart he wired acquiescence took the next train tobrussels and calais and caught the dover boat just in time for acceptance and now he was there to try guy waring for the murder of the man he himself had killed in the tangle at mambury       chapter xlii  unexpected evidence      when sir gilbert gildersleeve left spa he left with a ruddy glow of recovered health on his bronzed red cheek for in spite of anxiety and repentance and doubt the mans iron frame would somehow still assert itself when he took his seat on the bench in court that morning he looked so haggard and ill with fatigue and remorse that even elma clifford herself pitied him  a hushed whisper ran round among the spectators below that the judge wasnt fit to try the case before him and indeed he wasnt for it was his own trial not guy warings he was really presiding over  he sat down in his place a ghastly picture of pallid despair the red colour had faded altogether from his wan white cheeks his eyes were dreamy and bloodshot  with long vigil his big hands trembled like a womans as he opened his notebook his mouth twitched nervously so utter a collapse in such a man as he was seemed nothing short of pitiable to every spectator  counsel for the crown stared him steadily in the face counsel for the crownforbesewing qcwas an old forensic enemy who had fought many a hard battle against gildersleeve with scant interchange of courtesy when both were members of the junior bar together but now sir gilberts look moved even him to pity i think my lord the qc suggested with a sympathetic simper your lordships too ill to open the court today perhaps the proceedings had better be adjourned for the present  no no the judge answered almost testily shaking his sleeve with impatience ill have no putting off for trifles in the court where i sit theres a capital case to come on this morning when a mans necks at stakewhen a matter of life and deaths at issuei dont like to keep any one longer in suspense than i absolutely need delay would be cruel  as he spoke he lifted his eyesand caught elma cliffords the judge let his own drop again in speechless agony elmas never flinched neither gave a sign but elma knew as well as sir gilbert knew himself it was his own life and death the judge was thinking of and not guy warings  as you will my lord counsel for the crown responded demurely it was your lordships convenience we all had at heart rather than the prisoners  eh whats that the judge said sharply with a suspicious frown then he recovered himself with a start for a moment he had half fancied that fellow forbesewing meant something by what he saidmeant to poke innuendoes at him but after all it was a mere polite form how frightened we all are to be sure when we know were on our trial  the opening formalities were soon got over and then amid a deep hush of breathless lips guy waring of staple inn holborn gentleman was put upon his trial for the wilful murder of montague nevitt eighteen months before at mambury in devon  guy standing in the dock looked puzzled and distracted rather than alarmed or terrified his cheek was pale to be sure and his eyes were weary but as elma glanced from him hastily to the judge on the bench she had no hesitation in settling in her own mind which of the two looked most at that moment like a detected murderer before the faces of his accusers  guy was calm and selfcontained sir gilberts mute agony was terrible to behold yet strange to say no one else in court save elma seemed to note it as she did people saw the judge was ill but that was all  perhaps his wig and robes helped to hide the effect of conscious guiltnobody suspects a judge of murder perhaps all eyes were more intent on the prisoner  be that as it might counsel for the crown opened with a statement of what they meant to prove set forth in the familiar forensic fashion they didnt pretend the evidence against the accused was absolutely conclusive  or overwhelming in character it was inferential only but not circumstantialinferential in such a cumulative and convincing way as could leave no moral doubt on any intelligent mind as to the guilt of the prisoner they would show that a clbse intimacy had long existed between the prisoner waring and the deceased gentleman mr montague nevitt witnesses would be called who would prove to the court that just before the murder this intimacy owing to circumstances which could not fully be cleared up had passed suddenly into intense enmity and open hatred the landlord of the inn at mambury and other persons to be called would speak to the fact that prisoner had followed his victim in hot blood into devonshire and had tracked him to the retreat where he was passing his holiday alone and incognitohad tracked him with every expression of indignant anger and had uttered plain threats of personal violence towards him  nor was that all it would be shown that on the afternoon of warings visit to mambury mr nevitt who possessed an intense love of nature in her wildest and most romantic moodsits always counsels cue for the prosecution to set the victims character in the most amiable light and so win the sympathy of the jury as against the accusedmr nevitt that close student of natural beauty had strolled by himself down a certain woodland path known as the tangle which led through the loneliest and leafiest quarter of mambury  chase along the tumbling stream described as the mamwater ten minutes after he had passed the gate a material witness would show them the prisoner waring presented himself and pointedly asked whether his victim had already gone down the path before him  he was told that that was so thereupon the prisoner opened the gate and followed excitedly what happened  next no living eye but the prisoners ever saw  montague nevitt was not destined to issue from that wood alive two days later his breathless body was found all stiff and stark hidden among the brown bracken at the bottom of the dell where the murderer no doubt had thrust it away out of his sight on that fatal afternoon in fear and trembling  halfway through the opening speech sir gilberts heart beat fast and hard he had never heard forbesewing  open a case so well the man would be hanged  he felt sure of it he could see it for a while the judge almost gloated over that prospect of release what was guys life to him now by the side of his wifes and gwendolines happiness but as counsel uttered the words what happened next no living eye but the prisoners ever saw he looked hard at guy  not a quiver of remorse or of guilty knowledge passed over the young mans face but elma clifford for her part looked at the judge on the bench their eyes met once more again sir gilberts fell oh heavens how terrible even for gwendolines sake he could never stand this appalling suspense but perhaps after all the prosecution might fail there was still a chance left that the jury might acquit him  so torn by conflicting emotions he sat there still stiff and motionless in his seat as an egyptian statue  then counsel went on to deal in greater detail with the question of motive there were two motives the prosecution proposed to allege first the known enmity of recent date between the two parties believed to have reference to some business dispute and secondlyhere counsel dropped his voice to a very low keyhe was sorry to suggest it but the evidence bore it outmere  vulgar love of gainthe commonplace thirst after filthy lucre they would bring witnesses to show that when mr montague nevitt was last seen alive he was in possession of a pocketbook containing a very large large sum in bank of england notes of high value from the moment of his death that pocketbook had disappeared and nobody knew what had since become of it it was not upon the body when the body was found and all their efforts to trace the missing notes whose numbers were not known had been unhappily unsuccessful  guy listened to all this impeachment in a dazed dreamy way he hardly knew what it meant it appalled and chilled him the web of circumstances was too thick for him to break he couldnt understand it himself and what was far worse he could give no active assistance to his own lawyers on the question of the noteswhich might be very important evidence against himwithout further prejudicing his case by confessing the forgery at all hazards he was determined to keep that quiet now cyril had never spoken to a soul of that episode and to speak of it as things stood would have been certain death to him i would be to supply the one missing link of motive which the prosecution needed to complete their chain of cumulative evidence  it was some comfort to him to think however that the secret was safe in cyrils keeping cyril had all the remaining notes still unchanged in his possession and the prosecution knowing nothing of the forgery or its sequel had no clue at all as to where they came from  but as for sir gilbert he listened still with everdeepening horror his mind swayed to and fro between hope and remorse they were making the man guilty and gwendoline would be saved they were making the man guilty and a gross wrong would be perpetrated great drops of sweat stood colder than ever on his burning brow he couldnt have believed forbesewing could have done it so well he was weaving a close web round an innocent man with consummate forensic skill and cunning  the case went on to its second stage witnesses were called and guy listened to them dreamily all of them bore out counsels opening statement every man in court felt the evidence was going very hard against the prisoner theyd caught the right man that was clearso the spectators opined theyd proved it to the hilt this fellow would swing for it  at last the landlord of the talbot arms at mambury shuffled slowly into the witnessbox he was a heavy dull man and he gave evidence as to nevitts stay under an assumed namewhich counsel explained suggestively by the deceased gentlemans profound love of retirement and as to guys angry remarks and evident indignation  but the most sensational part of all his evidence was that which related to the pocketbook montague nevitt was carrying at the time of his death containing notes he should say for several hundredpounds or it murt be thousandsand yet again it mustnt which had totally disappeared since the day of the murder  diligent search had been made for the pocketbook everywhere by the landlord and the police but it had vanished into space leaving not a wrack behind as junior counsel for the prosecution poetically phrased it  at the words cyril mechanically dived his hand into his pocket as he had done a hundred times a day before during these last eighteen months to assure himself that that most incriminating and unwelcome object was still safely ensconced in its usual restingplace yes there it was sure enough as snug as ever he sighed and pulled his hand out again nervously with a little jerk something came with it that fell on the floor with a jingle by his neighbours feet cyril turned crimson then deadly pale he snatched at the object but his neighbour picked it up and examined it cursorily its flap had burst open with the force of the fall and on the inside the finder read with astonishment in very plain letters the very name of the murdered man montague nevitt  cyril held out his hand to recover it impatiently  but the finder was too much taken back at his strange discovery to part with it so readily it was full of moneybank of england notes and through the transparent paper of the outermost among them the finder could dimly read the words one hundred  he rose in his place and held the pocketbook aloft in his hand with a triumphant gesture cyril tried in vain to clutch at it the witness turned round sharply disturbed by this incident whats that the judge exclaimed puckering his brows in disapprobation and looking angrily towards the disturber  if you please my lord the innkeeper answered letting his jaw drop slowly in almost speechless amazement  thats the thing i was atalking of thats mr  nevitts pocketbook  hand it up the judge said shortly gazing hard with all his eyes at the mute evidence so tendered  the finder handed it up without note or comment  sir gilbert turned the book over in blank surprise  he was dumfoundered himself for a minute or two he examined it carefully inside and out yes there was no mistake it was really what they called it montague nevitt was written in plain letters on the leather flap within lay halfadozen engraved visitingcards  a foreign office passport in nevitts name and thirty bank of england notes for one hundred pounds apiece this was indeed a mystery  where did it come from the judge asked drawing  a painfully deep breath and handing it across to the jury  and the finder answered if you please my lord the gentleman next to me pulled it out of his pocket  who is he the judge inquired with a sinking heart for he himself knew perfectly well who was the unhappy possessor  and a thrill of horror ran round the crowded court as forbesewing answered in a very distinct voice mr cyril waring my lord the brother of the prisoner       chapter xliii  sir gilberts temptation      cyril felt all was up elma glanced at him trembling  this was horrible inconceivable inexplicable fatal  the very stars in their courses seem to fight against guy blind chance checkmated them no hope was left now save in gilbert gildersleeves own sense of justice  but sir gilbert gildersleeve sat there transfixed with horror no answering gleam now shot through his dull glazed eye for he alone knew that whatever made the case against the prisoner look worse made his own position each moment more awful and more intolerable  through the rest of the case cyril sat in his place like a stone figure counsel for the crown generously abstained from putting him into the witnessbox to give testimony against his brother or rather they thought the facts themselves as they had just come out in court more telling for the jury than any formal evidence the only other witness of importance was therefore the lad who had sat on the gate by the entrance to the tangle as he scrambled into the box sir gilberts anxiety grew visibly deeper and more acute than ever for the boy was the one person who had seen him at mambury on the day of the murder and on the boy depended his sole chance of being recognised at tavistock eighteen months before sir gilbert had left the crossexamination of this witness in the hands of a junior and the boy hadnt noticed him sitting down among the bar with gown and wig on but today it was impossible the boy shouldnt see him and if the boy should recognise himwhy then heaven help him  the lad gave his evidenceinchief with great care and deliberateness he swore positively to guy and wasnt for a moment to be shaken in crossexamination  he admitted he had been mistaken at tavistock and confused the prisoner with cyrilwhen he saw one of them apartbut now that he saw em both together before his eyes at once why he could take his solemn oath as sure as fate upon him guys counsel failed utterly to elicit anything of importance exceptand here sir gilberts face grew whiter than everexcept that another gentleman whom the lad didnt know had asked at the gate about the path and gone round the other way as if to meet mr nevitt  what sort of a gentleman the crossexaminer inquired clutching at this last straw as a mere chance diversion  well a vurry big zart o a gentleman witness answered unabashed a vine vigger o a man jest such another as thik un with the wig ther  as he spoke he stared hard at the judge a good scrutinizing stare sir gilbert quailed and glanced instinctively first at the boy and then at elma not a spark of intelligence shone in the lads stolid eyes  but elmas were fixed upon him with a serpentine glare of awful fascination thou art the man they seemed to say to him mutely sir gilbert in his awe was afraid to look at them they made him wild with terror yet they somehow fixed him try as he would to keep his own from meeting them they attracted him irresistibly  a ripple of faint laughter ran lightly through the court at the undisguised frankness of the boys reply  the judge repressed it sternly  oh he was just such another one as his lordship was he counsel repeated pressing the lad hard  now are you quite sure you remember all the people you saw that day are you quite sure the other man who asked about passersby wasntfor examplethe judge himself whos sitting here  sir gilbert glanced up with a quick suspicious air  it was only a shot at randomthe common advocates trick in trying to confuse a witness over questions of identity but to sir gilbert under the circumstances it was inexpressibly distressing well it murt a been he the lad answered putting his head on one side and surveying the judge closely with prolonged attention thik un ad just such another pair o ands as his lordship do ave it murt a been his lordship urself as is zitting there  this goes quite beyond the bounds of decency sir gilbert murmured faintly with a vain endeavour to hold his hands on the desk in an unconcerned attitude  have the kindness mr walters to spare the bench  attend to your examination observations of that sort are wholly uncalled for  but the boy once started was not so easily repressed  why it was his lordship he went on scanning the judge still harder i do mind his vurry voice it was im no doubt about it ive zeed a zight o people since i zeed im that day but i do mind his voice and i do mind his ands and i do mind his veace the zame as if it wur yesterday now i come to look blessed if it wasnt his lordship  guys counsel smiled a triumphant smile he had carried his point he had confused the witness this showed how little reliance could be placed upon the boys evidence as to personal identity hed identify anybody who happened to be suggested to him but sir gilberts face grew yet more deadly pale for he saw at a glance this was no accident or mistake the boy really remembered him and elmas steadfast eyes looked him through and through with that irresistible  appeal still more earnestly than ever  sir gilbert breathed again he had been recognised to no purpose even this positive identification fell flat upon everybody  at last the examination and crossexamination were finished and guys counsel began his hopeless task of unravelling this tangled mass of suggestion and coincidence he had no witnesses to call the very nature of the case precluded that all he could do was to cavil over details to point out possible alternatives  to lay stress upon the absence of direct evidence and to ask that the jury should give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt if any doubt at all existed in their minds as to his guilt or innocence  counsel had meant when he first undertook the case to lay great stress also on the presumed absence of motive but after the fatal accident which resulted in the disclosure of montague nevitts pocketbook any argument on that score would have been worse than useless counsel elected rather to pass the episode by in discreet silence and to risk everything on the uncertainty of the actual encounter  at last he sat down wiping his brow in despair after what he felt himself to be a most feeble performance  then sir gilbert began and in a very tremulous and failing voice summed briefly up the whole of the evidence  men who remember gildersleeves old blustering manner stood aghast at the timidity with which the famous lawyer delivered himself on this the first capital charge ever brought before him he reminded the jury in very solemn and almost warning tones that where a human life was at stake mere presumptive evidence should always carry very little weight with it  and the evidence here was all purely presumptive  the prosecution had shown nothing more than a physical possibility that the prisoner at the bar might have committed the murder there was evidence of animus it was true but that evidence was weak there was partial identification but that identification lay open to the serious objection that all the persons who now swore to guy warings personality had sworn just as surely and confidently before to his brother cyrils on the whole the judge summed up strongly in guys favour he wiped his clammy brow and looked appealingly at the bar as the jury would hope for justice themselves let them remember to mete out nothing but strict justice to the accused person who now stood trembling in the dock before them  all the court stood astonished could this be gildersleeve atkins would never have summed up like that atkins would have gone in pointblank for hanging him and everybody thought gildersleeve would hang with the best nobody had suspected him till then of any womanly weakness about capital punishment there was a solemn hush as the judge ended then everybody saw the unhappy man was seriously ill great streams of sweat trickled slowly down his brow his eyes stared in front of him his mouth twitched horribly he looked like a person on the point of apoplexy the prisoner at the bar gazed hard at him and pitied him  hes dying himself and he wants to go out with a clear conscience at last some one suggested in a low voice at the barristers table the explanation served  it was whispered round the court in a hushed undertone  that the judge today was on his very last legs and had summed up accordingly late in life he had learned to show mercy as he hoped for it  there was a deadly pause the jury retired to consider their verdict two men remained behind in court waiting breathless for their return two lives hung at issue in the balance while the jury deliberated  elma clifford glancing with a terrified eye from one to the other could hardly help pitying the guiltiest most his look of mute suffering was so inexpressibly pathetic  the twelve good men and true were gone for a full halfhour why nobody knew the case was as plain as a pikestaff gossipers said in court if he had been caught redhanded hed have been hanged without remorse it was only the eighteen months and the south african episode that could make the jury hesitate for one moment about hanging him  at last a sound a thrill a movement by the door  every eye was strained forward the jury trooped back again they took their places in silence sir gilbert scanned their faces with an agonized look it was a moment of ghastly and painful suspense he was waiting for their verdicton himself and guy waring       chapter xliv  at bay      only two people in court doubted for one moment what the verdict would be and those two were the pair who stood there on their trial sir gilbert couldnt believe the jury would convict an innocent man of the crime he himself had half unwittingly committed  guy waring couldnt believe the jury would convict an innocent man of the crime he had never been guilty of so those two doubted to all the rest the verdict was a foregone conclusion  nevertheless dead silence reigned everywhere in the court as the clerk of arraigns put the solemn question gentlemen do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty  and the foreman clearing his throat huskily answered in a very tremulous tone we find him guilty of wilful murder  there was a long deep pause every one looked at the prisoner guy waring stood like one stunned by the immensity of the blow it was an awful moment he knew he was innocent but he knew now the english law would hang him  one pair of eyes in the court however was not fixed on guy elma clifford at that final and supreme moment gazed hard with all her soul at sir gilbert gildersleeve her glance went through him she sat like an embodied conscience before him the judge rose slowly his eyes riveted on hers he was trembling with remorse and deadlier pale than ever  an awful lividness stole over his face his lips were contorted his eyebrows quivered horribly still gazing straight at elma he essayed to speak twice he opened his parched lips then his voice failed him  i cannot accept that finding he said at last in a very solemn tone battling hard for speech against some internal enemy i cannot accept it clerk you will enter a verdict of not guilty  a deep hum of surprise ran round the expectant court every mouth opened wide and drew a long hushed breath senior counsel for the crown jumped to his feet astonished but why my lord he asked tartly thus baulked of his success on what ground does your lordship decide to override the plain verdict of the jury  the pause that followed was inexpressibly terrible  guy waring waited for the answer in an agony of suspense  he knew what it meant now with a rush it all occurred to him he knew who was the murderer  but he hoped for nothing sir gilbert faltered elma cliffords eyes were upon him still compelling him because he said at last with a still more evident and physical effort pumping the words out slowly i am here to administer justice and justice i will administer  this man is innocent it was i myself who killed montague nevitt that day at mambury  at those awful words uttered in a tone so solemn that no one could doubt either their truth or their sincerity a cold thrill ran responsive through the  packed crowd of auditors the silence was profound  in its midst a boys voice burst forth all at once directed as it seemed to the counsel for the crown i said it was him the voice cried in a triumphant  tone i knowed um i knowed um thik theres the man that axed me the way down the dell the marnin o the murder  the judge turned towards the boy with a ghastly smile of enforced recognition you say the truth my lad he answered without any attempt at concealment  it was i who asked you it was i who killed him i went round by the far gate after hearing he was there and cutting across the wood i met montague nevitt in the path by the tangle i went there to meet him i went there to confront him but not of malice prepense to murder him i wanted to question him about a family matter why i needed to question him no one henceforth shall ever know  that secret thank heaven rests now in montague nevitts grave but when i did question him he answered me back with so foul an aspersion upon a lady who was very near and dear to methe judge  paused a moment he was fighting hard for breath something within was evidently choking him then he went on more excitedlyan aspersion upon a lady whom i love more than lifean insult that no man could standan unspeakable foulness and i sprang at him the cur in the white heat of my anger not meaning or dreaming to hurt him seriously i caught him by the throat the judge held up his hands before the whole court appealingly look at those hands gentlemen he cried turning them about how could i ever know how hard and how strong they were i only seemed to touch him i just pushed him from my path he fell at once at my feetdead dead unexpectedly  remember how it all came about the medical evidence showed his heart was weak and he died in the scuffle how was i to know all that i only knew thishe fell dead before me  with a face of speechless awe he paused and wiped his brow not a soul in court moved or breathed above a whisper it was evident the judge was in a paroxysm of contrition his face was drawn up his whole frame quivered visibly even elma pitied him  and then i did a grievous wrong the judge  continued once more his voice now very thick and growing rapidly thicker i did a grievous wrong for which here today before all this court i humbly ask guy warings pardon i had killed montague nevitt unintentionally unwittingly accidentally almost in a moment of anger never knowing i was killing him  and if he had been a stronger or a healthier man what little i did to him would never have killed him i didnt mean to murder him for that my remorse is far less poignant but what i did after was far worse than the murder i behaved like a sneaki behaved like a coward i saw suspicion was aroused against the prisoner guy waring and what did i do then  instead of coming forward like a man as i ought and saying i did it and standing my trial on the charge of manslaughter i did my best to throw further suspicion  on an innocent person i made the case look blacker and worse for guy waring i dont condone my own crime i did it for my wifes sake and my daughters i admitbut i regret it now bitterlyand am i not atoning for it with a great humiliation am i not amply atoning for it i wrote an unsigned letter warning waring at once to fly the country as a warrant was out against him waring foolishly took my advice and fled forthwith from that day to thishe gazed round him appealinglyoh friends i have never known one happy moment  guy gazed at him from the dock where he still stood guarded by two strong policemen and felt a fresh light break suddenly in upon him their positions now were almost reversed it was he who was the accuser and sir gilbert gildersleeve the judge in that court who stood charged today on his own confession with causing the death of montague nevitt  then it was you guy said slowly breaking the pause at last who sent me that anonymous letter at plymouth  it was i the judge answered in an almost inaudible  gurgling tone it was i who so wronged you  can you ever forgive me for it  guy gazed at him fixedly he himself had suffered much cyril and elma had suffered still more but the judge he felt sure had suffered most of all of them in this moment of relief this moment of vindication this moment of triumph he could afford to be generous sir gilbert gildersleeve i forgive you he answered slowly  the judge gazed around him with a vacant stare  i feel cold he said shivering very cold very faint too but ive made all right here and he held out a document i wrote this paper in my room last nightin case of accidentconfessing everything i brought it down here signed and witnessed unread intending to read it out if the verdict went against mei mean against waring but i feel too weak now to read anything further im so cold so cold take the paper forbesewing its all in your line youll know what to do with it he could hardly utter a word breath failed him so fast this thing has killed me he went on mumbling i deserved it i deserved it  how about the prisoner the authority from the gaol asked as the judge collapsed rather than sat down on the bench again  those words roused sir gilbert to full consciousness once more the judge rose again solemnly in all the majesty of his ermine the prisoner is discharged he said in a loud clear voice i am here to do justicejustice against myself i enter a verdict of not guilty then he turned to the polices i am your prisoner he went on in a broken rambling way  i give myself in charge for the manslaughter of montague nevitt manslaughter not murder though i dont even admit myself indeed it was anything  more than justifiable homicide  he sank back again once more and murmured three times in his seat as if to himself justifiable homicide  justifiable homicide justifiable homicide  somebody rose in court as he sank and moved quickly towards him the judge recognised him at once  granville kelmscott he said in a weary voice help me out of this i am very very ill youre a friend im dying give me your arm assist me       chapter xlv  alls well that ends well      granville helped him on his arm into the judges room amid profound silence all the court was deeply stirred a few personal friends hurried after him eagerly among them were the warings and mrs clifford and elma  the judge staggered to a seat and held granvilles hand long and silently in his then his eye caught elmas he turned to her gratefully thank you young lady he said in a very thick voice you were extremely good i forget your name but you helped me greatly  there was such a pathetic ring in those significant words i forget your name that every eye about stood dimmed with moisture remorse had clearly blotted out all else now from sir gilbert gildersleeves powerful brain save the solitary memory of his great wrongdoing  somethings upon his mind still elma cried looking  hard at him hes dying hes dying but he wants to say something else before he dies im certain   mr kelmscott its to you oh cyril stand  back mother leave them alone im sure from his eye he wants to say something to mr kelmscott  they all fell back reverently they stood in the presence of death and of a mighty sorrow sir gilbert still held granvilles hand fast bound in his own  itll kill her he muttered itll kill her im sure itll kill her shell never get over the thought that her father waswas the cause of montague nevitts death and youll never care to marry a girl of whom people will say either justly or unjustly shes a murderers daughter and that will kill her too for kelmscott she loved you  granville held the dying mans hand still more gently than ever sir gilbert he said leaning over him with very tender eyes no event on earth could ever possibly alter gwendolines love for me or my love for gwendoline i know you cant live this shock has been too much for you but if it will make you die any the happier now to know that gwendoline and i will still be one i give you my sacred promise at this solemn moment that as soon as she likes i will marry gwendoline he paused for a second i dont understand all this story just yet he went on  but of one thing im certain the sympathy of every soul in court today went with you as you spoke out the truth so manfully the sympathy of all england will go with you tomorrow when they come to learn of it sir gilbert till this morning i never admired you much as i love gwendoline as you made that confession just now in court i declare i admired you with all the greater confidence now will i marry your daughter  they carried him to the judges lodgings in the town and laid him there peaceably for the doctors to tend him for a fortnight the shadow of gildersleeve still lingered on growing feebler and feebler in intellect every day but the end was certain it was softening of the brain and it proceeded rapidly the horror of that unspeakable trial had wholly unnerved him the great strong man cried and sobbed like a baby lady gildersleeve and gwendoline were with him all through  he seldom spoke when he did it was generally to murmur those fixed words of exculpation in a tremulous undertone it was my hands that did itthese great clumsy hands of minenot inot i i never never meant it it was an accident an accident justifiable homicide what i really regret is for that poor fellow waring  and at the end of a fortnight he died once smiling with gwendolines hand locked tight in his own and granville kelmscott kneeling in tears by his bedside  the kelmscott property was settled by arrangement  it never came into court with the aid of the family lawyers the three halfbrothers divided it amicably  guy wouldnt hear of granvilles giving up his claim to the house and park at tilgate granville was to the manner born he said and brought up to expect it while cyril and he mere waifs and strays in the world  would be much better off even so with their third of the property each than they ever before in their lives could have counted upon as for cyril he was too happy in guys exculpation from the greater crime and his frank explanation of the lesserunder nevitts influenceto care very much in his own heart what became of tilgate  the only one man who objected to this arrangement was mr reginald clifford cmg of craighton the companion of the militant saints was strongly of opinion that cyril waring oughtnt to have given up his prior claim to the family mansion even for valuable consideration  elsewhere mr clifford drew himself up to the full height of his spare figure and caught in the tight skin of his mummylike face rather tighter than before as he delivered himself of this profound opinion a man should consult his own dignity he said stiffly and with great precision if hes born to assume a position in the county he should assume that position as a sacred duty he should remember that his wife and children  but he hasnt got any wife papa elma ventured to interpose with a bright little smile so that cant count either way  he hasnt a wife at present to be sure thats  perfectly true my dear no wife at present but he will probably now in his existing circumstances soon obtain one a man of property should always marry mr  waring will naturally desire to ally himself to some family of good position in the county and the ladys relations would of course insist  well it doesnt matter to us papa elma answered maliciously for as far as were concerned you know youve often said that nothing on earth would ever induce you to give your consent  the gentleman of good position in the county gazed at his daughter aghast with horror my dear child he said with positive alarm your remarks are nothing short of revolutionary you must remember that since then circumstances have altered at that time mr waring was a painter  hes a painter still i believe elma put in parenthetically the acquisition of property or county rank doesnt seem to have had the very slightest effect one way or the other upon his drawing or his colouring  her father disdained to take notice of such flippant remarks at that time he repeated solemnly mr waring was a painter a mere ordinary painter we know him now to be the heir and representative of a great county family if he were to ask you today  but he did ask me a long time ago you know papa elma put in demurely and at that time you remember you objected to the match so of course as in duty bound i at once refused him  and what did your father say to that elma cyril asked with a smile as she narrated the whole circumstances to him some hours later  oh he only said but hell ask you again now you may be sure my child and i replied very gravely i didnt think you would and do you know cyril i really dont think you will either  why not elma  because you foolish boy it isnt the least bit in the world necessary this has been all through a comedy of errors tragedy enough intermixed but still a comedy of errors there never was really any reason on earth why either of us shouldnt have married the other and the only thing i now regret myself is that i didnt do as i first threatened and marry you outright just to show my confidence in you and guy at the time when everybody else had turned most against you  well suppose we make up for lost time now by saying wednesday fortnight cyril suggested after a short pause during which both of them simultaneously had been otherwise occupied  oh cyril thats awfully quick it could hardly be managed theres the dresses and all that and the bridesmaids to arrange about and the invitations to issue but still sooner than put you off any longer nowwell yes my dear boyi dare say we could make it wednesday fortnight  the end
