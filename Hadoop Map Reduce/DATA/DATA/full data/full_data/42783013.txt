42783013	the caged lion   preface   when the venture has been made of dealing with historical events and characters it always seems fair towards the reader to avow what liberties have been taken and how much of the sketch is founded on history  in the present case it is scarcely necessary to do more than refer to the almost unique relations that subsisted between henry v and his prisoner james i of scotland who lived with him throughout his reign on the terms of friend rather than of captive and was absolutely sheltered by this imprisonment throughout his nonage and early youth from the frightful violence and presumption of the nobles of his kingdom  jamess expedition to scotland is wholly imaginary though there appears to have been space for it during henrys progress to the north to pay his devotions at beverley minster  the hero of the story is likewise invention though as froissart ascribes to king robert ii eleven sons who loved arms malcolm may well be supposed to be the son of one of those unaccounted for in the pedigrees of stewart  the same may be said of esclairmonde  there were plenty of luxemburgs in the low countries but the individual is not to be identified  readers of tylers henry v of agnes stricklands queens tytlers scotland and barantes histoire de bourgogne will be at no loss for the origin of all i have ventured to say of the really historical personages  mr fox bournes english merchants furnished the tradition respecting whittington  i am afraid the knighthood was really conferred on henrys first return to england after the battle of agincourt but humanor at least storytellingnature could not resist an anachronism of a few years for such a story  the only other wilful alteration of a matter of time is with regard to the duke of burgundys interview with henry  at the time of henrys last stay at paris the duke was attending the deathbed of his wife michelle of france but he had been several times in the kings camp at the siege of meaux  another alteration of fact is that ralf percy instead of being second son of hotspur should have been henry percy son of hotspurs brother ralf but the name would have been so confusing that it was thought better to set dugdale at defiance and consider the readers convenience alice montagu though her name sounds as if it came out of the most commonplace novelists repertory was a veritable personagethe heiress of the brave line of montacute or montagu daughter to the earl of salisbury who was killed at the siege of orleans wife to the earl of the same title in her right who won the battle of blore heath and was beheaded at wakefield and mother to earl warwick the kingmaker the marquis of montagu and george nevil archbishop of york  as nothing is known of her but her name i have ventured to make use of the blank  for jaqueline of hainault and her pranks they are to be found in monstrelet of old and now in barante though justice to her and queen isabeau compels me to state that the incident of the ring is wholly fictitious  of the trial of walter stewart no record is preserved save that he was accused of roborica  james kennedy was the first great benefactor to learning in scotland and founder of her earliest university having been himself educated at paris  the abbey of coldingham is described from a local compilation of the early part of the century with an account of the history of that grand old foundation and the struggle for appointments between the parent house at durham and the scottish government  priors akefield and drax are historical and as the latter really did commission a body of moss troopers to divert an instalment of king jamess ransom into his own private coffers i do not think i can have done him much injustice  as the nunnery of st abbs has gone bodily into the sea i have been the less constrained by the inconvenient action of fact upon fiction  and for the hospital of st katharinesbythetower its history is to be found in stowes survey of london and likewise in the evidence before the parliamentary commission which shows what it was intended by queen philippa to have been to the riverside population and what it might have been had such intentions been understood and acted onnay what it may yet become since the foundation remains intact although the building has been removed  c m yonge  november 24 1869     chapter i the guest of glenuskie   a master hand has so often described the glens and ravines of scotland that it seems vain and presumptuous to meddle with them and yet we must ask our readers to figure to themselves a sharp cleft sloping downwards to a brawling mountain stream the sides scattered with gray rocks of every imaginable size interspersed here and there with heather gorse or furze  just in the widest part of the valley a sort of platform of rock jutted out from the hillside and afforded a station for one of those tall narrow grimlooking fastnesses that were the strength of scotland as well as her bane  either by nature or art the rock had been scarped away on three sides so that the walls of the castle rose sheer from the steep descent except where the platform was connected with the mountain side by as it were an isthmus joining the peninsula to the main rock and even this isthmus a narrow ridge of rock just wide enough for the passage of a single horse had been cut through no doubt with great labour and rendered impassable except by the lowering of a drawbridge  glenuskie castle was thus nearly impregnable so long as it was supplied with water and for this all possible provision had been made by guiding a stream into the court  the castle was necessarily narrow and confined its massive walls took up much even of the narrow space that the rock afforded but it had been so piled up that it seemed as though the builders wished to make height compensate for straitness  there was too an unusual amount of grace both in the outline of the gateway with its mighty flanking towers and of the lofty donjon tower that shot up like a great finger above the massy more as the main building was commonly called by the inhabitants of glenuskie  wondrous as were the walls and deepset as were the arches they had all that peculiar slenderness of contour that scottish taste seemed to have learnt from france and a little more space was gained at the top both of the gateway towers and the donjon by a projecting cornice of beautifully vaulted arches supporting a battlement that gave the building a crowned look  on the topmost tower was of course planted the ensign of the owner and that ensign was no other than the regal ruddy lion of scotland ramping on his gold field within his tressure fiery and counter flory but surmounted by a label divided into twelve and placed upon a pennoncel or triangular piece of silk  the eyes of the early fifteenth century easily deciphered such hieroglyphics as these which to every one with the least tincture of the noble science indicated that the owner of the castle was of royal stewart blood but of a younger branch and not yet admitted to the rank of knighthood  the early spring of the year 1421 was bleak and dreary in that wild lonely vale and large was the fire burning on the hearth in the castle hall in the full warmth of which there sat with a light blue cloth cloak drawn tightly round him a tall old man of the giant mould of scotland and with a massive thoughtful brow whose grand form was rendered visible by the absence of hair only a few remnants of yellow locks mixed with silver floating from his temples to mingle with his magnificent white beard  a small blue bonnet with a short eagle feather fastened with a brooch of river pearl was held in the hands that were clasped over his face as bending down in his chair he murmured through his white beard have mercy good lord have mercy on the land  have mercy on my sonand guard him when he goes out and when he comes in  have mercy on the children i have toiled for and teach me to judge and act for them aright in these sore straits and above all have mercy on our king break his fetters and send him home to be the healer of his land the avenger of her cruel wrongs  so absorbed was the old man that he never heard the step that came across the hall  it was a slightly unequal step but was carefully hushed at entrance as if supposing the old man asleep and at a slow pace the new comer crossed the hall to the chimney where he stood by the fire warming himself and looking wistfully at the old knight  he was wrapped in a plaid black and white which increased the gray appearance of the pale sallow face and sad expression of the wearer a boy of about seventeen with soft pensive dark eyes and a sickly complexion with that peculiar wistful cast of countenance that is apt to accompany deformity though there was no actual malformation apparent unless such might be reckoned the slight halt in the gait and the small stature of the lad who was no taller than many boys of twelve or fourteen  but there was a depth of melancholy in those dark brown eyes that went far into the heart of any one who had the power to be touched with their yearning appealing almost piteous gaze as though their owner had come into a world that was much too hard for him and were looking out in bewilderment and entreaty for some haven of peace  he had stood for some minutes looking thoughtfully into the fire and the sadness of his expression ever deepening before the old man raised his face and said you here malcolm where are the others  patie and lily are still on the turrettop fair uncle returned the boy  it was so cold and he shivered again and seemed as though he would creep into the fire  and the reek asked the uncle  there is another reek broken out farther west replied malcolm  patie is sure now that it is as you deemed uncle that it is a cattlelifting from badenoch  heaven help them sighed the old man again folding his hands in prayer  how long o lord how long  malcolm took up the appeal of the psalm repeating it in latin but with none the less fervency that psalm that has ever since davids time served as the agonized voice of hearts hotburning at the sight of wrong  ah yes he ended there is nothing else for it  uncle this was wherefore i came  it was to speak to you of my purpose  the old purpose malcolm  nay that hath been answered before  but listen listen dear uncle  i have not spoken of it for a full year now  so that you cannot say it is the caresses of the good monks  no nor the rude sayings of the master of albany he added colouring at a look of his uncle  you bade me say no more till i be of full age nor would i save that i were safe lodged in an abbey then might patrick and lily be wedded and he not have to leave us and seek his fortune far away in france and in paties hands and leading my vassals might be safe but what could the doited helpless cripple do he added the colour rising hotly to his cheek with pain and shame  oh sir let me but save my soul and find peace in coldingham  my poor bairn said his uncle laying a kind hand upon him as in his eagerness he knelt on one knee beside the chair it must not be  it is true that the regent and his sons would willingly see you in a cloister nay that unmanly jeer of walter stewarts was i verily believe meant to drive you thither  but were you there then would poor lilias become a prize worth having and the only question would be whether walter of albany or robert of athole or any of the rest of them should tear her away to be the lady of their fierce ungodly households  you could give her to patrick uncle  no malcolm that were not consistent with mine honour or oaths to the king and state  you living and laird of glenuskie lilias is a mere younger sister whom you may give in marriage as you will but were you dead to the world under a cowl then the lady of glenuskie a kings grandchild may not be disposed of save by her royal kinsman or by those who woe worth the day stand in his place  i were no better than yon wolf of badenoch or the master of albany did i steal a march on the regent and give the poor lassie to my own son  and so lilias must pine and patrick wander off to the weary french war sighed malcolm and i must be scorned by my cousins whenever the house of stewart meets together and must strive with these fierce cruel men that will ever be too hard for me when patie is gone  his eyes filled with tears as he continued ah that fair chapel with the sweet chant of the choir the green smoothshaven quadrangle the calm cloister walk there there alone is rest  there one ceases to be a prey and a laughingstock there one sees no more bloodshed and spulzie there one need not be forced to treachery or violence  oh uncle my very soul is sick for coldingham  how many years will it be ere i can myself bestow my sister on patie and hide my head in peace  before his uncle had done more than answer nay nay malcolm these are no words for the oe of bruce you are born to dare as well as to suffer there was an approach of footsteps and two young people entered the hall the first a girl with a family likeness to malcolm but tall upright beautiful and with the rich colouring of perfect health her plaid still hanging in a loose swelling hood round her brilliant face and dark hair snooded with a crimson ribbon and diamond clasp the other a knightly young man of stately height and robust limbs keen bright blue eyes and amber hair and beard moving with the ease and grace that showed his training in the highest school of chivalry  good uncle cried the maiden in eager excitement there is a guest coming  he has just turned over the brae side and can be coming nowhere but here  a guest cried both malcolm and the elder knight of what kind lily  a knighta knight in bright steel and with three attendants said lilias one of patricks french comrades say i by the grace of his riding  not a message from the regent i trust sighed malcolm  patie oh do not lower the drawbridge till we hear whether it be friend or foe  nay malcolm tis well none save friends heard that said patrick when shall we make a brave man of you  nevertheless patie said the old gentleman though i had rather the caution had come from the eldest rather than the youngest head among us parley as much as may serve with honour and courtesy ere opening the gate to the stranger  hark there is his bugle  a certain look of nervous terror passed over young malcolms face while his sister watched full of animation and curiosity as one to whom excitement of any kind could hardly come amiss exclaiming as she looked from the window fear not most prudent malcolm father ninian is with him father ninian must have invited him  strange muttered patrick that father ninian should be picking up and bringing home stray wandering landloupers and with an anxious glance at lilias he went forward unwillingly to perform those duties of hospitality which had become necessary since the presence of the castle chaplain was a voucher for the guest  the drawbridge had already been lowered and the newcomer was crossing it upon a powerful black steed guided by father ninian upon his rough mountain pony on which he had shortly before left the castle to attend at a church festival held at coldingham  the chaplain was a wise prudent and muchrespected man nevertheless young sir patrick drummond felt little esteem for his prudence in displaying one at least of the treasures of the castle to the knight on the black horse  the stranger was a very tall man of robust and stalwart make apparently aged about seven or eight and twenty years clad in steel armour enamelled so as to have a burnished blue appearance but the vizor of the helmet was raised and the face beneath it was a manly open face thoroughly scottish in its forms but very handsome and with short dark auburn hair and eyes of the same peculiar tint glancing with a light that once seen could never be forgotten and the bearing was such that patrick at once growled to himself one of our haughty loons brimful of outre cuidance and yet how coolly he bears it off  if he looks to find us his humble servants he will find himself mistaken i trow  sir patrick said father ninian who was by this time close to him let me present to you sir james stewart a captive knight who is come to collect his ransom  i fell in with him on the road and as his road lay with mine i made bold to assure him of a welcome from your honoured father and lord malcolm  patricks face cleared  it was no grace or beauty that he feared in any stranger but the sheer might and unright that their regency enabled the house of albany to exercise over the orphans of the royal family whose head was absent and a captive knight could be no mischievous person still this might be only a specious pretence to impose on the chaplain and gain admittance to the castle and patrick was resolved to be well on his guard though he replied courteously to the graceful bow with which the stranger greeted him saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent i have been bold enough to presume on the good fathers offer of hospitality sir  you are welcome sir returned patrick taking the strangers bridle that he might dismount my father and my cousin will gladly further on his way a prisoner seeking freedom  a captive may well be welcome for the sake of one prisoner said his father who had in the meantime come forward and extended his hand to the knight who took it and uncovering his bright locks respectfully said i am in the presence of the noble tutor of glenuskie  even so sir returned sir david drummond who was in fact as his nephews guardian usually known by this curious title and you here see my wards the lord malcolm and lady lilias  your knighthood will make allowances for the lad he is but homebred  for while lilias with stately grace responded to sir james stewarts courtly greeting malcolm bashfully made an awkward bow and seemed ready to shrink within himself as indeed the brutal jests of his rude cousins had made him dread and hate the eye of a stranger and while the knight was led forward to the hall fire he merely pressed up to the priest and eagerly demanded under his breath have you brought me the book but father ninian had only time to nod and sign that a volume was in his bosom before old sir david called out what now malcolm forgetting that your part is to come and disarm the knight who does you the honour to be your guest  and sir patrick rather roughly pushed him forward gruffly whispering leave not lily to supply your lack of courtesy  malcolm shambled forward bewildered as the keen auburn eye fell on him and the cheery kindly voice said ha a new booka romance  well may that drive out other thoughts  had he ears to hear such a whisper thought malcolm as he mumbled in the hoarse voice of bashful boyhood not a romance sir but whatever the good fathers at coldingham would lend me  it is the itinerarium of the blessed adamnanus replied father ninian producing from his bosom a parcel apparently done up in many wrappers a sealskin above all  the itinerarium exclaimed sir james methought i had heard of such a book  i have a friend in england who would give many a fair rose noble for a sight of it  a friend in englandthe words had a sinister sound to the audience and while malcolm jealously gathered up the book into his arms the priest made cold answer that the book was the property of the monastery at coldingham and had only been lent to lord malcolm stewart by special favour  the guest could not help smiling and saying he was glad books were thus prized in scotland but at that moment as the sunny look shone on his face and he stood before the fire in the close suit of chamois leather which he wore under his armour old sir david exclaimed ha never did i see such a likeness  patie you should be old enough to remember do you not see it  what should i see  who is he like asked patrick surprised at his fathers manner  who whispered sir david in a lowered voice do you not see it to the unhappy lad the duke of rothsay  patrick could not help smiling for he had been scarcely seven years old at the time of the murder of the unfortunate prince of scotland but a flush of colour rose into the face of the guest and he shortly answered so i have been told and then assuming a seat near sir david he entered into conversation with him upon the condition of scotland at the period inquiring into the state of many of the families and districts by name  almost always there was but one answermurderharryingforay and when the question followed what had the regent done there was a shrug of the shoulders and as often sir jamess face flushed with a dark red fire and his hand clenched at the hilt of the sword by his side  and is there not a man in scotland left to strike for the right he demanded at last cannot nobles clergy and burghers band themselves in parliament to put down albany and his bloody house and recall their true head  they love to have it so returned sir david sadly  united they might be strong enough but each knows that his fellow douglas lennox march or mar would be ready to play the same game as albany and to raise a rival none will stir  and so proceeded sir james bitterly the manhood of scotland goes forth to waste itself in an empty foreign war merely to keep france in as wretched a state of misrule as itself  nay nay sir cried patrick angrily it is to save an ancient ally from the tyranny of our foulest foe  it is the only place where a scotsman can seek his fortune with honour and without staining his soul with foul deeds  bring our king home and every sword shall be at his service  what when they have all been lavished on the crazy frenchman said sir james  no sir said patrick rising in his vehemence when they have been brightened there by honourable warfare not tarnished by home barbarities  he speaks truly said sir david and though it will go to my heart to part with the lad yet may i not say a word to detain him in a land where the contagion of violence can scarce be escaped by a brave man  sir james gave a deep sigh as of pain but as if to hinder its being remarked promptly answered that may be but what is to be the lot of a land whose honest men desert her cause as too evil for them and seek out another that when seen closer is scarce less evil  how sir cried patrick you a prisoner of england yet speaking against our noble french allies so foully trampled on  i have lived long enough in england returned sir james to think that land happiest where law is strong enough to enforce peace and order  the coward loons muttered patrick chiefly out of the spirit of opposition  you have been long in england sir said lilias hoping to direct the conversation into a more peaceful current  many years fair lady he replied turning courteously to her i was taken when i was a mere lad but i have had gentle captors and no over harsh prison  and has no one ransomed you she asked pitifully as one much moved by a certain patience on his brow and in his sweet full voice  no one lady  my uncle was but too willing that the heir should be kept aloof and it is only now he is dead that i have obtained leave from my friendly captor to come in search of my ransom  lilias would have liked to know the amount but it was not manners to ask since the rate of ransom was the personal value of the knight and her uncle put in the question who was his keeper  the earl of somerset rather hastily answered sir james and then at once lilias exclaimed ah uncle is not the king too in his charge and then questions crowded on  what like is the king  how brooks he his durance  what freedom hath he  what hope is there of his return can he brook to hear of his peoples wretchedness  this was the first question at which sir james attempted to unclose his hitherto smiling and amused lip  then it quivered and the dew glittered in his eyes as he answered brook it  no indeed lady  his heart burns within him at every cry that comes over the border and will wellnigh burst at what i have seen and heard  king harry tells him that to send him home were but tossing him on the swords of the albany  better better so to die in one grapple for his countrys sake than lie bound hearing her bitter wails and unable to stir for her redress and as he dashed the indignant tear from his eyes patrick caught his hand  your heart is in the right place friend he said i look on you as an honest man and brother in arms from this moment  tis a bargain said sir james the smile returning and his eyes again glistening as he wrung sir patricks hand  when the hour comes for the true rescue of scotland we will strike together  and you will tell the king added patrick that here are true hearts and i could find many more only longing to fence him from the albany swords about which king harry is so good as to fash himself  but what like is the king asked lilias eagerly  oh i would fain see him  is it true that he was the tallest man at king harrys sacring more shame that he were there  he and i are much of a height lady returned the knight  maybe i may give you the justest notion of him by saying that i am said to be his very marrow  that explains your likeness to the poor duke said sir david satisfied and you too count kindred with our royal house methinks  i am sprung from walter the stewart so much i know my lands lie carrickwards said sir james lightly but i have been a prisoner so long that the pedigree of my house was never taught me and i can make no figure in describing my own descent  and as though to put an end to the inquiry he walked to the window where malcolm so soon as they had begun to talk of the misrule of scotland had ensconced himself in the windowseat with his new book making the most of the failing light and asked him whether the monk of iona equalled his expectations  malcolm was not easy to draw out at first but it presently appeared that he had been baffled by a tough bit of latinity  the knight looked and readily expounded the sentence so that all became plain and then as it was already too dark to pursue the study with comfort he stood over the boy talking to him of books and of poems while the usually pale listless uninterested countenance responded by looks of eager delight and flushing colour  it seemed as though each were equally pleased with the other sir james at finding so much knowledge and understanding in a scottish castle and malcolm at for the first time meeting anything but contempt for his tastes from aught but an ecclesiastic  their talk continued till they were summoned to supper which had been somewhat delayed to provide for the newcomers  it was a simple enough meal suited to lent and was merely of dried fish with barley bread and kail brose but there were few other places in scotland where it would have been served with so much of the refinement that sir david drummond and his late wife had learnt in france  a tablecloth and napkins separate trenchers and water for hand cleansing were not always to be found in the houses of the nobles and in fact there were those who charged malcolms delicacy and timidity on the nisete or folly of his effeminate education the having the rushes on the floor frequently changed the preference of lamps for pine torches and the not keeping falcons dogs swine and all pell mell in the great hall  lilias sat between her uncle and his guest looking so fair and bright that patrick felt fresh accesses of angry jealousy while the visitor talked as one able to report to the natives from another world and that world the hateful england which as a scotsman he was bound to abhor  had it been france it had been endurable but praise of english habits was mere disloyalty and yet whenever patrick tried to throw in a disparaging word he found himself met with a quiet superiority such as he had believed no knight in scotland could assume with him and still it was neither browbeating nor insolence nothing that could give offence  malcolm begged to know whether there had not been a rare good poet in england called chaucer  verily there had been said the knight and on a little solicitation so soon as supper was over he recited to the eager and delighted auditors the tale of patient grisel as rendered by chaucer calling forth eager comments from both patrick and lily on the unknightliness of the marquis  malcolm however added yet after all she was but a mere peasant wench  what makes that young sir replied sir james gravely  i would have you to know that the husbands rank is the wifes and the more unequal were their lot before the more is he bound to respect her and to make her be respected  that may be after the deed is done said sir david in a warning voice but it is not well that like should not match with like  many an evil have i seen in my time from unequal mating  and sir eagerly exclaimed patrick no doubt you can gainsay the slander that our noble king has been caught in the toils of an artful englishwoman and been drawn in to promise her a share in his crown  a flush of crimson flamed forth on sir james stewarts cheeks and his tawny eye glanced with a fire like red lightning but he seemed as it were to be holding himself in and answered with a voice forcibly kept low and calm and therefore the more terribly stern young sir i warn you to honour your future queen  sir david made a gesture with his hand enforcing restraint upon his son and turning to sir james said our queen will we honour when such she is sir but if you are returning to the king it were well that he should know that our hot scottish bloods here could scarce brook an english alliance and certainly not one beneath his birth  the king would answer sir returned sir james haughtily but with recovered command over himself that it is for him to judge whom his subjects shall brook as their queen  moreover he added in a different and more conciliatory voice scotsmen must be proud indeed who disdain the late kings niece the greatgranddaughter of king edward iii and as noble and queenly a demoiselle as ever was born in a palace  she is so very fair then said lilies who was of course on the side of true love  you have seen her gentle sir  oh tell us what are her beauties  fair damsel said sir james in a much more gentle tone you forget that i am only a poor prisoner who have only now and then viewed the lady joan beaufort with distant reverence as destined to be my queen all i can tell is that her walk and bearing mark her out for a throne  and oh cried malcolm is it not true that the king hath composed songs and poems in her honour  pah muttered patrick as though the king would be no better than a wandering minstrel rhymester  or than king david dryly said sir james  it is true then sir exclaimed lilias  he doth verily add minstrelsy to his other graces  know you the lines sir  can you sing them to us  oh i pray you  nay fair maid returned sir james methinks i might but add to the scorn wherewith sir patrick is but too much inclined to regard the captive king  a captive a captiveay minstrelsy is the right solace for a captive said patrick at least so they say and sing  our king will have better work when he gains his freedom  only there will come before me a subtilty i once saw in jelly and blancmange at a banquet in france where a lion fell in love with a hunters daughter and let her for loves sake draw his teeth and clip his claws whereupon he found himself made a sport for her fathers hounds  i promise you sir patrick replied the guest that the lady joan is more hike to send her lion forth from the hunters toils with claws and teeth freshwhetted by the desire of honour  but the laythe hay sir entreated lilias who knows that it may not win patrick to be the lady joans devoted servant  malcolm your harp  malcolm had already gone in quest of the harp he loved all the better for the discouragement thrown on his gentle tastes  the knight leant back with a pensive look softening his features as he said after a little consideration then fair lady i will sing you the song made by king james when he had first seen the fair mistress of his heart on the slopes of windsor looking from his chamber window  he feigns her to be a nightingale  and what is that sir demanded lilias  i have heard the word in romances and deemed it a kind of angel that sings by night  it is a bird sister replied malcolm philomel that pierces her breast with a thorn and sings sweetly even to her death  thats mere minstrel leasing malcolm said patrick  i have both seen and heard the bird in francerossignol as we call it there and were i a lady i should deem it small compliment to be likened to a little russetbacked homely fowl such as that  while i replied the prisoner feel so much with your fair sister that nightingales are a sort of angels that sing by night that it pains me when i think of winning my freedom to remember that i shall never again hear their songs answering one another through the forest of windsor  patrick shrugged his shoulders but lilias was so anxious to hear the lay that she entreated him to be silent and sir james with a manly mellow voice with an exceedingly sweet strain in it and a skill both of modulation and finger such as showed admirable taste and instruction poured forth that beautiful song of the nightingale at windsor which commences king jamess story of his love in his poem of the kings quhair  there was an eager pressing round to hear and not only were lilias and malcolm but old sir david himself much affected by the strain which the latter said put him in mind of the days of king robert iii which sad as they were now seemed like good old times so much worse was the present state of affairs  sir james however seemed anxious to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung and applied to malcolm to give a specimen of his powers and thus with music ballad and lay the evening passed away till the parting cup was sent round and the tutor of glenuskie and malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep in a wainscoted box bedstead and his two attendant squires a great irongray scot and a rosy honestfaced englishman on pallets on the floor  in the morning he went on his journey but not without an invitation to rest there again on his way back whether with or without his ransom  he promised to come saying that he should gladly bear to the king the last advices from one so honoured as the tutor of glenuskie and on their sides malcolm and sir david resolved to do their best to have some gold pieces to contribute rather than so proper a knight should fail in raising his ransom but gold was never plenty and patrick needed all that his uncle could supply to bear him to those wars in france where he looked for renown and fortune  for these were as may have been gathered those evil days when james i of scotland was still a captive to england and when the house of albany exercised its cruel misrule upon scotland delaying to ransom the king lest they should bring home a master  old robert of albany had been king stork his son murdoch was king log and the misery was infinitely increased by the violence and lawlessness of murdochs sons  king robert ii had left scotland the fearful legacy of as froissart says eleven sons who loved arms  of these robert iii was the eldest the duke of albany the second  these were both dead and were represented the one by the captive young king james the other by the regent duke murdoch of albany and his brother john earl of buchan now about to head a scottish force among whom patrick drummond intended to sail to assist the french  others of the eleven earls of athol menteith c survived but the youngest of the brotherhood by name malcolm who had married the heiress of glenuskie had been killed at homildon hill when he had solemnly charged his stewart nephews and brothers to leave his two orphan children to the sole charge of their mothers cousin sir david drummond a good old man who had been the best supporter and confidant of poor robert iii in his unhappy reign and in embassies to france had lost much of the rugged barbarism to which scotland had retrograded during the wars with england     chapter ii the rescue of coldingham   it was a lonely tract of road marked only by the bare space trodden by feet of man and horse and yet in truth the highway between berwick and edinburgh which descended from a heathery moorland into a somewhat spacious valley with copsewood clothing one side in the midst of which rose a high mound or knoll probably once the site of a camp for it still bore lines of circumvallation although it was entirely deserted except by the wandering shepherds of the neighbourhood or occasionally by outlaws who found an admirable ambush in the rear  the spring had hung the hazels with tassels bedecked the willows with golden downy tufts and opened the primroses and celandines beneath them when the solitary dale was disturbed by the hasty clatter of horses feet and hard heavy breathing as of those who had galloped headlong beyond their strength  here however the foremost of the party an old esquire who grasped the bridlerein of youth by his side drew up his own horse and that which he was dragging on with him saying  we may breathe here a moment there is shelter in the wood  and you rab get ye up to the top of jills knowe and keep a good lookout  let me go back you false villain sobbed the boy with the first use of his recovered breath  do not be so daft lord malcolm replied the squire retaining his hold on the boys bridle what rin your head into the wolfs mouth again when weve barely brought you off haill and sain  haill and sain  dastard and forlorn cried malcolm with passionate weeping  ii to flee and leave my sistermy uncle  oh where are they  halbert let me go ill never pardon thee  hoot my lord would i let you gang when the tutor spak to me as plain as i hear you now  take off lord malcolm says he save him and you save the rest  see him safe to the earl of mar  those were his words my lord and if you wilna heed them i will  what and leave my sister to the reivers  oh what may not they be doing to her  let us go back and fall on them halbert better die saving her than know her in walter stewarts hands  then were i the wretched craven he calls me  look you lord malcolm said halbert laying his finger on his nose with a knowing expression my young lady is safe from harm so long as you are out of the master of albanys reach  had you come by a canny thrust in the fray as no doubt was his purpose or were you in his hands to be mewed in a convent then were your sister worth the wedding but the master will never wed her while you live and have friends to back you and his father the regent will see she has no illusage  youll do best for yourself and her too as well as sir david if you make for dunbar and call ben your uncles of athole and strathernhow now rab are the loons making this way  na na said rab descending tis from the other gate tis a knight in blue damasked steel he methinks that harboured in our castle some weeks syne  hm said halbert considering he looked like a trusty cheild maybe hed guide my lord here to a wiser wit and a good lance on the way to dunbar is not to be scorned  in fact there would have been no time for one party to conceal themselves from the other for hidden by the copsewood and unheeded by the watchers who were gazing in the opposite direction sir james stewart and his two attendants suddenly came round the foot of jills knowe upon the fugitives who were profiting by the interval to loosen the girths of their horses and water them at the pool under the thicket whilst halbert in vain tried to pacify and reason with the young master who had thrown himself on the grass in an agony of grief and despair  sir james after the first momentary start recognized the party in an instant and at once leapt from his horse exclaiming  how now my bonnie manmy kind hostwhat is it what makes this grief  do not speak to me sir muttered the unhappy boy  they have been reftreft from me and i have done nothing for them  walter of albany has them and i am here  and he gave way to another paroxysm of grief while halbert explained to sir james stewart that when sir patrick drummond had gone to embark for france with the army led to the aid of charles vi by the earl of buchan his father and cousins with a large escort had accompanied him to eyemouth whence after taking leave of him they had set out to spend passiontide and easter at coldingham abbey after the frequent fashion of the devoutly inclined among the scottish nobility in whose castles there was often little commodity for religious observances  short however as was the distance they had in the midst of it been suddenly assailed by a band of armed men among whom might easily be recognized the giant form of young walter stewart the master of albany the regent duke murdochs eldest son who was well known for his lawless excesses and violence  his fathers silky sayings and his own ruder speeches had long made it known to the house of glenuskie that the family policy was to cajole or to drive the sickly heir into a convent and rendering lilias the possessor of the broad lands inherited from both parents unite her and them to the albany family  the almost barbarous fierceness and wild licentiousness of walter would have made the arrangement abhorrent to lilias even had not love passages already passed between her and her cousin patrick drummond and sir david had hitherto protected her by keeping malcolm in the secular life but walter it seemed had grown impatient and had made this treacherous attack evidently hoping to rid himself of the brother and secure the sister  no sooner had the tutor of glenuskie perceived that his own party were overmatched than he had bidden his faithful squire to secure the bairnsif not both at least the boy and halbert perceiving that lilias had already been pounced upon by sir walter himself and several more seized the bridle of the bewildered malcolm who was still trying to draw his sword and had absolutely swept him away from the scene of action before he had well realized what was passing and now that the poor lad understood the whole his horror grief and shame were unspeakable  before sir james had done more than hear the outline of halberts tale however the watchers on the mound gave the signal that the reivers were coming that waya matter hitherto doubtful since no one could guess whether walter stewart would make for edinburgh or for doune  with the utmost agility sir james sprang up the side of the mound reconnoitred and returned again just as halbert was trying to stir his master from the ground and malcolm answering sullenly that he would not movehe would be taken and die with the rest  you may save them instead if you will attend to me said sir james and at his words the boy suddenly started up with a look of hope  how many fell upon you demanded sir james  full a hundred lances replied halbert and a lance meant at least three men  it wad be a fules wark to withstand them  best bide fast in the covert for our horses are sair forfaughten  if there are now more than twenty lances i am greatly mistaken returned sir james  they must have broken up after striking their blow or have sent to secure glenuskie and we falling on them from this thicket  i see i see cried halbert  back ye loons back among the hazels hold every one his horse ready to mount  with your favour sir squire i say bind each man his horse to a tree the skene and broadsword which i see you all wear will be ten times as effective on foot  do as the knight bids said malcolm starting forth with colour on his cheek light in his eye that made him another being  in him there is help  ay ay lord malcolm muttered halbert you need not tell me that i know my duty better than not to do the bidding of a belted knight and pretty man too of his inches  the two attendants of sir james were meantime apparently uttering some remonstrance to which he lightly replied tut nigel it will do thine heart good to hew down a minion of albany  what were i worth could i not strike a blow against so foul a wrong to my own orphan kindred  brewster ill answer it to thy master  these are his foes as well as those of all honest men  ha thou art as glad to be at them as i myself  by this time he had exchanged his cap for a steel helmet and was assuming the command as his natural right as he placed the men in their ambush behind the knoll received reports from those he had set to watch and concerted the signal with halbert and his own followers  malcolm kept by him shivering with intense excitement and eagerness and thus they waited till the horses hoofs and clank of armour were distinctly audible  but even then sir james with outstretched hand signed his followers back and kept them in the leash as it were until the troop was fairly in the valley those in front beginning to halt to give their horses water  they were in effect riding somewhat carelessly and with the ease of men whose feat was performed and who expected no more opposition  full in the midst was lilias entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse ridden by a slender lightlimbed wiry groom whom malcolm knew as christopher hall a retainer of the duke of albany and beside him rode her captor sir walter stewart a man little above twenty but with a bronzed hardened reckless expression that made him look much older and of huge height and giant build  malcolm knew him well and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father from fear of his intentions and from the misery that his brutal jests scoffs and practical jokes had often personally inflicted and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst fears  but ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror sir jamess shout of st andrew for the right was ringing out echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him as simultaneously they leapt forward  malcolm among the first darting with one spring as it were to the horse where his sister was carried seized the bridle with his left hand and flashing his sword upon the ruffian with the other shouted let go villain give me my sister halls first impulse was to push his horse forward so as to trample the boy down but malcolms hold rendered this impossible besides there was the shouting the clang the confusion of the outburst of an ambush all around and on every side and before the man could free his hand to draw his weapon he necessarily loosed his grasp of lilias who half springing half falling came to the ground almost overthrowing her brother in her descent but just saved by him from coming down prostrate  the horse suddenly released started forward with its rider and at the same moment malcolm recovering himself stood with his sword in his hand his arm round his sisters waist assuring her that she was safe and himself glowing for the first time with manly exultation  had he not saved and rescued her himself  it was as well however that the rescue did not depend on his sole prowess  indeed by the time the brother and sister were clinging together and turning to look round the first shock was over and the retainers of albany probably fancying the attack made by a much larger troop were either in full flight or getting decidedly the worst in their encounters with their assailants  sir james stewart had at the first onset sprung like a lion upon the master of albany and without drawing his sword had grappled with him in the name of st andrew and the king yield thy prey thou dastard were his words as he threw his arms round the body of sir walter and exerted his full strength to drag him from his horse  the young giant writhed struggled cursed raged he had not space to draw sword or even dagger but he struck furiously with his gauntleted hand strove to drive his horse forward  the struggle like that of hercules and antaeus so desperate and mighty was the strength put forth on either side but nothing could unclasp the iron grip of those sinewy arms and almost as soon as malcolm and lilias had eyes to see what was passing walter stewart was being dragged off his horse by that tremendous grapple and the next moment his armour rung as he lay prostrate on his back upon the ground  his conqueror set his mailed foot upon his neck lightly but so as to prevent any attempt to rise and after one moments pause to gather breath said in a clear deep trumpet voice walter stewart of albany on one condition i grant thee thy life  it is that thou take the most solemn oath on the spot that no spulzie or private brawl shall henceforth stain that hand of thine while thy father holds the power in scotland take that oath thou livest refuse it and  he held up the deadly little dagger called the misericorde  and who art thou caitiff landlouper muttered walter to put to oath knights and princes  the knight raised the visor of his helmet  the evening sun shone resplendently on his damasked blue armour and the st andrews cross on his breast and lighted up that red fire that lurked in his eyes and withal the calm power and righteous indignation on his features might have befitted an avenging angel wielding the lightning  thou wilt know me when we meet again was all he said and for the very calmness of the voice the master of albany who was but a mere commonplace insolent ruffian quailed with awe and terror to the very backbone  loose me and i will swear he faintly murmured  sir james before removing his foot unclasped his gorget and undoing a chain held up a jewel shaped like a st andrews cross with a diamond in the midst covering a fragmentary relic  at the sight walter stewarts eyes large pale ones dilated as if with increased consternation the sweat started on his forehead and his breath came in shorter gasps  malcolm and lilias standing near likewise felt a sense of strange awe for they too had heard of this relic a supposed fragment of st andrews own instrument of martyrdom which had belonged to st margaret and had been thought a palladium to the royal family and house of stewart  rise on thy knees said sir james now taking away his foot and swear upon this  walter completely cowed and overawed rose to his knees at his victors command laid his hand on the relic and in a shaken almost tremulous voice repeated the words of the oath after his dictation i walter stewart master of albany hereby swear to god and st andrew to fight in no private brawl to spoil no man nor woman to oppress no poor man clerk widow maid or orphan to abstain from all wrong or spulzie from this hour until the king shall come again in peace  he uttered the words and kissed the jewel that was tendered to him and then sir james said in the same cold and dignified tone let thine oath be sacred or beware  now mount and go thy way but take heed how i meet thee again  sir walters horse was held for him by brewster the knights english attendant and without another word he flung himself into the saddle and rode away to join such of his followers as were waiting dispersed at a safe distance to mark his fate but without attempting anything for his assistance  oh sir burst forth malcolm but then even as he was about to utter his thanks his eye sought for the guardian who had ever been his mouthpiece and with a sudden shriek of dismay he cried my uncle where is he where is sir david  alack alack cried lilias  oh brother i saw him on the ground he fell before my horse  i saw no more for the master held me and muffled my face  oh let us back he may yet live  yea let us back said sir james if we may yet save the good old man those villains will not dare to follow or if they do nigelbrewster you understand guarding the rear  sir began lilias how can we thank  not at all lady replied sir james smiling you will do better to take your seat i fear it must be en croupe for we can scarce dismount one of your guards  she shall ride behind me said malcolm in a more alert and confident voice than had ever been heard from him before  ay right said sir james placing a kind hand on his shoulder thou hast won her back by thine own exploit and mayst well have the keeping of her  that rush on the caitiff groom was well and shrewdly done  and for all malcolms anxiety for his uncle his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down trodden coward into something like manhood and selfrespect  lilias who like most damsels of her time was hardy and active saw no difficulties in the mode of conveyance and so soon as malcolm had seated himself on horseback she placed one foot upon his toe and with a spring of her own assisted by sir jamess wellpractised hand was instantly perched on the crupper clasping her brother round the waist with her arms and laying her head on his shoulder in loving pride at his exploit while for her further security sir james threw round them both the long plaid that had so lately bound her  dear malcolmand her whisper fell sweetly on his earit will be bonnie tidings for patie that thou didst loose me all thyself  the false tyrant to fall on us the very hour patie was on the salt sea  but they were riding so fast that there was scant possibility for words and besides sir james kept too close to them for private whispers  in about an hours time they had crossed the bit of tableland that formed the moor and descended into another little gorge which was the place where the attack had been made upon the travellers  this was where it was possible that they might find sir david but no trace was to be seen except that the grass was trampled and stained with blood  perhaps both lilias and old halbert suggested some of their people had returned and taken him to the abbey of coldingham and as this was by far the safest lodging and refuge for her and her brother the horses heads were at once turned thitherwards  the grand old priory of coldingham founded by king edgar son of margaret the saint and of malcolm ceanmohr in testimony of his gratitude for his recovery of his fathers throne from the usurper donaldbane was a benedictine monastery under the dominion of the great central abbey of durham  it had been a great favourite with the scottish kings of that glorious dynasty which sprung from margaret of wessex and had ample estates which when it was in good hands enabled it to supply the manifold purposes of an ecclesiastical school a model farm a harbour for travellers and a fortified castle  at this period the prior john de akecliff or oakcliff was an excellent man a great friend of sir david drummond and much disliked and persecuted by the house of albany so that there was little doubt that this would be the first refuge thought of by sir davids followers  accordingly malcolm and his companions rode up to the chief gateway a grand circular archway with all the noble though grotesque mouldings zigzag and cable dogtooth and parrotbeak visages human and diabolic wherewith the norman builders loved to surround their doorways  the doors were of solid oak heavily guarded with iron and from a little wicket in the midst peered out a cowled head and instantly ensued the exclamation  benedicite  welcome my lord malcolm  ah but this will ease the heart of the tutor of glenuskie  ah then he is here cried malcolm  here sir but in woful plight borne in an hour syne by four carles who said you had been set upon by the master of albany and sair harried and they say the tutor doth nought but wail for his bairns  how won ye out of his hands my lord  thanks to this good knight said malcolm and the gate was opened and the newcomers dismounted to pass under the archway which taught humility  a number of the brethren met them as they came forth into the first quadrangle surrounded by a beautiful cloister and containing what was called edgars walls a house raised by the good founder for his own lodging and that of visitors within the monastery  it was a narrow building about thirty feet from the church was perfectly familiar to malcolm who bent his steps at once thither among the congratulations of the monks and lilias was not prevented from accompanying him thus far within the convent but all beyond the nave of the church was forbidden ground to her sex though the original monastery destroyed by the danes had been one of the double foundations for monks and nuns  entering the building the brother and sister hastily crossed a sort of outer hall to a chamber where sir david lay on his bed attended by the prior akecliff and the infirmarer  the glad tidings had already reached him and he held out his hands kissed and blessed his restored charges and gave thanks with all his heart but there was a strange wanness upon his face and a spasm of severe pain crossed him more than once though as lilias eagerly asked after his hurts he called them nothing since he had her safe again and then bade malcolm summon the captive knight that he might thank him  sir james stewart had been left in the hall without to the hospitality of the monks he had laid aside his helmet washed his face and arranged his bright locks and as he rose to follow malcolm his majestic stature and bearing seemed to befit the home of the old scottish king  as he entered the chamber sir david slightly raised himself on the pillow and with his eyes dilating into a bewildered gaze exclaimed my liege my dear master  he raves sighed lilias clasping malcolms hand in dire distress  no muttered the sick man sinking back  good king robert has been in his grave many a day his sons woe is mesir recovering himself pardon the error of an old dying man who owes you more than he can express  then sir said james stewart grant me the favour of a few moments private speech with you  i will not keep you long from him he added to malcolm and lilias  his manner was never one to be disputed there was an atmosphere of obedience about the whole monastery and the prior added  yes my children it is but fitting that you should give thanks in the church for your unlookedfor deliverance  malcolm was forced to lead lilias away into the exquisite cross church built in the loveliest early english style of which a few graceful remnants still exist  the two young things knelt together hand in hand in the lornness of their approaching desolation neither of them having dared to utter the foreboding upon their hearts but feeling it all the more surely and while the sisters spirit longed fervently after him whose protection had been only just removed the brother looked up to the sheltering vaults lost in the tranquil twilight and felt that here alone was his haven of peace the refuge for the feeble and the fatherless  their devotions performed they ventured back to the outer hall and on their return being notified they were again admitted  sir james who had been seated on a stool by the sick mans head immediately rose and resigned his place to lilias but did not leave the room and sir david thus spoke bairns god in his mercy hath raised you up the best of guardians in the stead of your ain poor tutor  malcolm laddie you will ride the morn with this gentleman to the true head of your name your ain king whom god for ever bless  his voice quivered  and be it your study so to profit by his example and nurture as to do your devoir by him for ever  nay father cried malcolm i cannot leave you and lily  if you call me father do my bidding said sir david  lily can be safely bestowed with the good sisters of st abbs nor while you are out of albanys reach is the poor lassie worth his molesting but when i am gone your uncles of albany and athole become your tutors and the prior has no power to save you  only over the border with the king is there safety from them and your ruin is the ruin of your sister  and added sir james when the king is at liberty or when you yourself are of age you will return to resume the charge of your fair sister unless some nearer protector be found  meantime he laid one hand on malcolms head and with the other took out the relic which had had so great an effect upon walter stewart i swear on this holy rood of st andrew that malcolm stewart of glenuskie shall be my charge not merely as my kinsman but as my young brother  you hear malcolm said sir david  you will strive to merit such goodness  father broke out the poor boy again you cannot mean to part us  let us abide as we have been till i am of age to take my vows  i am not fit to serve the king  he is the best judge of that returned sir james  and added sir david i tell you lad that i shall never be as i was before and that were i a whole man and sain riding back to glenuskie the morn i should still bless the saints and bid you gang  rarely did the youth of the fifteenth century venture to question the authority of an elder but malcolm was only silenced for a moment and though by no means understanding that his guardian believed his injuries mortal he threw himself upon the advice of the prior whom he entreated to allow him to judge for himself and to remain to protect his sisterhe talked boldly of protecting her after this days exploit  but prior akecliff gave him no more encouragement than did his uncle  the benedictine vows were out of the question till he should be eighteen and the renunciation of the world they involved would be ruinous to lilias since she would become his heiress  moreover the prior himself was almost in a state of siege for the regent was endeavouring to intrude on the convent one brother william drake or drax by his own nomination instead of the canonical appointment emanating from durham and as national feeling went with the regents nominee it was by no means certain that the present prior would be able to maintain his position  oh go yes go dear brother entreated lilias  i should be far happier to know you in safety  they cannot hurt me while you are safe  but you lily  what if this villain drax have his way  he could not harm her in st ebbas fold returned the prior  the abbess herself could not yield her and as you have so often been told my young lord your absence is a far greater protection to your sister than your presence  moreover were the tutors mind at rest there would be far better hope of his recovery  there was no alternative and malcolm could not but submit  lilias was to be conducted before daybreak to the monastery of st abbs about six miles off whence she could be summoned at any time to be with her uncle in coldingham and malcolm was to set off at daybreak with the captive knight whose return to england could no longer be delayed  poor children while sir james stewart was in the priors chamber they sat silent and mournful by the bedside where their guardian lay dozing even till the bell for matins summoned them in common with all the other inmates of the convent they knelt on the floor of the candlelit church and held each others hands as they prayed lilias still the stronger and more hopeful while malcolm as he looked up at those dear familiar vaultings felt as if he were a bird driven from its calm peaceful nest to battle with the tossing winds and storms of ocean without one near him whom he had learnt to love  it was still dark when the service had ended and prior akecliff came towards them  daughter he said to lilias we deem it safer that you should ride to st abbs ere daylight  your palfrey is ready the mother abbess is warned and i will myself conduct you thither  priors were not people to be kept waiting and as it was reported that the tutor of glenuskie was still asleep lilias had to depart without taking leave of him  with malcolm the last words were spoken while crossing the court  fear not lily my heart will only weary till the church owns me and patie has you  nay my malcolm mayhap as the prior tells me your strength and manhood will come in the south country  let them said malcolm i will neither cheat the church nor patie  it were no cheat  there never was any compact  patie is winning his fortune by his own sword he would scorn  hush lily  when the king sees what a weakling sir james has brought him he will be but too glad to exchange patie for me and leave me safe in these blessed walls  but here they were under the archway and the convoy of armed men whom the exigencies of the time forced the convent to maintain were already mounted  sir james stood ready to assist the lady to her saddle and with one long earnest embrace the brother and sister were parted and lilias rode away with the prior by her side letting the tears flow quietly down her cheeks in the darkness and but half hearing the long arguments by which good father akecliff was proving to her that the decision was the best for both malcolm and herself  by and by the dawn began to appear the air of the march night became sharper and in the distance the murmur and plash of the tide was heard then standing heavy and dark against the clear pale eastern sky there arose the dark mass of st ebbas monastery the parent of coldingham standing on the very verge of the cliff to which it has left the name of st abbs head upon ground which has since been undermined by the waves and has been devoured by them  the sea far below calmly brightened with the brightening sky and reflected the morning stars in a lucid track of light strong enough to make the lights glisten red in the convent windows  lilias was expected was a frequent guest and had many friends there and as the sweet sound of the lauds came from the chapel and while she dismounted in the court the concluding amen swelled and died away she though no convent bird felt herself in a safe home and shelter under the wing of kind abbess annabel drummond and only mourned that malcolm so much tenderer and more shrinking than herself should be driven into the unknown world that he dreaded so much more than she did     chapter iii hal   the sun had not long been shining on the dark walls of st ebbas monastery before the lowbrowed gate of coldingham priory opened to let pass the guests of the previous night  malcolm had been kissed and blessed by his guardian and bidden to transfer his dutiful obedience to his new protector and somewhat comforted by believing sir david to be mending since last night he had rent himself away and was riding in the frosty morning air beside the kinsman who had so strangely taken charge of him and accompanied by sir jamess tall old scottish squire by the english groom and by malcolms own servant halbert  for a long space there was perfect silence and as malcolm began to detach his thoughts from all that he had left behind he could not help being struck with the expressions that flitted over his companions countenance  for a time he would seem lost in some deep mournful reverie and his head drooped as if in sadness or perplexity then a sudden gleam would light up his face as if a brilliant project had occurred to him his lips would part his eyes flash he would impel his horse forward as though leading a charge or lift up his head with kindling looks like one rehearsing a speech but ever a check would come on him in the midst his mouth closed in dejection his brow drew together in an anguish of impatience his eyelids drooped in weariness and he would ride on in deep reflection till roused perhaps by the flight of a moorfowl or the rush of a startled roe he would hum some gay french huntingsong or plaintive scottish ballad  scarcely a word had been uttered until towards noon on the borders of a little narrow valley the merry sound of bells clashed up to their ears and therewith sounds of music  tis the toon of christs kirk on the green said the squire as sir james looked at him for information where we were to bait  methought in lent we had been spared this gallimawfrey  tis midlent week you pagan replied sir james  these good folk have come amothering and a share of their simnels well have  sir entreated the squire were it not more prudent of you to tarry without and let me fetch provisions  hoot man a throng is our best friend  besides the horses must rest  so saying sir james rode eagerly forward malcolm following not without wonder at not having been consulted for though kept in strict discipline by his uncle it had always been with every courtesy due to his rank as a kings grandson and the cousins from whom he had suffered were of the same rank with himself  did this wandering landless knight now he had him in his power mean to disregard all that was his due  but when sir james turned round his face sparkling with goodhumour and amusement and laughed as he said now then for the humours of a scottish fair all his offended dignity was forgotten  the greensward was surrounded by small huts and hovels a little old stone church on one side and a hostel near it shadowed by a single tall elm beneath which was the very centre of the village wake  not only was it midlent but the day was the feast of a local saint in whose honour lenten requirements were relaxed  monks and priests were there in plenty and so were jugglers and maskers robin hood and marion gleemen and harpers merchants and hucksters masterful beggars and sorners shepherds in gray mauds with wise collies at their feet shrewd old carlines with their winters spinning of yarn lean wolflike borderers peaceable for the nonce merry lasses with towlike locks floating from their snoods all seen by the intensely glittering sun of a clear march day dry and not too cold for these hardy northern folk  nigel the squire sighed in despondency and malcolm who hated crowds and knew himself a mark for the rude observations of a freespoken populace shrank up to him when sir james nodding in time to the tones of a bagpipe that was playing at the hostel door flung his bridle to brewster the groom laughed at his glum and contemptuous looks merrily hailed the gudewife with her brown face and big silver earrings seated himself on the bench at the long wooden table under the great garland of firboughs willow catkins and primroses hung over the boughs of the tree crossed himself murmured his benedictus benedicat drew his dagger carved a slice of the haunch of ox on the table offered it to the reluctant malcolm then helping himself entered into conversation with the lean friar on one side of him and the stalwart manatarms opposite apparently as indifferent as the rest of the company to the fact that the uncovered boards of the table were the only trenchers and the salt and mustard were taken by the point of each mans dagger from common receptacles dispersed along the board  probably the only person really disgusted or amazed was the english brewster who though too cautious to express a word of his feelings preserved the most complete silence and could scarcely persuade himself to taste the rude fare  nor when the meal was over was sir james disposed to heed the wistful looks of his attendants but wandered off to watch the contest in archery at the butts where arrow after arrow flew wide of the clout for the strength of scotland did not lie in the longbow and albanys edict that shooting should be practised on sundays and holidays had not produced as yet any great dexterity  sir james at first laughed merrily at the extraordinary screwings of visage and contortions of attitude and the useless demonstration of effort with which the clowns aimed their shafts and drew their bow sometimes to find the arrow on the grass at their feet sometimes to see it producing consternation among the bystanders but when he saw brewster standing silently apart viewing their efforts with a scorn visible enough in the dead stolidity of his countenance he murmured a bitter interjection and turned away with folded arms and frowning brow  nigel again urged their departure but at that moment the sweet notes of a long narrative ballad began to sound to the accompaniment of a harp and he stood motionless while the wild mournful ditty told of the cruelty of the lady of frendraught and how     morning sun neer shone upon    lord john and rothiemay  large tears were dropping from under the hand with he veiled his emotion and when nigel touched his cloak to remind him that the horses were ready he pressed the old mans hand saying with a sigh i heard that last at my fathers knee  it rung in my ears for many a year  here lad and dropping a gold coin into the wooden bowl carried round by the blind minstrels attendant he was turning away when the gleeman detecting perhaps the ring of the coin broke forth in stirring tones     it fell about the lammas tide       when moormen win their hay    the doughty earl of douglas rode       into england to catch a prey  again he stood transfixed beating time with his hand his eyes beaming his hips moving as he followed the spiritstirring ballad and then as douglas falls and is laid beneath the bracken bush unseen by his men and montgomery forces hotspur to yield not to him but           to the bracken bush    that grows upon the lily lea  he sobbed without disguise and no sooner was the ballad ended than he sprang forward to the harper crying again again another gold crown to hear it again  sir entreated nigel remember how much hangs on your speed  the ballad i must have exclaimed sir james trying to shake him off it moves the heart more than aught i ever heard  how runs it  i know the ballad said malcolm half in impatience half in contempt  i could sing every word of it  every gleeman has it  nayhear you sirthe lad can sing it reiterated nigel and sir james throwing the promised guerdon to the minstrel let himself be led away to the front of the inn but there was a piper playing to a group of dancers and as if his feet could not resist the fascination sir james held out his hand to the first comely lass he saw disengaged and in spite of the steelguarded boots that he wore answered foot for foot spring for spring to the deft manoeuvres of her shoeless feet with equal agility and greater grace  nigel frowned more than ever at this exhibition and when the knight had led his panting partner to a seat and called for a tankard of ale for her refreshment he remonstrated more seriously still  sir the gates of berwick will be shut  the days lengthen man  and who knows if some of yon landloupers be not of walter stewarts meine  granted that they ken not yourself that lad is only too kenspeckle  moreover you ye made free enough with your siller to set the haill crew of mosstroopers on our track  twenty mile to berwickgate said sir james carelessly nor need you ever look behind you at jades like theirs  nay friend i come since you grudge me for once the sight of a little wholesome glee among my own people  my holiday is dropping from me like sands in an hourglass  he mounted however and put his horse to as round a pace as could be maintained by the whole party with out distress nor did he again break silence for many miles  at the gates of berwick then in english hands be gave a password and was admitted he bade nigel conduct lord malcolm to an inn explaining that it was his duty to present himself to the governor and being detained to sup with him was seen no more till they started the next morning  the governor rode out with them some ten miles with a strong guard of spearmen and after parting with him they pushed on to the south  after the first days journey malcolm was amazed to see sir james mount without any of his defensive armour which was piled on the spare horse his head was covered by a chaperon or flat cap with a short curtain to it and his sword was the only weapon he retained  nigel was also nearly unarmed and sir james advised malcolm himself to lay aside the light hawberk he wore then at his amazed look said poor lad he never saw the day when he could ride abroad scathless  when will the breadth of scotland be as safe as these english hills  he was very kind to his young companion treating him in all things like a guest pointing out what was worthy of note and explaining what was new and surprising  malcolm would have asked much concerning the king to whom he was bound but these questions were the only ones sir james put aside saying that his kinsman would one day learn that it ill beseemed those who were about a kings person to speak of him freely  one night was spent at durham the parent of coldingham and here malcolm felt at home far more grand as was that mighty cathedral institution there it stood with the weir encircling it on its own fair though mighty hill with all the glory of its norman mister and lovely ladychapel yet it seemed to the boy more like a glorified coldingham than like a strange region  the peace of god rests on the place he said when sir james asked his thoughts as he looked back at the grand mass of buildings  these are the only spots where the holy and tender can grow like the palestine lilies sheltered from the blast in the abbots garden at coldingham  nay lad it were an ill world did lilies only grow in abbots gardens  it is an ill world said malcolm  let us hear what you say in a months time replied the knight lightly then dreaming over the words  a few days more and they were riding among the lovely rock and woodland scenery of yorkshire when suddenly there leaped from behind a bush three or four young men with a loud shout of stand  reivers thought malcolm sick with dismay as the foremost grasped sir jamess bridle but the latter merely laughed saying how now hal be these your old tricks  ay when such prizes are errant said the assailant and sir james springing from his horse embraced him and his companion with a cordiality that made malcolm not a little uneasy  could he have been kidnapped by a false englishman into a den of robbers for the sake of his ransom  you are strict to your time said the chief robber  i knew you would be  so when ned marmion came to beverley and would have us to see his hunting at tanfield we came on thinking to meet you  marmion here has a nooning spread in the forest ere we go on to thirsk where i have a matter to settle between two wrongheaded churls  how has it been with you jamie you have added to your meine  ah hal never in all your cutpurse days did you fall on such an emprise as i have achieved  let us hear said hal linking his arm in sir jamess who turned for a moment to say take care of the lad john he is a young kinsman of mine  kinsman thought malcolm do all wandering stewarts claim kin to the blood royal but then as he looked at sir jamess stately head he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence and so kind to himself and ashamed of the moments petulance dismounted and as john said this is the way to our noon meat he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade sheltered from the wind where a lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread dried fish and eggs was laid out on the grass in a bright warm sunshine and hal declaring himself to have a hunters appetite and that he knew jamie had been starved in scotland and was as lean as a greyhound seated himself on the grass and to malcolms extreme surprise not to say disgust was served by lord marmion on the knee and with doffed cap  while the meal was being eaten malcolm studied the strangers  lord marmion was a goodhumoured heartylooking young yorkshireman but the other two attracted his attention far more  they were evidently brothers one perhaps just above the other just below thirty both of the most perfect mould of symmetry activity and strength though perhaps more inclining to agility than robustness  both were faircomplexioned and wore no beard but john was the paler graver and more sedate and his aquiline profile had an older look than that borne by hals perfectly regular features  it would have been hard to define what instantly showed the seniority of his brother for the clearness of his colouringbright red and white like a ladyshis short wellmoulded chin and the fresh earnestness and animation of his countenance gave an air of perpetual youth in spite of the scar of an arrow on the cheek which told of at least one battle but there were those manifestations of being used to be the first which are the evident tokens of elder sonship and the lordly manner more and more impressed malcolm  he was glad that his own sir james was equal in dignity as well as superior in height and he thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible to the sparkling azure eyes of the englishman steadfast keen and brilliant unspeakably though they were but so soon as sir james seemed to have made his explanation the look was most winningly turned on him a hand held out and he was thus greeted welcome my young prince malcolm i am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer that he has brought you to partake it  his keeper somerset thought malcolm as he bowed stiffly he seems to treat me coolly enough  i come to serve my king he said but he was scarcely heard for as hal unbuckled his sword before sitting down on the grass he thrust into his bosom a small black volume with which he seemed to have been beguiling the time and john exclaimed  there goes godfrey de bulloin  i tell you jamie tis well you are come  now have i some one to speak with  ever since harry borrowed my lady of westmorelands book of the holy war he has not had a word to fling at me  ah said sir james i saw a book indeed of the holy land  it would tempt him too much to hear how near the border it dwells  what was it named malcolm  the itinerarium of adamnanus replied malcolm blushing at the sudden appeal  ha  ive heard of it cried the english knight  i sent to half the convent libraries to beg the loan when gilbert de lannoy set forth for the survey of palestine  does the monk of iona tell what commodity of landing there may be on the coast  malcolm had the seaport towns at his fingers ends and having in the hard process of translation and reading and rereading one of the few books that came into his hands nearly mastered the contents he was able to reply with promptness and precision although with much amazement for     much he marvelled a knight of pride    like bookbosomed priest should ride  nor had he ever before found his accomplishments treated as aught but matters of scorn among the princes and nobles with whom he had occasionally been thrown  good good said sir harry at last  well read and clearly called to mind  the stripling will do you credit james  where have you studied fair cousin  cousin was it english fashion to make a cousin of everybody  but gentle humble malcolm had no resentment in him and felt gratified at the friendly tone of so grand and manlylooking a knight  at home he answered with a travelling scholar who had studied at padua and paris  that is where you scots love to haunt  but know you how they are served there  i have seen the gibbet where the mayor of paris hung two clerks sons for loving his daughters over well  the clerks twa sons of owsenford that were foully slain cried malcolm his face lighting up  oh sir have you seen their gibbet  what were they friends of yours asked hal much amused and shaking his head merrily at sir james  ill company i fear  only in a ballad said malcolm colouring that tells how at yuletide the ghosts came to their mother with their hats made of the birk that grew at the gates of paradise  a rare ballad must that be exclaimed hal  canst sing it  or are you wearymarmion prithee tell some of the fellows to bring my harp from the baggage  his own harp is with ours said sir james he will make a better figure therewith  at his sign the attendant nigel the only person besides lord marmion of tanfield who had been present at the meal besides the two stewarts and the english brothers rose and disappeared between the trees beyond which a hum of voices an occasional laugh and the stamping of horses and jingling of bridles betokened that a good many followers were in waiting  malcolms harp was quickly brought having been slung in its case to the saddle of halberts horse and as he had used it to beguile the last evenings halt it did not need much tuning  surprised as his princely notions were at being commanded rather than requested to sing the sweet encouraging smile and tone of kind authority banished all hesitation in complying and he gave the ballad of the clerks twa sons of owsenford with much grace and sweetness while the weakness of his voice was compensated by the manlier strains with which sir james occasionally chimed in  then as harry gave full meed of appreciative praise and thanks sir james said lend me thine harp malcolm i have learnt thy song now and thou harry must hear and own how far our scottish minstrelsy exceeds thy boasted chevy chase  and forth rang in all the mellow beauty of his voice that most glorious of ballads the battle of otterburn as much more grand than it had been when he heard it from the gleeman or from malcolm as a magnificent voice patriotic enthusiasm and cultivation and refinement could make it  he had lost himself and all around in the passion of the victory the pathos of the death  but no such bright look of thanks recompensed him  harrys face grew dark and he growled douglas dead  ay he wins more fields so than alive  i wish you would keep my old shrewsbury friend earl tyneman as you call him at home  tis ill keeping the scholars in bounds when the master is away returned sir james  well by this time tom has taught them how to transgresssent them home with the long scourge from robbing orchards in anjou  he writes to me almost with his foot in the stirrup about to give douglas and buchan a lesson  i shall make short halts and long stages south  this is too far off for tidings  true said sir john with a satirical curl of the lip above all when fair ladies brook not to ink their ivory fingers  there spake the envious fiend laughed the elder brother  john bears not the sight of what he will not or cannot get  ill never be chained to a ladys litter nor be forced to loiter till her wimple is pinned retorted john  nor do i like dames with two husbands besides  one would have cancelled the other as grammarians tell us said harry if thy charms john had cancelled thine hook nose  i would they had ere her first marriage  humfrey will burn his fingers there and we must hasten back to look after that among other thingsmy lord marmion he added starting hastily up and calling to him as he stood at some distance conversing with the scottish nigel so please you let us have the horses and as the gentleman hastened to give the summons he said we shall make good way now  we shall come on watling street  ha jamie when shall we prove ourselves better men than a pack of pagan romans by having a set of roads fit for man or beast of our own making instead of theirs half decayed  look where i will in england or france their roads are the same in buildfirm as the world itself straight as arrows  an army is off ones mind when once one gets on a roman way ill learn the trick and have them from edinburgh to bordeaux ere ten years are out and then what with traffic and converse with the world and ready justice neither highland men minor gascons will have leisure or taste for robbery  perhaps gascons and scots will have a voice in the matter said james a little stiffly and the horses being by this time brought sir harry mounted and keeping his horse near that of young malcolm to whom he had evidently taken a fancy he began to talk to him in so friendly and winning a manner that he easily drew from the youth the whole history of his acquaintance with sir james stewart of the rescue of his sister and the promise to conduct him to the captive king of scots as the only means of saving him from his rapacious kindred  poor lad said harry gravely  do you know king james sir asked malcolm timidly  know him said harry turning round to scan the boy with his merry blue eye  i know himyes that as far as a poor welsh knight can know his grace of scotland  and sir will he be good lord to me  eh thats as you may take him  i would not be one of yonder scots under his hands  has he learned to hate his own countrymen asked malcolm in an awe stricken voice  hate  i trow he has little to love them for  he is a good fellow enough my young lord when left to himself but best beware  lions in a cage have strange tempers  a courier rode up at the moment and presented some letters which sir harry at once opened and read beckoning his brother and sir james to his side while malcolm rode on in their wake in a state of dismay and bewilderment  nigel and lord marmion were together at so great an interval that he could not fall back on them nor learn from them who these brothers were  and there was something in the ironical suppressed pity with which harry had spoken of his prospects with the king of scots that terrified him all the more because he knew that sir james and nigel would both hold it unworthy of him to have spoken freely of his own sovereign with an englishman  would james be another walter and if so would sir james stewart protect him  he had acquired much affection for and strong reliance on the knight but there was something unexplained and his heart sank  the smooth line of watling street at length opened into the old town of thirsk and here bells were ringing flags flying from the steeple music sounded a mayor and his corporation in their robes rode slowly forth crowds lined the roadside caps were flung up and a tremendous shout arose god save king harry  malcolm gazed about more utterly discomfited  there was harry upright on his horse listening with a gracious smile while the mayor rehearsed a speech about welcome and victories and the hopeful queen and what was still more to the purpose tendered a huge pair of gauntlets each filled to the brim one with gold and the other with silver pieces  eh  thanks master mayor but these gloves must be cleared ere there is room for me to use them in battle  and handing the gold glove to his brother he scattered the contents of the silver one far and wide among the populace who shouted their blessings louder than ever and thus he reached the marketplace  there all was set forth as for the lists a horseman in armour on either side  heigh now sirs said harry have we not wars enough toward without these mummings of vanity  this is no show my lord king returned the mayor abashed  this is deadly earnest  these are two honourable gentlemen of yorkshire who are come hither to fight out their quarrel before your grace  two honourable foolsheads muttered harry then raising his voice come hither gentlemen let us hear your quarrel  the two gentlemen were big yorkshiremen heavybrowed and their native shrewdness packed far away behind a bumpkin stolidity and surliness that barely allowed them to show respect to the king  so please you sir growled the first in his throat here stands christopher kitson of barrowbridge ready to avouch himself a true man and prove in yonder fellows teeth that it was not a brokenkneed beast that i sent up for a heriard to my lord archbishop when my father died but that he of easingwold is a black slanderer and backbiter  and here shouted the other stands honest william trenton of easingwold ready to thrust his lies down his throat and prove on his body that the heriard he sent to my lord archbishop was a sorry jade  that were best proved by the beasts body interposed time king  and proceeded the doughty kitson as though repeating a lesson having vainly pleaded the matter these nine years we are come to demand licence to fight it out with lance sword and dagger in your royal presence to set the matter at rest for ever  breaking a mans head to prove the soundness of a horse ejaculated harry  your licence is given sir king demanded kitson  my licence is given for a combat a loutrance said henry but as they were about to flounder back on their big farmhorses he raised his voice to a thundering sound solely on this condition that he who slays his neighbour be he trenton or kitson shall hang for the murder ere i leave thirsk  there was a recoil and the mayor himself ventured to observe something about the judgment of god and never so seen  and i say thundered henry and his blue eyes seemed to flame with vehement indignation i say that the ordeal of battle is shamefully abused and that it is a taking of gods nameay and mans lifein vain to appeal thereto on every coxcombs quarrel risking the life that was given him to serve gods ends not his own sullen fancy  i will have an end of such thingsand you gentlemen since the heriard is dead or too old to settle the question shake hands and if you must let blood come to france with me next month and flesh your knives on french and scots  so please you sir grumbled kitson theres mistress agnes of mineshull shes been in doubt between the two of us these five years and shed promised to wed whichever of us got the better  ill settle her mind for her  whichever i find foremost among the french ill send home to her a knight and with better sense to boot than to squabble for nine years as to an old horse  he then dismounted and was conducted into the townhall where a banquet was prepared taking by the hand sir james stewart and followed by his brother john and by malcolm who felt as though his brain were turning partly with amazement partly with confusion at his own dulness as he perceived that not only was the freespoken hal henry of monmouth king of england but that his wandering benefactor the captive knight whose claim of kindred he had almost spurned was his native sovereign james the first of scotland     chapter iv the tidings of beauge   malcolm understood it at last  in the great chamber where he was bidden to wait within nigel till sir james came from a private conference with harry he had all explained to him but within a curtness and brevity that must not be imitated in the present narrative  the squire nigel was in fact sir nigel baird baron of bairdsbrae the gentleman to whom poor king robert ii had committed the charge of his young son james when at fourteen he had been sent to france nominally for education but in reality to secure him from the fate of his brother rothsay  captured by english vessels on the way the heir of scotland had been too valuable a prize to be resigned by the politic henry iv who had lodged him at windsor castle together with edmund mortimer earl of march and placed both under the nominal charge of the prince of wales a youth of a few years older  unjust as was the detention it had been far from severe the boys had as much liberty as their age and recreation required and received the choicest training both in the arts of war and peace  they were bred up in close intercourse with the kings own four sons and were united with them by the warmest sympathy  in fact since usurpation had filled henry of lancasters mind with distrust and jealousy his eldest son had been in no such enviable position as to be beyond the capacity of fellowfeeling for the royal prisoner  of a peculiarly frank open and affectionate nature young henry had so warmly loved the gentle and fascinating richard ii that his trust in the father of whom he had seen little in his boyhood had received a severe shock through richards fate  under the influence of a new suspicious and avaricious wife the king kept his son as much at a distance as possible chiefly on the welsh marches learning the art of war under hotspur and oldcastle and when the father and son were brought together again the bold free bearing and extraordinary ability of the prince filled the suspicious mind of the king with alarm and jealousy  to keep him down give him no money and let him gain no influence was the narrow policy of the king and henry chafing dreaming feeling the injustice and pining for occupation shared his complaints within james and in many a daydream restored him freely to his throne and together redressed the wrongs of the world  meantime james studied deep in preparation and recreated himself with poetry inspired by the charms of joan beaufort the lovely daughter of the kings legitimatized brother the earl of somerset while henry persisted in a boys passionate love to king richards maiden widow isabel of france  entirely unrequited as his affection was it had a beneficial effect  next after his deep sense of religion it kept his life pure and chivalrous  he was for ever faithful to his future wife even when isabel had been returned to france and his romantic passion had fixed itself on her younger sister catherine whom he endowed in imagination with all he had seen or supposed in her  credited with every excess by the tongue of his stepmother too active minded not to indulge in freakish sports and experiments in life very astounding to commonplace minds sometimes when in dire distress even helping himself to his unpaid allowance from his fathers mails and always with buoyant high spirits and unfailing drollery that scandalized the grave seniors of the court there is full proof that prince hal ever kept free from the gross vices which a later age has fancied inseparably connected with his frolics and though always in disgrace the vexation of the court and a byword for mirth he was true to the grand ideal he was waiting to accomplish and never dimmed the purity and loftiness of his aim  that little band of princely youths who sported studied laughed sang and schemed in the glades of windsor were strangely brought togetherthe captive exiled king the disinherited heir of the realm and the sons of the monarch who held the one in durance and occupied the throne of the other and yet their affection had all the frank delight of youthful friendship  the younger lads were in more favour with their father than was the elder  thomas was sometimes preferred to him in a mortifying manner johns grave quiet nature prevented him from ever incurring displeasure and humfrey was the spoilt pet of the family but nothing could lessen harrys largeminded love of his brothers and he was the idol and hero of the whole young party who implicitly believed in his mighty destinies as a renovator of the world the deliverer of jerusalem and restorer of the unity and purity of the church  harry the fifth was crowned and with the full intention of carrying out his great dream  but his promise of releasing james became matter of question  the house of albany who held the chief power in scotland had bound henry iv over not to free their master and it was plain that to send him home before his welcome was ensured would be but tossing him on their spears  in vain james pleaded that he was no boy and was able to protect himself and vowed that when the faithful should rally round his standard he would be more than a match for his enemies or that if not he would rather die free than live in bondage  henry would not listen and insisted upon retaining him until he should himself be at leisure to bring him home with a high hand utterly disregarding his assurance that this would only be rendering him in the eyes of his subjects another despised and hated balliol  deeming himself a divinelyappointed redresser of wrongs henry was already beginning on his great work of purifying europe in preparation for his mighty crusade and having won that splendid victory which laid distracted france at his feet he only waited to complete the conquest as thoroughly and rapidly as might be and lest his grand purpose should be obstructed this great practical visionary though full of kindness and generosity kept in thraldom a whole troop of royal and noble captives  he had however been so far moved by jamess entreaties as to consent that when he himself offered his devotions at the shrine of st john of beverley the native saint who shared with the two cordwainers his gratitude for the glories of crispin crispians day his prisoner should unknown to any save the few who shared the pilgrimage push on to reconnoitre his own country and judge for himself having first sworn to reveal himself to no one and to avoid all who could recognize him  james had visited glenuskie within a special view to profiting by the wisdom of sir david drummond and had then been at stirling edinburgh and perth on his way back falling in with malcolm in his distress he had conceived the project of taking him to england and finding himself already more than half recognized by sir david had obtained his most grateful and joyous consent  in truth jamess heart had yearned to his young cousin his own situation had become much more lonely of late for henry was no longer the comrade he had once been since he had become a keeper instead of a fellowsufferer  it was true that he did his best to forget this by lavishing indulgences on his captive and insisting on being treated on terms of brotherly familiarity but though his transcendent qualities commanded love the intimacy could be but a semblance of the once equal friendship  moreover that conspiracy which cost the life of the earl of cambridge had taught james that cautious reserve was needed in dealing with even his old friends the princes so easily might he be accused of plotting either with henrys immediate heir or with the mortimers and in this guarded life he had hailed with delight the opportunity of taking to himself the young orphan cousin of kindred blood of congenial tastes and homelike speech whom he might treat at once as a younger brother and friend and mould by and by into a trusty counsellor and assistant  that peculiar wistfulness and gentleness of malcolms look and manner together with the refinement and intellect apparent to all who conversed with him without alarming him had won the kings heart and made him long to keep the boy with him  as to malcolms longing for the cloister he deemed it the result of the weakly health and refined nature which shrank from the barbarism of the outer world and he thought it would pass away under shelter from the rude taunts of the fierce cousins at a distance from the wellmeaning exhortations of the monks and at the spectacle of brave and active men who could also be pious conscientious and cultivated  in the renewed sojourn at windsor which james apprehended the training of such a youth as malcolm of glenuskie would be no small solace  by the time malcolm had learnt as much of all this as sir nigel baird knew or chose to communicate the king entered the room  he flung himself on his knees exclaiming with warm gratitude as he kissed the kings hand my liege i little kenned  i meant thee to ken little said james smiling  well laddie wilt thou share the prisoners cellay bairdsbrae you were a true prophet harry will do all himself and will not hear of losing me to deal with my own people at my own gate  no no hell have me back with southron bows and bills so soon as this small trifle of france lies quiet in his grasp  i had nearly flung back my parole in his face and told him that no english sword should set me on the bruces throne but there is something in harry of monmouth that one must love and there are moments when to see and hear him one would as soon doubt the commission of an angel with a flaming sword  a black angel growled sir nigel  scoff and chafe baird but look at his work  look at normandy freed from misrule and exaction in peace and order  look at this land  was ever king so loved  or how durst he act as he did this day  nay an it were so at home said baird i had as lief stay here as where a man is not free to fight out his own feud  even this sackless callant thought it shame to see two honest men baulked  poor scotland sighed james  woe is the land where such thoughts come readiest to grayhaired men and innocent boys  i tell you cousin this precious right is the very cause that our poor country is so lawless and bloody that yon poor silly sparrow would fain be caged for fear of the kites and carrioncrows  alack my lord let me but have my way  i cannot fight  let patrick drummond have my sister and my lands and your service will be far better done said malcolm  i know all that said the king kindly  there is time enough for settling that question and meantime you will not be spoilt for monk or priest by cheering me awhile in my captivity  i need you laddie me added laying his hand on the boys shoulder with all the instinctive fascination of a stewart  i lack a comrade of my own blood for i am all alone  oh sir and malcolm looking into his face saw it full of tenderness  books and masters you shall have continued james such as for church or state cathedral cloister or camp shall render you the meeter prince and i pass you my royal word that if at full age the cowl be your choice i will not gainsay you  meantime abide with me and be the young brother i have yearned for  the king threw his arms round malcolm who felt and unconsciously manifested a strange bliss in that embrace even while fixed in his determination that nothing should make him swerve from his chosen path nor render him false to his promise to patrick and lilias  it was a strange change from being despised and downtrodden by fierce cousins or only fondled pitied and treated with consideration by his own nearest and dearest friends to be the chosen companion of a king and such a king  nor could it be a wile of satan thought malcolm since james still promised him liberty of choice  he would ask counsel of a priest next time he went to confession and in the meantime in the full tide of gratitude admiration and affection he gave himself up to the enjoyment of his new situation and of time kings kindness and solicitude  this was indeed absolutely that of an elder brother for observing that malcolms dress and equipments the work of glenuskie looms supplemented by a few edinburgh purchases was uncouth enough to attract some scornful glances from the crowd who came out to welcome the royal entrance into york the next day he instantly sent brewster in search of the best tailor and lorimer in the city and provided so handsomely for the appearance of young glenuskie his horse and his attendants that the whole floor of their quarters was strewn with doublets boots chaperons and gloves saddles bridles and spurs when the duke of bedford loitered into the room and began to banter james for thus as he supposed pranking himself out to meet the lady of his love and then bemoaned the fripperies that had become the rage in their once bachelor court vowing between sport and earnest that hal was so enamoured of his fair bride that anon the conquest of france would be left to himself and his brother tom of clarence while james retorted by thrusts at bedfords own rusticity of garb and by endeavouring to force on him a pair of shoes with points like rams horns as a special passport to the favour of dame jaca lady who seemed to be the object of duke johns great distaste  suddenly a voice was heard in the gallery of the great old mansion where they were lodged  john  john  herewhere is the duke i say  it was thick and husky as with some terrible emotion and the king and duke had already started in dismay before the door was thrown open and king henry stood among them his face of a burning red  see here john he said holding out a letter and then with an accent of wrathful anguish and a terrible frown he turned on james exclaiming i would send you to the tower sir did i think you had a hand in this  malcolm trembled and sidled nearer his prince while james with an equally fierce look replied hold sir  send me where you will but dare not dishonour my name  then changing as he saw the exceeding grief on henrys brow and heard johns smothered cry of dismay for heavens sake harry what is it  this said henry less loudly less hotly but still with an agony of indignation thomas is deadand by the hand of two of your traitor scots  murdered cried james aghast  murdered by all honest laws of war but on the battlefield said henry your cousin of buchan and old douglas fell on my brave fellows at beauge when they were spent with travel to stop the robberies in anjou they closed in with their pikes on my brave fellows took somerset prisoner and for thomas while he was dealing with a knight named swinton in front the villain buchan comes behind and cleaves his head in twain and that is what you scots call fighting  it was worthy of a son of albany said james  would that vengeance were in my power  ay you loved him said henry grasping jamess hand his passion softened into a burst of tears as he wrung his prisoners hand  nay who did not love him my brave freehearted brother  and that ii should have dallied here and left him to bear the brunt and be cut off by you felon scots  and he hid his face struggling within an agony of heartrending grief which seemed to sway his whole tall powerful frame as he leant against the high back of a chair while john together with james was imploring him not to accuse himself for his presence had been needful at home and to turn the tenor of his thought james inquired whether there were any further disaster  not as yet said henry there is not a man left in that heavenabandoned crew who knows how to profit by what they have got but i must back again ere the devil stir them up a man of witand you sir can you take order with these heady scots  from windsor no said james but set me in the saddle let me learn war under such a captain as yourself and maybe they will not take the field against me or if they do the slayer of clarence shall rue it  be it so said henry wringing his hand  you shall with me to france jamie and see war  the scots should flock to the lion rampant and without them the french are mo better than deer under the fool and murderer they call dauphin  yet alas will any success give me back my brothermy brother the brave and true he added weeping again within time abandon of an open nature and simple age  it was for my sins my forgetfulness of my great work that this has come on meho marmion carry these tidings from me to the dean pray him that the knell be tolled at the minster and a requiem sung for my brother and all who fell with him  we will be there ourselves and the mayor must hold us excused from his banquet these men are too loyal not to grieve for their king  and with his arm round the neck of his brother john henry left the room and before another word could be said sir nigel was there having only retired on the kings entrance  the news was of course all over the house and with an old attendants freedom he exclaimed so sir the english have found tough cummers at last  not too honourably said james sadly  hout would not the puir loons be glad enow of any gate of coming by a clout at the mans brother that keeps you captive  they have taken away one of those i loved best said james  im no speaking ill of the lad clarence himself said nigel he was a braw youth leal and bold and he has died in his helm and spurs as a good knight should  id wish none of these princes a waur ending moreover could swinton have had the wit to keep him living hed have been a bonnie barter for you my lord but ony way the fight was a gallant one and the very squire that brought the tidings cannot deny that our scots fought like lions  would douglas but so fight in any good quarrel sighed the king  but what are you longing to ask malcolm  is it for your kinsman patrick  i fear me that there is little chance of your hearing by name of him  i wot not said sir nigel i did but ask for that harebrained young cousin of mine davie baird that must needs be off on this journey to france and the squire tells me he was no herald to be answerable for the rogues that fought on the other side  we shall soon see for ourselves said james i am to make this campaign  you you my liege  against your own ally and under the standard of england  woes me how could ye be so lost  james argued on his own conviction that the true france was with poor charles vi and that it was doing the country no service to prolong the resistance of the armagnacs and the dauphin who then appeared mere partisans instead of patriots  as to fighting under the english banner no subjection was involved in an adventurer king so doing had not the king of bohemia thus fought at crecy and was not the king of sicily with the french army  moreover james himself felt the necessity of gaining some experience in the art of war  theoretically he had studied it with all his might from caesar quintus curtius and that favourite modern authority the learned ecclesiastic jean pave who was the vauban of the fifteenth century and he had likewise obtained greedily all the information he could from henry himself and his warriors but all this had convinced him that if war was to be more than a mere raid conducted by mere spirit and instinct some actual apprenticeship was necessary even for such a dash henry himself had told him that he would find his bookknowledge an absolute impediment without some practice and would probably fail for that very reason when opposed to tough old seasoned warriors  and prudence apart james at fiveandtwenty absolutely glowed with shame at the thought that every one of his companions had borne arms for at least ten years past while his arrows had no mark but the target his lances had all been broken in the tiltyard  it was this argument that above all served to pacify old bairdsbrae though he confessed himself very uneasy as to the prejudice it would create in scotland and so evidently loathed the expedition that james urged on him to return to scotland instead of continuing his attendance  there was no fear but that his ransom would be accepted and he had been absent twelve years from his home  no no my lord i sware to your father that id never quit you till i brought you safe home again and god willing ill keep my oath  but whats this puir callant to do that you were set upon rearing upon your books at windsor  he shall choose said james  either he shall study at the learned university at oxford or at paris or he shall ride with me and see how cities and battles are won  speak not yet cousin it takes many months to shake out the royal banner and you shall look about you ere deciding now give me yonder black cloak they are assembling for the requiem  malcolm as he followed his king was not a little amazed to see that henry the magnificent victor was wrapped in a plain black serge garment his short dark hair uncovered his feet bare and that on arriving at the minster he threw himself on his knees almost on his face before the choir steps there remaining while the de profundis and the like solemn and mournful strains floated through the dark vaultings above him perhaps soothing while giving expression to the agony of his affliction and selfaccusation not for the devastation of the turbulent country of an insane sovereign but for his having relaxed in the mighty work of renovation that he had imposed on himself  even when the service was ended the king would not leave the minster  he lifted himself up to bid bedford and his companions return but for himself he intended to remain and confess in preparation for being houselled at the mass for the dead early the next morning before hastening on the southern journey  was this thought the bewildered malcolm as he fell asleep the godless atmosphere he had been used to think all that was not glenuskie or coldinghamengland above all  indeed in the frosty twilight of the spring morning though henry was now clad in his usual garb sleeplessness sorrow and fasting made him as wan and haggard as any ascetic monk his eyes were sunken and his closed lips bore a stern fixed expression which scarcely softened even when the sacrificial rite struck the notes of praise and though a light came into his eye it was rather the devotion of one who had offered himself than the gleam of hopeful exultation  the horses stood saddled at the west door for henry was feverishly eager to reach pontefract where he had left his queen and wished to avoid the delay of breaking his fast at york but only to snatch a meal at some country hostel on his way  round the horses however a crowd of the citizens were collected to gaze and two or three women with children in their arms made piteous entreaties for the kings healing touch for their little ones  the kind henry waited ungloved his hand asked his treasurer for the gold pieces that were a muchesteemed part of the cure and signed to his attendant chaplain to say the collect appointed for the rite  fervent blessings were meantime murmured through the crowd which broke out into loud shouts of god save king harry as he at length leapt into the saddle but at that moment a feeble withered old man leaning on a staff and wearing a bedesmans gown peered up and muttered to a comrade  fairfaced quothafair maybe but not long for this world  one is gone already and the rest will not be long after the holy mans words will have their waythe death mark is on him  the words caught jamess ear and he angrily turned round foulmouthed raven peace with thy traitor croak but bedford caught his arm crying  hush tis a mere bedesman and bending forward to pour a handful of silver into the beggars cap he said pray gaffer praypray for the dead and living both  so said james as both mounted theres a fee for a boding traitor  i knew his face said bedford with a shudder he belonged to archbishop scrope  a traitor too said james  nay there was too much cause for his words  never shall i forget the day when scrope was put to death on this very moor on which we are entering  there sat my father on his horse with us four boys around him when the old man passed in front of us and looked at him with a face pitiful and terrible  harry of bolingbroke he said because thou hast done these things therefore shall thy foes be of thine own household the sword shall never depart therefrom but all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age and in the fourth generation shall their name be clean cut off  the commons will have it that at that moment my father was struck with leprosy and struck to the heart assuredly he was nor was he ever the same man again  i always believed that those words made him harder upon every prank of poor hals till any son save hal would have become his foe  and see now the old bedesman may be in the right poor pretty blanche has long been in her grave thomas is with her now and jamiehe lowered his voicewhen men say that harry hath more of alexander in him than there is in other men it strikes to my heart to think of the ring lying on the empty throne  now said james what strikes me is what doleful bodings can come into a brave mans head on a chill morning before he has broken his fast a tankard of hot ale will chase away omens whether of bishop or bedesman  it may chase them from the mind but will not make away with them said john  but i might have known better than to speak to you of such thingsyou who are wellnigh a lollard in disbelief of all beyond nature  no lollard am i said james  what holy church tells me i believe devoutly but not in that which she bids me loathe as either craft of devils or of men  ay of which  there lies the question said john  of men said the scottish king of men who have wit enough to lay hold of the weaker side even of a sober youth such as lord john of lancaster your proneness to believe in sayings and prophecies in sorceries and magic is the weakest point of all of you  and it is the weakest point in you james that you will not credit upon proof such proof as was the fulfilment of the prophecy of the place of my fathers death  one such saying as that fulfilled to the ear though not in truth is made the plea for all this heartsinkingay and what is worse for the durance of your fathers widow as a witch and of her brave young son because forsooth his name is arthur of richemont and some old welsh rhymester hath whispered to harry that richmond shall come out of brittany and be king of england  arthur is no worse off than any other captive of agincourt said bedford and i tell you james the day may come when you will rue your want of heed to timely warnings  better rue once than pine under them all my life and far better than let them betray me into deeming some grewsome crime an act of justice as you may yet let them do said james  such converse passed between the two princes while king henry rode in advance for the most part silent and only desirous of reaching pontefract castle where he had left the young wife whose presence he longed for the more in his trouble  the afternoon set in with heavy rain but he would not halt although he gave free permission to any of his suite to do so and james recommended malcolm to remain and come on the next day with brewster  the boy however disclaimed all weariness partly because bashfulness made him unwilling to venture from under his royal kinsmans wing and partly because he could not bear to let the english suppose that a scotsman and a stewart could be afraid of weather as the rain became harder with the evening twilight silence sank upon the whole troop and they went splashing on through the deep lanes in mud and mire until the lights of pontefract castle shimmered on high from its hill  the gates were opened the horses clattered in torches came forth flickering and hissing in the darkness  the travellers went through what seemed to malcolm an interminable number of courts and gateways and at length flung themselves off their horses when henry striding on mounted the steps entered the building and turning the corner of a great carved screen he and his brother with james and malcolm found themselves in the midst of a blaze of cressets and tapers which lighted up the wainscoted part of the hall  the whole scene was dazzling to eyes coming in from the dark and only after a moment or two could malcolm perceive that close to the great fire sat a party of four playing at what he supposed to be that french game with painted cards of which patrick drummond had told him and that the rest seemed to be in attendance upon them  dark eyed and haired with a creamy ivory skin and faultless form and feature the fair catherine would have been unmistakable save that as henry hurried forward the lights glancing on his jaded face matted hair and soaked dress the first to spring forward to meet him was a handsome young man who wrung his hand crying ah harry harry then tis too true while the lady made scarcely a step forwards no shade of colour tinged her delicate cheek and though she did not resist his fervent embrace it was with a sort of recoil and all she was heard to say was eh messire vos bottes sont crottees  you know all kate he asked still holding her hand and looking afraid of inflicting a blow  the battle  is it then so great a disaster and seeing his amazed glance the poor messire de clarence it was pity of him he was a handsome prince  ah sweet he held thee dear said henry catching at the crumb of sympathy  but yes said catherine evidently perplexed by the strength of his feeling and repeating he was a beau sieur courtois  but surely it will not give the armagnacs the advantage  with heavens aid no  but how fares it with poor madgehis wife i mean  she is away to her estates  she went this morn and wished to have taken with her the demoiselle de beaufort but i forbade thati could not be left without one lady of the blood  alack joan and henry was turning but catherine interrupted him you have not spoken to madame of hainault nor to the duke of orleans nay you are in no guise to speak to any one she added looking with repugnance at the splashes of mud that reached even to his waist  i will don a fresh doublet sweetheart said henry more rebuked than seemed fitting and be ready to sup anon  supper  we supped long ago  that may be but we have ridden long since we snatched our meal that i might be with thee the sooner my kate  that was not well in you my lord to come in thus dishevelled steaming with wetnot like a king  you will be sick my lord  the little word of solicitude recalled his sweet tender smile of gratitude  no fear ma belle sickness dares not touch me  then said the queen you will be served in your chamber and we will finish our game  henry turned submissively away but bedford tarried an instant to say fair sister he is sore distressed  it would comfort him to have you with him  he has longed for you  catherine opened her beautiful brown eyes in a stare of surprise and reproof at the infraction of the rules of ceremony which she had brought with her  john of bedford had never seemed to her either beau or courtois and she looked unutterable things to which he replied by an elevation of his marked eyebrows  she sat down to her game utterly ignoring the other princes in their weatherbeaten condition and they were forced to follow the king and make their way to their several chambers for queen catherines will was law in matters of etiquette  the proud peat  she is jealous of every word harry speakseven to his cousin muttered james as he reached his own room  you saw her thoughyou saw her he added smiling as he laid his hand on malcolms shoulder  the boy coloured like a poppy and answered awkwardly enough the lady joan sir  who but the lady joan thou silly lad  how sayst thou  will not scotland forget in the sight of that fair face all those fule phantasiesthe only folly i heard at glenuskie  methinks said malcolm looking down in sheer awkwardness it were easier to bow to her than to king harrys dame  she hath more of stateliness  humph said james dost so serve thy courtly prenticeship  nay but in a sort i see thy meaning  the royal blood of england shows itself to one who hath an eye for princeliness of nature  nay said malcolm gratified those dark eyes and swart locks  dark eyesswart locks interrupted the king  his wits have gone wool gathering  indeed sir exclaimed malcolm i thought you meant the lady who stood by the queens table with the grand turn of the neck and the white wimple and veil  pshaw said james the foolish callant he hath taken that great brown luxemburg nun of dame jacs for the rose of somerset  however james seeing how confounded the boy was by this momentary displeasure explained to him who the other persons he had seen werejaqueline the runaway countess of hainault in her own right and duchess of brabant by marriage humfrey duke of gloucester the kings young brilliant brother the grave melancholy duke of orleans who had been taken captive at agincourt and was at present quartered at pontefract the handsome but stout and heavylooking earl of march brave lord warwick sir lewis robsart the old knight to whose charge the queen had been specially committed from the moment of her betrothal and a young bold gaylooking lad of malcolms own age but far taller and stouter and with a merry halfdefiant halfinsouciant air who had greatly taken his fancy was he was told ralf percy the second son of sir harry percy  of him they called hotspurwho was taken captive at otterburn who died a rebel exclaimed malcolm  ay said james but king harry had learnt the art of war as a boy first under hotspur in wales nor doth he love that northern fashion of ours of keeping up feud from generation to generation  so hath he restored the eldest son to his barony and set him to watch our borders and the younger ralf he is training in his own school of chivalry  more wonders for malcolm stewart who had learnt to believe it mere dishonour and tameness to forgive the son for his fathers deeds  a cloistered priest could hardly do so pardon to a hostile family came only with the last mortal throe and here was this warlike king forgiving as a mere matter of course  but added james you had best not speak of your bent conventwards in the court here  i should not like to have you called the monkling  malcolm crimsoned with the resolution never to betray himself     chapter v whittington s feast   the next day the royal train set forth from pontefract and ere mounting james presented his young kinsman to the true joan beaufortfairhaired softfeatured blueeyed and with a lovely air of graciousness as she greeted him with a sweet blushing sunny smile half that of the queen in anticipation half that of the kindly maiden wishing to set a stranger at ease  so beautiful was she that malcolm felt annihilated at the thought of his blunder of last night  as they rode on james was entirely occupied with the lady and malcolm was a good deal left to himself for though the party was numerous he knew no one except the duke of bedford who was riding with the king and lord warwick in deep consultation while sir nigel baird lord marmion and the rest were in the rear  he fell into a mood of depression such as had not come upon him since he passed the border thinking himself despised by all for being illfavoured and illdressed and chafing above all at the gay contempt he fancied in young ralf percys eye  he became constantly more discontented with this noisy turmoil and more resolved to insist on returning to the peaceful cloister where alone he could hide his head and be at rest  the troop halted for what they called their noon meat at the abode of a hospitable yorkshire knight but king henry in order that the good gentlemans means should not be overtasked had given directions that only the ladies and the princes should enter the house while the rest of the suite should take their meal at the village inn  king james in attending to joan had entirely forgotten his cousin and malcolm doubtful and diffident was looking hesitatingly at the gateway when ralf percy called out ha you there this is our way  that is only for the royal folk but theres good sack and better sport down here  ill show you the way he added goodnaturedly softened as most were by the startled wistful timid look  malcolm ashamed to say he was royal but surprised at the patronage was gratefully following when old bairdsbrae indignantly laid his hand on the rein  not so sir this is no place for you  let me alone entreated malcolm as he saw percys amazed look and whistle of scorn  they dont want me  you will never have your place if you do not take it said the old gentleman and leading the trembling shrinking boy up to the door he continued for the honour of scotland sir and then announcing malcolm by his rank and title he almost thrust him in  fancying he detected a laugh on ralf percys face and a sneer on that of the stout english porter malcolm felt doubly wretched as he was ushered into the hall and the buzz of talk and the confusion made by the attendance of the worthy knight and his many sons one of whom waiting with better will than skill had nearly run down the shy limping scotsman who looked wildly for refuge at some table  in his height of distress a kindly gesture of invitation beckoned to him and he found himself seated and addressed first in french and then in careful foreign english by the same lady whom he had yesterday taken for joan of somerset namely esclairmonde de luxemburg  he was too much confused to look up till the piece of pasty and the wine with which the lady had caused him to be supplied were almost consumed and it was not till she had made some observations on the journey that he became at ease enough to hazard any sort of answer and then it was in his sweet low scottish voice with that irresistibly attractive look of shy wistful gratitude in his great soft brown eyes while his unenglish accent caused her to say i am a stranger here like yourself my lord and at the same moment he first raised his eyes to behold what seemed to him perfect beauty and dignity an oval face richlytinted olive complexion dark pensive eyes a sweet grave mouth smiling with encouraging kindness and a lofty brow that gave the whole face a magnificent air not so much stately as above and beyond this world  it might have befitted st barbara or st katherine the great intellectual virgin visions of purity and holiness of the middle ages but the kindness of the smile went to malcolms heart and emboldened him to answer in his best french you are from holland lady  not from the fens she answered  my home lies in the borders of the forest of ardennes  and then they found that they understood each other best when she spoke french and malcolm english or rather scotch and their acquaintance made so much progress that when the signal was again given to mount the lady esclairmonde permitted malcolm to assist her to her saddle and as he rode beside her he felt pleased with himself and as if ralf percy were welcome to look at him now  on esclairmondes other hand there rode a small slight girl whom malcolm took for quite a child and paid no attention to but presently old sir lewis robsart rode back with a message that my lady of westmoreland wished to know where the lady alice montagu was  a gentle timid voice answered o sir i am well here with lady esclairmonde  pray tell my good lady so  and therewith sir lewis smiled and said you could scarcely be in better hands fair damsel and rode back again while alice was still entreating may i stay with you dear lady  it is all so strange and new  esclairmonde smiled and said you make me at home here mademoiselle it is i who am the stranger  ah but you have been in courts before  i never lived anywhere but at middleham castle till they fetched me away to meet the queen  for the gentle little maiden a slender fairhaired childishfaced creature in her sixteenth year was the motherless child and heiress of the stout earl of salisbury the last of the montacutes or montagues who was at present fighting the kings battles in france but had sent his commands that she should be brought to court in preparation for fulfilling the longarranged contract between her and sir richard nevil one of the twentytwo children of the earl of westmoreland  she was under the charge of the countessa stately dame with all the beaufort pride and much afraid of her she was as everything that was shy or forlorn seemed to turn towards the maiden whose countenance not only promised kindness but protection  presently the cavalcade passed a gray building in the midst of green fields and orchards where under the trees some blackveiled figures sat spinning  a nunnery quoth esclairmonde looking eagerly after it as she rode past  a nunnery said malcolm encouraged into the simple confidingness of a young boy  how unlike the one where my sister is  not a tree is near it it is perched upon a wild crag overhanging the angry sea and the winds roar and the gulls and eagles scream and the waves thunder round it  yet it is not the less a haven of peace replied esclairmonde  verily said malcolm one knows what peace is under that cloister where all is calm while the winds rave without  you know how to love a cloister said the lady as she heard his soft sad tones  i had promised myself to make my home in one said malcolm but my king will have me make trial of the world first  and so please you he added recollecting himself he forbade me to make my purpose known so pray lady be so good as to forget what i have said  i will be silent said esclairmonde but i will not forget for i look on you as one like myself my young lord  i too am dedicated and only longing to reach my cloistered haven  she spoke it out with the ease of those days when the monastic was as recognized a profession as any other calling and yet with something of the desire to make it evident on what ground she stood  lady alice uttered an exclamation of surprise  yes said esclairmonde i was dedicated his my infancy and promised myself in the nunnery at dijon when i was seven years old  then as if to turn the conversation from herself she asked of malcolm if he too had made any vow  only to myself said malcolm  neither my tutor nor the prior of coldingham would hear my vows  and he was soon drawn into telling his whole story to which the ladies both listened with great interest and kindness esclairmonde commending his resolution to leave the care of his lands and vassals to one whom he represented as so much better fitted to bear them as patrick drummond and only regretting the silence king james had enjoined saying she felt that there was safety and protection in being avowed as a destined religious  and you are one said lady alice looking at her in wonder  and yet you are with that lady  and the girls innocent face expressed a certain wonder and disgust that no one could marvel at who had heard the flemish countess talk in the loudest broadest most hoydenish style  she has been my very good lady said esclairmonde she has under the saints saved me from much  oh i entreat you tell us dear lady entreated alice  it was not a reticent age  malcolm stewart had already avowed himself in his own estimation pledged to a monastic life and esclairmonde of luxemburg had reasons for wishing her position and intentions to be distinctly understood by all with whom she came in contact moreover there was a certain congeniality in both her companions their innocence and simplicity that drew out confidence and impelled her to defend her lady  my poor countess she said she has been sorely used and has suffered much  it is a piteous thing when our little imperial fiefs go to the spindle side  what are her lands asked malcolm  hainault holland and zealand replied the lady  her father was count of hainault her mother the sister of the last duke of burgundyhim that was slain on the bridge of montereau  she was married as a mere babe to the duke of touraine who was for a brief time dauphin but he died ere she was sixteen and her father died at the same time  some say they both were poisoned  the saints forfend it should be true but thus it was my poor countess was left desolate and her uncle the bishop of liegejean sans pitie as they call himclaimed her inheritance  you should have seen how undaunted she was  were you with her then asked alice montagu  yes  i had been taken from our convent at dijon when my dear brothers to whom heaven be merciful died at azincourt  my oncles a la mode de bretagnehow call you it in english  welsh uncles said alice  they are the count de st pol and the bishop of therouenne  they came to dijon  in another month i should have been seventeen and been admitted as a novice but alack there were all the lands that came through my grandmother in holland and in flanders all falling to me and monseigneur of therouenne like almost all secular clergy cannot endure the religious orders and would not hear of my becoming a sister they took me away and the bishop declared my dedication null and they would have bestowed me in marriage at once i believe if heaven had not aided me and they could not agree on the person  and then my dear countess promised me that she would never let me be given without my free will  then said alice the bishop did cancel your dedication  yes said esclairmonde but none can cancel the dedication of my heart  so said the holy man at zwoll  how lady anxiously inquired malcolm has not a bishop power to bind and unloose  yea said esclairmonde such power that if my childish promise had been made without purpose or conscience thereof or indeed if my will were not with it it would bind me no more there were no sin in wedlock for me no broken vow  but my own conscience of my vow and my sense that i belong to my heavenly spouse proved he said that it was not my duty to give myself to another and that whereas none have a parents right over me if i have indeed chosen the better part he to whom i have promised myself will not let it be taken from me though i might have to bear much for his sake  and when i said in presumption that such would lie light on me he bade me speak less and pray more for i knew not the cost  he must have been a very holy man said alice and strict withal  who was he  one father thomas a canon regular of the chapter of st agnes a very saint who spends his life in copying and illuminating the holy scripture and in writing holy thoughts that verily seem to have been breathed into him by special inspiration of god  it was a sermon of his in lent upon chastening and perplexity that i heard when first i was snatched from dijon that made me never rest till i had obtained his ghostly counsel  if i never meet him again i shall thank heaven for those months at zwoll all my lifeere the duke of burgundy made my countess resign holland for twelve years to her uncle and we left the place  then wellnigh against her will they forced her into a marriage with the duke of brabant though he be her first cousin her godson and a mere rude boy  i cannot tell you how evil were the days we often had then  if he had been left to himself madame might have guided him but ill men came about him they maddened him with wine and beer they excited him to show that he feared her not he struck her and more than once almost put her in danger of her life  then too his mother married the bishop of liege her enemy  the bishop  he had never been consecrated and had a dispensation  that marriage deprived my poor lady of even her mothers help  all were against her then and for me too it went ill for the duke of burgundy insisted on my being given to a halfbrother of his one they call sir boemond of burgundya hard man of blood and revelry  the duke of brabant was all for him and so was the duchessmother and though my uncles would not have chosen him yet they durst not withstand the duke of burgundy  i tried to appeal to the emperor sigismund the head of our house but i know not if he ever heard of my petition  i was in an exceeding strait and had only one trust namely that father thomas had told me that the more i threw myself upon god the more he would save me from man  but oh they seemed all closing in on me and i knew that sir boemond had sworn that i should pay heavily for my resistance  then one night my countess came to me  she showed me the bruises her lord had left on her arms and told me that he was about to banish all of us her ladies into holland and to keep her alone to bear his fury and she was resolved to escape and would i come with her  it seemed to me the message of deliverance  her nurse brought us peasant dresses high stiff caps black boddices petticoats of many colours and therein we dressed ourselves and stole out ere dawn to a church where we knelt till the sieur descaillonthe gentleman who attends madame stilldrove up in a farmers garb with a market cart and so forth from bruges we drove  we cause to valenciennes to her mother but we found that she by persuasion of the duke would give us both up so the sieur descaillon got together sixty lances and therewith we rode to calais where never were weary travellers more courteously received than we by lord northumberland the captain of calais  oh i am glad you came to us english cried alice  only i would it had been my father who welcomed you  and now  now i remain with my lady as the only demoiselle she has from her country and moreover i am waiting in the trust that my kinsmen will give up their purpose of bestowing me in marriage now that i am beyond their reach and in time i hope to obtain sufficient of my own goods for a dowry for whatever convent i may enter  oh let it be an english one cried alice  i have learnt to breathe freer since i have been on english soil said esclairmonde smiling but where i may rest at last heaven only knows  this is a strange country said malcolm  no one seems afraid of violence and wrong here  is that so strange asked alice amazed  why men would be hanged if they did violence  i would we were as sure of justice at my home sighed esclairmonde king henry will bring about a better rule  never doubt cried salisburys daughter  when france is once subdued there will be no more trouble he will make your kinsmen do you right dear demoiselle and oh will you not found a beauteous convent  king henry has not conquered france yet was all esclairmonde said  ha cried the buxom countess jaqueline as the ladies dismounted never speak to me more our solemn sister  when have i done worse than lure a young cavalier and chain him all day with my tongue  he is a gentle boy said esclairmonde smiling  truly he looked like a calf turned loose among strange cattle  how gat he into the hall  he is of royal scottish blood said esclairmonde cousingerman to king james  and our grave nun has a fancy to tame the wild scots like a second st margaret  a kings grandson fie fie what become ambitious clairette  eh you were so occupied that i should have been left to no one but monseigneur of gloucester but that i was discreet and rode with my lord bishop of winchester  how he chafed but i know better than to have teteatetes with young sprigs of the blood royal  esclairmonde laughed goodhumouredly partly in courtesy to her hoyden mistress but partly at the burning blushing indignation she beheld in the artless face of alice montagu  the girl was as shy as a fawn frightened at every word from knight or lady and much in awe of her future motherinlaw a stiff and stately dame with all the beaufort haughtiness so that lady westmoreland gladly and graciously consented to the offer of the demoiselle de luxemburg to attend to the little maiden and let her share her chamber and her bed and indeed alice montagu bred up in strictness and in both piety and learning as was sometimes the case with the daughters of the nobility had in all her simplicity and bashfulness a purity and depth that made her a congenial spirit with the grave votaress whom she regarded on her side with a young girls enthusiastic admiration for a grown woman although in point of fact the years between them were few  the other ladies of the court were a little in awe of the demoiselle de luxemburg and did not seek her when they wished to indulge in the gossip whose malice and coarseness she kept in check but if they were anxious or in trouble they always came to her as their natural consoler and the countess jaqueline bold and hoydenish as she was kept the license of her tongue and manners under some shadow of restraint before her and though sometimes bantering her often neglecting her counsel evidently felt her attendance a sort of safeguard and protection  the gentlemen were mostly of the opinion of the duke of gloucester who said that the lady esclairmonde was so like deborah come out of a mystery that it seemed to be always passiontide where she was and she moreover was always guarded in her manner towards them keeping her vocation in the recollection of all by her gravely and coldly courteous demeanour and the sober hues and fashion of her dress but being aware of malcolms destination perceiving his loneliness and really attracted by his pensive gentleness she admitted him to far more friendly intercourse than any other young noble while he revered and clung to her much as lady alice did as protector and friend  king james was indeed so much absorbed in his own ladylove as to have little attention to bestow on his young cousin and he knew moreover that to be left to such womanly training as ladies were bound to bestow on young squires and pages was the best treatment for the youth who was really thriving and growing happier every day as he lost his awkwardness and acquired a freedom and selfconfidence such as he could never have imagined possible in his original browbeaten state though without losing the gentle modesty and refinement that gave him such a charm  a great sorrow awaited him however at leicester where easter was to be spent  a messenger came from durham bringing letters from coldingham to announce the death of good sir david drummond which had taken place two days after malcolm had left him all but the youth himself having well known that his state was hopeless  in his grief malcolm found his chief comforter in esclairmonde who kindly listened when he talked of the happy old times at glenuskie and of the kindness and piety of his guardian while she lifted his mind to dwell on the company of the saints and when he knew that her thoughts went like his to his fatherly friend in the solemn services connected with the departed he was no longer desolate and there was almost a sweetness in the grief of which his fair saint had taken up a part  she showed him likewise some vellum pages on which her ghostly father the canon of st agnes had written certain dialogues between the divine master and his disciple which seemed indeed to have been whispered by heavenly inspiration and which soothed and hallowed his mourning for the guide and protector of his youth  he loved to dwell on her very name esclairmondelight of the world  the taste of the day hung many a pun and conceit upon names and to malcolm thiswhich had in fact been culled out of romanceseemed meetly to express the pure radiance of consolation and encouragement that seemed to him to shine from her and brighten the life that had hitherto been dull and gloomynay even to give him light and joy in the midst of his grief  at that period courts were not much burdened with etiquette  no feudal monarch was more than the first gentleman and there was no rigid line of separation of ranks especially where as among the kings of the red rose the boundaries were so faint between the princes and the nobility and as catherine of valois was fond of company and indolently heedless of all that did not affect her own dignity or ease the whole court including some of the princely captives lived as one large family meeting at morning mass in church or chapel taking their meals in common riding hunting hawking playing at bowls tennis or stoolball or any other pastime in such parties as suited their inclinations and spending the evening in the great hall in conversation varied by chess dice and cards recitals of romance and music sometimes performed by the choristers of the royal chapel or sometimes by the company themselves and often by one or other of the two kings who were both proficients as well with the voice as with the lute and organ  thus malcolm had many opportunities of being with the demoiselle of luxemburg and almost a right was established that when she sat in the deep embrasure of a window with her spinning he should be on the cushioned step beneath when she mounted he held the stirrup and when the church bells were ringing he led her by her fair fingers to her place in the nave and back again to the hall and when the manchet and rere supper were brought into the hall he mixed her wine and water and held the silver basin and napkin to her on bended knee and had become her recognized cavalier  he was really thriving  even the highspirited son of hotspur could not help loving and protecting him  have a care said ralf to a lad of ruder mould ill no more see that lame young scot maltreated than a girl  he is no better than a girl growled his comrade my little brother dick would be more than a match for him  i wot not that said percy theres a drop of life and spirit at the bottom and for the rest when he looks up with those eyes of his and smiles his smile it is somehow as if it were beneath a man to vex him wilfully  and he sees so much meaning in everything too that it is a dozen times better sport to hear him talk than one of you fellows who have only wit enough to know a hawk from a heronschaw  after a grave eastertide spent at leicester the court moved to westminster where henry had to meet his parliament and obtain supplies for the campaign which was to revenge the death of clarence  there was no great increase of gaiety even here for henry was extremely occupied both with regulating matters for government during his absence and in training the troops who began to flock to his standard so that the queen complained that his presence in england was of little service to her since he never had any leisure and there were no pastimes  well dame said henry gaily there is one revel for you  i have promised to knight the lord mayor honest whittington and i hear he is preparing a notable banquet in the guild hall  a city mayor exclaimed queen catherine with ineffable disgust  my brothers would sooner cut off his roturier head than dub him knight  belike said henry dryly but what kind of friends have thy brothers found at paris  moreover this whittington may content thee as to blood rougedragon hath been unfolding to me his lineage of a good house in gloucestershire  more shame that he should soil his hands with trade said the queen  see what you say when he has cased those fair hands in spanish gloves you ladies should know better than to fall out with a mercer  ah said duke humfrey they never saw the silks and samites wherewith he fitted out my sister philippa for the swedes  lucky the bride whose wardrobe is purveyed by honest dick  is it not honour enough for the mechanical hinds that we wear their stuffs said countess jaqueline without demeaning ourselves to eat at their boards  the outrecuidance of the rogues in the netherlands would be surpassing did we feed it in that sort  tis you that will be fed dame jac laughed henry  i can tell you their sack and their pasties their marchpane and blancmanger far exceed aught that a poor soldier can set before you  moreover observed humfrey the ladies ought to see the romaunt of the cat complete  how cried jaqueline is it then true that this vittentone is the millers son whose cat wore boots and made his fortune  i have heard my aunt of orleans divert my father with that story murmured catherine  how went the tale  i thought it folly and marked it not  what became of the cat  the cat desired to test his masters gratitude so tells straparola said the duke of orleans in his dry satirical tone and whereas he had been wont to promise his benefactor a golden coffin and state funeral puss feigned death and thereby heard the lady inform her husband that the old cat was dead  a la bonne heure said the marquis  take him by the tail and fling him on the muckheap beneath the window  thereof i acquit whittington who never was thankless to man or brute said king henry  moreover his cat or her grandchildren must be now in high preferment at the king of barbarys court  a marvellous beast is that cat said james  when i was a child in scotland we used to tell the story of her exchange for a freight of gold and spices only the ship sailed from denmark  maybe said henry but i would maintain the truth of whittingtons cat with my lance and would gladly have no worse cause  youll see his cat painted beside him in the guild hall and may hear the tale from him as i loved to hear him when i was a lad     turn again whittington    thrice lord mayor of london town  i told my good old friend i must have come over from france on purpose to keep his third mayoralty  so i am for the city on thursday and whoever loves good wine good sturgeon good gold or good men had best come with me  such inducements were not to be neglected and though queen catherine minced and bridled and apologized to duchess jaqueline for her husbands taste for low company neither princess wished to forego the chance of amusement and a brilliant cavalcade set forth in full order of precedence  the king and queen were first then to his great disgust the king of scots with duchess jaqueline bedford with lady somerset gloucester with the countess of march the duke of orleans with the countess of exeter and malcolm of glenuskie found himself paired off with his sovereigns ladylove joan beaufort and a good deal overawed by the tall horned tower that crowned her flaxen locks as well as by knowing that her uncle the bishop of winchester the stateliest stiffest and most unapproachable person in all the court was riding just behind him beside the demoiselle de luxemburg  temple bar was closed and there was a flourish of trumpets and a parley ere the gate was flung open to admit the royal guests but malcolm in his place could not see the aldermen on horseback in their robes of scarlet and white drawn up to receive the king  all that way up holborn every house was hung with tapestry and the citizens formed a gorgeouslyapparelled lane shouting in unison their greetings attuned to bursts of music from trumpets and nakers  beautiful old st pauls with the exquisite cross for openair preaching in front rose on their view and before the lofty west door the princely guests dismounted each gentleman leading his lady up the nave to the seat prepared in such manner that he might be opposite to her  the clergy lined the stalls and a magnificent mass was sung and was concluded by the advance of the king to the altar step followed by a fine old man in scarlet robes bordered with white fur the collar of ss round his neck and his silvery hair and lofty brow crowning a face as sagacious as it was dignified and benevolent  it seemed a reversal of the ordinary ceremonial when the slender agile young man took in hand the sword and laid the honour of knighthood on the grayheaded substantial senior whom he bade to arise sir richard whittington  jaqueline of hainault had the bad taste to glance across to humfrey and titter but the duke valued popularity among the citizens and would not catch her eye and in the line behind the royal ladies there was a sweet elderly face beautiful though timeworn with blue eyes misty with proud glad tears and a mouth trembling with tender exultation  after the ceremony was concluded king henry offered his hand to the lady mayoress dame alice whittington making her bright tears drop in glad confusion at his frank hearty congratulation and warm praise of her husband and though the fair catherine could have shuddered when sir richard advanced to lead her she was too royal to compromise her dignity by visible scorn and she soon found that the merchant could speak much better french than most of the nobles  malcolm felt as averse as did the french princesses to burgher wealth and splendour and his mind had not opened to understand burgher worth and weight and when he saw the princes john and humfrey and even his own king seeking out city dames and accosting them with friendly looks it seemed to him a degrading truckling to riches from which he was anxious to save his future queen but when he would have offered his arm to lady joan he saw her already being led away by an alderman measuring at least a yard across the shoulders and the goodnatured earl of march seeing him at a loss presented him to a round merry wife in a scarlet petticoat and black boddice its plump curves wreathed with geld chains who began pitying him for having been sent to the wars so young being as usual charmed into pity by his soft appealing eyes and unconscious grace would not believe his assertions that he was neither a captive nor a frenchmandont tell her when he spoke like a stranger and halted from a wound  colouring to the ears he explained that he had never walked otherwise whereupon her pity redoubled and she by turns advised him to consult master doctor caius and to obtain a recipe from mistressshe meant damealice whittington the kindest soul living and lady mayoress as she was with no more pride than the meanest scullion  pity she had no childyet scarce pity either since she and the good lord mayor were father and mother to all orphans and destitutenay to all who had any care on their minds  malcolm was in extreme alarm lest he should be walked up to the lady mayoress for inspection before all the world when they entered the guild hall a building of grand proportions which as good mistress bolt informed him had lately been paved and glazed at sir richard whittingtons own expense  the bright new red and yellow tiles and the stained glass of the tall windows high up as well as the panels of the wainscot were embellished with trademarks and the armorial bearings of the guilds and the long tables hung with snowy napery groaned with gold and silver plate such as the duke of orleans observed to catherine no citizens would dare exhibit in france to any prince or noble at peril of being mulcted of all with or without excuse  on an open hearth beneath the louvre or opening for smoke burnt a fire diffusing all around an incenselike fragrance from the logs composed of cinnamon and other choice woods and spices that fed the flame  the odour and the warmth on a bleak day of may were alike delicious and king henry after heading dame alice up to it stood warming his hands and extolling the choice scent adding you spoil us sir richard  how are we to go back to the smoke of wood and peat and fires puffed with our own mouths after such pampering as thisthe costliest fire i have seen in the two realms  it shall be choicer yet sir said sir richard whittington who had just handed the queen to her seat  scarce possible replied henry unless i threw in my crown and that i cannot afford  i shall be pawning it ere long  instead of answering the lord mayor quietly put his hand into his furred pouch and drawing out a bundle of parchments tied with a ribbon held them towards the king with a grave smile  lo you now sir richard said henry with a playful face of disgust this is to save your dainty meats by spoiling my appetite by that unwelcome sight  what man have you bought up all the bonds i gave in my need to a whole synagogue of jews and bench of loinbards  i shall have to send for my crown before you let me go though verily he added with frank open face im better off with a good friend like you for my creditoronly im sorry for you sir richard  i fear it will be long ere you see your good gold in the stead of your dirty paper even though i gave you an order on the tolls  how now  what man dick whittington art raving  here the tongs  for sir richard gently smiling had placed the bundle of bonds on the glowing bed of embers  henry even while calling for the tongs was raking them out with his sword and would have grasped them in his hand in a moment but the lord mayor caught his arm  pardon my lord and grant your new knights boon  when he is not moonstruck said henry still guarding the documents why my lady mayoress know you what is here  sixty thousand my liege composedly answered dame alice  my husband hath his whims and i pray your grace not to hinder what he hath so long been preparing  yea sir added whittington earnestly  you wot that god hath prospered us richly  we have no child and our nephews are well endowed how then can our goods belong to any save god our king and the poor  henry drew one hand over his eyes and with the other wrung that of whittington  had ever king such a subject he murmured  had ever subject such a king was whittingtons return  thou hast conquered whittington said the king presently looking up with a sunny smile  to send me over the seas a free man beholden to you in heart though not by purse is as i well believe worth all that sum to thy loyal heart  thou art setting me far on my way to jerusalem my dear friend  thank him katehe hath done much for thine husband  catherine looked amiable and held out a white hand to be kissed aware that the king was pleased though hardly understanding why he should be glad that an odour of singed parchment should overpower the gums and cinnamon  this was soon remedied by the fresh handful of spices that were cast into the flame and the banquet began magnificent with peacocks cranes and swans in full plumage the tusky bear crunched his apple deers antlers adorned the haunch the royal sturgeon floated in wine fountains of perfumed waters sprang up from shells towers of pastry and of jelly presented the endless allegorical devices of mediaeval fancy and preeminent over all a figure of the cat with emerald eyes fulfilled as henry said the proverb a cat might look at a king and truly the cat and her master had earned the right therefore his first toast was to the cat  each guest found at his or her place a beautiful fragrant pair of gloves in spanish leather on the back of which was once more embroidered in all her tabby charms the cats face  therewith began a lengthy meal and malcolm stewart rejoiced at finding himself seated next to the lady esclairmonde but he grudged her attention to her companion a slender dark thoughtful representative of the goldsmiths company to whom she talked with courtesy such as malcolm had scorned to show his city dame  who said esclairmonde presently was a dame in a religious garb whom i marked near the door here  she hooked like one of the beguines of my own country  we have no such order here lady said the goldsmiths puzzled  hey master price cried mistress bolt speaking across malcolm i can tell the lady who it was  twas good sister avice rodney to whom the lady mayoress promised some of these curious cooling drinks for the poor shipwright who hath wellnigh cloven off his own foot with his axe  yea truly returned the goldsmith it must have been one of the bedeswomen of st katharines whom the lady has seen  what order may that be asked esclairmonde  i have seen nothing so like my own country since i came hither  that may well be madam said mistress belt seeing that these bedeswomen were first instituted by a countrywoman of your ownqueen philippa of blessed memory  by your leave mistress bolt interposed master price the hospital of st katharine by the tower is of far older foundation  by your leave sir i know what i say  the hospital was founded i know not when but these bedeswomen were especially added by the good queen by the same token that mine aunt cis who was tirewoman to the blessed lady joan was one of the first  how was it  what is their office eagerly inquired esclairmonde  and mistress bolt arranged herself for a long discourse  well fair sirs and sweet lady though you be younger than i you have surely heard of the black death  well named was it for never was pestilence more dire and the venom was so strong that the very lips and eyelids grew livid black and then there was no hope  little thought of such disease was there i trow in kings houses and all the fair young lords and ladies the children of king edward as then was were full of sport and gamesomeness as you see these dukes be now  and never a one was blither than the lady joanshe they called joan of the tower being a true londoner bornbless her  my aunt cis would talk by the hour of her pretty ways and kindly mirth  but twas even as the children have the game in the streets     there come three knights all out of spain    are come to fetch your daughter jane  twas for the king of castille that same peter for whom the black prince of wales fought and of whom such grewsome tales were told  the pretty princess might almost have had a boding what sort of husband they had for her for she begged and prayed even on her knees that her father would leave her but her sisters were all espoused and there was no help for it  but as one comfort to her my aunt cis who had been about her from her cradle was to go with her and oft she would tell of the long journey in litters through france and how welcome were the english tongues they heard again at bordeaux and how when poor lady joan saw her brother the prince she clung about his neck and sobbed and how he soothed her and said she would soon laugh at her own unwillingness to go to her husband  but even then the black death was in bordeaux and being low and mournful at heart the sweet maid contracted it and lay down to die ere she had made two days journey and her last words were my god hath shown me more pity than father or brother and so she died like a lamb and mine aunt was sent by the prince to bear home the tidings to the good queen who was a woeful woman  and therewith here was the pestilence in london raging among the poor creatures that lived in the wharves and on the river bank in damp and filth so that whole households lay dead at once and the contagion gathering force spread into the city and even to the nobles and their ladies  then my good aunt having some knowledge of the sickness already and being without fear went among the sick and by her care and the food wine and clothing she brought saved a many lives  and from whom should the bounties come save from the good queen who ever had a great pity for those touched like her own fair child  moreover when she heard from my aunt how the poor things lived in uncleanness and filth and how what with many being strangers coming by sea and others being serfs fled from home they were a nameless masterless sort who knew not where to seek a parish priest and whom the friars shunned for their poverty she devised a fresh foundation to be added to the hospital of st katharines in the docks providing for a chapter of ten bedeswomen gentle and wellnurtured who should both sing in choir and likewise go forth constantly among the poor to seek out the children see that they learn their credo ave and pater noster bring the more toward to be further taught in st katharines school and likewise to stir poor folk up to go to mass and lead a godly life to visit the sick feed and tend them and so instruct them that they may desire the sacraments of the church  ah good flemish queen cried esclairmonde  she learnt that of our beguines  if your ladyship will have it so said mrs bolt but my aunt cicely began  who nominates these bedeswomen asked esclairmonde  that does the queen said mistress bolt  not this young queen as yet for queen joan the late kings widow holds the hospital till her death unless it should be taken from her for her sorceries from which heaven defend us  can it be visited said esclairmonde  i feel much drawn thither as i ever did to the beguines  ay marry may it cried delighted mrs bolt  i have more than one gossip there foreby sister avice who was godchild to aunt cis and if the good lady would wish to see the hospital i would bear her company with all my heart  to malcolms disgust esclairmonde caught at the proposal which the scottish haughtiness that lay under all his gentleness held somewhat degrading to the cousin of the emperor  he fell into a state of gloom which lasted till the lovingcup had gone round and been partaken of in pairs  after hands had been washed in rosewater the royal party took their seats in barges to return to westminster by the broad and beautiful highway of the thames  here at once alice montagu nestled to esclairmondes side delighted with her cat gloves and further delighted with an old captain of trained bands to whose lot she had fallen and who on finding that she was the daughter of the earl of salisbury under whom he had served had launched forth by the hour into the praises of that brave nobleman both for his courage and his kindness to his troops  no wonder king henry loves his citizens so well cried esclairmonde would that our netherlandish princes and burghers could take pride and pleasure in one anothers wealth and prowess instead of grudging and fearing thereat  to my mind said malcolm they were a forward generation  that city dame will burst with pride if you lady go with her to see those bedeswomen  i trust not laughed esclairmonde for i mean to try  nay but said malcolm what should a mere matter of old rockers and wornout tirewomen concern a demoiselle of birth  i honour them for doing their masters work said esclairmonde and would fain be worthy to follow in their steps  surely said malcolm there are houses fit for persons of high and princely birth to live apart from gross contact with the world  there are said esclairmonde but i trust i may be pardoned for saying that such often seem to me to play at humility when they stickle for birth and dower with the haughtiest  i never honoured any nuns so much as the humble sisters of st begga who never ask for sixteen quarterings but only for a tender hand soft step pure life and pious heart  i deemed said malcolm that heavenly contemplation was the purpose of convents  even so for such as can contemplate like the holy man i have told you of said esclairmonde but labour hath been greatly laid aside in convents of late and i doubt me if it be well or if their prayers be the better for it  and so said alice i heard my lord of winchester saying how it were well to suppress the alien priories and give their wealth to found colleges like that founded by bishop wykeham  for in truths the spirit of the age was beginning to set against monasticism  it was the period when perhaps there was more of license and less of saintliness than at any other and when the long continuance of the great schism had so injured church discipline that the clergy and ecclesiastics were in the worst state of all especially the monastic orders who owned no superior but the pope and between the two rivals could avoid supervision altogether  such men as thomas a kempis or the great jean gerson were rare indeed and the monasteries had let themselves lose their missionary character and become mere large farms inhabited by celibate gentlemen and their attendants or by the superfluous daughters of the nobles and gentry  such devotion as led esclairmonde to the pure atmosphere of prayer and selfsacrifice had well nigh died out and almost every other lady of the time would have regarded her release from the vows made for her its her babyhood a happy escape  still less at a time when no active order of sisters save that of the beguines in holland had been invented and when no nun ever dreamt of carrying her charity beyond the quadrangle of her own convent could any one be expected to enter into esclairmondes admiration and longing for outofdoor works but the person whom she had chiefly made her friend was the kings almoner and chaplain sometimes called sir martin bennet at others dr bennet a great oxford scholar bred up among william of wykehams original seventy at winchester and new college and now much trusted and favoured by the king whom he everywhere accompanied  that sir martin was a pluralist must be confessed but he was most conscientious in providing substitutes and was a man of much thought and of great piety in whom the fair pupil of the canon of st agnes found a congenial spirit     chapter vi malcolms suit   that is a gentle and gracious slip of the stewart  what shall you do with him asked king henry of james as they stood together at one end of the tiltyard at westminster watching malcolm stewart and ralf percy who were playing at closhey the early form of ninepins  i know what i should like to do said james  what may that be  to marry him to the lady esclairmonde de luxemburg  henry gave a long whistle  have you other views for her  not i  am i to have designs on every poor dove who flies into my tent from the hawk  besides are not they both of them vowed to a religious life  neither vow is valid replied james  to meddle with such things is what i should not dare said henry  monks and friars are no such holy beings that i should greatly concern me about keeping an innocent had out of their company said james  nor do i say they are said henry but it is ill to cross a vow of devotion and to bring a man back to the world is apt to render him not worth the having  you may perchance get him down lower than you intended  this boy never had any real vocation at all said james it was only the timidity born of illhealth and the longing for food for the mind  maybe so replied the english king and you may be in the right but why fix on that grand luxemburg wench who ought to be a lady abbess of fontainebleau at least or a very st hilda to rule monks and nuns alike  because they have fixed on each other  malcolm needs a woman like her to make a man of him and with her spirit and fervent charity we should have them working a mighty change in scotland  if you get her there  have i your consent harry  mine  its no affair of mine  you must settle it with madame of hainault but you had best take care  you are more like to make your tame lambkin into a ravening wolf than to get that deborah the prophetess to herd him  james in sooth viewed this warning as another touch of lancastrian superstition and only considered how to broach the question  malcolm meantime was balancing between the now approaching decision between oxford and france  he certainly felt something of his old horror of warlike scenes but even this was lessening he was aware that battles were not everyday occurrences and that often there was no danger at all  he would not willingly be separated from his king and if the female part of the court were to accompany the campaign it would be losing sight of all he cared for if he were left among a set of stranger shavelings at oxford  yet he was reluctant to break with the old habits that had hitherto been part of his nature he felt after every word of esclairmondenay after every glance towards heras though it were a blessed thing to have like her chosen the better part he knew she would approve his resort to the home of piety and learning he was aware that when with ralf percy and the other youths of the court he was ashamed of his own scrupulousness and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and unmanly and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic might not seize him and disgrace him for ever  in effect he did not know what he wished even when he found that the queen had decided against going across the sea and that therefore all the ladies would remain with her at shene or windsor  he should probably never again see esclairmonde the guiding star of his recent life the embodiment of all that he had imagined when conning the quaint old english poems that told the legend of seynct katharine and as he leant musingly against a lattice feeling as if the brightness of his life was going out king james merrily addressed him  eh the fit is on you too boy  what fit sir  malcolm opened his eyes  the pleasing madness  malcolm uttered a cry like horror and reddened crimson  sir  sir sir he stammered  a wellknown token of the disease is raving  sir sir  i implore you to speak of nothing so profane  i am not given to profanity said james endeavouring to look severe but with laughter in his voice  methought you were not yet so sacred a personage  myself  no but that ii should dare to have such thoughts ofoh sir and malcolm covered his face with his hands  oh that you should have so mistaken me  i have not mistaken you said james fixing his keen eyes on him  oh sir cried malcolm like one freshly stung you have  never never dreamt i of aught but worshipping as a living saint as i would entreat st margaret or  there was still the kings steady look and the suppressed smile  malcolm broke off and with a sudden agony wrung his hands together  the king still smiled  ay malcolm it will not do you are man not monk  but why be so cruel as to make me vile in my own eyes almost sobbed malcolm  because said the king she is not a saint in heaven nor a nun in a convent but a free woman to be won by the youth she has marked out  marked  oh sir she only condescended because she knew my destination  that is well said king james  thus sparks kindle at unawares  malcolms groan and murmur of never made james almost laugh at the evidence that on one side at least the touchwood was ready  oh sir he sighed why put the thought before me to make me wretched  even were she for the world she would never be for me idoitedhirpling  peace silly lad all that is past and gone  you are quite another now and a year or two of harrys school of chivalry will send you home a gallant knight and minstrel such as no maiden will despise  the king went and malcolm fell into a silent state of musing  he was entirely overpowered both by the consciousness awakened within himself by the doubt whether it were not a great sin and by the strangeness that the king hitherto his oracle should infuse such a hope  what king james deemed possible could never be so incredible or even sacrilegious as he deemed it  restless ashamed rent by a thousand conflicting feelings malcolm roamed up and down his chamber writhed tried to sit and think then finding his thoughts in a whirl renewed his frantic pacings  and when dire necessity brought him again into the ladies chamber he was silent blushing ungainly abstracted and retreated into the farthest possible corner from the unconscious esclairmonde  then when again alone with the king he began with the assertion it is utterly impossible sir and james smiled to see his poison working  not that he viewed it as poison  monasticism was at a discount and the ranks of the religious orders were chiefly filled the old benedictine and augustinian foundations by gentlemen of good family who wanted the easy life of a sort of bachelor squire and the friaries were recruited by the sort of men who would in modern times be dissenting teachers of the lower stamp  james was persuaded that malcolm was fit for better things than were usually to be seen in a convent and that it was a real kindness not to let him merely retire thither out of faintness of heart mistaken for devotion and he also felt as if he should be doing good service not only to malcolm but to scotland if he could obtain for him a wife of the grand character of esclairmonde de luxemburg  he even risked the mention of the project to the countess of hainault without whose consent nothing could be effected  jaqueline laughed long and loud at the notion of her stately esclairmonde being the ladylove of king jamess little whitevisaged cousin but if he could bring it about she had no objection she should be very glad that the demoiselle should come down from the height and be like other people but she would wager the king of scots her emerald carcanet against his herons plume that esclairmonde would never marry unless her hands were held for her  was she not at that very moment visiting some foundation of bedeswomenthat was all she heard of at yonder feast of cats  in fact under dr bennets escort esclairmonde and alice were in a barge dropping down the thames to the neighbourhood of the frowning fortress of the toweras yet unstained and at the steps leading to the hospitium of st katharine the ladies were met not only by their friend mrs bolt but by sir richard whittington his kindly dame and by master william kedbesby a grave and gentlelooking old man who had been master of st katharines ever since the first year of king richard ii and delighted to tell of the visits good queen anne of bohemia had made to her hospital and the kind words she had said to the old alms folk and the children of the schools and when he heard that the lady esclairmonde was of the same princely house of luxemburg he seemed to think no honour sufficient for her  they visited the two houses one for old men the other for old women each with a common apartment with a fire and a diningtable in the midst and sleeping cells screened off round it and with a paved terrace walk overhanging the river where the old people could sit and sun themselves and be amused by the gay barges and the swans that expatiated there  the bedeswomen ten in number had a house arranged like an ordinary nunnery except that they were not in seclusion had no grating and shared the quadrangle with the almsfolk and children  they were gentle and wellnurtured women chiefly belonging to the city and country families that furnished servants to the queens and they applied themselves to various offices of charity going forth into the city to tend the poor and to teach the women and children  the appointments of almsfolk and admissions to the school were chiefly made at their recommendation and though a master taught all the booklearning in the busy hive of scholarseighty in numberone or more of them instructed the little girls in spinning and in stitchery to say nothing of gentle and modest demeanour  there was a great look of happiness and good order about all and the church fair and graceful seemed well to complete and rule the institution  esclairmonde could but sigh with a sort of regret as she left it and let herself be conducted by sir richard whittington to a refection at his beautiful house in crutched friars built round a square combining warehouse and manorhouse richlycarved shields with the arms of the companies of london supporting the tier of firstfloor windows and another row of brackets above supporting another overhanging story  a fountain was in the centre of a beautiful greensward with beds of roses pansies pinks stars of bethlehem and other good old flowers among which a monkey was chained to a tree while a cat roamed about at a safe distance from him  alice montagu raised a laugh by asking if it were the cat to which her city namesake replied that her master never could abide to be without a cat in memory of his first friend and marshalled them into the beautiful hall with wainscot lining below surmounted by an arcade containing statues and above a beautiful carved ceiling  here a meal was served to them and the lady talked with whittington of the grand townhalls and other buildings of the merchants of the low countries with whom he was a trader for their rich stuffs and the visit passed off with no small satisfaction to both parties  esclairmonde sat in the barge on her return looking out on the gray clear water and on the bright gardens that sloped down to it gay with roses and fruitful with mulberries apples and strawberries and the mansions and churches that were never quite out of sight though there were some open fields and wild country ere coming to westminster all as if she did not see them but was wrapped in deep contemplation  alice at last weary of silence stole her arm round her waist and peeped up into her face  may i guess thy thoughts sweet clairette thou wilt found such a hospice thyself  say not i will child said esclairmonde with a crystal drop starting in each dark eye  i would strive and hope but  ah thou wilt thou wilt cried alice and since there are beguines enough for their own netherlands thou wilt come to england and be our foundress here  nay little one here are the bedeswomen of st katharines in london  ah but we have other cities  good father have we not hullsouthamptonoh so many where poor strangers come that need ghostly tendance as well as bodily  esclairmondelight of the worldoh it was not for nothing that they gave thee that goodly name  the hospice shall bear it  hush hush sweet pyet mine own name is what they must not bear  ah but the people will give it and our holy father the pope he will put thee into the canon of saints  only pity that i cannot live to hear of ste esclairmondenay but then i must overlive thee mind i should not love that  oh silence silence child these are no thoughts to begin a work with little flatterer it may be well for me that our lives must needs lie so far apart that i shall not oft hear that fond silly tongue  nay said alice in the luxury not of castlebuilding but of convent building it may be that when that knight over there sees me so small and illfavoured he will none of me and then ill thank him so and pray my father to let him have all my lands and houses except just enough to dower me to follow thee with dear lady prioress  but here alice was summarily silenced  such talk both priest and votaress told her was not meet for dutiful daughter or betrothed maiden her lot was fixed and she must do her duty therein as the good wife and lady of the castle the noble english matron and as she looked half disposed to pout esclairmonde drew such a picture of the beneficent influence of the good baronial dame ruling her castle bringing up her children and the daughters of her vassals in good and pious nurture making the heart of her husband safely trust in her benefiting the poor and fostering holy men wayfarers and pilgrims that the girls eyes filled within tears as she looked up and said ah lady this is the life fitted for thee who can paint it so well  why have i not a brother that you might be countess of salisbury and i a poor little sister in a nunnery  esclairmonde shook her head  silly child petite niaise our lots were fixed by other hands than ours  we will strive each to serve our god in the coif or in the veil in samite or in serge and he will only ask which of us has been most faithful not whether we have lived in castle or in cloister  little had esclairmonde expected to hear the greeting with which the countess received her breaking out into peals of merriment as she told her of the choice destiny in store for her to be wedded to the little lame scot pretending to read her a grave lecture on the consequences of the advances she had made to him  esclairmonde was not put out of countenance in fact she did not think the countess in earnest and merely replied with a smile that at least there was less harm in lord malcolm than in the suitors at home  jaqueline clapped her hands and cried good tidings clairette  ill never forgive you if you make me lose my emerald carcanet  so the arrow was winged after all  she prefers himher heart is touched by the dainty step  madame entreated esclairmonde with agitation at least infirmity should be spared  it touches her deeply exclaimed the duchess  ah to see her in the mountains teaching the wild men to say their aye and to wear culottes the little prince interpreting for her as king james told us in his story of the saint his ancestor  raillery about malcolm had been attempted before but never so pertinaciously and esclairmonde heeded it not at all till james himself sought her out and within all his own persuasive grace told her that he was rejoiced to hear from madame of hainault that she had spoken kindly of his youthful kinsman for whose improvement he was sure he had in great measure to thank her  esclairmonde replied composedly but as one on her guard that the sieur de glenuskie was a gentle and a holy youth of a good and toward wit  as i saw from the first said james when i brought him away from being crushed among our rude cousins but lady i knew not how the task of training the boy would be taken out of my hands by your kindness and now pardon me lady only one thing is wanting to complete your work and that is hope  hope is always before a holy man sir  o madame but we peer earthly beings require an earthly hope nearer home to brace our hearts and nerve our arms  i thought the sieur de glenuskie was destined to a religious life  never by any save his enemies lady  the regent albany and his fierce sons have striven to scare malcolm into a cloister that his sister and his lands may be their prey and they would have succeeded had not i come to scotland in time  the lad never had any true vocation  that may be said esclairmonde somewhat sorrowfully  still added james he is of a thoughtful and somewhat tender mould and the rudeness of life will try him sorely unless he have some cheering star some light of love to bear him up and guide him on his way  if so may he find a worthy one  lady it is too late to talk of what he may find  the brightness that has done so much for him already will hinder him from turning his eyes elsewhere  you are a minstrel sir king and therefore these words of light romance fall from your lips  nay lady hitherto my romance has been earnest  it rests with you to make malcolms the same  not so sir  that has long been out of my hands  madame you might well shrink from what it was as insult to you to propose but have you never thought of the blessings you might confer in the secular life with one who would be no hindrance but a help  no sir for no blessings but curses would follow a breach of dedication  lady i will not press you with what divines have decided respecting such dedication  any scruples could be removed by the holy father at rome and though i will speak no further i will trust to your considering the matter  you have never viewed it in any light save that of a refuge from wedlock with one to whom i trust you would prefer my gentle cousin  it were a poor compliment to lord malcolm to name him in the same day with sir boemond of burgundy said esclairmonde but as i said it is not the person that withholds me but the fact that i am not free  i do not ask you to love or accept the poor boy as yet said james i leave that for the time when i shall bring him back to you with the qualities grown which you have awakened  at least i can bear him the tidings that it is not your feelings but your scruples that are against him  sir king said esclairmonde gravely i question not your judgment in turning your kinsman and subject to the secular life but if you lead him by false hopes of which i am the object i tell you plainly that you are deluding him and if any evil come thereof be it on your own head  she moved away with a bend of her graceful neck and james stood with a slight smile curving his lip  by my troth he said to himself a lordly lady  she knows her own vocation  she is one to command scores of holy maids and have all the abbots and priors round at her beck instead of one poor man  rather malcolm than i  but he is the very stuff that loves to have such a woman to rule him and if she wed at all he is the very man for her  ill not give it up  love is the way to make a man of him whether successful or not and she may change her mind since she is not yet on the roll of saints  if i could get a word with her father confessor and show him how much it would be for the interest of the church in scotland to get such a woman there it would be the surest way of coming at her  were she once in scotland my pretty one would have a stay and helper  but all must rest till after the campaign  james therefore told malcolm so much as that he had spoken to his lady love for him and that she had avowed that it was not himself but her own vows that was the obstacle  malcolm crimsoned with joy as well as confusion and the king proceeded for the vowshe shrugged his shoulderswe knew there is a remedy meantime malcolm be you a man win your spurs and show yourself worth overcoming something for  malcolm smiled and brightened holding his head high and joyously and handling his sword  then came the misgivingbut lilias sir and patrick drummond  we will provide for them boy  you know drummond is bent on carving his own fortune rather than taking yours and that your sister only longs to see you a gallant knight  it was true but malcolm sighed  you have not spoken to the lady yourself asked the king  no sir  oh how can i faltered malcolm shamefaced and frightened  james laughed  let that be as the mood takes you or occasion serves he said wondering whether the lads almost abject awkwardness and shame would be likely to create the pity akin to love or to contempt and deciding that it must be left to chance  nor did malcolm find boldness enough to do more than haunt esclairmondes steps trembling if she glanced towards him and almost shrinking from her gaze  he had now no doubts about going on the campaign and was in full course of being prepared with equipments horses armour and attendants as became a young prince attending on his sovereign as an adventurer in the camp  it was not even worth while to name such scruples to the english friar who shrived him on the last day before the departure and who knew nothing of his past history  he knew all priests would say the same things and as he had never made a binding vow he saw no need of consulting any one on the subject it would only vex him again and fill him with doubts  the suspicion that dr bennet was aware of his previous intention made him shrink from him  so the last day had come and all was farewell  king henry had persuaded the queen to seclude herself for one evening from madame of hainault for his sake king james was pacing the gardens on the thames banks with joan beauforts hand for once allowed to repose in his many a noble gentleman was exchanging last words with his wifemany a young squire whispering what he had never ventured to say beforemany a silver mark was clovenmany a bright tress was exchanged  even ralf percy was in the midst of something very like a romp with the handsome bessie nevil for a knot of ribbon to carry to the wars  malcolm felt a certain exaltation in being enough like other people to have a ladylove but there was not much comfort otherwise indeed he could so little have addressed esclairmonde that it was almost a satisfaction that she was the centre of a group of maidens whose lovers or brothers either had been sent off beforehand or who saw their attentions paid elsewhere and who all alike gravitated towards the demoiselle de luxemburg for sympathy  he could but hover on the outskirts conscious that he must cut a ridiculous figure but unable to detach himself from the neighbourhood of the magnet  as he looked back on the happy weeks of unconstrained intercourse when he came to her as freely as did these young girls with all his troubles he felt as if the king had destroyed all his joy and peace and yet that these flutterings of heart and agonies of shame and fits of despair were worth all that childish calm  he durst say nothing only now and then to gaze on her with his great brown wistful eyes which he dropped whenever she looked towards him until at last when the summer evening was closing in and the last signal was given for the breakup of the party malcolm ventured on one faltering murmur lady lady you are not offended with me  nay said esclairmonde kindly nothing has passed between us that should offend me  his eye lighted  may i still be remembered in your prayers lady  as i shall remember all who have been my friends here she said  and oh lady if i shouldshould win honour may i lay it at your feet  whatever you achieve as a good man and true will gladden me said esclairmonde as it will all others that wish you well  both you and your sister in her loneliness shall have my best prayers  farewell lord malcolm may the saints bless and guard you whether in the world or the church  malcolm knew why she spoke of his sister and felt as if there were no hope for him  esclairmondes grave kindness was a far worse sign than would have been any attempt to evade him but at any rate she had spoken with him and his heart could not but be cheered  what might he not do in the glorious future  as the foremost champion of a crusading king bearing st andrews cross through the very gates of jerusalem what maiden however saintly could refuse him his guerdon  and he knew that for the present esclairmonde was safe from retiring into any convent since her high birth and great possessions would make any such establishment expect a large dower with her as a right and few abbesses would have ventured to receive a runaway foreigner especially as one of her guardians was the bishop of therouenne     chapter vii the siege of meaux   wintry winds and rains were sweeping over the english tents on the banks of the marne where henry v was besieging meaux then the stronghold of one of those terrible freebooters who were always the offspring of a lengthened war  jean de gast usually known as the bastard de vaurus nominally was of the armagnac or patriotic party but in fact pillaged indiscriminately especially capturing travellers on their way to paris and setting on their heads a heavy price failing which he hung them upon the great elmtree in the marketplace  the very suburbs of paris were infested by the forays of this desperate routier as such highway robbers were called the supplies of previsions were cut off and the citizens had petitioned king henry that he would relieve them from so intolerable an enemy  the king intended to spend the winter months with his queen in england and at once attacked the place in october hoping to carry it by a coup de main  he took the lower city containing the marketplace and several large convents with no great difficulty but the upper city on a rising ground above the river was strongly fortified well victualled and bravely defended and he found himself forced to invest it and make a regular siege though at the expense of severe toil and much sickness and suffering  both his own prestige in france and the welfare of the capital depended on his success and he had therefore fixed himself before meaux to take it at whatever cost  the greater part of the army were here encamped together with the chief nobles march somerset salisbury warwick and likewise the king of scots  james had for a time had the command of the army which besieged and took dreux while henry was elsewhere engaged but in general he acted as a sort of volunteer aidedecamp to his brother king and malcolm stewart of glenuskie was always with him as his squire  a great change had come over malcolm in these last few months  his feeble sickly boyhood seemed to have been entirely cast off and the warm genial summer sun of france to have strengthened his frame and developed his powers  he had shot up suddenly to a fair height had almost lost his lameness and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue  his nerves had become less painfully sensitive and when after his first skirmish during which he had kept close to king james far too much terrified to stir an inch from him he had not only found himself perfectly safe but had been much praised for his valour he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery and what with use and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity he was as sincere as ralf percy in abusing the french for never coming to a pitched battle  perhaps indeed malcolm spoke even more eagerly than ralf in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward and his fear lest percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such  so far the king of scots had succeeded in awakening martial fire in the boy but he found him less the companion in other matters than he had intended  when at paris james would have taken him to explore the learned hoards of the already venerable university of paris where young james kennedyson to sir james kennedy of dunure and to mary an elder sister of the kingwas studying with exceeding zeal  both james and dr bennet were greatly interested in this famous abode of hearingthe king indeed was already sketching out designs in his own mind for a similar institution in scotland designs that were destined to be carried out after his death by kennedy and malcolm perforce heard many inquiries and replies but he held aloof from friendship with his clerkly cousin kennedy and closed his ears as much as might be hanging back as if afraid of returning to his books  there was in this some real dread of ralf percys mockery of his clerkliness but there was more real distaste for all that appertained to the past days that he now despised  the tide of vitality and physical vigour so long deficient had whom it had fairly set in carried him away with it and in the activity of body newly acquired mental activity had wellnigh ceased  and therewith went much of the tenderness of conscience and devout habits of old  they dropped from him sometimes for lack of time sometimes from false shame and by and by from very weariness and distaste  he was soldier now and not monkay and even the observances that such soldiers as henry and james never failed in and always enforced were becoming a burthen to him  they wakened misgivings that he did not like and that must wait till his next general shrift  and esclairmonde  out of her sight malcolm dreamt a good deal about her but more as the woman less as the saint and the hopes so low in her presence burnt brighter in her absence as malcolm grew in selfconfidence and in knowledge of the world  he knew that when he parted with her he had been a miserable little wretch whom any woman would despise yet she had shown him a sort of preference how would it be when he returned to her perhaps a knight certainly a brave man like other men  of patrick drummond he had as yet heard nothing and only believed him to be among the scots who fought on the french side under the earls of buchan and douglas  indeed james especially avoided places where he knew these scots to be engaged as henry persisted in regarding them as rebels against him and in hanging all who were made prisoners nor had malcolm during the courtesies that always pass between the outposts of civilized armies made much attempt to have any communication with his cousin for though his own abnegation of his rights had never been permitted by his guardian or reckoned on by his sister or her lover still he had been so much in earnest about it himself as while regarding it as a childish folly to feel ill at ease in the remembrance and though defiant willing to avoid all that could recall it  meantime he with his king was lodged in a large old convent as part of the immediate following of king henry  others of the princes and nobles were quartered in the market hall and lower town but great part of thine troops were in tents and in a state of much discomfort owing to the overflowings of the marne  fighting was the least of their dangers though their skirmishes were often fought ankledeep in mud and mire fever and ague were among them and many a sick man was sent away to recover or die at paris  the long dark evenings were a new trial to men used to summer campaigning and nothing but henrys wonderful personal influence and perpetual vigilance kept up discipline  at any hour of the day or night at any place in the camp the king might be at hand with a cheery word of sympathy or encouragement or with the most unflinching sternness towards any disobedience or debaucheryever a presence to be either loved or dreaded  an engineer in advance of his time he was persuaded that much of the discomfort might be remedied by trenching the ground around the camp but this measure proved wonderfully distasteful to the soldiery  how hard they laboured in the direct siege operations they cared not but to be set to drain french fields seemed to them absurd and unreasonable and the work would not have proceeded at all without constant superintendence from one of the chiefs of the army since the ordinary knights and squires were as obstinately prejudiced as were the men  thus it was that on a cold sleety december day james of scotland rode along the meadows splashing through thin ice into muddy water and attended by his small personal suite excepting sir nigel baird who was gone on a special commission to paris  both he and malcolm were plainly and lightly armed and wore long blue cloaks with the st andrews cross on the shoulder steel caps without visors and the kings merely distinguished by a threadhike circlet of gold  they had breastplates swords and daggers but they were not going to a quarter where fighting was to be expected and bright armour was not to be exposed to rust without need  a visit of inspection to the delvers was not a congenial occupation for though the menatarms had obeyed james fairly well when he was in sole command at dreux yet whenever he was obliged to enforce anything unpopular the national dislike to the scot was apt to show itself and the whole army was at present in a depressed condition which made such manifestations the more probable  but king henry was not half recovered from a heavy feverish cold which he had not confessed or attended to and he had also of late been troubled with a swelling of the neck  this morning too much to his inconvenience and dismay he had missed his signetring  the private seal on such a ring was of more importance than the autograph at that time and it would never have left the kings hand but no doubt in consequence of his indisposition his finger always smallboned had become thin enough to allow the signet to escape unawares he was unwilling to publish the loss as it might cast doubt on the papers he despatched and he with his chamberlain fitzhugh king james malcolm percy and a few more had spent half the morning in the vain search ending by the king sending his chamberlain lord fitzhugh to carry to paris a seal already bearing his shield but lacking the small private mark that authenticated it as his signet  fitzhugh would stand over the lapidary and see this added and bring it back  ralf percy had meantime been sent to bring a report of the diggers but he was long in returning and when henry became uneasy james had volunteered to go himself and henry had consented not because the air was full of sleety rain or snow but because his hands were full of letters needing to be despatched to all quarters  the air was so thick that it was not easy to see where were the sullen group of diggers presided over by the quondam duellists of thirsk kitson and trenton now the most inseparable and impracticable of men but james and his companions had ridden about two miles from the marketplace when ralf percy came out of the mist exclaiming is it you sir king  maybe you can do something with those rascals  ive talked myself blue with cold to make them slope the sides of their dyke but the owl kitson says no yorkshireman ditcher ever went but by one fashion and none ever shall and when i lifted my ridingrod at the most insolent of the rogues what must trenton do but tell me the lot were free yeomen and id best look out or theyd roll me in the mire if i meddled with a soul of them  you didnt threaten to strike trenton  no no the sullen cur is a gentleman  twas one of those lubberly men atarms  i told them they should hear what king harry would say to their mood  i would it were he  so would i said james  little chance that they will hearken to a scot when you have put them in such a mood  hold ralf do not go for the king he has letters for the emperor mattering more than this dyke  he rode on and did his best by leaping into the ditch taking the spade and showing the superior security of the angle of inclination traced by the king but all in vain both trenton and kitson silently but obstinately scouted the notion that any king should know more about ditches than themselves  see cried percy starting up heres other work  the fellows whence came they  favoured by the fog and the soft soil of the meadows a considerable body of the enemy were stealing on the delvers with the manifest purpose of cutting them off from the camp  they were all mounted but the only horses in the english party were those of james percy malcolm and the halfdozen men of his escort  james assuming the command at once bade these to be all released they would be sure to find their way to the camp and that would bring succour  meantime he drew the whole of the men about thirty in number into a compact body  they were properly archers but their bows had been left behind and they had only their pikes and bills which were however very formidable weapons against cavalry as long as they continued in an unbroken rank and though the bogs pools sunken hedges and submerged stumps made it difficult to keep close together as they made their way slowly with one flank to the river these obstacles were no small protection against a charge of horsemen  for a quarter of a mile these tactics kept them unharmed but at length they reached a wide smooth meadow and the enemy seemed preparing to charge  james gave orders to close up and stand firm pikes outwards malcolms heart beat fast it was the most real peril he had yet seen and yet he was cheered by the kings ringing voice stand firm ye merry men  they must soon be with us from the camp  suddenly a voice shouted the scots the scots  tis the scots treachery we are betrayed  come sir to percy theyll be on you treason  an it were you fool would a percy turn his back cried ralf striking at the man but the panic had seized the whole body all were shouting that the false scots king had brought his countrymen down on them they scattered hither and thither and would have fallen an easy prey if they had been pursued  but this did not seem to be the purpose of the enemy who merely extended themselves so as to form a hedge around the few who stood sword in hand disdaining to fly  these were james somewhat in advance with his head high and a lion look on his brow malcolm white with dismay ralf restless with fury kitson and trenton apparently as unmoved as ever brewster equally steady and malcolms follower halbert in a glow of hopeful excitement  never fear friends said james kindly to you this can only be matter of ransom  i fear nothing sharply answered ralf  well stand by you sir said kitson to ralf but if ever there were foul treason  pshaw you ass were all percys thanks for at that moment a horseman came forward from among the enemy a gigantic form on a tall white horse altogether a dark gray man the open visor revealing an elderly face hardfeatured and grim and the shield on his arm so dinted faded and battered as scarce to show the blue chief and the bleeding crowned heart but it was no unfamiliar sight to malcolms eyes and with a slight shudder he bent his head in answer to the fierce whisper old douglas himself with which hotspurs son certified himself that he had the foe of his house before him  king james resting the point of his sword on his mailed foot stood erect and gravely expectant and the scot springing to the ground advanced with the words we greet you well my liege and hereby he was bending his knee as he spoke and removing his gauntlet in preparation for the act of homage  hold earl douglas said james homage is vain to a captive  you are captive no longer sir king said earl archibald  we have long awaited this occasion and will at once return to scotland with you with the arms and treasure we have gained here and will bear down the craven albany  kitson and trenton looked at one another and grasped their swords as though doubting whether they ought not to cut down their kings prisoner rather than let him be rescued and meanwhile the cry save king james broke out on all sides knights leapt down to tender their homage and among the foremost malcolm knew sir patrick drummond crying aloud my lord my lord we have waited long for you  be a free king in free scotland  trust us my liege  trust you my friends said james deeply touched i trust you with all my heart but how could you trust me if i began with a breach of faith to the king of england  ralf percy held up his finger and nodded his head to the yorkshire squires who stood openmouthed still believing that a scot must be false  there was an angry murmur among the scots but james gazed at them undauntedly as though to look it down  yes to king harry he said in his trumpet voice  i belong to him and he has trusted me as never prisoner was trusted before nor will i betray that trust  the foul fiend take such niceties muttered old douglas but checking himself he said then sir give me your sword and well have you home as my prisoner to save this your honour  yea said james that is mine own though my body be yours and till england put me to ransom you would have but a useless captive  sir said sir john swinton pressing forward if my lord of douglas be plainspoken bethink you that it is no cause for casting aside this one hope of freedom that we have sought so long  if you have the heart to strike for scotland this is the time  it is not the time said james nor will i do scotland the wrong of striking for her with a dishonoured hand  that will we see when we have him at hermitage castle quoth douglas to his followers  now sir king best give your sword without more grimace  living or dead you are ours  i yield not said james  dead you may take mealive never  then turning his eyes to the faces that gazed on him so earnestly in disappointment in affection or in scorn he spoke brave friends who may perchance love me the better that i have been a captive half my life and all my reign you can believe how sair my heart burns for my bonnie lands sake and how little id reck of my life for her weal  but broken oaths are ill beginnings  for me so notably trusted by king henry to break my bonds would shame both scots and kings and it were yet more paltry to feign to yield to my lord of douglas  rescue or no rescue i am englands captive  gentles kindly brother scots in one way alone can you free me  give up this wretched land of france whose troubles are but lengthened by your valour  let me gang to king harry and tell him your swords are at his service so soon as i am free  then am i your king indeed we return together staunch hearts and strong hands and the key shall keep the castle and the bracken bush keep the cow though i lead the life of a dog to bring it about  his tawny eye flashed with falcon light and as he stood towering above all the tall men around there were few who did not in heart own him indeed their king  but his picture of royal power accorded ill with the notions of a black douglas in the most masterful days of that family and earl archibald who had come to regard kings as beings meant to be hectored by douglases resentfully exclaimed hear him comrades he has avouched himself a southron at heart  has he reckoned how little it would cost to give a thrust to the caitiff who has lost heart in his prison and clear the way for albany who is at least a true scot  do so lord earl said james and end a long captivity  but let these go scatheless  with one voice percy kitson trenton and brewster shouted their resolve to defend him to the last and malcolm flinging himself on patrick drummond adjured him to save the king  thou here laddie said patrick amazed and while several more knights exclaimed sir sir well see no hand laid on you he thrust forward take my horse sir ride on and ill see no scathe befall you  thanks said james but my feet will serve me best we will keep together  the scottish force seemed dividing into two douglas and his friends and retainers mounted and holding together as though still undecided whether to grapple with the king and his halfdozen companions while drummond and about ten more lances were disposed to guard him at all risks  now said james to his english friends and therewith sword in hand he moved with a steady but swift stride towards the camp nor did douglas attempt pursuit some of the other horsemen hovered between and patrick drummond with a puzzled face kept near on foot  so they proceeded till they reached a bank and willow hedge through which horses could hardly have pursued them  on the other side of this james turned round and said thanks sir knight i suppose i may not hope that you will become a follower of the knight adventurer  i cannot fight under the english banner my liege  elsewhere i would fellow you to the death  this is no time to show your error said james and i therefore counsel you to come no farther  the english will be pricking forth in search of us so i will but thank you for your loyal aid  i entreat you sir cried patrick not to believe that we meant this matter to go as it has done  it had long been our desireof all of us that is save my lord buchans retainersto find you and release you but never did we deem that lord douglas would have dared to conduct matters thus  you would be little the better for me did lord douglas bring me back on his own terms said james smiling  no no when i go home it shall be as a free king able to do justice to all alike and for that i am content to bide my time and trust to such as you to back me when it comes  and with all my heart sir said patrick  would that you were where i could do so now  ah laddie to malcolm yere in good hands  my certie i kenned ye but by your voice  yere verily grown into a goodly ship after all and ye stood as brave as the rest  my poor father would have been fain to see this day  malcolm flushed to the ears somehow patricks praise was not as pleasant to him as he would have expected and he only faltered you know  i ken but what johnnie swinton brought me in a letter frae the abbot of coldingham that my fatherthe saints be with himhad been set on and slain by yon accursed master of albanywould that his thrapple were in my gripthat he had sent you southwards to the king and that your sister was in st abbs  is it so  malcolm had barely time to make a sign of affirmation when the king hurried him on  i grieve to balk you of your family tidings but delay will be ill for one or other of us so fare thee well sir patrick till better times  he shook the knights hand as he spoke cut short his protestations and leapt down the bank saying in a low voice as he stretched out his hand and helped malcolm down after him he would have known me again for your guest if we had stood many moments longer he looked hard at me as it was and neither in england nor scotland may that journey of mine be blazed abroad  malcolm was on the whole rather relieved he could not help feeling guilty towards patrick and unless he could have full time for explanation he preferred not falling in with him  and at the same moment kitson stepped towards the king  sir you are an honest man and we crave your pardon if we said aught that seemed in doubt thereof  james laughed shaking each honest hand and saying at least good sirs do not always think scot and traitor the same word and thank you for backing me so gallantly  id wish no better than to back such as you sir said kitson heartily and james then turned to ralf percy and asked him what he thought of the douglas face to face  a dour old block said ralf  if those runaways had but stayed within us the hoary ruffian should have had his lesson from a percy  james smiled for the grim giant was still a good deal more than a match for the slim rosyfaced stripling of the house of percy who nevertheless simply deemed his nation and family made him invincible by either scot or frenchman  the difficulties of their progress however entirely occupied them having diverged from the regular track they had to make their way through the inundated meadows sometimes among deep pools sometimes in quagmires or ever hedges while the water that drenched them was fast freezing and darkness came down on them  all stumbled or were bogged at different times and malcolm shorter and weaker than the rest and his lameness becoming more felt than usual could not help impeding their progress and at last was so spent that but for the kings strong arm he would have spent the night in a boghole  at last the lights were near the outskirts were gained the password given to the watch and the rough but welcome greeting was heardthats well  more of you come in  how got you off  the rogues got back then said kitson  some score of them was the answer but tis thought most are drowned or stuck by the french  the king is in a proper rage as well he may be but what else could come of a false scot in the camp  have a care you foul tongue percy was the first to cry and as torches were now brought out and cast their light on the wellknown faces the soldiers stood abashed but james tarried not for their excuses his heart was hot at the words which implied that henry suspected him and he strode hastily on to the convent where the quadrangle was full of horses and men and the windows shone with lights at the door of the refectory stood a figure whose armour flashed with light and his voice sounded through the closed visori tell you march i cannot rest till i knew what his hap has been  if he have done this thing  what then answered james out of the darkness in a voice deep with wrath but henry started  you there you safe  speak again  come here that i may see  where is he  here sir king said james gravely  now the saints be thanked cried henry joyously  where be the caitiffs that brought me their false tale  they shall hang for it at once  it was the less wonder said james still coldly that they should have thought themselves betrayed since their king believed it of me  nay twas but for a hot momentay and the bitterest i ever spent what could i do when the villains swore that there were signals and i know not what devices passing  i hoped yet twas but a plea for their own cowardice and was mounting to come and see for you  come i should have known you better id rather the whole world deceived me than have distrusted you jamie  there was that in his tone which ended all resentment and jamess hand was at once clasped in his while henry added ho provostmarshal to the gallows with these knaves  nay harry said james let me plead for them  there was more than ordinary to dismay them  dismay ay the more cause they should have stood like honest men  if a rogue be not to hang for deserting his captain and then maligning him soon would knavery be master of all  hear me first hal  ill hear when i return and you are dried  why man thou art an icicle errant change thy garments while i go round the posts or i shall hear nought for the chattering of thy teeth  nor i for your cough if you go harry  surely tis salisburys night  the more cause that i be on the alert  could i be everywhere mayhap a few winter blasts would not have chilled and frozen all the manhood out of the host  he spoke very sharply as he threw him on his horse and wrapped his cloak about hima poor defence spite of the ermine lining against the frost of the december night for a man whose mother the fair and wise mary de bohun had died in early youth from disease of the lungs  james and the two young partners of his adventure had long been clad in their gowns of peace and seated by the fire in the refectory james with his harp in his hand from time to time dreamily calling forth a few plaintive notes such as he said always rang in his ears after hearing a scottish voice when they again heard henrys voice in hot displeasure with the provostmarshal for having deferred the execution of the runaways till after the hearing of the story of the king of scots  his commands were not to be transgressed for the king of anything and he only reprieved the wretches till morning that their fate might be more signal  he spoke with the peremptory fierceness that had of late almost obscured his natural goodhumour and kindliness and when he entered the refectory and threw himself into a chair by the fire he looked wearied out in body and mind shivered and coughed and said with unwonted depression that the sullen fellows would make a quagmire of their camp after all since a french reinforcement had come up and the vigilance that would be needed would occupy the whole army  at supper he ate little and spoke less and when james would have related his encounter within the scots he cut him short saying let that rest till morning i am sick of hearing of it  an air upon thy harp would be more to the purpose  nor would james have been unwilling to be silent on old douglass conduct if he had not been anxious to plead for the panicstricken archers as well as to extol the conduct of the two youths and of the yorkshire squires but as he divined that the young hotspur would regard praise from him as an insult he deferred the subject for his absence and launched into a plaintive narrative ballad to which henry listened leaning back in his chair often dozing but without relaxation of the anxiety that sat on his pale face and ever and anon wakening within a heavy sigh as though his buoyant spirits were giving way under the weight of care he had brought on himself  james was just singing of one of the many knightly orphans of romance exposed in woods to the nurture of bears his father slain his mother dead of griefa ditty he had perhaps chosen for its soporific powerswhen a gay bugle blast rang through the court of the convent  the french would scarce send to parley thus late exclaimed james but the next moment a joyful clamour arose without and henry springing to his feet spoke not but stood awaiting the tidings with the colour burning on cheek and brow in suppressed excitement  an esquire splashed to the ears hurried into the room and falling on his knees cried aloud god save king harry  news news my lord  the queen has safely borne you a fair son at windsor castle five days since  henry did not speak but took the messengers hand wrung it and left a costly ring there  then taking off his cap he put his hands over his face uttering a few words of fervent thanksgiving almost within himself and then turning to the esquire made further inquiries after his wifes welfare took from him the letter that archbishop chicheley had sent poured out a cup of wine for him bade the lords around make him good cheer but craved license for himself to retire  it was so unlike his usual hilarious manner that all looked at one another in anxiety and spoke of his unusual susceptibility to fatigue and care while the squire looking at the rich jewel in his hand declared within disappointment in his tone that he would rather have had a mere flint stone so he had heard king harrys own cheery voice  james was not the least anxious of them but long ere light the next morning henry stood at his bedside saying i must go round the posts before mass jamie  will you face the matin frost  i am fitter to face it than thou said james rising  is there need for this  great need said henry  here are these fresh forces all aglow within their first zeal and unless they are worse captains than i suppose them they will attempt some mischief ere longnor is any time so slack as cockcrow  james was speedily ready and within some suppressed sighs so was malcolm who knew himself in duty bound to attend his master and was kept on the alert by seeing ralf percy also on foot  but it was a great relief to him that the young gentleman murmured in no measured terms against the intolerable activity of their kings  no other attendants went within them since henry was wont to patrol his camp with as little demonstration as possible  i would scarcely ask a dog to come out with me this wintry morn said he as he waved back his sleepy chamberlain fitzhugh and took his brother kings arm but i could not but crave a turn with thee jamie ere the hue and cry of rejoicing begins  that is poor welcome for your heir said james  poor child said henry then after they had walked some space in silence he added youll mock me but i would that this had not befallen at windsor  i had laid my plans that it should be otherwise but ladies are ill to guide  and wherefore should it not have been at fair windsor  if i can love it as a prison sure your son may well love it as a cradle  no dishonour to windsor said henry but sleeping or waking this whole night hath this adage rung in my ears     harry born at monmouth shall short time live and all get    harry born at windsor shall long time live and lose all  a most choice piece of royal poesy and prophecy laughed james  nay do not charge me with it thou dainty minstrel  it was sung to me by mime old herefordshire nurse when windsor seemed as little within my reach as meaux and i never thought of it again till i looked to have a son  then balk the prophecy said james edward born at windsor got enough and lived long enough to boot  too late was the answer  the archbishop christened the poor child harry in the very hour of his birth  poor child echoed james rather sarcastically  nay tis not solely the rhyme said henry but this has been a wakeful night and not without misgivings whether i am one who ought to look for joy in his children  what is past was not such that you alone should cry mea culpa said james  i never thought so till now said henry  yet who knows  my father was a winsome young man ere his exile full of tenderness to us all at the rare times he was with us  who knows what cares may make of me ere my boy learns to knew me  you will not hold him aloof and give him no chance of loving you  i trow not  ill have him with me in the camp and he and my brave men shall be one anothers pride  which roman emperor is it that hears the nickname his fathers soldiers gave him as a child  naycaligula was it  omens are against me this morning  then laughs them to scorn and be yourself said james  bless god for the goodly child who is born to two kingdoms won by his fathers and his grandsires swords  ah said henry depressed by failing health a sleepless night and hungry morning maybe it were better for him soul and body both did i stand here duke of lancaster and good edmund of march yonder were head of realm and army  never would he be head of this army said james  he would be snoring at shene that is if he could sleep for the trouble the duke of lancaster would be giving him  henry laughed at last  good king edmund he would assuredly never try to set the world right on its hinges  honest fellow soon he will be as hearty in his congratulations as though he did not lie under a great wrong  heighho such as he may be in the right ont  ive marvelled of late whether any priest or hermit could bring back my old assurance that all this is my work on earth or tell me if it be all one grand error  men there have been like caesar alexander or charlemagne who thought my thoughts and worked them out and surely church and nations cry aloud for purifying  jerusalem and a general councili saw them once clear and bright before me but now a mist seems to rise up from richards blood and hide them from me and there comes from it my fathers voice when he asked on his deathbed what right i had to the crown  what would it be if i had to leave this work half done  he was interrupted by the sight of a young knight stealing into the camp after a furtive expedition to paris  it was enough to rouse him from his despondent state and the severity of his wrath was in full proportion to the offence  nor did he again utter his misgivings but was full of his usual alacrity and life as though daylight had restored his buoyancy  james on the way back to the thanksgiving mass interceded for last nights offenders as an act of grace suitable to the occasion but henry was inexorable  had they stood to die like englishmen they had not lied like dogs he said and as dogs they shall hang  in fact in the critical state of his army he knew that the only safety lay in the promptest and sternest justice and therefore the three foremost in accusing king james of treachery were hung long before noon  however he called for the two yorkshiremen and thus addressed them well done my masters  thanks for showing scots and frenchmen what stuff englishmen are made of  i keep my word good fellows  kneel down and ill dub each a knight  how now what are you blundering and whispering for  so please you sir said kitson this is no matter to win ones spurs formere standing still without a blow  i would all had that same gift of standing still returned henry  what is it sticks in your gizzard friend  if tis the fees i take them on myself  no sir hoarsely cried both  and kitson explained sir you said youd knight the one of us that was foremost  now the two being dubbed we shall be but where we were before as to mistress agnes of mineshull unless of your goodwill you would be pleased to let us fight out the wager of the heriard in all peace and amity  henry burst out laughing with all his old merriment as he said for no mistress agnes living can i have honest mens lives wasted specially of such as have that gift of standing still  if she does not knew her own mind one of you must get himself killed by the frenchmen not by one another  so kneel down and well make your knighthoods feast fall in with that of my son  thus sir christopher kitson and sir william trenton rose up knights and bore their honours with a certain bluntness that made them butts even while they were the heroes of the day and henry who had resumed his gay temper made much diversion out of their mingled shrewdness and gruffness  so muttered malcolm to ralf percy we are passed over in the self same matter for which these fellows are knighted  tush answered percy id scorn to be confounded with a couple of clowns like them  moreover he added with better reason their valour was more exercised than ours inasmuch as they thought there was treachery and we did not  no no when my spurs are won it shall be for some prowess better than standing stockstill  malcolm held his tongue unwilling that percy should see that he did feel this an achievement but he was vexed at the lack of reward fancying that knighthood would be no small step in the favour of that imaginary esclairmonde whom he had made for himself  light of the world he loved to call her still but it was in the commonplace romance of his time the mere light of beauty and grace illuminating the world of chivalry     chapter viii the capture   the seven months siege ended at last but it was not until the brightness of may was on the fields outside and the deadly blight of famine on all within that a haggard wastedlooking deputation came down from the upper city to treat with the king  henry was never severe with the inhabitants of french cities and exacted no harsh terms save that he insisted that vaurus the robber captain and his two chief lieutenants should be given up to him to suffer condign punishment  the warriors who had shut themselves up to hold out the place by honourable warfare for the dauphin must be put to ransom as prisoners of war but the burghers were to be unmolested on condition of their swearing allegiance to henry as regent for and heir of charles vi  to this the deputies consented and the next day was fixed for the surrender  the difficulty was as henry had found at harfleur rouen and many other places to enforce forbearance on his soldiery who regarded plunder as their lawful prey the enemy as their natural game and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmercifulness  the more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of english country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of menatarms the mere greedy rapacious and insubordinate became their temper  well knowing the greatness of the peril and that the very best of his captains had scarcely the will if they had the power to restrain the license that soon became barbarity unimaginable he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his scutcheon but a shame to human nature looking back to the exultation with which he had entered harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness  having taken all possible precautions he stood in his full armour with the foxs brush in his helmet under the great elm in the marketplace received the keys accepted the sword of the captain commissioned by charles with royal courtesy gave his hand to be kissed by the mayor and then with grave inexorable air like a statue of steel watched as the freebooter vaurus and his two chief companions were led down with their hands tied halters round their necks and priests at their sides preparing them to be hung on that very tree  they were proud hard men and uttered no entreaty for grace  they had hung too many travellers upon these same branches not to expect their own turn and they were no cravens to abase themselves  that act of justice ended henry mounted his warhorse and rode in at the gates  his wont was to go straight to the principal church and there attend a solemn mass of thanksgiving but experience had taught him that his devotions were the very opportunity of his mens rapine he had therefore arranged that as soon as he should have arrived in the choir of the cathedral james should take his place and he slip out by a side door so as to return to the scene of action  in full procession he and his suite reached the chief door and there dismounted in an immense crowd which thronged in at the doors  come glenuskie said ralf percy as the two youths were pushed chose together in the press if you have a fancy for being smothered in the minster i have none  we shall never be missed  twill be sport to walk round and see how these hardy rogues contrived to hold out  malcolm willingly turned aside with him and looked down the sloping street which was swarming with comers and goers  the whole place was in an inflammable state  soldiers were demanding quarters which the citizens unwillingly gave  a refusal or expostulation against a rough entry led to violence and ever as the two youths walked farther from the cathedral there was more of excitement more rude oaths of soldiers more shrieking of women often crying out even before any harm was done to them or their houses  at last before a tall overhanging house there was an immense press and a frightful din of shouts and imprecations filling both the newcomers with infectious eagerness  how now how now called percy  keep the peace good fellows  sir cried a number of voices passionately the french villains have barred their door  theres a lot of cowardly armagnacs hid there with their gold trying to balk honest men of their ransom  such was the cry resounding on all sides  have at them  theres the rogue at the windows  out on the fellows  burn down the door  tis vaurus himself and all his gold  treason treason  the clamour was convincing to the spirit if not to the senses  the two lads believed in the concealed armagnacs or perhaps more truly were carried away by the vehemence around them and with something of the spirit of the chase threw themselves headlong into the affair  open open shouted ralf  open in the name of king henry  an old mans face peeped through a little wicket in the door and at sight of the two youths evidently of high rank said in a trembling voice alas alas  sir bid these cruel men go away  i have nothing hereno oneonly my sick daughter  you hear said malcolm turning round only his sick daughter  sick daughterold liar  heres an honest tinker makes oath he has hoards of gold laid up for vaurus and ten armagnacs hidden in his house have at him  bring fire  blows hailed thick on the door a flaming torch was handed over the heads of the throng horrible growls and roars pervaded them  malcolm and ralf furious at the cheat stood among the foremost making so much noise themselves between thundering and reviling and calling out where are the armagnacs  down with the traitors that they were not aware of a sudden hush behind them till a buffet from a heavy hand fell on malcolms shoulder and a mighty voice cried shame shame  what you too  there are traitors hid here sir said percy in angry selfjustification  and what an if there are  back every one of you rogues that you behere fitzhugh see those villains back to the camp  let their arms be given up to the provostmarshalkites and crows as you are  away out with you  henry pointed to the broken door and the cowed and abashed soldiers slunk away from the terrible light of his eyes  no man could stand before the face of the king  there was a stillness  he stood leaning on his sword his chest heaving with his panting breaths  he was naturally as fleet as the swiftfooted achilles but the winter had told upon him and the haste with which he had rushed to the rescue left him breathless and speechless while he seemed as it were to nail the two lads to the spot by his steady gaze of mingled distress and displeasure  neither could brook his eye percy hung his head like a boy in a scrape malcolm quailed with terror but at the same time felt a keen sense of injury in being thus treated as a plunderer and the blow under which his shoulder ached seemed an indignity to his royal blood  boys said henry still low and breathlesly but all the more impressively what is to become of honour and mercy if such as you must needs become ravening wolves at scent of booty  it was not booty sir they said traitors were hid here said percy sulkily  tush the old story  ever the plea for rapine and bloodthirstiness after the warnings of last night you should have known better but you are all alike in frenzy for a sack  you have both put off your knighthood till you have learnt not to become a shame thereto  i take not knighthood at your hands sir burst out malcolm goaded with hot resentment but startled the next moment at the sound of his own words  i cry you mercy said king henry in a cold short tone  malcolm turned on his heel and walked away without waiting to see how the poor old man in the house threw himself at the kings feet with a piteous history of his sick daughter and her starving children nor how ralf hurried off headlong to the lower town to send them immediate relief in bread wine and doctors  the gay goodnatured thoughtless lad no mere harboured malice for the chastisement than if his tutor had caught him idling but things went deeper with malcolm  true he had undergone many a brutal jest and cruel practical joke from his cousins but that was all in the family not like a blow from an alien king and one not apologized for but followed up by a rebuke that seemed to him unjust lowering him in his own eyes and those of esclairmonde and making him ready to gnaw himself with moody vexation  you here malcolm said king james entering his quarters did you miss me in the throng  i have not seen you all day  i have been insulted sir said malcolm  i pray your license to depart and carry my sword to my kinsmen in the french camp  how now  is it the way to treat an insult to run away from it  not when the world judges men to be on equal terms my lord  what  who has done you wrong you silly loon  king henry sir he struck me with his fist and rated me like his hound and i will not eat another morsel of his bread unless he would answer it to me in single combat  little enough bread youd eat after that same answer ejaculated james oh  i understand now  you were with young hotspur and the rest that set on the poor townsmen and harry made small distinction of persons nay malcolm it was ill in you that talked of so loathing spulzie  i wanted no spulzie  there were armagnacs hid in the house and the king would not hear us  he knew that story too well  were you asleep or idling last night when he warned all on no plea whatever to break into a house but if the old tale of treachery came up to set a guard and call one of the captains  did you hear himeh  i can take chiding from you sir but neither words nor blows from any other king in christendom still less when he threatens me that i have deferred my knighthood  as if i would have it from him  from me you will not have it until he have pardoned ralf percy said james dryly  malcolm i had not thought you such a fule body  under a captains banner what can be done but submit to his rule  i should do so myself were salisbury or march in command  then sir said malcolm much hurt that the king did not take his part i shall carry my service elsewhere  so said james much vexed this is the meek lad that wanted to hide in a convent from an ill world flying off from his king and kinsman that he may break down honest mens doors at his will  that i may be free from insult sir  you think john of buchan like to cosset you  you found the black douglas so courtly to me the other day as to expect him to be tender to this nicety of yours  malcolm as your prince and guardian i forbid this folly and command you to lay aside this fit of malice and do your devoir  what sobbing silly ladwheres your manhood  sir sir what will they think of methe lady esclairmonde and allif they hear i have sat down tamely with a blow  she will never think about you at all but as a sullen malapert neerdo weel if you go off to that camp of routiers trying to prop a bad cause because you cannot take correction nor observe discipline  a sudden suspicion came over malcolm that the king would not thus make light of the offence if it had really been the inexpiable insult he had supposed it and the thought was an absolute relief for in effect the parting from james and joining the party opposed to esclairmondes friends would have been so tremendous a step that he could hardly have contemplated it in his sober senses and he murmured my honour sir in a tone that james understood  oh for your honouryou need not fear for that  any knight in the army could have done as much without prejudice to your honour  why you silly loon dye think i would not have been as angered as yourself if your honour had been injured  malcolms heart felt easier but he still growled  then sir if you assure me that i can do so without detriment to my honour i will not quit you  james laughed  it might have been more graciously spoken my good cousin but i am beholden to you  malcolm ashamed and vexed at the sarcastic tone held his tongue for a little while but presently exclaimed will the bishop of therouenne hear of it  james laughed  belike not or if he should it would only seem to him the reasonable training of a young squire  the king did not say what crossed his own mind that the bishop of therouenne was more likely to think henry overstrict in discipline and absurdly rigorous  the prelate charles de luxemburg brother to the count de st pol had made several visits to the english camp  he was one of these princely younger sons who like beaufort at home took ecclesiastical preferments as their natural provision and as a footing whence they might become statesmen  he was a great admirer of henrys genius and as the chief french prelate who was heartily on the english side enjoyed a much greater prominence than he could have done at either the french or burgundian court  he and his brother of st pol were esclairmondes nearest kinsmenoncles a la mode de bretagne as they call the relationship which is here sometimes termed welsh uncle or first cousins once removedand from him james had obtained much more complete information about esclairmonde than he could ever get from the flighty duchess  her mother a beautiful walloon had been heiress to wide domains in hainault her father to great estates in flanders all which were at present managed by the politic bishop  like most of the statesmansecularclergy the bishop hated nothing so much as the monastic orders and had made no small haste to remove his fair niece from the convent at dijon where she had been educated lest the cistercians should become possessed of her lands  he had one scheme for her marriage but his brother the count had wished to give her to his own second son who was almost an infant and the duke of burgundy had designs on her for his halfbrother boemond and among these various disputants esclairmonde had never failed to find support against whichever proposal was forced upon her until the coalition between the dukes of burgundy and brabant becoming too strong she had availed herself of countess jaquelines discontent to evade them both  the family had of course been much angered and had fully expected that her estates would go to some great english abbey or to some english lord whose haughty reserve and insularity would be insupportable  it was therefore a relief to monseigneur de therouenne to hear jamess designs and when the king further added that he would be willing to let the claims on the hainault part of her estates be purchased by the count de st pol and those in flanders by the duke of burgundy the bishop was delighted and declared that rather than such a negotiation should fail he would himself advance the sum to his brother but that the duke of burgundys consent was more doubtful only could they not do without it  and he honoured malcolm with a few words of passing notice from time to time as if he almost regarded him as a relation  no doubt it would have been absurd to fly from such chances as these to patrick drummond and the opposite camp and yet there were times when malcolm felt as if he should get rid of a load on his heart if he were to break with all his present life hurry to patrick confess the whole to him and thenhide his head in some hermitage leaving his pledge unforfeited  that however could not be  he was bound to the king and might not desert him and it was not unpleasant to brood over the sacrifice of his own displeasure  see said henry in the evening as he came into the refectory and walked up to james i have found my signet  it was left in the finger of my spanish glove which i had not worn since the beginning of winter thanks to all who took vain pains to look for it  but malcolm did not respond with his pleased look to the thanks  he was not in charity with henry and crept out of hearing of him while james was saying you had best destroy one or the other or they will make mischief  here ill crush it with the pommel of my sword  ay said henry laughing youd like to shew off one of your sledge hammer blowssir bras de fer  but master scot you shall not smash the english shield so easily  this one hangs too loose to be safe i shall keep it to serve me when we have fattened up at paris after the leanness of our siege  hal said james seeing his gay temper restored you have grievously hurt that springald of mine  his northern blood cannot away with the taste he got of your fist  pretty well for your godly young monk to expect to rob unchecked laughed henry  he will do well at last said james  manhood has come on him with a rush and borne him off his feet nor would i have him overtame  there spake the scot said henry  by my faith jamie we should have had you the worst robber of all had we not caught you young  well what am i do for this sprig of royalty  say i struck unawares  nay had i known him id have struck with as much of a will as his slight bones would bear  an you love me hal do something to cool his ill blood and remove the sense of shame that sinks a lad in his own eyes  methought said henry there was more shame in the deed than in the buffet  nevertheless the goodnatured king took an occasion of saying my lord of glenuskie i smote without knowing you  it was no place for a princenay for any honest man otherwise no hand should have been laid on my guest or my brothers near kinsman  and whereas i hear that both you and my fiery hot percy verily credited the cry that prisoners were hid in that house let me warn you that never was place yielded on composition but some villain got up the shout and hundreds of fools followed it till they learnt villainy in their turn  therefore i ever chastise transgression of my command to touch neither dwelling nor inhabitant  you have both learnt your lesson and the lion rampant and he of the straight tail will both be reined up better another time  malcolm had no choice but to bend his head mutter something and let the king grasp his hand though to him the apology seemed none at all but rather to increase the offence since the blame was by no means taken back again while the condescension was such as could not be rejected and thus speciously took away his excuse for brooding over his wrath  his hand lay so unwillingly in that strong hearty clasp that the king dropped it frowned shrugged his shoulders and muttered to himself sullen young dog  no scot can let bygones be bygones and then he turned away and cast the trifle from his memory  james was amazed not to see the moody face clear up and asked of malcolm whether he were not gratified with this ample satisfaction  i trow i must be sir said malcolm  i tell thee boy said james not one kingnay not one manin a thousand would have offered thee the frank amends king harry hath done this day nay i doubt whether even he could so have done were it not that the hope of his wifes coming hath made him overflow with joy and charity to all the world  malcolm did not make much reply and james regarded him with some disappointment  the youth was certainly warmly attached to him but these tokens of superiority to the faults of his time and country which had caused the king to seek him for a companion seemed to have vanished with his feebleness and timidity  the manhood that had been awakened was not the chivalrous generous and gentle strength of henry and his brothers but the punctilious pride and sullenness and almost something of the license of the scot  the camp had not proved the school of chivalry that james in his inexperience had imagined it must be under henry and the tedium and wretchedness of the siege had greatly added to its necessary evils by promoting a reckless temper and willingness to snatch at any enjoyment without heed to consequences  close attendance on the kings had indeed prevented either malcolm or percy from even having the temptation of running into any such lengths as those gentry who had plundered the shrine of st fiacre at breuil or were continually galloping off for an interval of dissipation at paris but they were both on the outlook for any snatch of stolen diversion for in ceasing from monastic habits malcolm seemed to have laid aside the scruples of a religious or conscientious youth and specially avoided dr bennet the kings almoner  james feared he had been mistaken and looked to the influence of esclairmonde to repair the evil if perchance she should follow the queen to france  and this it was almost certain she must do since she was entirely dependent upon the countess of hainault and could not obtain admission to a nunnery without recovering a portion of her estates     chapter ix the dance of death   the queen was coming  no sooner had the first note of surrender been sounded from the towers of meaux than henry had sent intelligence to england that the way was open for the safe arrival of his muchloved wife and at length on a sunny day in may tidings were received that she had landed in france under the escort of the duke of bedford  vincennes in the midst of its noble forest was the place fixed for the meeting of the royal pair and never did a happier or more brilliant cavalcade traverse those woodlands than that with which henry rode to the appointed spot  all the winter the king had heeded appearances as little as of old when roughing it with hotspur in wales but now his dress was of the most royal  on his head was a small green velvet cap encircled by a crown in embroidery his robe was of scarlet silk and over it was thrown a mantle of dark green samite thickly powdered with tiny embroidered white antelopes the garter was on his knee the george on his neck  it was a kingly garb and well became the tall slight person and fair noble features  during these tedious months he had looked wan haggard and careworn but the lines of anxiety were all effaced his lustrous blue eyes shone and danced like easter suns his complexion rivalled the fresh delicate tints of the blossoms in the orchards and when with a shyness for which he laughed at himself he halted to brush away any trace of dust that might offend the eye of his dainty kate and gaily asked his brother king if he were sufficiently pranked out for a ladys bower james thinking he had never seen him so handsome replied  like a young bridegroomnay more like a young suitor  youre jealous jamieafraid of being outshone  tis is your own fault man none can ever tell whether you be in festal trim or not  for king jamess taste was for sober wellblending hues and as he never lapsed into henrys carelessness his state apparel was not very apparently dissimilar from his ordinary dress being generally of dark rich crimson blue or russet with the st andrews cross in white silk on his breast or else the ruddy lion but never conspicuously and the sombre hues always seemed particularly well to suit his auburn colouring  malcolm in scarlet and gold was a far gayer figure and quite conscious of the change in his own appearancehow much taller ruddier and browner he had become how much better he held himself both in riding and walking and how much awkwardness and embarrassment he had lost  no wonder esclairmonde had despised the sickly timid monkish schoolboy and if she had then shown him any sort of grace or preference what would she think of the princely young squire he could new show her who had seen service had proved his valour and was only not a knight because of king henrys unkindness and king jamess punctilioat any rate no child to be browbeaten and silenced with folly about cloistral dedication but a youth who had taken his place in the world and could allege that his inspiration had come through her bright eyes  would she be there  that was the chief anxiety for it was not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on the continent and catherine had given no intimation as to who would be in her suiteso that as henry had merrily observed he was the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense except indeed salisbury who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come out with the queen  she is come cried henry  beforehand with us after all and he spurred his horse on as he saw the banner raised and the escort around the gate and in a few seconds more he and his companions had hurried through the court where the ladies had scarcely dismounted and hastened into the hall breaking into the seneschals solemn reception of the queen  my kate my fairest  mine eyes have been hungry for a sight of thee  and catherine in her horned headgear and flutter of spangled veil was almost swallowed up in his hearty embrace and the fervency of his great love so far warmed her that she clung to him and tenderly said my lord it is long since i saw you  thou wert before me  ah forgive thy tardy knight he continued gazing at her really enhanced beauty as if he had eyes for no one else even while with lip and hand kiss grasp and word he greeted her companions of whom jaqueline of hainault and john of bedford were the most prominent  and the babe where is he then cried he  let me have him to hold up to my brave fellows in the court  the prince of wales said catherine  you never spake of my bringing him  if i spake not it was because i doubted not for a moment that you would keep him with you  nay verily it is not in sooth that you left him  you are merely sporting with use  truly sir said catherine i never guessed that you would clog yourself with a babe in the cradle and i deemed him more safely nursed at windsor  if it be for his safety  yet a soldiers boy should thrive among soldiers said the king evidently much disappointed and proceeding to eager inquiries as to the appearance and progress of his child to which the queen replied with a certain languor as though she had no very intimate personal knowledge of her little son  other eyes were meanwhile eagerly scanning the bright confusion of veils and wimples and malcolm had just made out the tall head and dark locks under a long almost shrouding white veil far away in the background behind the countess of hainault when the duke of bedford came up with a frown of consternation on his always anxious face and drawing king james into a window said what have you been doing to himto which james without hearing the question replied where is she  joan  at home  it was the queens will  of that another time  but what means this and he signed towards his brother  never saw i man so changed  had you seen him at christmas you might have said so replied james but now i see naught amiss i had been thinking i had never seen him so fair and comely  i tell you james said bedford contracting his brows till they almost met ever his arched nose i tell you his look brings back to me my mothers the last time she greeted my father  to your fantasy not your memory john  you were a mere babe at her death  of five years said bedford  that facethat coughhave brought all backay the yearning look when my father was absent and the pure rosy fairness that harry and tom cited so fiercely against one who would have told them how sick to death she was  i mind me too that when our grandame of hereford made us motherless children over to our grandsire of lancaster it was with a warning that harry had the tender lungs of the bohuns and needed care  one deadly sickness he had at kenilworth when my father was ridden for posthaste  my mind misgave me throughout this weary siege but his service held me fast at home and i trusted that you would watch over him  a man like him is ill to guide said james but he is more himself now than he has been for months and a few weeks quiet with his wife will restore him  but what is this he proceeded in his turn why is the lady joan not here  how can i tell  it was no fault of mine  i even got a prim warning that it became me not to meddle about her ladies and i doubted what slanders you might hear if i were seen asking your nightingale for a token  have you none  good john i know you have  john smiled his ironical smile produced from the pouch at his girdle a small packet bound with rosecoloured silk and said the nightingale hath a plume you see and saith moreover that her knight hath done his devoir passably but that she yet looks to see him send some captive giant to her feet  so sir knight i hope your poor dwarf hath acquitted him well in your chivalrous jargon  james smiled and coloured with pleasure the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to and even press to his lips his ladys first loveletter in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing bedford of whom he eagerly asked of the fair joans health and welfare and whether she were flouted by queen catherine  no more than is the meed of her beauty said bedford  sister kate likes not worship at any shrine save one  look at our suite our knightsyea our very grooms are picked for their comeliness to wit that great featherpated oaf of a welshman owen tudor there while dames and demoiselles tirewomen and all are as near akin as may be to sir gawains loathly lady  not at least the fair luxemburg  did not i see her stately mien  she is none of the queens and moreover she stands aloof so that the women forgive her gifts  there is that cough of harrys again  he is the shadow of the man he was i would i knew if this were the stepdames doing  nay john when you talk to me of harrys cough and of nightwatches and flooded camps i hearken but when your wits run woolgathering after that poor woman making waxen images stuck full  you are in the right ont james said henry who had come up to them while he was speaking  john will never get sorceries out of his head  i have thought it over and will not be led into oppressing my fathers widow any more  i cannot spend this pentecost cheerily till i know she is set free and restored to her manors and i shall write to humfrey and the council to that effect  and as john shrugged his shoulders henry gaily added thou seest what comes of a winter spent with this unbeliever jamie and truly i found the thought of unright to my fathers widow was a worse pin in my heart than ever she is like to thrust there  thus then it was that in the overflowing joy and goodwill of his heart and mayhap with the presentiment which rendered him willing to be at peace with all his kindred henry forgave and released his stepmother joan of navarre whom common rumour termed the witch queen and whom he had certainly little reason to love whether it were true or not that she had attempted to weave spells against him  in fact there were few of the newcomers from england who did not like bedford impute the transparency of henrys hands and the hollowness of his brightlytinted cheek to some form of sorcery  meantime esclairmonde de luxemburg more beautiful than ever under a still simpler dress had greeted malcolm with her wonted kindness adding with a smile that he was so much grown and embrowned that she should not have known him but for the sweet scottish voice which he like his king possessed  you do me too much grace in commending aught that is mine madame said malcolm with an attempt at the assurance he believed himself to have acquired but he could only finish by faltering and blushing  there was a power of repression about esclairmonde that annihilated all his designs and drove him back into his bashful self whenever he came into contact with her and felt how unlike the grave serene loftiness of her presence was to the mere queen of romance that in her absence her shadow had become  alice montagu returning to her side relieved while disconcerting him sweet little alice had been in a continual flutter ever since commands had come from meaux that she was to come out to meet the father whom she had not seen since what seemed like half her childish lifetime and the betrothed whom she had never seen at all and lady westmoreland had added to her awe by the lengthened admonition with which she took leave of her and on this day when esclairmonde herself had arrayed the fair child in the daintiest of rosepink boddices edged with swansdown the whitest of kirtles and softest of rosy veils the flush of anxiety on the pale little face made it so fair to look upon that as the maiden wistfully asked think you he will flout me it was impossible not to laugh at the very notion  ah but i would be glad if he did for then i might bide with you  when in the general greeting alice had been sought out by a tall dark browed grizzled warrior esclairmonde had cruelly as the maiden thought kept her station behind the countess and never stirred for all those wistful backward glances but left her alone to drop on her knee to seek the blessing of the mighty old soldier  and now she was holding his great hand almost as tough as his gauntlets and leading him up to her friend while he louted low and spoke with a grand fatherly courtesy  fair demoiselle this silly wench of mine tells me that you have been good friend to her and i thank you for the same with all mine heart  silly was a fond term of love then and had all the affection of a proud father in it as the earl of salisbury patted the small soft fingers in his grasp  truly my lord responded esclairmonde the lady alice hath been my sweetest companion friend and sister for these many months  nay child art worthy to be called friend by such a lady as this  if so i shall deem my little alice grown a woman indeed as it is time she werediccon nevil is bent on the wedding before we go to the wars again  alice coloured like a damask rose and hid her face behind her friend  hast seen him sweet asked esclairmonde when salisbury had been called away  is he here  yes out therehe with the white bull on his surcoat said alice dreading to look that way  and hast spoken with him asked the lady next feeling as if the stout commonplace hardylooking soldier she saw was scarce what she would have chosen for her little wild rose of an alice comely and brave though he were  he hath kissed mine hand faltered alice but it was quite credible that not a word had passed  the marriage was a business contract between the houses of wark and raby and a grand speculation for sir richard nevil that was all but gentle alice had no reluctance beyond mere maidenly shyness and unwillingness to enter on an unknown future under a new lord  she even whispered to her dear clairette that she was glad sir richard never tormented her by talking to her and that he was grave and so old  so old why little one he can scarce be sevenandtwenty  and is not that old oh so old said alice  able to take care of me i would not have a youth like that young lord of glenuskie  oh nonever  that is well said esclairmonde smiling but wherefore put such disdain in thy voice alice  he used to be our playfellow and he hath grown older and more manly in this year  his boyhood was better than such manhood said alice he was more to my taste when he was meek than now that he seems to say i would be saucy if i durst  and he hath not the stuff to dare any way  fie fie  alice you are growing slanderous  nay now clairette own verilyyou feel the like  hush silly one what skills it  youths must pass through temptation and if his king hindered his vocation maybe the poor lad may rue it sorely but methinks he will come to the right at last  it were better to say a prayer for his faults than to speak evil of them alice  poor malcolm  he was at that very moment planning with an embroiderer a robe wherein to appear covered with flashes of lightning transfixing the world and mottoes aroundesclaire mais embrase  every moment that he was absent from esclairmonde was spent in composing chivalrous discourses in which to lay himself at her feet but the mere sight of her steady dark eyes scattered them instantly from his memory and save for very shame he would have entreated king james again to break the ice for him since the lady evidently supposed that she had last year entirely quashed his suit  and in this mood malcolm mounted and took his place to ride into paris where the king wished to arrive in the evening and with little preparation so as to avoid the weary length of a state reception with all its speeches and pageants  in the glow of a may evening the cavalcade passed the gates and entered the city where the streets were so narrow that it was often impossible to ride otherwise than two and two  the foremost had emerged into an open space before a church and churchyard when there was a sudden pause a shock of surprise  all across the space blocking up the way was an enormous line of figures looking shadowy in the evening light and bearing the insignia of every rank and dignity that earth presented popes were there with triple crown and keys and fanned by peacock tails scarletmatted and caped cardinals mitred and crosiered bishops crowned and sceptred kings ermined dukes steelclad knights gowned lawyers squarecapped priests cowled monks and friars of every degreenay the mechanic with his tools the peasant with his spade even the beggar within his dish old men and children of every age and women too of all gradesthe towercrowned queen the beplumed dame the lofty abbess the veiled nun the bourgeoise the peasant the beggarall were there moving in a strange shadowy wild dance sometimes slow sometimes swift and mad with gaiety to the music of an unseen band of clashing kettledrums cymbals and other instruments that played fast and furiously while above all a knell in the church tower rang forth at intervals a slow deep lugubrious note and all the time there glided in and out through the ring a grisly beingskullheaded skeletonboned scythe in handdeath himself and ever and anon when the dance was swiftest would he dart into the midst pounce on one or other holding an hourglass to the face unheeding rank sex or age and bear his victim to the charnelhouse beside the church  it was a sight as though some terrible sermon had taken life as though the unseen had become visible the veil were taken away and the implicit unresisting obedience of the victims added to the sense of awful reality and fatality  the advance of the victorious king henry made no difference to the continuousness of the frightful dance nay it was plain that he was but in the presence of a monarch yet more victorious than himself and the mazes wound on the performers being evidently no phantoms but as substantial as those who beheld them nay the grisly ring began to absorb the royal suite within itself and an awestricken silence prevailedat least where malcolm stewart and ralf percy were riding together  neither lad durst ask the other what it meant  they thought they knew too well  percy ceased not for one moment to cross himself and mutter invocations to the saints malcolms memory and tongue alike seemed inert and paralyzed with horrorhis brain was giddy his eyes stretched open and when death suddenly turned and darted in his direction one horrible gush of thoughtfallen fallen  lost lost  no confessioncame over him he would have sobbed out an entreaty for mercy and for a priest but it became a helpless shriek and while percys sword flashed before his eyes he felt himself falling deathstricken to the earth and knew no more  therehe moved said a voice above him  how now glenuskie cried ralf percy  look up i verily thought you were sped by death in bodily shape but twas all an abominable grisly pageant got up by some dismal caitiffs  it was the danse macabre added the sweet tone that did indeed unclose malcolms eyes to see esclairmonde bending over him and holding wine to his lips  ralf raised him that he might swallow it and looking round he saw that he was in a small wainscoted chamber with an old burgher woman ralf percy and esclairmonde certainly not in the other world  he strove to ask what it meant and esclairmonde spoke again  it is the danse macabre i have seen it in holland  it was invented as a warning to those of sinful life and this good woman tells me it has become the custom to enact it every evening at this churchyard of the holy innocents  a custom i devoutly hope king harry will break exclaimed ralf  if not ill some day find the way between those painted ribs of monseigneur de la mort i can tell him  i had nearly given him a taste of my sword as it was only some gascon rogue caught my arm and he was off ere i could get free  so i jumped off that your poor corpse should not be trodden by french heels and i hardly know how it was but the lady esclairmonde was by my side as i dragged you out and caused these good folks to let me bring you in behind their shop  lady lady i am for ever beholden cried malcolm gathering himself up as if to fall at her feet and his heart bounding high with joy for this was from death to life indeed  i saw there was some one hurt said esclairmonde in her repressive manner  drink some more wine eat this bread and you will be able to ride to the hotel de st pol  oh lady let me speak of my bliss and he snatched at her hand but was still so dizzy that he sank back becoming aware that he was stiff and bruised from his fall  almost at the same moment a new step and voice were heard in the little open booth where the cutler displayed his wares and king james was at once admitted  how goes it laddie he asked  they told me grim death had clutched you and borne you off to his charnelhouse but at least i see an angel has charge of you  esclairmonde slightly coloured as she made answer  i saw some one fall and came to offer my poor skill sir but as the sieur de glenuskie is fast recovering if you will permit sir nigel baird to attend me sir i will at once return  i am readyi am not hurt  oh let us go together panted malcolm leaping up  eh gentlemen exclaimed the hospitable cutlers wife you will not away so fast  this gallant knight will permit you to remain  and the fair lady she will do me the honour to drink a cup of wine to the recovery of her betrothed  not so good woman said esclairmonde a little apart i am the betrothed of heaven  i only assisted because i feared the youths fall was more serious than it proves  the bourgeoise begged pardon and made a curtsey there was nothing unusual in the avowal the lady had made when the convent was a thoroughly recognized profession but esclairmonde could not carry out her purpose of departing separately with old sir nigel baird malcolm was on his feet quite ready to mount and there was no avoiding the being assisted to her saddle by any but the king who was in truth quite as objectionable a companion as far as appearances went for a young solitary maiden as was malcolm himself  esclairmonde felt that her benevolence might have led her into a scrape  when she had seen the fall knowing that to the unprepared the ghastly pageant must seem reality she had obeyed the impulse to hurry to the rescue to console and aid in case of injury and she had not even perceived that her female companions did not attempt to accompany her  however the mischance could best be counteracted by simplicity and unconsciousness so as she found herself obliged to ride by the king she unconcernedly observed that these fantastic dances might perhaps arouse sinners but that they were a horrible sight for the unprepared  very like a dream becoming flesh and blood said james  we in advance were slow to perceive what it was and then the king merely thought whether it would alarm the queen  i trow it did not  no the thing has not been found that will stir her placid face  she merely said it was very lugubrious and an ill turn in the parisians thus to greet her but they were always senseless betes and he being relieved of care for her looked with all his eyes with a strange mixture of drollery at the antics and the masques yet of grave musing at the likeness to this present life  i think said esclairmonde that king henry is one of the few men to whom the spectacle is a sermon  he laughs even while he lays a thing to heart  these few sentences had brought them to the concourse around the gateway of the great hotel de st pol in whose crowded courtyard esclairmonde had to dismount and after being handed through the hall by king james to make her way to the ladies apartments and there find out what she was most anxious about how alice who had been riding at some distance from her with her father had fared under the alarm  alice ran up to her eagerly  ah dear clairette and was he greatly hurt  not much he had only swooned for fright  swooned to be a prince and not have the heart of a midge  and how was it with you you very wyvern for courage  with me  oh i was somewhat appalled at first when my father took hold of my rein and bade me never fear for i saw his face grow amazed  sir richard nevil rode up on the other side and said the hobgoblins should eat out his heart ere they hurt me and i looked into his face as he said that and liked it more than ever i thought to like any but yours clairette  i think my father was going to leave me to him and see whether the king needed some one to back him but up came a french lord and said twas all a mere show and my father said he was glad i was a stouthearted wench that had never cried out for fear and then i was so pleased that i never heeded the ugly sight any more  ay and when sir richard lifted me off my horse he kissed my hand of his own accord  this is all he has ever said to you said esclairmonde smiling  it is like an englishmanto the purpose  yea is it not  oh is it not better than all the fine speeches and compliments that joan beaufort gets from her scottish king  they have truths in them too child  ay but too finespun too minstrellike for a plain english maid  the hobgoblins should eat out his heart ere they touched me she repeated to herself as though the saying were the most poetical concert sung on minstrel lovers lute  deaths dance had certainly brought this affianced pair to a better understanding than all the gayest festivities of the court  esclairmonde would have been happy if no one had noticed her benevolence to the young scot save alice montagu but she had to endure countless railleries from every lady from countess jaqueline downwards on the unmistakable evidence that her heart had spoken and her grave dignity had less effect in silencing them than usual so diverting was the alleged triumph over her propriety well as they knew that she would have done the same for the youngest horseboy or the oldest manatarms     chapter x the whitsuntide festival   lady fairest lady  ah suffer your slave to fall at your feet with his thanks  no thanks are due sir  i knew not who had fallen  cruel coyness  take not away the joy that has fed a hungry heart  lord glenuskies heart was wont to hunger for better joys  lady i have ceased to be a foolish boy  such foolishness was better than some mens wisdom  listen belle demoiselle  i have been forth into the world and have learnt to see that monasteries have become mere haunts for the sluggard who will not face the world and that honour glory and all that is worth living for lie beyond  ah lady those eyes first taught me what life could give  hush sir said esclairmonde  i can believe that as a child you mistook your vocation and the secular life may be blest to you but with me it can never be so and if any friendship were shown to you on my part it was when i deemed that we were brother and sister in our vows if i unwittingly inspired any false hopes i must do penance for the evil  call it not evil lady entreated malcolm  it cannot be evil to have wakened me to life and hope and glory  what should you call it in him who should endeavour to render lady joan beaufort faithless to your king lord malcolm  what then must it be to tempt another to break trothplight to the king of heaven  nay madame faltered malcolm but if such troth were forbidden and impossible  none has the right or power to cancel mine replied the lady  yet he still entreated your kindred are mighty  but my bridegroom is mightier she said  o lady yetsay at least cried malcolm eagerly that were you free in your own mind to wed at least you would less turn from me than from the others proposed to you  that were saying little for you said esclairmonde half smiling  but sir she added gravely you have no right to put the question and i will say nothing on which you can presume  you were kinder to me in england sighed malcolm with tears in his eyes  then you seemed as one likeminded she answered  and he cried gathering fresh ardour i would be likeminded again you would render me so sweetest lady  i would kiss your every step pray with you bestow alms with you found churches endow your beguines and render our change from our childish purpose a blessing to the whole world become your very slave to do your slightest bidding  o lady could i but give you my eyes to see what it might be  it could not be if we began with a burthened conscience said esclairmonde  we have had enough of this sieur de glenuskie  you know that with me it is no matter of likes or dislikes but that i am under a vow which i will never break  make way sir  he could but obey she was far too majestic and authoritative to be gainsaid  and malcolm in an access of misery stood lost to all the world kneeling in the windowseat where she had left him resting his head against the glass when suddenly a white plump hand was laid on his shoulder and a gay voice cried  all a la mort my young damoiseau  what has our saint been unpropitious  never mind you shall have her yet  we will see her like the rest of the world ere we have done within her  and malcolm found himself face to face with the freespoken jaqueline of hainault  you are very good madame he stammered  you shall think me very good yet  i have no notion of being opposed by a little vassal of mine and well succeed if it were but for the fun of the thing  monseigneur de therouenne is on your side or would be if he were sure of the duke of burgundy  you see these prelates hate nothing so much as the religious orders and all the pride of the luxemburgs is in arms against clairettes fancy for those beggarly nursing sisters so it drives him mad to hear her say she only succoured you for charity  he thinks it a family disgrace that can only be wiped off by marrying her to you and he would do it bon gre mal gre but that he waits to hear what burgundy will say  you have only to hold out and she shall be yours if i hold her finger while you put on the ring  only let us be sure of burgundy  this was not a very flattering way of obtaining a bride but malcolm was convinced that when once married to esclairmonde his devotion would atone to her for all that was unpleasant in obtaining her  at least she loved no one else she had even allowed that she had once thought him likeminded she had formerly distinguished him and nothing lay between them but her scruples and when they were overcome by whatever means his idol would be his to adore to propitiate to win by the most intense devotion  all now must however turn upon the duke of burgundy without whose sanction madame of hainault would be afraid to act openly  the duke was expected at paris for the whitsuntide festival which was to be held with great state  the custom was for the kings of france to feast absolutely with all paris with interminable banquet tables open to the whole world without question  and to this henry had conformed on his first visit to the city but he had learnt that the costly and lavish feast had been of very little benefit to the really distressed who had been thrust aside by loudvoiced miscreants and sturdy beggars such as had no shame in driving the feeble back with blows and receiving their own share again and again  by the advice of dr bennet his almoner he was resolved that this should not happen again that the feast should be limited to the official guests and that the cost of the promiscuous banquet should be distributed to those who really needed it and who should be reached through their parish priests and the friars known to be most charitable  dr bennet as almoner with the other chaplains was to arrange the matter and horrible was the distress that he discovered in the city that had for fiveandtwenty years been devastated by civil fury as well as by foreign wars and famines pestilences murders and tyrannies had held sway so as to form an absolute succession of reigns of terror  the poor perished like flies in a frost the homeless orphans of the parents murdered by either faction roamed the streets and herded in the corners like the vagrant dogs of eastern cities and meantime the nobles and their partisans revelled in wasteful pomp  scholar as he was dr bennet was not familiar enough with parisian ways not to be very grateful for aid from esclairmonde in some of his conferences and for her explanations of the different tastes and needs of french and english poor  what she saw and heard on the other hand gave form and purpose to her aspirations  the dutch sisters of st bega the english bedeswomen of st katharine were sorely needed at paris  they would gather up the sufferers collect the outcast children feed the hungry follow with balm wherever a wound had been  to found a beguinage at paris seemed to her the most befitting mode of devoting her wealth and her little admirer alice gave up her longing desire that the foundation should be in england when she learned that as the wife of nevil her abode was likely to be in france as long as that country required english garrisons  to the young heiress of salisbury her own marriage though close at hand seemed a mere ordinary matter compared with esclairmondes beguinage to her the real romance  never did she see a beggar crouching at the church door without a whisper to herself that there was a subject for the beguines and tenderhearted as she was she looked quite gratified at any lamentable tale which told the need  if esclairmonde had a climax to her visions of her brownrobed messengers of mercy it was that the holy canon of st agnes should be induced to come and act the part of master to her bedeswomen as did master kedbesby at home  she had even dared to murmur her design to dr bennet and when he under strict seal of secrecy had sounded king henry the present real master of paris he reported that the tears had stood in the kings eyes for a moment as he said blessings on the maiden  should she be able to do this for this city i shall know that heaven hath indeed sent a blessing by my arms  for one brief week esclairmonde and alice were very happy in this secret hope but at the end of that time the bishop of therouenne appeared esclairmonde had ventured to hope that the kings influence and likewise the fact that her intention was not to enrich one of the regular monastic orders might lead him to lend a favourable ear to her scheme but she was by no means prepared to find him already informed of the affair of the dance of death and putting his own construction on it  so my fair cousin this is the end of your waywardness  the tokens were certainly somewhat strong but the young gentlemans birth being equal to yours after the spectacle you have presented your uncle of st pol and i myself must do our utmost to obtain the consent of the duke of burgundy  monseigneur is mistaken said esclairmonde  child we will have no more folly  you have flown after this young scot in a manner fitted only for the foolish name your father culled for you out of his books of chivalry  you have given a lesson to the whole court and city on the consequences of a damsel judging for herself and running a mad course over the world instead of submitting to her guardians  the court understands my purpose as well as you do monseigneur  silence mademoiselle  your convent obstinacy is ended for ever now since to send you to one would be to appear to hide a scandal  i do not wish to enter a convent said esclairmonde  my desire is to dedicate my labour and my substance to the foundation of a house here at paris such as are the beguinages of our netherlands  the bishop held up his hands  he had never heard of such lunacy and it angered him as such purposes are wont to anger worldlyhearted men  that a lady of luxemburg should have such vulgar tastes as to wish to be a beguine was bad enough but that netherlandish wealth should be devoted to support the factious poor of paris was preposterous  neither the duke of burgundy nor her uncle of st pol would allow a sou to pass out of their grasp for so absurd a purpose the pope would give no licenseabove all to a vain girl who had helped a wife to run away from her husbandfor new religious houses and unless esclairmonde was prepared to be landless penniless and the scorn of every one for her wild behaviour she must submit bon gre mal gre to become the wife of the scottish prince  landless and penniless then will i be monseigneur said esclairmonde was not poverty the bride of st francis  the bishop made a growl of contempt but recollecting himself and his respect for the saint began to argue that what was possible for a man a mere merchants son an inspired saint besides was not possible to a damsel of high degree and that it was mere presumption vanity and obstinacy in her to appeal to such a precedent  there was something in this that struck esclairmonde for she was conscious of a certain satisfaction in her plan of being the first to introduce a beguinage at paris and that she was to a certain degree proud of her years of constancy to her high purpose and she looked just so far abashed that the uncle saw his advantage and discoursed on the danger of attempting to be better than other people and of trying to vapour in spiritual heights to all of which she attempted no reply till at last he broke up the interview by saying there then child all will be well  i see you are coming to a better mind  i hope i am monseigneur she replied with lofty meekness but scarcely such as you mean  alice montagus indignation knew no bounds  what was this noble votaress to be forced not only to resign the glory of being the foundress of a new order of beneficence but to be married just like everybody else and to that wretched little coward  boemond of burgundy was better than that for he at least was a man  no no alice said esclairmonde with a shudder any one rather than the burgundian  it is shame even to compare the scot  he may not be so evil in himself said alice but with a brave man you have only his own sins while a coward has all those other people may frighten him into  he bore himself manfully in battle said the fair fleming in reproof  but alice answered with the scorn that sits so quaintly on the gentle daughter of a bold race ay where he would have been more afraid to run than to stand  you are hard on the scot said esclairmonde  maybe it is because the nevils of raby are borderers she added smiling and as alice likewise smiled and blushed now if it were not for this madness i could like the youth  i would fain have had him for a brother that i could take care of  but what will you do esclairmonde  trust said she sighing  maybe my pride ought to be broken and i may have to lay aside all my hopes and plans and become a mere serving sister to learn true humility  anyhow i verily trust to my heavenly spouse to guard me for himself  if the duke of burgundy still maintains boemonds suit then in the dissension i see an escape  and my father will defend you and so will sir richard said alice with complacent certainty in their full efficiency  and king harry will interfere and we will have your hospital ay we will  how can you talk so lightly of abandoning it  i only would know what is human pride and what gods will sighed esclairmonde  the duke arrived with his two sisters his wife being left at home in bad health and took up his abode at the hotel de bourgogne whence he came at once to pay his respects to the king of england the poor king of france at the hotel de st pol being quite neglected  esclairmonde and alice stood at a window and watched the arrival of the magnificent cavalcade attended by a multitude ecstatically shouting noel noel  long live philippe le bon  blessings on the mighty duke while seated on a tall charger whose great dappled head jewelled and beplumed could alone be seen amid his sweeping housings bowing right and left waving his embroidered gloved hand in courtesy was seen the stately duke in the prime of life handsomefaced brilliantly coloured dazzlingly arrayed in gemmed robes so that alice drew a long breath of wonder and exclaimed this duke is a goodly man he looks like the emperor of us all  but when he had entered the hall conducted by john of bedford and edmund of march had made his obeisance to henry and had been presented by him to king james alice standing close behind her queen recollected that she had once heard esclairmonde say till i came to england i deemed chivalry a mere gaudy illusion  duke philippe would not bear close inspection the striking features and full red lips that had made so effective an appearance in the gay procession seen from a distance seemed harsh haughty and sensual near at hand and when brought into close contact with the strange bright stern purity now refined into hectic transparency of king henrys face the grand and melancholy majesty of the royal stewarts or even the spare keen irregular visage of john of bedford  and while his robes were infinitely more costly thanand his ornaments tenfold outnumberedall that the three island princes wore yet no critical eye could take him for their superior even though his tone in addressing an inferior was elaborately affable and condescending and theirs was always the frankness of an equal  where they gave the sense of pure gold he seemed like some ruder metal gilt and decorated as if theirs were reality his the imitation theirs the truth his the display  but in reality his birth was as princely as theirs and no monarch in europe not even henry equalled him in material resources he was idolized by the parisians and henry was aware that france had been made over to england more by his revenge for his fathers murder at montereau than by the victory at agincourt  therefore the king endured his grand talk about our arms and our intentions and for malcolms sake james submitted to a sort of patronage as if meant to imply that if philippe the magnificent chose to espouse the cause of a captive king his ransom would be the merest trifle  when henry bade him to the pentecostal banquet when kings keep state he graciously accepted the invitation for himself and his two sisters marguerite widow of the second shortlived dauphin and anne still unmarried but when henry further explained his plan of feasting merely with the orderly and apportioning the food in real alms the duke by no means approved  feed those miserables he said  one gains nothing thereby  they make no noise whereas if you affront the others who know how to cry out they will revile you like dogs  i will not be a slave to the rascaille said henry  ah my fair lord you a victor may dispense with these cares but for a poor little prince like me it is better to reign in mens hearts than on their necks  in the hearts of honest menon the necks of knaves said henry  philippe shrugged his shoulders  he was wise in his own generation for he had all the audible voices in paris on his side while the cavils at henrys economy have descended to the present time  do you see your rival sir said the voice of the bishop of therouenne in malcolms ear just as the duke had begun to rise to take leave and he pointed out a knight of some thirty years glittering with gay devices from head to foot and showing a bold proud visage exaggerating the harshness of the burgundian lineaments  malcolm shuddered and murmured such a pearl to such a hog  and meanwhile king james stepping forward intimated to the duke that he would be glad of an interview with him  philippe made some ostentation of his numerous engagements with men of church and state but ended by inviting the king of scotland to sup with him that evening if his grace would forgive travellers fare and a simple reception  thither accordingly james repaired on foot attended only by sir nigel and malcolm with a few archers of the royal guard in case torches should be wanted on the way home  how magnificent were the surroundings of the great duke it would be wearisome to tell  the retainers in the court of the hotel looked as james said as if honest steel and good cloth were reckoned as churls and as if this were the very land of cockaigne as sir richard whittington had dreamt it  neither he nor st andrew himself would know their own saltire made in cloth of silver the very metal to tarnish  sir nigel had to tell their rank ere the porters admitted the small company but the seneschal marshalled them forward in full state  and james never looked more the king than when in simple crimson robe the pure white cross on his breast his auburn hair parted back from his noble brow he stood towering above all heads passively receiving the duke of burgundys elaborate courtesies and greetings nor seeming to note the lavish display of gold and silver meant to amaze the poorest king in europe  exceeding was the politeness shown to himeven to the omission of the seneschals tasting each dish presented to the duke a recognition of the presence of a sovereign that the two scots scarcely understood enough for gratitude  malcolm was the best off of the two at the supper for james had of course to be cavalier to the sickly fretfullooking dauphiness while malcolm fell to the lot of the lady anne who though not beautiful had a kindly hearty countenance and manner and won his heart by asking whether the demoiselle de luxemburg were still in the suite of madame of hainault and then it appeared that she had been her convent mate and warmest friend and admirer in their girlish days at dijon and was now longing to see her  was she as much set as ever on being a nun  meantime the duke was pompously making way for the king of scots to enter his cabinet wherewith a gold cup before each a dish of comfits and a stoup of wine between themtheir interview was to take place  these dainties accord with a matter of ladies love said james as the duke handed him a sugar heart transfixed by an arrow  good good said philippe  the alliance is noble and our crowns and influence might be a good check in the north to your mighty neighbour nor would i be hard as to her dowry  send me five score yearly of such knaves as came with buchan and i could fight the devil himself  a morning gift might be specified for the name of the thingbut we understand one another  i am not certain of that sir said james smiling though i see you mean me kindly  nay now continued philippe i know how to honour royalty even in durance nor will i even press madame la dauphine on you instead of anne though it were better for us all if she could have her wish and become a queen and you would have her jointureif you or any one else can get it  stay my lord duke said james with dignity i spake not of myself deeming that it was well known that my troth is plighted  how said burgundy amazed but not offended  methought the house of somerset was a mere bastard slip with which even king henry with all his insolence could not expect you to wed in earnest  however we may keep our intentions secret awhile and then with your lances and my resources english displeasure need concern you little  james who had learned selfcontrol in captivity began politely to express himself highly honoured and obliged  do not mention it  royal blood thus shamefully oppressed must command the aid of all that is chivalrous  speak and your ransom is at your service  the hot blood rushed into jamess cheek at this tone of condescension but he answered with courteous haughtiness of myself sir duke there is no question  my ransom waits englands willingness to accept it and my hand is not free even for the prize you have the goodness to offer  i came not to speak of myself  not to make suit for my sister nor my intercession exclaimed philippe  i make suit to no man said james then recollecting himself if i did so no readier friend than the duke of burgundy could be found  i did in effect come to propose an alliance between one of my own house and a fair vassal of yours  ha the runaway jade of luxemburg cried burgundy the most headstrong girl who lives  she dared to plead her foolish vows against my brother boemond fled with that other hoyden of hainault and now defies me by coming here  ill have her and make her over to boemond to tame her pride were she in the great satans camp instead of king henrys  and this is the mirror of chivalry thought james  but he persevered in his explanation of his arrangement for permitting the estates of esclairmonde de luxemburg to be purchased from her and her husband should that husband be malcolm stewart of glenuskie and he soon found that these terms would be as acceptable to the duke as they had already proved to her guardian monseigneur de therouenne  money was nothing to philippe but his policy was to absorb the little seignoralties that lay so thick in these border lands of the empire and what he desired above all was to keep them from either passing into the hands of the church or from consolidating into some powerful principality as would have been the case had esclairmonde either entered a convent or married young waleran de luxemburg her cousin  therefore he had striven to force on her his halfbrother who would certainly never unite any inheritance to hers but he much preferred the purchase of her hainault lands and had no compunction in throwing over boemond except for a certain lurking desire that the ladys contumacy should be chastised by a lord who would beat her well into subjection  he would willingly have made a great show of generosity and have laid james under an obligation and yet by the kings dignified tone of courtesy he was always reduced to the air of one soliciting rather than conferring a favour  finally malcolm was called in and presented to the duke making his own promise on his word of honour as a prince and giving a written bond that so soon as he obtained the hand of the demoiselle de luxemburg he would resign her hainault estates to the duke of burgundy for a sum of money to be fixed by persons chosen for the purpose  this was more like earnest than anything malcolm had yet obtained and he went home exulting and exalted his doubts as to esclairmondes consent almost silenced when he counted up the forces that were about to bear upon her  and they did descend upon her  countess jaqueline had been joined by other and more congenial flemish dames and was weary of her grave monitress and she continually scolded at esclairmonde for perverseness and obstinacy in not accepting the only male thing she had ever favoured the bishop of therouenne threatened and argued and the duke of burgundy himself came to enforce his commands to his refractory vassal and on finding her still unsubmissive flew into a rage and rated her as few could have done save philippe called the good  all she attempted to answer was that they were welcome to her lands so they would leave her person free her vows were not to man but to god and god would protect her  it was an answer that seemed specially to enrage her persecutors who retorted by telling her that such protection was only extended to those who obeyed lawful authority and hints were thrown out that if she did not submit willingly she might find herself married forcibly for a bishop could afford to disregard the resistance of a bride  would malcolmwould his kingconsent to her being thus treated  as to malcolm he seemed to her too munch changed for her to reckon on what remnant of good feeling there might be to appeal to in him  and james though he was certain not to permit palpable coercion in his presence or even if he were aware that it was contemplated seemed to have left the whole management of the affair to esclairmondes own guardians and they would probably avoid driving matters to extremities that would revolt him while he was near enough for an appeal  and esclairmonde was too uncertain whether her guardians would resort to such lengths or whether it were not a vain threat of the giddy countess to compromise her dignity by crying out before she was hurt and she had no security save that she was certain that in the english household of king henry such violence would not be attempted and out of reach of that protection she never ventured  once she said to henry my only hope is in god and in you my lord  and henry bent his head saying noble lady i cannot interfere but while you are in my house nothing can be done with you against your will  yet even henry was scarcely what he had been in allpervading vigilance and readiness  like all real kings of men he had been his own prime minister commanderinchief and private secretary transacting a marvellous amount of business with prompt completeness and when in the midst of shattered health which he would not avow the cares of two kingdoms and the generalship of an army with all its garrisons rested on him his work would hardly have been accomplished but for his brothers aid  it was never acknowledged often angrily disdained  but when john of bedford had watched the terrible lassitude and lethargy that weighed on the king at times in the midst of his cabinet work he was constantly on the watch to relieve him and his hand and style so closely resembled henrys that the difference could scarce be detected and he could do what none other durst attempt  many a time would henry whose temper had grown most uncertain fiercely rate him for intermeddling but john knew and loved him too well to heed and his tact and unobtrusiveness made henry rely on him more and more  if the illness had only been confessed those who watched the king anxiously would have had more hope but he was hotly angered at any hint of his needing care and though he sometimes relieved oppression by causing himself to be bled by a servant he never allowed that anything ailed him it was always the hot weather the anxious tidings the long pageant that wearied himthings that were wont to be like gnats on a lions mane  those solemn banquets and festivalslasting from forenoon till eventide with their endless relays of allegorical subtleties their longwinded harangues noisy music interludes of giants sylvan men distressed damsels knightserrant on horseback ships and forests coming in upon wheels and fulsome compliments that must be answeredhad been always his aversion and were now so heavy an oppression that bedford would have persuaded the queen to curtail them  but to the fair catherine this appeared an unkind endeavour of her disagreeable brotherinlaw to prevent her from shining in her native city and eclipsing the burgundian pomp and she opened her soft brown eyes in dignified displeasure answering that she saw nothing amiss with the king and she likewise complained to her husband of his brothers jealousy of her welcome from her own people bringing on him one of henrys most bitter sentences  henry would only have had her abate somewhat of the splendour that gratified her because he did not think it becoming to outshine her parents but catherine scorned the notion  her old father would know nothing or would smile in his foolish way to see her so brave and for her mother she recked not so long as she had a larded capon before her nor was it possible to make the young queen understand that this fatuity and feebleness were the very reasons for deferring to them  the ordering of the feast fell to catherine and her train and its splendours on successive days had their full development greatly to the constraint and weariness among others of esclairmonde who was always assigned to malcolm stewart and throughout these long days had to be constantly repressing him not that he often durst make her any direct compliment for he was usually quelled into anxious wistful silence and merely eyed her earnestly paying her every attention in his power  and such a silent tedious meal was sure to be remarked either with laughing rudeness by countess jaqueline or with severe reproof by the bishop of therouenne both of whom assured her that she had better lay aside her airs and resign herself in good part for there was no escape for her  one day however when the feast was at the hotel de bourgogne and there were some slight differences in the order of the guests the duke of bedford put himself forward as the lady esclairmondes cavalier so much to her relief that her countenance usually so guarded relaxed into the bright sweet smile of cheerfulness that was most natural to her isolated as the pairs at the table were and with music braying in a gallery just above there was plenty of scope for conversation and once again esclairmonde was talking freely of the matters regarding the distress in paris that bedford had consulted her upon before he became so engrossed with his brothers affairs or she so beset by her persecutors  towards the evening when the feast had still some mortal hours to last there fell a silence on the duke and at length when the music was at the loudest he said lady i have watched for this moment  you are persecuted  look not on me as one of your persecutors but if no other refuge be open to you here is one who might know better how to esteem you than that malapert young scot  how sir exclaimed esclairmonde amazed at these words from the woman hating bedford  make no sudden reply said john  i had never thought of you save as one consecrate till when i see you like to be hunted down into the hands of yon silly lad i cannot but thrust between  my brother would willingly consent and if i may but win your leave to love you lady it will be with a heart that has yearned to no other woman  he spoke low and steadily looking straight before him with no visible emotion save a little quiver in the last sentence a slight dilating of the delicately cut nostril and then he was silent until having recovered the selfrestraint that had been failing him he prevented the words she was trying to form by saying not in haste lady  there is time yet before you to bethink yourself whether you can be free in will and conscience  if so i will bear you through all  how invitingly the words fell on the lonely heart so long left to fight its own battles  there came for the first time the full sense of what life might be the shielding tenderness the sure reliance the pure affection such as she saw henry lavish on the shallow queen but which she could meet and requite in john  the brutal boemond the childish malcolm had aroused no feeling in her but dislike or pity and to them a convent was infinitely preferable but bedfordthe religious manly brave unselfish bedfordopened to her the view of all that could content a highsouled womans heart backed moreover by the wonder of having been the first to touch such a spirit  it would not have been a mesalliance  her family was one of the grandest of the netherlands the saintly emperor henry of luxemburg was her ancestor and bedfords proposal was not a condescension such as to rouse her sense of dignity  his rank did not strike her as did his lofty stainless character the like of which she had never known to exist in the world of active life till she saw the brothers of england who came more near to the armed saints and holy warriors of church legend than her fancy had thought mortal man could do bred as she had been in the sensual violent and glittering burgundy of the fifteenth century  in truth as malcolm had thought the cloister the only refuge from the harshness and barbarism of scotland so esclairmonde had thought piety and purity to be found nowhere else and both had found the court of henry v an infinitely better world than they had supposed possible but until the present moment esclairmonde had never felt the slightest call to take a permanent place there  now however the cloister even if it were open to her presented a gloomy cheerless life of austerity in comparison with human affection and matronly duty  and most vivid of all at the moment was the desire to awaken the tender sweetness that slept in those steady gray eyes to see the grave wise visage gleam with smiling affection and to rest in having one to take thought for her and finish this long term of tossing about and selfdefence  was not the patience with which he kept his eyes away from her already a proof of his consideration and delicate kindness  but deep in esclairmondes soul lay the sense that her dedication was sacred and her power over herself gone  she had always felt a wifes allegiance due to him whom she received as her spiritual spouse and though the sense at this moment only brought her disappointment and self reproach her will was loyal  the bond was cutting into her very flesh but she never even thought of breaking it and all she waited for was the power of restraining her grateful tears  in this she was assisted by observing that bedfords attention had been attracted towards his brother who was looking wan and weary scarcely tasting what was set before him and after fitfully trying to converse with marguerite of burgundy at last had taken advantage of an endless harangue from all the virtues and had dropped asleep  the lady anne was seen making a sign to her sister not to disturb him and bedford murmured with a sigh there is for once a discreet woman  then as if recalled to a sense of what was passing he turned on esclairmonde his full earnest look saying you will teach the queen how he should be cared for  you will help me  sir said esclairmonde feeling it most difficult not to falter this is a great grace but it cannot be  cannot said bedford slowly  you have taken thought  sir it is not the part of a betrothed spouse to take thought  my vows were renewed of my own free will and it were sacrilege to try to recall them for the first real temptation  she spoke steadily but the effort ached through her whole frame especially when the last word illumined john plantagenets face with strange sweet light quenched as his lip trembled his nostril quivered his eye even moistened as he said it is enough lady i will no more vex one who is vexed enough already and you will so far trust me as to regard me as your protector if you should be in need  indeed i will said esclairmonde hardly restraining her tears  that is well said bedford  and he neither looked at her nor spoke to her again till as he led her away in the procession from the hall he held her hand fast and murmured there then it rests sweet lady unless having taken counsel with your own heart you should change your decree and consult some holy priest  if so make but a sign of the hand and i am yours for verily you are the only maiden i could ever have loved  she was still in utter confusion in the chamber where the ladies were cloaking for their return when her hands were grasped on either side by the two burgundian princesses  sweet runaway we have caught you at last  here into annes chamber see you we must  how is it with you  like you the limping scot better than boemond laughed the dauphiness her company dignity laid aside for schoolgirl chatter  if you cannot hold out said anne the scot seems a gentle youth and at least you are quit of boemond  yes said marguerite his last prank was too strong for the duke quartering a dozen menatarms on a sulky cambrai weaver till he paid him 2000 crowns  besides it would be well to get the scottish king for an ally  do you know what we two are here for clairette  we are both to be betrothed one to the handsome captive with the gold locks the other to your hawknosed neighbour who seemed to have not a word to say  but said esclairmonde replying to the easiest part of the disclosure the king of scots is in love with the demoiselle of somerset  what matters that silly maid said marguerite he does not displease me and anne is welcome to that melancholy duke  oh lady anne exclaimed esclairmonde if such be your lot it would be well indeed  what the surly brother of whom catherine tells such tales continued marguerite  credit them not said esclairmonde  he never crosses her but when he would open her eyes to his brothers failing health  yes interrupted marguerite my lord brother swears that this king will not live a year and if catherine have no better luck with her child than poor michelle then there will be another good queen anne in england  if so said esclairmonde looking at her friend with swimming eyes she will have the best of husbandsas good as even she deserves  anne held her hand fast and would have said many tender words on esclairmondes own troubles but the other ladies were arrayed and esclairmonde would not for worlds have been left behind in the hotel de bourgogne  privacy was not an attainable luxury and esclairmonde could not commune with her throbbing heart or find peace for her aching head till night this must be a matter unconfided to any even alice montagu  and while the maiden lay smiling in her quiet sleep after having fondly told her friend that sir richard nevil had really noticed her new silken kirtle she knelt on beneath the crucifix mechanically reciting her prayers and as the beads dropped from her fingers fighting out the fight with her own heart  her mind was made up but her sense of the loss her craving for the worthy affection which lay within her graspthese dismayed her  the life she had sighed for had become a blank and she passionately detested the obligation that held her back from affection usefulness joy and excellencenot ambition for the greatest help to her lay in bedfords position his exalted rank and nearness to the crown  indeed she really dreaded and loathed worldly pomp so much that the temptation would have been greater had he not been a prince  it was this sense of renunciation that came to her aid  she had at least a real sacrifice to offer till now as she became aware she had made none  she folded her hands and laid her offering to be hallowed by the one allsufficient sacrifice  she offered all those capacities for love that had been newly revealed to her she offered up the bliss whose golden dawn she had seen she tried to tear out the earthliness of her heart and affections by the roots and lay them on the altar entreating that come what might her spirit might never stray from the heavenly spouse of her betrothal  therewith came a sense of his perfect sufficiencyof rest peace support ineffable love that kept her kneeling in a calm almost ecstatic state in which common hopes fears and affections had melted away     chapter xi the two promises   after all alice montagu was married almost privately and without any preparation  tidings came that the duke of alencon was besieging cosne a city belonging to the duke of burgundy and that instant relief was needed  the duke was urgent with henry to save the place for him and set off at once to collect his brilliant chivalry while henry rousing at the trumpetcall declared that nothing ailed him but pageants sent orders to all his troops to collect from different quarters and prepared to take the command in person while reports daily came in of the great muster the armagnacs were making as though determined to offer battle  salisbury was determined not to abide the chances of the battle without first giving a protector to his little daughter and therefore as quietly as if she had been merely going to mass the lady alice was wedded to her sir richard nevil who treated the affair as the simplest matter of course and troubled himself with very slight demonstrations of affection  the wedding took place at senlis whither the female part of the court had accompanied the king upon the very day of the parting  no one was present except one of sir richards brothers the whole family numbered twentytwo his esquire and on alices side her father esclairmonde and a few other ladies  at the last moment however the king himself came up leaning on warwicks arm looking thin ill and flushed but resolved to do honour to his faithful salisbury at whose request he had permitted the barony of montagu to be at once transferred to nevil who would thenceforth be called by that title  after the ceremony king henry kissed the gentle bride placed a costly ring upon her finger and gave his best and warmest wishes to the newly married pair  little guessed any there present what the sound of warwick and salisbury would be in forty years time to the babe cradled at windsor  as the king passed esclairmonde he paused and said in an undertone dear lady deem not that i have forgotten your holy purpose but you understand that there are some who are jealous of any benefit conferred on paris save from themselves and whose alliance i may not risk  but if god be pleased to grant me this battle also then with his good pleasure i shall not be forced to have such respect to persons and when i return lady whether the endowment come from your bounty or no god helping us you shall begin the holy work of st katharines bedeswomen among the poor of paris  but while henry v with all his grave sweetness spoke these words to esclairmonde de luxemburg this was the farewell of countess jaqueline of hainault to malcolm stewart  look here my languishing swain never mind her scorn but win your spurs in the battle that is to be and then make some excuse to get back again to us before the two kings with all their scruples  then beshrew me but she shall be yours  if monseigneur de therouenne and i cannot manage one proud girl i am not countess of hainault  this promise sent him away planning the enjoyment of conquering esclairmondes long resistance and teaching her where to find happiness should he punish her by being stern and tyrannical at first or should his kindness teach her to repent  when he was a knight he would be in a condition to assert his authority he thought and of knighthood both he and ralf percy felt almost certain in that wholesale dubbing of knights that was wont to be the preliminary of a battle  to be sure they had indulged in a good many unlicensed pleasures at parisralf from sheer reckless love of sport malcolm in his endeavour to forget himself and to be manly but they had escaped detection and they knew plenty of young englishmen and many more burgundians and gascons who had plunged far deeper into mischief and thought it no disgrace but rather held that there was some special dispensation for the benefit of warriors  malcolm and ralf were riding with a party of these young men  king henry had consented to make his first days journey as far as corbeil in a litter since only there he was to meet the larger number of his troops whom bedford and warwick were assembling  james was riding close beside him with his immediate attendants and the two youths not being needed had joined their comrades with the advanced guard of the escort  it was always a fiction maintained by henry that he was marching in a friendly country plunder was strictly forbidden and everything was to be paid for but unfortunately the peasantry on his way never realized this and the soldiery often took care they should not  therefore when the advanced guard came to the village that had been marked out for their halt instead of finding provisions and forage to be purchased they met with only bare walls and a few stray cats and while storming and raving between hunger and disappointment a report came from somewhere that the inhabitants had fled and driven off their cattle to another village some four miles off in the woods on the heights above  of course they must be taught reason  it was true that the menatarms who were under the command of sir christopher kitson and sir william trenton were obliged to abide where they were much as kitson growled at being unable to procure a draught of wine for trenton whom he had been nursing for weeks under intermitting fever caught at meaux but the young gentlemen were well pleased to show themselves under no yorkshiremans orders and galloped off en masse to procure refreshment for their horses and themselves further stimulated by the report that the armagnacs had left a sick man behind them there who might be a valuable prisoner  by and by a woodland path brought the disorderly party about forty in number including their servants and the ruffians who always followed whenever plunder was to be scented out upon a pretty french village of the better class built round a green shaded with chestnuts under which sure enough were haycarts cows sheep and goats and their owners taking refuge in a place thought to be out of the track of the invaders  here were the malicious defrauders of the hungry warriors  down upon them flew the angry foragers  soon the pretty tranquil scene was ringing with the oaths of the plundering and the cries of the plundered the cattle were being driven off the houses and farmyards rifled blood was flowing and what could not be carried off was burning  the search for the armagnac prisoner had however relaxed after the first inquiry and malcolm surprised that this had been forgotten suddenly bethought him of the distinction he should secure by sending a valuable prize to esclairmondes feet  he seized on an old man who had not been able to fly and stood trembling and panting in a corner and demanded where the sick man was  the old man pointed to a farmhouse round which clouds of smoke were rolling and malcolm hurried into it shouting dog of an armagnac come out  yield ere thou be burnt  no answer and he dashed forward  in the lower room was a sight that opened his eyes with horrorno other than the shield of drummond with the three wavy lines ay and with it the helmet and suit of armour whereof he knew each buckle and brace  patie  patrick  patrick drummond he wildly shouted are you there  no answer and seeing through the smoke a stair he rushed up  there in an upper room on a bed lay a senseless form suffocated perhaps by the smoke but unmistakably his cousin  he called to him seized him shook him dragged him out of bed all in vain there was no sign of animation the fire was gaining on the house malcolms own breath was failing and his frenzied efforts to carry patricks almost giant form to the stairs were quite unavailing  wild with horror he flew shouting downstairs to call halbert whom he had left with his horse but neither halbert nor horse was in sight nor indeed any of the party  not a man was in sight except a few hurrying far out of reach as if something had alarmed them he wrung his hands in anguish and was about to make another attempt to drag patrick down from the already burning house when suddenly a troop of horse was among the scene of desolation and at their head king james himself  malcolm flew to the king cutting short his angry exclamation with the cry help help he will burn  patrick  patie drummond there  james had scarce gathered the sense of the words ere leaping from his horse he bounded up the stairs through the smoke amid flakes of burning thatch falling from the roof groped in the dense clouds of smoke for the senseless weight and holding the shoulders while malcolm held the feet they sped down the stair and rested not till they had laid him under a chestnut tree out of reach of the crash of the house which fell in almost instantly  does he live gasped malcolm  he will not said the king if his nation be known here  keep out of his sight  he must hear only french  remembering how inexorably henry hung every scotch prisoner malcolms heart sank  this was why no one had sought the prisoner  a scot was not available for ransom  should he be the murderer of his cousin lilys love  meantime james hurriedly explained to kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy summoned sir nigel to his side closed his own visor and called for water then hung over the prisoner anxious to prevent the first word from being broad scotch  in the free air some long sobs showed that patrick was struggling back to life and james at once said rendez vous messire but he neither answered nor was there meaning in his eyes  and james perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs and that his right shoulder was dislocated and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when malcolm had grasped him by the arms  he swooned again at the first attempt to lift him and a haycart having been left in the flight of the marauders he was laid in it and covered with the kings cloak to be conveyed to corbeil where james trusted to secure his life by personal intercession with henry  he groaned heavily several times but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way and james and sir nigel kept on either side of the cart ready to address him in french the first moment having told the english that he was a prisoner of quality who must be carefully conveyed to king jamess tent at corbeil  malcolm was not allowed to approach lest he should be recognized and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense with very different feelings towards patrick than those with which he had of late thought of him or of his own promises  if patrick died through this plundering raid how should he ever face lily  it was nearly night ere they reached corbeil where the tents were pitched outside the little town  james committed his captive to the prudent care of old baird bidding him send for a french or burgundian surgeon unable to detect the scottish tongue and then taking malcolm with him he crossed the square in the centre of the camp to the royal pavilion opposite to which his own was pitched  it was a sultry night and henry had insisted on sleeping in his tent declaring himself sick of stone walls and as they approached his voice could be heard in brief excited sentences giving orders and asking for the king of scots  here sir said james stopping in where the curtain was looped up and showed king henry half sitting half lying on a couch of cushions and deerskins his eyes full of fire his thin face flushed with deep colour bedford march warwick and salisbury in attendance  ho you are late said henry  did you come up with the caitiff robbers  they made off as we rode up  the village was already burnt  who were they  i hope you hung them on the spot as i bade continued henry coughing between his sentences and almost in spite of himself putting his hand to his side  i was delayed  there was a life to save a gentleman who lay sick and stifled in a burning house  and what was it to you cried henry angrily if a dozen rebel armagnacs were fried alive when i sent you to hinder my men from growing mere thieves  gentleman forsooth  one would think it the dauphin himself or mayhap buchan  ha it is a scot then  yes sir said james sir patrick drummond a good knight hurt and helpless for whom i entreat your grace  you disobeyed me to spare a scot burst forth henry  you who call yourself a captain of mine and who know my will  he hangs instantly  harry bethink yourself  this is no captive taken in battle  he is a sick man left behind sorely hurt  then wherefore must you be meddling instead of letting him burn as he deserved and heeding what you undertook for me  i will have none of your traitor ruffians here  since you have brought him in the halter for himhere ralf percy tell the provostmarshal  he was interrupted for james unbuckled his sword and tendered it to him  king harry he said gravely this morning i was your friend and brotherinarms now i am your captive  hang patrick drummond who aided me at meaux in saving my honour and such freedom as i have and i return to any prison you please and never strike blow for you again  take back your sword said henry  what folly is this  you knew that i count not your rebel subjects as prisoners of war  i did not know that i was saving a defenceless man from the flames to be used like a dog  i never offered my arm to serve a savage tyrant  take your sword reiterated henry his passion giving way before jamess steady calmness  we will look into it tomorrow but it was no soldierly act to take advantage of my weariness to let my commands be broken the first day of taking the field and bring the caitiff here  we will leave him for the night i say  take up your sword  not till i am sure of my liegemans life said james  no threats sir  i will make no promise said henry haughtily but the words died away in a racking cough  and bedford laying his hand on jamess arm said he is fevered and weary  fret him no longer but take your sword and get your fellow out of the camp  james was too much hurt to make a compromise  no he said unless your brother freely spares the life of a man thus taken i must be his prisonerbut his soldier never  he left the tent followed by malcolm in an agony of despair and self reproach  henrys morning decisions were not apt to vary from his evening ones there was a terrible implacability about him at times and he had never ceased to visit his brother of clarences death upon the scots on the plea that they were in arms against their king  even bedford obviously thought that the prisoner would be safest out of his reach and this could hardly be accomplished since patrick had been placed in jamess tent in the very centre of the camp near the kings own  and though bedford and march might have connived at his being taken away yet the mass of the soldiery would if they detected a scot being smuggled away into the town have been persuaded that king james was acting treacherously  besides the captive himself proved to be so exhausted that to transport him any further in his present state would have been almost certainly fatal  a barber surgeon from corbeil had been fetched and was dealing with the injuries which had apparently been the effect of a fall some days previously probably when on his way to join the french army at cosne and the first fever of these hurts had no doubt been aggravated by the adventures of the day  at any rate patrick lay unconscious or only from time to time groaning or murmuring a few words sometimes french sometimes scotch  malcolm would have fallen on his knees by his side and striven to win a word or a look but james forcibly withheld him  if you roused him into loud ravings in our own tongue all hope of saving him would be gone he said  shall we  oh can we cried malcolm catching at the mere word hope  i only know said the king that unless we do so by harrys goodwill i will never serve under him again  and if he persists in his cruelty  then must some means be found of carrying drummond into corbeil  it will go hard with me but he shall be saved malcolm  but this whole army is against a scot and harrys eye is everywhere and his fierceness unrelenting  malcolm this is bondage  may god and st andrew aid us  when the king came to saying that it was plain he deemed the case past all other aid  malcolms misery was great  the very sight of patrick had made a mighty revulsion in his feelings  the almost forgotten associations of glenuskie were revived the forms of his guardian and of lily came before him as he heard familiar names and phrases in the dear home accent fall from the fevered lips  coldingham rose up before him and st abbs with lily watching on the rocks for tidings of her knighther knight to whom her brother had once promised to resign all his lands and honours but who now lay captured by plunderers among whom that brother made one and in peril of a shameful death  oh far better die in his stead than return to lily with tidings such as these  was this retribution for his broken purpose and for having fallen away not merely into secular life but into sins that stood between him and religious rites  the king had called st andrew to aid  must a proof of repentance and change be given ere that aid would come  should he vow himself again to the cloister yield up the hope of esclairmonde and devote himself for patricks sake  could he ever be happy with patrick dead and esclairmonde driven and harassed into being his wife  were it not better to vow at once that so his cousin were spared he would return to his old purposes  almost had he uttered the vow when tugging hard at his heart came the vision of esclairmondes loveliness and he felt it beyond his strength to resign her voluntarily besides how madame of hainault and monseigneur de therouenne would deride his uncertainties and how intolerable it would be to leave esclairmonde to fall into the hands of boemond of burgundy  such a renunciation could not be made he did not even know that patricks safety depended on it and instead of that he promised with great fervency of devotion that if st andrew would save patrick drummond and bring about the two marriages a most splendid monastery for educational purposes such as the king so much wished to found should be his reward  it should be in honour of st andrew and should be endowed with esclairmondes wealth which would be quite ample enough both for this and for a noble portion for lily  surely st andrew must accept such a vow and spare patrick  so malcolm tried to pacify an anguish of suspense that would not be pacified     chapter xii the last pilgrimage   the summer morning came the reveille sounded mass was sung in the chapel tent without which henry never moved and malcolm tried to reassure his sinking heart by there pledging his vow to st andrew  the english king was not present but the troops were drawing up in complete array that he might inspect them before the march  and a glorious array they were of steelclad menatarms on horseback in bands around their leaders banner and of ranks of sturdy archers with their longbows in leathern cases the orderly multitude stretching as far as the eye could reach glittering in the early sun and waiting with bold and glad hearts to greet the muchloved king who had always led them to victory  the only unarmed knight was james of scotland  he stood in the space beside the standard of england in his plain suit of chamois leather his crimson cloak over his shoulder but with no weapon about him waiting with crossed arms for the mornings decision  close outside the royal tent waited henrys horse and those of his brother and other immediate attendants and after a short interval the king came forth in his brightest armour with the coronal on his helmet and the beaver up and as he mounted not without considerable aid enthusiastic shouts of long live king harry broke forth and came echoing back and back from troop to troop gathering fervour as they rose  the king rode forward towards the standard but while yet the shouts were pealing from the army be suddenly caught at his saddlebow reeled visibly and would have fallen before bedford could bring his horse to his side had not james sprung forward and laid one arm round him and a hand on his rein  it is nothing said henry  let me alone  ere the words were finished he put his hand to his side dropped his bridle and gasped while a look of intense suffering passed over his features and he was passive while his horse was led back to the tent and he was lifted down and placed on the couch he had just quitted  loose my belt he gasped then trying to smile percy has strained it three holes tighter  alas though it was indeed thus drawn in his armour was hanging on him like the shell of a last years nut  they released him from it and he lay against the cushions with short painful respiration and frequent cough  you must go on with the men at once john he said  i will but be blooded and follow in the litter  warwick and salisbury began bedford  no no peremptorily gasped henry  it must be you or i i would but this stitch in the side catches me so that i can neither ride nor speak go instantly  you know what i have ordered  ill be up with you ere the battle  he brooked no resistance  his impatience and with it the oppression and pain only grew by remonstrance and bedford was forced to obey the command to go himself and leave no one he could help behind him  you will stay at least said john in his distress turning to the scottish king  i must said james  you hold not your wrath said bedford  it will madden me to leave him to any save you in this stress  some are dull some he will not heed  i will tend him like yourself john said the scot taking his hand do what he may harry is harry still  hasten to your command john he will be calmer when you are gone  bedford groaned  it was hard to leave his brother at a moment when he must be more than himselfbecome general of an army with a battle imminent but he was under dire necessity and forced himself to listen to and gather the import of the few terse orders and directions that henry breathless as he was rendered clear and trenchant as ever  the king almost drove his brother away at last while a barber was taking a copious stream of blood from him and as the army had already been set in motion a great stillness soon prevailed no one being left save a small escort and part of the kings own immediate household for henry had himself ordered away montagu his chamberlain percy and almost all on whom his eyes fell  the bleeding relieved him he breathed less tightly but became deadly pale and sank into a doze of extreme exhaustion  who is here he said awakening  some drink  what you jamie  you that were on fire to see a stricken field  not so much as to see you better at ease said james  i am better said henry  i could move now and i must  this tent will stifle me by noon  you will not go forward  no ill go back  a sick man is best with his wife  and i can battle it no further nor grudge the glory of the day to john  he deserves it  the irascible sharpness had passed from his voice and manner and given place to a certain languid cheerfulness as arrangements were made for his return to vincennes  there proved to be a large and commodious barge in which the transit could be effected on the river with less of discomfort than in the springless horse litter by which he had travelled the day before and this was at once prepared  malcolm had meanwhile remained as in duty bound in attendance on his king  james had found time to enjoin him to stay being to say the truth unwilling to trust one so inexperienced and fragile in the melee without himself nor indeed would this have been a becoming moment for him to put himself forward to win his spurs in the english cause  nothing had passed about patrick drummond nor the high words of last night  henry seemed to have forgotten them between his bodily suffering and the anxiety of being forced to relinquish the command just before a battle and james would have felt it ungenerous to harass him at such a moment when absolutely committed to his charge  for the present there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority since the king had promised to take cognizance of the case and the chief danger was from his chance discovery by some lawless manat arms who would think himself doing good service by killing a concealed scot under any circumstances  drummond himself after his delirious night had sunk into a heavy sleep and the king thought the best hope for him would be to remain under the care of sir nigel baird for the present until he could obtain favour for him from henry and could send back orders from vincennes  he would not leave malcolm to share the care of him declaring that the canny sir nigel would have quite enough to do in averting suspicion without him and besides he needed malcolm himself in the scarcity of attendants who had any tenderness or dexterity of hand to wait upon the suffering king  henry had rallied enough to walk down to the river leaning upon james and he smiled thanks when he was assisted by trenton and kitson to lie along on cushions  so my yorkshire knights he said tis you that have had to stop from the battle to watch a sick man home  ay sir said sir christopher i did it with the better will that trenton here has not been his own man since the fever and twere no fair play in the matter your grace wets of did i go into battle whole and sound and he sick and sorry  henrys look of amusement brightened him into his old self as he said honester guards could i scarce have good friend  at that moment after a nudge or two from trenton kitson and he came suddenly down on their knees with an impetus that must have tried the boards of the bottom of the barge  sir said kitson always the spokesman we have a grace to ask of you  say on said henry  any boon save the letting you cut one anothers throats  no sir  will trentons scarce my match now mores the pity and moreover weve lost the good will to it we once had  no sir twas license to go a pilgrimage  on pilgrimage  ay sir to yon shrine at breuilst fiacres as they call him  some of our rogues pillaged his shrine as you know sir and those that know these parts best say he was a scottish hermit and bears malice like a scot saint though he be and that your sickness my lord is all along of that  so we two have vowed to go barefoot there for your healing my liege if so be we have your license  and welcome with my best thanks good friends said henry exerting himself to lean forward and give his hand to their kiss  then as they fell back into their places with a few inarticulate blessings and assurances that they only wished they could go to rome or to jerusalem if it would restore their king henry said smiling as he looked at james scotsmen here there and everywherein heaven as well as earth what was it last night about a scot that moved thine ire jamie  didst not tender me thy sword  by my faith thou hast it not  what was the rub  james now told the story in its fulness  how he had met sir patrick drummond at glenuskie how afterwards the knight had stood by him in the encounter at meaux and how it had been impossible to leave him senseless to the flames and how he had trusted that a capture made thus accidentally of a helpless man would not fall under henrys strict rules against accepting scottish prisoners  hm said henry it must be as you will only i trust to you not to let him loose on us either here or on the border  take back your sword jamie  if i spoke over hotly last nighta man hardly knows what he says when he has a goad in the sideyou forgive it jamie and as the scots king with the dew in his eyes wrung his hand he added anxiously your sword  what not here  heres mine  which is it  then as james handed it to him ay i would fain you wore it  tis the sword of my knighthood when poor king richard dubbed me in ireland and many a brave scheme came with it  the soft movement of the barge upon the water had a soothing influence and he was certainly in a less suffering state though silent and dreamy as he lay half raised on cushions under an awning james anxiously watching over him and malcolm with a few other attendants near at hand stout bargemen propelling the craft and the guard keeping along the bank of the river  his thoughts were perhaps with the battle for presently he looked up and murmured the verse     i had a dream a weary dream       ayont the isle of skye    i saw a dead man win a fight       and i think that man was i  that stave keeps ringing in my brain nor can i tell where or when i have heard it  tis from the scottish ballad that sings of the fight of otterburn said james i brought it with me from scotland  and got little thanks for your pains said henry smiling  but methinks since no percy is in the way i would hear it again there was true knighthood in the douglas that died there  jamess harp was never far off and again his mellow voice went through that gallant and plaintive strain though in a far more subdued manner than the first time he had sung it and henry weakened and softened actually dropped a brave mans tear at the bracken bush upon the lily lea and the hero who lay there  that i should weep for a douglas he said half laughing but the hearts of all honest men lie near together on whatever side they draw their swords  god have mercy on whosoever may fall tomorrow  i trow jamie thou couldst not sing that rough rhyme of agincourt  i was bashful and ungracious enough to loathe the very sound of it when i came home in my pride of youth but i would lief hear it once more  or stayyorkshiremen always have voices and raising his tone he unspeakably gratified trenton and kitson by the request and their voices deep and powerful and not uncultivated poured forth the lay of agincourt to the waves of the french river and to its mighty victor     our king went forth to normandye  long and lengthily chanted was the triumphant song with the latin choruses which were echoed back by the escort on the bank while henry lay listening and musing and malcolm had time for many a thought and impulse  patricks life was granted although it had been promised too late to send the intelligence back to the tent at corbeil  so far the purpose of his vow to st andrew had been accomplished but with the probability that he should soon again be associated with patrick came the sense of the failure in purpose and in promise  patrick would not reproach him he well knewnay would rejoice in the change but even this certainty galled him and made him dread his cousins presence as likely to bring him a sense of shame  what would patrick think of his letting a lady be absolutely compelled to marry him  might he not say it was the part of walter stewart over again  indeed malcolm remembered how carefully king james was prevented from hearing the means by which the countess intended to make the lady his own and a sensation came over him that it was profanation to call on st andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means  why was it that as his eyes fell on the face of king henry the whole world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring and a sentence he had once heard esclairmonde quote would come to him constantly my son think not to buy off god  it is thyself that he requires not thy gifts  but the long lay of victory was over and king henry had roused himself to thank the singers then sighed and said how long ago that was  six years said james  the whole space from the hope and pride of youth to the care and toil of eld said henry  your scots made an old man of me the day they slew thomas  yet that has been your sole mishap said james  yea truly  but thenceforth i have learnt that the road to jerusalem is not so straight and plain as i deemed it when i stood victorious at agincourt  the church one againthe holy sepulchre redeemed  it seemed then before my eyes and that i was the man called to do it  so it may be yet said james  sickness alters everything and raises mountains before us  it may be so said henry and yetjerusalem  jerusalem  it was my fathers cry it was king edwards cry it was st louis cry and yet they never got there  st louis was far on his way said james  ay he never turned aside said henry sighing and moving restlessly and wearily with something of returning fever     o bona patria lumina sobria te speculantur  boy are you there as in turning his eye fell on malcolm  take warning the straight road is the best  you see i have never come to jerusalem  then again he murmured     hic breve vivitur hic breve plangitur hic breve fletur    non breve vivere non breve plangere retribuetur  and james seeing that nothing lulled him like song offered to sing that mysteriously beautiful rhythm of bernard of morlaix  ay prithee do so said henry  theres a rest there when the agincourt lay rings hollow  well there is a jerusalem where our shortcomings are made up only the straight waythe straight way  malcolm took his part with james in singing the rhythm which he had learnt long ago at coldingham and which thus in every note brought back the vanished aspirations and selfdedication to the straight way  for such an original purpose of selfdevotion must ever benot of course exclusively to the monastic life but whoever lowers his aims of serving god under any worldly inducement is deviating from the straight way and thought malcolm if king harry feels agincourt an empty word beside the song of sion must not all i have sought for be a very vanity  sometimes dozing but sometimes restless and with the pain of breathing constantly increasing on him henry wore through the greater part of the day upon the river until it was necessary to land and be taken through the forest in his litter  he was now obliged to be lifted from the barge and his weariness rendered the conveyance very distressing save that his patient smile never faded and still he said all will be well when i come to my kate  alas when the gates were reached james hardly knew how to tell him that the queen had gone that morning to paris with her mother  yet still he was cheerful  if the physicians deal hard with me he said it will be well that she should not be here till the worst is over  the physicians were there  a messenger had gone direct from corbeil to summon them and henry delivered himself up into their hands to fight out the battle with disease as he had set himself to fight out many another battle in his time  a sharp conflict it wasbetween a keen and aggravated disease apparently pleurisy coming upon pulmonary affection of long standing and a strong and resolute nature unquenched by suffering and backed by the violent remedies of a halfinstructed period  those who watched him and strove to fulfil the directions of the physicians hardly marked the lapse of hours even though more than one day and night had passed ere in the early twilight of a long summers morn he sank into a sleep his face still distressed but less acutely and his breath heavy and labouring though without the severe pain  the watchers felt that here might be the turning point and stood or sat around not daring to change their postures or utter the slightest word suddenly james who stood nearest leaning against the wall with his eyes fixed on the face of the sleeper was aware of a hand on his shoulder and looking round saw in the now full light bedfords faceso pale haggard and replete with anxiety so dusty and travelstained that henry awakening at that moment exclaimed ha john  and as his brother was slow to replyhas the day gone against thee  how was it never fear to speak brother thou art safe and i know thou hast done valiantly  valour is never lost whether in defeat or success  speak john  take it not so much to heart  there has been no battle harry said bedford gathering voice with difficulty  the dauphin would not abide our coming but broke up his camp  beshrew thee man said henry but i thought thou wast just off a flight  dost think one can ride fast only for a flight said bedford  ah would that it had been the loss of ten battles rather than this  and he fell on his knees grasping henrys hand and hiding his face against the bed with the same instinct of turning to him for comfort with which the young motherless children of henry of bolingbroke when turned adrift among the rude beaufort progeny of john of gaunt had clung to their eldest brother and found tenderness in his love and protection in his fearlessness so that few royal brethren ever loved better than henry and john of lancaster  it was well and kindly done john said henry and thou hast come at a good time for thanks be to god the pain hath left me and if it were not for this burthen of heaviness and weariness i should be more at ease than i have been for many weeks  but as he spoke there was that both in his face and voice that chilled with a dread certainty the hearts of those who hung over him  is my wife come  i could see her now he wistfully asked  alas no  sir lewis robsart the knight attached to her service faltered with a certain shame and difficulty that the queen would come when her orisons at notre dame were performed  it was his last disappointment but still he bore it cheerily  best he said  my fair one was not made for sights like this and were she herehis lip trembledi might bear me less as a christian man should  my sweet catherine  take care of her john she will be the most desolate being in the world  john promised with all his heart though pity for coldhearted catherine was not the predominant feeling there  i would i had seen my childs face and blessed him continued henry poor boy  i would have him warwicks charge  warwick is waiting admission said bedford  he and salisbury and exeter rode with me  the kings face lighted up with joy as he heard this  it is good for a man to have his friends about him he said and as they entered he held out his hand to them and thanked them  then took place the wellknown scene when looking back on his career he pronounced it to have been his endeavour to serve god and his people and declared himself ready to face death fearlessly since such was the will of his maker grieving only for the infancy of his son but placing his hope and comfort in his brother john and commending the babe to the fatherly charge of warwick  you cannot love him for his own sake as yet but if you think you owe me aught repay it to him  and as he thought over the fate of other infant kings he spoke of some having hated the father and loved the child others who had loved the father and hated the child  to humfrey of gloucester he sent stringent warnings against giving way to his hot and fiery nature offending burgundy or rushing into a doubtful wedlock with jaqueline of hainault speaking of him with an elder brothers fatherly affection but turning ever to john of bedford with full trust and reliance as one likeminded and able to carry out all his intentions  for the french prisoners they might not be released lest more fire be kindled in one day than can be quenched in three  and for you jamie he said affectionately holding out his hand my friend my brotherinarms i must say the same as ever  pardon me jamie but i have not kept you out of malice such as man must needs renounce on his deathbed  i trust to john and to the rest for giving you freedom at such time as you can safely return to be such a king indeed as we have ever hoped to be  do you pardon me james for this as for any harshness or rudeness you may have suffered from me  james with full heart murmured out his ardent love his sense that no captive had ever been so generously treated as he  and you my young lord said henry looking towards malcolm whose light touch and tender hands had made him a welcome attendant in the illness i have many a kind service to thank you for  and i believe i mightily angered you once but boy rememberay and you too ralf percythat he is your friend who turns you back from things sore to remember in a case like mine  after these and other calm collected farewells henry required to know from his physicians how long his time might yet be  there was hesitation in answering plainly as they saw that mortification had set in  what he said do ye think i have faced death so many times to fear it now  then came the reply given by the weeping kneeling physician sir think of your soul for without a miracle you cannot live two hours  the king beckoned his confessor and his friends retired to return again to take their part in the last rites the viaticum and unction  henry was collected and alive to all that was passing responding duly and evidently entering deeply into the devotions that were to aid his spirit in that awful passage his face gravely set but firm and fearless as ever  the ceremonial ended he was still sensible though with little power of voice or motion left but the tone though low was steady as ever when he asked for the penitential psalms  still they doubted whether he were following them for his eyes closed and his lips ceased to move until as they chanted the revival note of davids mournful penanceo be favourable and gracious unto sion build thou the walls of jerusalemat that muchloved word the light of the blue eyes once more beamed out and he spoke again  jerusalem  on the faith of a dying king it was my earnest purpose to have composed matters here into peace and union and so to have delivered jerusalem  but the will of god be done since he saw me unworthy  then his eyes closed again he slept or seemed to sleep and then a strange quivering came over the face the lips moved again and the words broke from them thou liest foul spirit thou liest but as though the parting soul had gained the victory in that conflict peace came down on the wasted features and with the very words of his redeemer himself into thy hands i commend my spirit he did indeed fall asleep the mighty soul passed from the wornout frame     chapter xiii the ring and the empty throne   no one knows how great a tree has been till it has fallen nor how large a space a mighty man has occupied till he is removed  king henry v left his friends and foes alike almost dizzy as in place of his grand figure they found a blank instead of the hand whose force they had constantly felt mere emptiness  malcolm of glenuskie who had been asserting constantly that king henry was no master of his and had no rights over him had nevertheless for the last year or more been among those to whom the kings will was the moving spring fixing the disposal of almost every hour and making everything dependent thereon  when the deathhush was broken by the depart o christian soul and bedford with a face white and set like a statue stood up from his knees and crossed and kissed the still white brow it was to malcolm as if the whole universe had become as nothing  to him there remained only the great god the heavenly jerusalem into which the king had entered and himself far off from the straight way wandering from his promise and his purpose into what seemed to him a mere hollow painted scene such as came and went in the midst of a banquet  or again it was the grisly dance of death that was the only reality death had clutched the mightiest in the ring  whom would he clutch next  he stood motionless as one in a dream or rather as if not knowing which was reality and which phantom gazing gazing on at the bed where the king lay round which the ecclesiastics were busying themselves unperceiving that james bedford and the nobles had quitted the apartment till percy first spoke to him in a whisper then almost shook him and led him out of the room  i am sent for you he said in a much shaken voice your king says you can be of use  then tightening his grasp with the force of intense grief oh what a day what a day my father my father  i never knew mine own father  but he has been all to harry and to me  oh woe worth the day  and dropping into a window seat he covered his face with his hands and gave way to his grief pointing however to the councilroom where malcolm found bedford writing at the table king james and a few others engaged in the same manner  a few words from james informed him or would have done so if he could have understood that the duke of bedford on whom at that terrible moment the weight of two kingdoms and of the war had descended could not pause to rest or to grieve till letters and orders had been sent to the council in england and to every garrison every ally in france to guard against any sudden panic or faltering in friendship to england and her infant heir  warwick and salisbury were already riding post haste to take charge of the army robsart was gone to the queen exeter to the duke of burgundy and as the clergy were all engaged with the tendance of the royal corpse there was scarcely any one to lessen the dukes toil james knowing malcolms pen to be ready had sent for him to assist in copying the brief scrolls addressed to each captain of a fortress or town announcing the fathers death and commanding him to do his duty to the sonking harry vi  each was then to be signed by the duke and despatched by menatarms who waited for the purpose  like men stunned the halfdozen who sat at the counciltable worked on never daring to glance at the empty chair at the upper end  the only words that passed were occasional inquiries of and orders from bedford and these he spoke with a strange alertness and metallic ring in his voice as though the words were uttered by mechanism yet in themselves they were as clear and judicious as possible as if coming from a mind wound up exclusively to the one necessary object and the facethough flushed at first and gradually growing paler with knitted brows and compressed lipsbetrayed no sign of emotion  hours passed he wrote he ordered he signed he sealed he mentioned name after name of place and officer never moving or looking up  and james who knew from salisbury that he had neither slept nor eaten since sixty miles off he had met a worse report of his brother watched him anxiously till when evening began to fall he murmured there is the captain ofofatbutthe pen slipped from his fingers and he said i can no more  the overtaxed powers strained so longmind memory and allwere giving way under the mere force of excessive fatigue  he rose from his seat but stumbled like one blind as james upheld him and led him away to the nearest bedchamber where almost while the attendants divested him of the heavy boots and cuirass he had never paused all these hours to remove he dropped into a sleep of sheer exhaustion  james who was likewise wearied out with watching turned towards his own quarters but in so doing he could not but turn aside to the chapel where before the altar had been laid all that was left of king henry there he lay his hands clasped over a crucifix clad in the same rich green and crimson robes in which he had ridden to meet his queen at vincennes but three short months before the golden circlet from his helmet was on his head but it could not give additional majesty to the still and severe sweetness of his grand and pure countenance so youthful in the lofty power that high aspirations had imprinted on it yet so intensely calm in its marble rest more than ever with the look of the avenging unpitying angel  to james it was chiefly the face of the man whom he had best loved and admired in spite of their strange connection but to malcolm who had as usual followed him closely it was verily a look from the invisible worlda look of awful warning and reproof almost as if the pale set lips were unclosing to demand of him where he was in the valley of shadows through which the way lay to jerusalem  if henry had turned back and warned him at the gate of the heavenly sion surely such would have been his countenance and malcolm when like james he had sprinkled the holy water on the white brow and crossed himself while the low chant of psalms from kneeling priests went up around himclasped his two hands close together and breathed forth the words oh i have wandered far  o great king i will never leave the straight way again  i will cast aside all worldly aims  o god and the saints help me not to lose my way again  he would have tarried on still in the fascination of that wonderful unearthly countenance and in the inertness of faculties stunned by fatigue and excitement but james summoned him by a touch and he again followed him  o sir he began when they had turned away i repent me of my falling away to the world  i give all up  let me back to my vows of old  we will talk of that another time said james gravely  neither you nor i malcolm can think reasonably under such a blow as this and i forbid you rashly to bind yourself  sir sir cried malcolm petulantly  you took me from the straight way  you shall not hinder my return  i hinder no true purpose said king james  i only hinder another rash and hasty pledge to be felt as a fetter or left broken on your conscience  silence now  when men are sad and spent they cannot speak as befits them and had best hold their peace  these words were spoken on the way up the stair that led to the apartments of the king of scots  on opening the door of the larger room the first thing they saw was the tall figure of a distinguishedlooking knight who as they entered flung himself at king jamess feet fervently exclaiming o my liege accept my homage  never was vassal so bound to his lord by thankfulness for his life and for far more than his life  sir patrick drummond i am glad to see you better at ease said james nay suffer me he added giving his hand to raise the knight but finding it grasped and kissed with passionate devotion almost overpowering the only halfrecovered knight so that james was forced to use strength to support him and would at once have lifted him up but the warmhearted patrick resisted almost sobbing outnay sir king of my heart indeed let me first thank you  i knew not how much more i owed you than the poor life you savedmy fathers rescue and that of all that was most dear  speak of such things seated my good friend said james trying to raise him but drummond still did not second his efforts  i have not given my parole of honour as the captive whose life is again due to you  you must give that to the duke of bedford sir patrick said james  i know not if i am to be put into ward myself  in any case you are safe by the good kings grace so you pledge yourself to draw no sword against england in scotland or france till ransom be accepted for you  alack said patrick i have neither sword nor ransom  i would i knew what was to be done with the life you have given me my lord  i will find a use for it never fear said james sadly but kindly be my knight for the present till better days come for us both  with my whole heart said patrick fervently  yours am i for ever my liege  then my first command is that you should rise and rest said james assisting the knight to regain his feet and placing him in the only chair in the room  you must become a whole man as soon as may be  for patricks arm was in a sling and evidently still painful and useless and he sank back breathless and unresisting like one who had by no means regained perfect health while his handsome features looked worn and pale  i fear me said james as the two cousins silently shook hands that you have moved over soonyou surely had my message bairdsbrae  oh yes my lord replied baird but the lad was the harder to hold and after the fever was gone we deemed he could well brook the journey by water  twas time i was here to guide ye too my lord you and the callant baith look sair forfaughten  we have had a sad time of it nigel said james with trembling lip  and if brewster tells me right yeve not tasted food the whole day said nigel laying an authoritative hand on his royal pupil  nay sit ye down here come the varlets with the meal i bade them have ready  james passively yielded courteously signing to the others to share the food that was spread on a table and with the same scarcely conscious grace making inquiries which elicited that patrick drummonds hurts had been caused by his horse falling and rolling over with him whilst with sir john swinton and other scottish knights he was reconnoitring the line of the english march  he was too much injured to be taken back to the far distant camp and had accordingly been intrusted to the french farmer with no attendant but a young french horseboy since he was too poor to keep a squire  he knew nothing more for fever had run high and he had not even been sensible of his desertion by his french hosts on the approach of the english far less of the fire and of his rescue by the king and malcolm but for this he seemed inclined to compensate to the utmost by the intense eagerness of devotion with which he regarded james who sat meanwhile crushed down by the weight of his own grief  i can eat no more baird said he swallowing down a draught of wine and pushing aside his trencher  your license gentlemen  i must be alone  take care of the lads nigel  malcolm is spent too  his deft service was welcome toto my dearest brother  and though he hastily shut himself into his own inner chamber it was not till they had seen that his grief was becoming uncontrollable  patrick could not but murmur dearest brother  ay like brothers they loved said baird gravely  a strange brotherhood began drummond  but malcolm cried with much agitation not a word patie  you know not what you say  take heed of profaning the name of one who is gone to the sion above  you turned english our wee malcolm exclaimed drummond in amaze  there is no english french or scot where he is gone cried malcolm no babel  o patie i have been far fallen  i have done you in heart a grievous wrong but if i have turned back in time it is his doing that lies there  his what harry of lancasters demanded the bewildered patrick  what had he to do with you  he has been my only true friend here cried malcolm  oh if my hand be free from actual spoil and bloodshed it was his doing  oh that he could hear me bless him for the chastisement i took so bitterly  chastisement demanded patrick  the english king dared chastise you of scots blood royal  tis well he is dead  the laddies wellnigh beside himself said baird  but he speaks true  this king whom heaven assolizie kept a tight hand over the youngsters and falling on lord malcolm and some other callants making free with a house at meaux dealt some blows of which my young lord found it hard to stomach his share though i am glad to see he is come to a better mind  ay tis pity of this king harry  brave and leal was he never spake an untrue word never turned eye for fear nor foot for weariness nor hand for toil nor nose for ill savour  a man look you to be trusted never failing his word for good or ill  right little love has there been between him and me but i could weep like my own lad in there to think i shall never see that knightly presence more nor hear those frank gladsome voices of the boys as they used to shout up and down windsor forest  you too sir nigel and with a king like ours  ay sir patrick and if he be such a king as scotland never had since st david and maybe not then im free to own as much of it is due to king harry as to his own noble selfdid ye say they had streekit him in the chapel lord malcolm  id fain look on the bonnie face of him ill neer look on his like again  no sooner had old bairdsbrae gone than malcolm flung himself down before his cousin crying oh patrick you will hear me  i cannot rest till you know how changed i have been  changed said patrick ay and for the better  why malcolm i never durst hope to see you so sturdy and so heartsome  my father would have been blithe to see you such a gallant young squire  even the halt is gone  nearly said malcolm  but i would fain be puny and puling to have the clear heart that once i had  oh hear me hear me and pardon me patie  and malcolm in his agitation poured forth the whole story of his having shifted from his old cherished purpose of devoting himself to the service of heaven and leaving lands and vassals to the stronger hands of patrick and lilias how having thus given himself to the world he had fallen into temptation how he had let himself be led to persecute with his suit a noble lady vowed like himself how he had almost agreed to marry her by force and how he had been running into the ordinary dissipations of the camp abstaining from confession avoiding mass disobeying orders plunging into scenes of plunder till he had almost been the death of patrick whom he had already so cruelly wronged  so felt the boy  fresh from that deathbed the evils his conscience had protested against from the first appeared to him frightfully heinous and his anguish of selfreproach was such that patrick listened in the greatest anxiety lest he should hear of some deadly stain on his young kinsmans scutcheon but when the tale was told and he had demanded is that all and found that no further overt act was alleged against malcolm he breathed a long sigh and muttered you daft laddie you had fairly startled me  so this is the coil is it  who ever told you to put on a cowl i should like to know  why twas what my poor father ever declared against  i take your lands  by my troth twould be enough to make me break faith with your sister if i could  the vow was in my heart faltered malcolm  in a fules head said patrick  what right have babes to be talking of vows  twould be the best tidings ive heard for many a long day that you were wedded to a lass with a good tocher and fit to guide your silly pate  whats that  her vows  if they are no better than yours the sooner they are forgot the better  if she had another love twould be another matter but with a bishop on your side youve naught to fear  malcolm turned away sick at heart  to him his present position had become absolute terror  his own words had worked him up to an alarming sense of having lapsed from high aims to mere selfishness of having profaned vows consented to violence and fallen away from grace and he was in an almost feverish passion to utter something that would irrevocably bind him to his former intentions but here were the king and patrick both conspiring to silence him and hold him back to his fallen and perilous state  nay patrick even derided his penitence  patrick was an honourable knight a religious man as times went but he had been brought up in a much rougher and more unscrupulous school than malcolm and had been hardened by years of service as a soldier of fortune  the armagnac camp was not like that of england  warriors of such piety and strictness as henry and bedford had never come within his ken and that any man professing to be a soldier should hesitate at the license of war was incomprehensible to him  the discipline of henrys army had been scoffed at in the french camp and every infraction of it hailed as a token of hypocrisy and to the stout scot malcolms grief for the rapine at meaux which after all he had not committed seemed a simple absurdity  even his own danger on the second occasion did not make him alter his opinion it was all the fortune of war  and he was not sure that he had not best have been stifled at once since his hands were tied from warfare  and as for lilyhow was he to win her now  then as malcolm opened his mouth patrick sharply charged him to hold his tongue as to that folly unless he wanted to drive him to make a vow on his side that he would turn knight of rhodes and never wed  malcolm wearied out with excitement came at last to weeping that no one would hear or understand him but the scene was ended by bairdsbrae who returning brought a leech with him who at once took the command of patrick and ordered him to his bed  malcolm could not rest  he was feverish with the shock of grief and awe and absorbed in the thought which had mastered him and which was much dwelt on in the middle agesthe monastic path going towards heaven straight as a sunbeam the secular twining its way through a tortuous difficult coursethe broad way tending downward to the abyss  to his terrified apprehension he had abandoned the direct and narrow path for the fatal road and there might at any moment be captured and whirled away by the grisly phantom death who had just snatched the mightiest in his inevitable clutch and with something of the timidity of his nature he was in absolute terror until he should be able to set himself back on the shining road from which he had swerved and be rid of the load of transgression which seemed ready to sink him into the gulf  those few and perfunctory confessions to a courtly priest who knew nothing about him and was sure not to be hard on a kings cousin now seemed to add to his guilt and wandering downstairs towards the chapel he met a train of ecclesiastics slowly leaving it having just been relieved by a bevy of monks from a neighbouring convent who took up the chants where they had left them  looking up at them he recognized dr bennets bent head and throwing himself before him on his knee he gasped o father father hear me take me back  give me hope  what means this my young lord said dr bennet pausing while his brethren passed on  are you sick he added kindly seeing the whiteness of malcolms face and his startled eye  oh no no only sick at heart at my own madness and the doom on it  o sir hear me  take my vow again give me absolution once more to a true shrift  oh if you will hear me it shall be honest this time  only put me in the way again  the chaplain was sorely sad and weary  he it was whose ministrations had chiefly comforted the dying king  to him it had been the loss of a deeplyloved son and pupil as well as of almost unbounded hopes for the welfare of the church and he had had likewise in the freshness of his sorrow to take the lead in the ecclesiastical ceremonies that ensued so that both in body and mind he was wellnigh worn out and longed for peace in which to face his own private sorrow but the wild words and anguished looks of the young scot showed him that his case was one for immediate hearing and he drew the lad into the confessional authoritatively calmed his agitation and prepared to hear the outpouring of the boys selfreproach  he heard it allsifting facts from fancies and learning the early purpose the terror at the cruel world the longing for peace and shelter the desire to smooth his sisters way which had led him to devote himself in heart to the cloister though never permitted openly to pledge himself  then the discovery that the world was less thorny than he had expected the allurement of royal favour and greatness the charm of amusement and activity in recovered health the cowardly dread of scorn leading him not merely into the secular life but into the gradual dropping of piety and devotion the actual share he had taken in forbidden diversions his attempts at plunder his illwill to king henry and above all his persecution of esclairmonde which he now regarded as sacrilegious and he even told how he lay under a half engagement to countess jaqueline to return alone to the court and bear his part in the forcible marriage she projected  he told all with no extenuation nay rather with such outbursts of opprobrium on himself that dr bennet could hardly understand of what positive evils he had been guilty and he ended by entreating that the almoner would at once hear his vow to become a benedictine monk ere  but dr bennet would not listen  he silenced the boy by saying he had no more right to hear it than malcolm as yet to make it  nay that inner dedication for which malcolm yearned as a sacred bond to his own will the priest forbade  it was no moment to make such a promise in his present mood when he did not know himself  if broken he would only be adding sin to sin nor was malcolm with all his errors fresh upon him in any state to dedicate himself worthily  the errorswhich in ralf percy or in most other youths might have seemed slightwere heavy stains on one who like malcolm had erred not thoughtlessly but with a conscience of them all in wilful abandonment of his higher principles on these the chaplain mostly dwelt on these he tried to direct malcolms repentance and finding that the youth was in perpetual extremes of remorse and that his abject submission was a sort of fresh form of wilfulness almost passion at being forbidden to bind himself by the vow he told him that the true token of repentance was steadiness and constancy and that therefore his absolution must be deferred until he had thus shown that his penitence was true and sincereby perseverance firstly in the devotions that the chaplain appointed for him and secondly in meeting whatever temptations might be in store for him  nay the cruel chaplain absolutely forbade the white excited eager boy to spend half the night in chapel over the first division of these penitential psalms and prayers but on his obedience sent him at once to his bed  malcolm could have torn his hair  unabsolved  still under the weight of sin still unpledged still on dangerous ground still left to a secular lifeand that without esclairmonde  why had he not gone to a french benedictine who would have caught at his vow and crowned his penitence with some magnificent satisfying asceticism  yet something in his heart something in the fathers own authority made him submit and in a tumult of feeling more wretched even than before his confession he threw himself on his bed expecting to charge the tossings of a miserable night on dr bennet and to creep down barefoot to the chapel in the early morning to begin his misereres  instead of which his first wakening was in broad daylight by king james standing over him  malcolm he said i have answered for you that you are discreet and trusty  a message of weight is to be placed in your hands  come with me to the duke of bedford  malcolm could only dress himself and obediently follow to the chamber where sat the duke his whole countenance looking as if the light of his life had gone out but still steadfastly set to bear the heavy burden that had been placed on his shoulders  he called malcolm to him and showed him a ring asking whether he knew it  the kings signetking harrys said malcolm  he was then reminded how in the winter henry had lost the ring and after having caused another to be made at paris had found it in the finger of his gauntlet  very few knew of the existence of this duplicate  bedford himself was not aware of it till it had been mentioned by james and lord fitzhugh the chamberlain and then search was made for it without effect so that it evidently had been left with the queen  these private signets were of the utmost importance far more so than even the autograph for though signatures were just acquiring individuality enough to become the best authentication yet up to this very reign the seal was the only valid affirmation  such signets were always destroyed on a princes death and it was of the utmost importance that the duplicate should not be left in queen catherines handsabove all while she was with her mother and her party who were quite capable of affixing it to forgeries  bedford james and fitzhugh were all required at vincennes the two latter at the lyinginstate in the chapel  most of the other trusty nobles had repaired to the army and indeed bedford aware of the terrible jealousies that were sure to break out in the headless realm did not choose to place a charge that might hereafter prove invidious in the hands of any englishman or to extend the secret any further than could be helped since who could tell what suspicion might not be thus cast on any paper sealed by henry  in his perplexity james had suggested young malcolm who had assisted in the search for the lost ring and been witness to its discovery and whom he could easily send as bearer of his condolences to the widowed queen who had indeed the entree of the palace but had no political standing was neither french nor english and had shown himself discreet enough with other secrets to deserve confidence  bedford caught at the proposal  and malcolm now received orders to take horse with a sufficient escort and hasten at once to paris where he should try if possible to obtain the ring from the queen herself but if he could not speak to her in private he might apply to sir lewis robsart  no other person was to be informed of the real object of the mission and he was to get back to vincennes as soon as possible  neither prince could understand the scared distressed looks with which malcolm listened to commands showing so much confidence in a youth of his years  they encouraged him by assurances that sir lewis robsart who had a curious kind of authority half fatherly half nurselike over the queen would manage all for him  and king james provoked by his reluctance began as they left bedfords chamber to chide him for ungraciousness in the time of distress and insensibility to the honour conferred on him  nay nay disclaimed malcolm almost ready to weep but i have a whole world of penance  penance  plague on the boys perverseness  what penance is so good as obedience said james much displeased  sir sir panted malcolm tis not only that  could any one but be sent in my stead  my returning alone is what madame of hainault badeforfor some scheme on  his voice was choked and his face was burning  is the lad gone daft cried james in great anger  if madame of hainault were so lost to decorum as to hatch such schemes at such a moment i trow you are neither puppet nor fool in her hands for her to do what she will with  ill have no more fooling  malcolm could only obey  in the brief space while the horses were preparing and he had to equip and take food he sped in search of dr bennet hoping he knew not what from his interference or trusting at any rate to explain his own sudden absence  but looking into the chapel he recognized the chaplain as one of the leading priests in one of the lengthiest of masses which was just commencing  it was impossible to wait for the conclusion  he could but kneel down find himself too much hurried and confused to recollect any prayer then dash back again to don his ridinggear before king james should miss him and be angered again  unabsolvedunvowed he thought  sent off thither against my will whatever may fall out it is no fault of mine     chapter xiv the troth flight   trembling and awed the ladies waited at paris  it was well known how the kings illness must end  no one save the queen professed to entertain any hope of his amendment but catherine appeared to be too lethargic to allow herself to be roused to any understanding of his danger and as to the personal womanly tendance of wife to suffering husband she seemed to have no notion of it  her mother had never been supposed to take the slightest care of king charles and catherine after her example regarded the care either of husband or child as no more required of a royal lady than of a queen bee  the little lady montagu as alice was now to be called who had been scheming that her richard should be wounded just enough to learn to call her his good little nursetender was dreadfully scandalized as indeed were wives of more experience when they found all their endeavours to make their mistress understand how ill the king really was and how much he wished for her fall upon uncomprehending ears and at last were desired by her mother isabeau not to torment the poor queen or they would make her ill  make her ill  i wish i could muttered lady warwick as she left the presencechamber but it is like my little nan telling her applestock baby that all her kin were burnt alive in one castle  she heeds as much  but when at late evening sir lewis robsart rode up to the hotel and a hush went along with him for all knew that he would never have left his king alive catherines composure gave way  she had not imagination enough for apprehension of what was out of sight but when she knew that she had lost her king to whom she had owed the brief splendour of an otherwise dreary and neglected life she fell into a passion of cries and tears even at the mere sight of sir lewis and continued to bewail her king her lord her husband her light her love with the violence of an utterly unexpected bereavement  but while her shrieks and sobs were rending the air a hoarse voice gasped out what say you  my son henri dead and white and ghastly the gray hair hanging wildly from the temples the eyes roaming with the wistful gaze of the half insane poor king charles stood among them demanding tell me i am sick again  tell me it is but one of my delusions  so brave so strong so lively so good to the poor old man my son henri cannot die  that is for the old the sick  and when sir lewis with gentle words had made him understand the truth he covered his face with his hands and staggered away led by his attendant knight still murmuring in a dazed way mon fils henri mon bon fils henrimost loving of all my children  in truth neither of his own sons had been thus mourned nor had any person shown the poor crazed monarch the uniform deferential consideration he had received from henry  he crept back to his own chamber and for many days hardly spoke save to moan for his bon fils henri scarcely tasting food and pining away day by day  those who had watched the likeness between the heroes of monmouth and of macedon saw the resemblance carried out for as the aged persian queen perished away from grief for the courteous and gentle alexander so now the king of the conquered realm was actually wasting to death with mourning for his frank and kindly bon fils henri  as part of royal etiquette catherine betook herself to her bed in a chamber hung with black the light of day excluded and ranks of wax tapers shedding a lugubrious light upon rows of gentlemen and ladies who had to stand there on duty watching her as the mourners watched the king though her lyinginstate was not always as silent for though there was much time spent in slumber catherine sometimes would indulge in a good deal of subdued prattle with her mother or her more confidential attendants  but at other times chiefly when first awaking or else when anything had crossed her will she would fall into agonies of passionate griefweeping shrieking and rending her hair with almost a frenzy of misery as she called herself utterly desolate and screamed aloud for her king to return to her  she was quite past the management of her english ladies on these occasions and her mother declaring that she was becoming crazed like her father declined having anything to do with her  even sir lewis robsart she used to spurn aside and nothing ever seemed effectual but for the demoiselle de luxemburg with her full sweet voice and force of will in all the tenderness of strength caressingly to hold her still talk to her almost as to an infant and sing away her violence with some long low dittysometimes a mere flemish lullaby sometimes a church hymn  as lady warwick said when the ladies were all wearied out with the endeavour to control their queens waywardness and violence and it sighed away like a departing tempest before esclairmonde it was as great a charity as ever ministering as a st katherines bedeswoman could be  to the young lady montagu the blow was astounding  it was the first realization that a great man could die a great support be taken away and childlike she moved about bewildered and stunned in the great household on which the dark cloud had descendedclinging to esclairmonde as if to protect her from she knew not what anything dreadful might happen with the king dead and her father and husband away  alas poor esclairmonde  she was in much more real danger herself as came to the brides mind presently when in the midst of her lamentations she exclaimed and ah clairette there ends his goodly promise about the sisterhood of good works at paris  esclairmonde responded with a gesture of sorrow and the murmur of the in principibus non confide that is so often the echo of disappointment  and what will you do continued alice watching her anxiously as her face turning very pale was nevertheless uplifted towards heaven  strive to trust more in god less in princes she breathed forth clasping her hands and compressing her lips  nay but does it grieve you so intensely asked alice  mayhap  alas sweet one  i would that the fall of this device seemed like to be the worst effect to me of your good kings death  pray for me alice for now no earthly power stands between me and my kinsmens will  alice cried aloud nay nay lady we are english still  there are my father my lord the duke of bedford they will not suffer any wrong to be done  hush alice  none of them hath any power to aid me  even good king henry had no legal power to protect me only he was so great so strong in word or deed that no man durst do before him what he declared a shame and a sin  now it will be expedient more than ever that nothing be done by the english to risk offending the duke of burgundy  none will dare withhold me none ought to dare for they act not for themselves but for their infant charge and my countess is weary of me  there is nothing to prevent my uncles from taking me away with them or  nothing cried alice  it cannot be  oh that my father were here  he could do nothing for me  a convent  no convent here could keep me against the bishop of therouenne  alice wrung her hands  oh it cannotshall not be  no alice i do not believe it will be  i have that confidence in him to whom i have given myself that i do not believe he will permit me to be snatched from him so long as my will does not consent  esclairmonde faltered a moment as she remembered her wavering crossed her hands on her breast and ejaculated may he deal mercifully with me  yet it may be at an exceeding costat that of all my cherished schemes of all that was pride and selfseeking  alice look not so terrified  nothing can be done immediately or with violence in this first mourning for the king and i trust to make use of the time to disguise me and escape to england where i may keep my vow as anchoress or as lay sister  let me keep that and my selfexalting schemes shall be all put by  the question whether this should be to england or to the southern parts of france held by the armagnacs remained for decision as opportunity should direct alice constantly urging her own scheme of carrying her friend with her as her tirewoman if as seemed likely she were sent home and esclairmonde refusing to consent to anything that might bring the bride into troubles with her father and husband and the debates being only interrupted when the lady montagu was required to take her turn among the weary ladiesinwaiting around catherines state bed  whenever she was not required to control console or persuade the queen esclairmonde spent most of her time in a chamber apart from the chatter of jaquelines little court where she was weaving in the delicate point lace work she had learnt in her flemish convent an exquisite robe such as were worn by priests at mass  she seldom worked save for the poor but she longed to do some honour to the one man who would have promoted her nearly vanished scheme and this work she trusted to offer for a vestment to be used at his burial mass  many a cherished plan was resigned many an act of selfnegation uttered as she bent over the dainty web many an entreaty breathed that her moments wandering of fancy might not be reckoned against her but that she might be aided to keep the promise of her infancy and devote herself undivided to the direct service of god and of his poor be it in ever so humble a station  here she sat alone when steps approached the door opened and of all people he stood before her whom she least wished to see the young lord of glenuskie  amazed as she was she betrayed no confusion and merely rose saying quietly this is an error  i will show you madames apartment  but malcolm who had begun by looking far more confused than she cried earnestly one moment lady  i came not willingly the countess sent for me to her  but since i am herelisten while heaven gives me strength to say iti will trouble you never again  i am come to a better mind  oh forgive me  what are you here then for sir said esclairmonde with the same defensive dignity  my king sent me against my will on a mission to the queen panted malcolm  i am forced to wait here or lady i should have been this day doing penance for my pursuit of you  verily i am a penitent  mayhap heaven will forgive me if you will  if i understand you aright it is well said esclairmonde still gravely and doubtfully  it is so indeed protested malcolm with a terrible wrench to his heart yet a sensation of freeing his conscience  fear me no longer now  after that which i saw at vincennes i know what it is to be on the straight path andoh what it is to have fallen from it  how could i dream of dragging you down to be with one so unworthy becoming more worthless each day  lady if i never see you more pardon me pray for me as a saint for a poor outcast on earth  hush said esclairmonde i am no saintonly a maiden pledged  but sir i thank you fervently  you have lightened my heart of one of my fears  malcolm could not but be cheered by being for once spoken to by her in so friendly a tone and he added gravely and resolutely my suit then i yield up ladyyield for ever  am i permitted once to kiss that fair and holy hand as i resign my presumptuous hopes thereof  mayhap it were wiser left undone said esclairmonde  my mind misgives me that this meeting is planned to bring us into trouble  farewell my lord  as she had apprehended the door was flung back and countess jaqueline rushed in clasping her hands in an affectation of merry surprise as she cried here they are  see monseigneur  no keeping doves apart  madame said esclairmonde turning on her with cold dignity i have been thanking monsieur de glenuskie for having resigned the suit that i always declared to be in vain  you misunderstood clairette said jaqueline  no gentleman ever so spoke  no no my young lord has kept his promise to me and i will not fail him  madame faltered malcolm i came by command of the king of scots  so much the better cried jaqueline  so he can play into our hands for all his grandeur  it will lose him his wager though  here is bridethere is priestnay bishop pointing to him of therouenne who had accompanied her but hitherto had stood silent  madame said malcolm the time and state of the household forbid  ma foi  what is that to us  king henry is neither our brother nor our father and catherine will soon laugh at it as a good joke  nay said the bishop with more propriety it is the contract and trothplight alone that could take place at present  that secure the full solemnities will await a fitting time but it is necessary that the troth be exchanged at once  monseigneur said esclairmonde mine is in other keeping  and monseigneur added malcolm i have just told the lady that i repent of having fallen from my vocation and persecuted her  how sir said the bishop turning on him do you thus lightly treat a lady of the house of luxemburg  beware  there are those who know how to visit an insult on a malapert lad who meddles with the honour of the family  be not threatened lord malcolm said esclairmonde with a gleam in her eye  and malcolm was stewart enough to answer with spirit my lord i will meet them if needed  this lady is so affianced that it is sacrilege to aspire to her  ah said the bishop in an audible aside to the giggling countess this comes of her having thrown herself at the youths head  now he will no more of her  crimson with wrath and also with a wild sense of hope that the obligation had become absolute malcolm made a vehement incoherent exclamation but esclairmonde retained her composure  monseigneur and madame both know better she said  this is but another menace  peace minion said the bishop of therouenne and listen to me  if this young gentleman after professing himself willing to wed you now draws back so much the worse for him  but if you terrify him out of it with your humours then will my brother st pol and the duke of burgundy soon be here with no king of england to meddle and by st adrian sir boemond will be daunted by no airs like monsieur there  a bride shall you be esclairmonde de luxemburg ere the week is out if not to monsieur de glenuskie to the chevalier boemond de bourgogne  look not at me said jaqueline  i am weary of your contumacy  all i shall do is to watch you well  ive suspected for some days that you were concocting mischief with the little montagu but youll not escape again as when i was fool enough to help you  the two stood a few paces apart where they had been discovered esclairmondes eyes were closed her hands clasped as if in silent prayer for aid  girlyour choice said the bishop peremptorily  wedlock on the spot to this gentleman or to sir boemond a week hence  esclairmonde was very white  my will shall not consent to a present breach of vow to save a future one she said in a scarce audible voice  a sudden thought darted into malcolms mind  with colour flooding his face to his very temples he stepped nearer to her and said in a tremulous undertone lady trust me  the bishop withheld jaqueline almost by force so soon as he saw that the pair were whispering together and that there was something of relaxation in esclairmondes face as she looked up at him in silent interrogation  he spoke low but solemnly and imploringly  trust me with your plight lady and i will restore it when you are free  hardly able to speak she however murmured you will indeed do this  so help me heaven he said and his eyes grew large and bright he held his head with the majesty of his race  heaven has sent you said esclairmonde with a long sigh and holding out her hand to him as though therewith she conferred a highsouled womans full trust  and malcolm took it with a strange pang of pain and exultation at the heart  the trust was won but the hope of earthly joy was gone for ever  the countess broke out with a shout of triumph there there they have come to reason at last  theres an end of her folly  malcolm felt himself a man and esclairmondes protector all at once as he stood forth still holding her hand  monseigneur he said this lady consents to intrust her troth to me and be affianced to mehis chest heaved but he still spoke firmlyon condition that no word be spoken of the matter nor any completion of the rite take place until the mourning for king henry be at an end and at a sort of shiver from esclairmonde he added not for a year by which time i shall be of full age  a strange bridegroom said jaqueline but maybe you do well to get her on what terms you can  do you agree monseigneur  in truth monseigneur may have been relieved that the trial of strength between him and his ward had thus terminated  he was only anxious to have the matter concluded  the agreement binding malcolm to accept a stated number of crowns in instalments as the value of esclairmondes lands under the guarantee of the duke of burgundy and king james of scotland had all been long ago signed sealed and secured and there was nothing to prevent the fiancailles or espousals from taking place at once  it was a much more real ceremony than a mere betrothal being in fact in the eye of the civil law a marriage though the full blessing and the sacramental words of union were deferred for the completion of the rite it was the first part of the marriage service binding the pair so indissolubly to one another that neither could enter into wedlock with any one else as long as the other livedexcept of course by papal dispensation and in cases of stolen weddings it was all that was deemed needful  all therefore that remained to be done was that the bishop summoned his chaplain to serve as a witness and as scribe and then the two young people in their deep mourning dresses standing before the bishop vowed to belong to none other than to one another and the betrothal rings being produced were placed on their fingers and their hands were clasped  malcolms was steady as he felt esclairmondes rest in his untrembling but with the quietness of one who trusted all in all where she trusted at all  poor children they have all to learn hilariously shouted the countess  they have forgotten the kiss  will you suffer it my sister said malcolm with burning cheeks  my brother and my guardian responded esclairmonde raising the white brow to his lips  at that moment back went the door and in flew alice montagu crying aloud clairette the queenoh madame your pardon but i am sent for esclairmonde  the queen is in worse fits than ever  sir lewis cant get the ring from her  they think she will rave like her father presently come  esclairmonde could only hurry away at this while alice grasping her hand continued  oh have they been persecuting you  i dreaded it when i saw yon little wretch butoh esclairmonde what is this in an utterly changed voice  he holds my faith in trust  he will restore it said esclairmonde hurriedly  but lady montagu spoke not another word and indeed they were hard upon the english queens rooms whence they already heard hysterical screams of passion  jaqueline had immediately set forth in the same direction out of curiosity and malcolm in much anxiety since the mission that he had been cautioned to guard so jealously seemed in danger of being known everywhere  he had himself been allowed to stand by the queens bedside and rehearse jamess message but when he had further hinted of his being sent by bedford to bring the ring the queen perhaps at the mention of the brotherinlaw pouted knew nothing of any ring and supposed m le duc meant to strip her a poor desolate widow of all her jewels  then malcolm had spoken in private with sir lewis robsart who knew the ring was among her jewels and promised to get it for him as soon as was possible and it was while waiting for this that malcolm had been summoned to the countess of hainaults apartments  but ere sir lewis could get the ear of the queen as he now told malcolm her mother had been with her  catherine was dull jealous unwilling to part with anything but always easily coaxed over  her mother isabeau had on the other hand a good deal of low cunning and selfishness and understood how valuable an instrument might be a duplicate seal of a deceased monarch  therefore she instigated her daughter to deny that she possessed it and worked her up into a state of impracticability in which sir lewis robsart was unable to deal with her and only produced so wild a tempest of passion as perfectly to appal both him and her ladies  that the duke of bedford had sent for a ring which she would not give up was known over the whole palace the only matter still not perhaps known was what was the value of that individual ring  robsart however promised to exonerate malcolm from having shown any indiscretion he charged it all on himself for having left his queen for an instant to isabeau  meanwhile malcolm and he with other nobles and ladies waited waited in the outer chamber listening to the fearful storm of shrieks and cries till they began to spend themselves and die away and then they heard esclairmondes low voice singing her lullaby and every one breathed freer as though relieved and murmurs of conversation rose again  malcolm moved across to greet the lady montagu and though she looked at him with all the disdain her little gentle face could accomplish he had somehow a spring and strength in him that could not now be browbeaten  he bent over her and said lady i see you know all  it is but a trust  if you so treat it sir you will do well responded the young matron with as much stern gravity as she could assume the fact being that she longed to break down and cry heartily that esclairmonde should so far have failed and become like other people  long long they waitedmalcolm with a strange dreamy feeling at his heart neither triumph nor disappointment but something between both and peace above all  dinner was served in the hall the company returned to the outer apartment yet still all was silent within till at last late in the afternoon there came a black figure forth from under the black hangings and esclairmonde turning to lady warwick said the queen is awake and desires her ladies presence  and then coming towards malcolm who was standing near sir lewis robsart she placed in his hand the signetring  both while the attendants of the queen filed back into her chamber eagerly demanded how the ring had been obtained  poor lady said esclairmonde she was too much spent to withhold anything  she was weak and exhausted with cries and tears and when she had slept she was as meek as a lamb and there was no more ado but to bid her remember that the blessed king her lord would have bidden her let the ring be broken up at once lest it should be used so as to harm her son  that esclairmonde had prevailed by that gentle force of character which no one could easily resist could not however be doubted for a moment and a fresh thrill of amazement and almost of joy came over malcolm at the sense that he had become the protector of such a being and that in a sort she belonged to him and was in his power having trusted herself to him  robsart advised and esclairmonde concurred in the counsel that lord glenuskie should set forth for vincennes immediately before there should be time for any more cabals or for queen isabeau to have made her daughter repent of having delivered up the signetring  malcolm therefore at once took leave of his affianced venturing to kiss her hand as he looked wistfully in her face and said dear lady how shall i thank you for this trust  esclairmonde gave her sweet grave smile as she said to gods keeping i commend you sir  she would not even bid him be true to his trust it would have seemed to her to insult him in whom her confidence was placed and she only added i shall ever bless you for having saved me farewell  now am i bound for ever to pray for you and your sister  and it would be impossible to tell how the sense of esclairmondes trust and of the resolute selfdenial it would require of him elevated malcolms whole tone and braced his mind  the taking away of his original high purpose had rendered him as aimless and pleasureloving as any ordinary lad but the situation in which he now stoodguarding this saintly being for her chosen destiny at the expense of all possible earthly projects for his own happiness or ambitionwas such as to bring out that higher side of his nature that had wellnigh collapsed  as he stood alone in the anteroom waiting until his horse and escort should be ready for his return a flood of happiness seemed to gush over him esclairmonde was no more his own indeed than was king henrys signet but the trust was very precious and gave him at least the power of thinking of her as joined by a closer link than even his sister lilias and towards her his conscience was again clear for this very betrothal put marriage out of the question for him and was a real seal of his dedication  he only felt as if his heart ought not to be so light and peaceful while his penance was still unsaid his absolution not yet pronounced     chapter xv the trust   james of scotland and john of bedford sat together in the twilight of a long and weary day spent by the one in standing like a statue at the head of his deceased friend as a part of the pageant of the lyinginstate in the chapel whither multitudes had crowded throughout the day to see the mighty victor mighty lord lie low on his funeral couch the nobles gazing with a certain silent and bitter satisfaction at him who had not only broken the pride of their country but had with his iron hand repressed their own private exactions while the poor and the peasants openly bewailed him as the father and the friend who had stood between them and their harsh feudal lords  by the other the hours had passed in the press of toil and perplexity that had fallen on him as the yet unaccredited representative of english power in france and in writing letters to those persons at home from whom he must derive his authority  the hour of rest and relaxation was welcome to both though they chiefly spent it each leaning back in his chair in silence  your messenger is not come back said bedford presently rousing himself  it may have been no easy task replied james not however without uneasiness  i would said bedford presently that i had writ the matter straight to robsart  the lad is weak and may be tampered with  he knows that i have pledged my honour for him said james  bedfords thin lips moved at the corners  nay said james not angrily the youth hath in some measure disappointed me  the evil in him shot forth faster than the good under this camp life but methinks there is in him a certain rare quality of soul that i loved him for at the first and though it hath lain asleep all this time yet what he hath now seen seemed to me about to work the change in him  it may be so said bedford and yet i would i had not consented to his going where that woman of hainault might work on him to fret the lady esclairmonde  james started somewhat as he remembered overruling this objection of malcolms own making  she cannot have the insolence he said  at that moment a hasty step approached the door was opened with scant ceremony and ralf percy covered from head to foot with blood hurried in breathless and panting  my lord duke your license  here is malcolm stewart set upon in the forest by robbers and stabbed  slain  dead cried both princes springing up in horror  alive stillin the chapelasking for you my lord said percy  he bade us lay him there at the kings feet and as it was the readiest way to a priest we did his bidding  my poor malcolm sighed james and he and bedford hastened to obey the summons  there was time on the way for ralf percy to give them the particulars we had gone forthtrenton kitson altogether some halfdozen of usfor a mouthful of air in the forest after our guard all day in the chapel when about a mile from the castle we heard a scuffle and clashing of arms  so breaking through the thicket we saw a score of fellows on horseback fully armed and in the midst poor glenuskie dragged to the ground and struggling hard with two of them  we drew our swords hallooed and leapt out and the knaves never stayed to see how many of us there were but made off like the dastards they were but not till one had dealt poor stewart this parting stroke  he hath been bleeding like a sheep all the way home and hath scarce spoken but a thanksgiving for our having come in time as he called it and to ask for dr bennet and the duke  the words brought them to the door of the chapel where for a time the chants around king henry had paused in the agitation of the new arrival as the black and white crowd of priests and monks opened and made way for the king and duke they saw in the full light of the wax tapers laid on a pile of cushions not far from king henrys feet the figure of malcolm his ridinggown open at the breast and kerchiefs dyed and soaked with blood upon it the black of his garments and hair enhancing the ghastly whiteness of his face and yet an air of peace and joy in the eyes and in the folded hands as dr bennet and another priest stood over him administering those abbreviated rites of farewell blessing which the church sanctioned in cases of sudden and violent death  the princes both stood aside and presently malcolm faintly said thank god  i trusted to his mercy to pardon  now all would be well could i but see the duke  i am here dear youth said bedford kneeling on one side of him while james coming to the other side spoke to him affectionately but to him malcolm only replied by a fond clasp of the hand giving his sole attention to bedford to whom he held the signet  it has cost too much said bedford sadly  oh sir this would be naught save that i am all that lies between herthe lady esclairmondeand boemond of burgundy and as at that moment bedford saw the gold betrothal ring on the finger his countenance lost something of the pitying concern it had worn  malcolm detected the expression and rallying his powers the more continued sir there was no helpthey vowed that she must choose between boemond and me  on the faith of a dying man i hold her troth but in trust i pledged myself to her to restore it when her way is clear to her purpose  she would never be mine but in name  and now who will save her  my life alone is between her and yonder wolf  oh sir duke promise me to save her and i die content  this is mere waste of time broke in the duke  where are the knave chirurgeonssee james if the lad dies twill be from mere loss of blood there is no inward bleeding and if there be no more loitering he will do well  and seeing the surgeons at hand he would have risen to make way but malcolm held him fast reiterating save her sir  if your life guards her throw it not away by thus dallying said bedford disengaging himself while malcolm groaned heavily and turned his heavy eyes to his royal friend who said kindly fear not dear cousin either thou wilt live or he will be better than his word  god will guard her i know said malcolm and oh my own dear lord i need not ask you to be the brother to my poor sister you have been to me at least all will be clear for her and patie  i trust not yet said james smiling in encouragement  thou wilt live my faithful laddie  malcolm was spent and nearly fainting by this time and all his reply was a few gasps of only say you pardon me all my lord and will speak for her to the duke ask her prayers for me and as james sealed his few words of reply with a kiss he closed his eyes and became unconscious in which state he was conveyed to his bed  you might have set his mind at rest said james somewhat hurt to the duke  who  i said bedford  i cannot stir a finger that could set us at enmity with burgundy for any lady in the land  moreover if she have found means to secure herself once she can do so again  i would you could have been more kind to my poor boy said james  methought i was the most reasonably kind of you all  had it not been mere murder to keep him there prating and bleeding i had asked of him what indiscretion had blown the secret and perilled the signet  no robbers were those between paris and vincennes in our midst but men who knew what he bore  ill never  bedford just restrained himself from saying trust a scot again but his manner had vexed and pained james who returned to malcolm and left him no more till called by necessity to his post as king henrys chief mourner when the care of him was left to patrick drummond and old bairdsbrae and malcolm was a very tranquil patient who seemed to need nothing but the pleasure of looking at the ring on his finger  the weapon had evidently touched no vital part and he was decidedly on the way to recovery when on the second evening bedford met james saying i have seen robsart  it was no indiscretion of young glenuskies  it was only what comes of dealing with women  can i see the boy without peril to him  malcolm was so much better that there was no reason against the dukes admission and soon bedfords falconface looked down on him in all its melancholy  thanks my lord glenuskie he said i thought not to be sending you on a service of such risk  it was a welcome service said malcolm  bedfords brows knitted themselves for a moment as he said i came to ask whether you deem that this hurt was from a common robber or routier  assuredly not said malcolm but very low and looking up into his face as he added this should be for your ear alone sir  they were left alone and the duke said i have heard from robsart how the ring was obtained  you may spare that part of the story  sir said malcolm when the lady esclairmonde for he was not to be balked of dwelling on that name with prolonged delight had brought me the ring sir lewis robsart advised my setting forth without loss of time  so he told me said the duke and likewise that you took his words so literally as to set out with only three followers  ay sir but he knew not wherefore  my escort had gone forth into the city and while they were being collected a message bade me to the lady esclairmondes presence  i went suspecting naught but i found myself in presence of madame of hainault and of a veiled ladywho my lord he paused  she was broad in form and had a trick of gasping as though overfat  bedford nodded  every one knew queen isabeau by these tokens  she scarce spoke my lord but the countess jaqueline pretended to be in one of her merry moods  she told me one good turn deserved another and that as in gratitude and courtesy bound i must do her the favour of either lending her the signet or if i would not let it out of my hands of setting it to a couple of parchments which she declared king henry had promised to grant  the false woman  sir words told not on her  she laughed and clapped her hands at whatever i said of honour faith or trust  she would have it that it was a jestnay romping fashion she seized my hand which i let her have knowing it was only my own seal that was on it  never was i so glad that the signet being too small for my fingers it was in my bosom  knew you what the parchments bore asked bedford anxiously  oneso far as i could seewas of the duke of orleans liberty said malcolm  the otherpardon me sirit bore the names of duke humfrey and countess jaqueline  the shameless wanton broke forth bedford  how did you escape her at last boy  sir said malcolm turning as red as loss of blood permitted she had not kept her hands off me therefore when she stood between me and the door i told her that discourtesy was better than trustbreaking and while she jeered at my talking out of a book of chivalry i een took her by the hands lifted her aside opened the door ran downstairs and so to the stables where i mounted with the only three men i could get together  bedford could not but laugh as he added bravely done lord malcolm but i fear me she will never forgive you  what next  i left word for the other fellows to join us at the hostel by the gate and tarried for them till i feared being here after the gates were fast then set out without them and rode till just within the forest a band of men how many i cannot tell were on us and before my sword was well drawn they had surrounded me and seized my bridle  one of them bade me submit quietly and they would not harm me if i would yield up that which i wist of  i said i would sooner yield my life than my trust whereupon they mastered me and dragged me off my horse and were rifling me when iknowing the flemish accent of that drunken fellow of the countessscalled out shame on you ghisbert  then it was that he stabbed me even at the moment when the holy saints sent brave percy and the rest to rush in upon them  you are sure it was ghisbert repeated bedford anxiously  as certain as a mans voice can make me said malcolm  methinks had i not named him he would perhaps have bound me to a tree and left it to be thought that they were but common thieves  belike said bedford thoughtfully  we are beholden to you my lord glenuskie the whole state of england is beholden to you for the saving of the confusion and evils the loss of that ring would have caused  you can keep counsel i wot well  then let all this matter of the queen and countess rest a secret  malcolm looked amazed and bedford added i cannot quarrel with the woman nor banish her from court  did we accuse her holland would become armagnac nor is she subject of ours to have justice done on her it is for her interest to hush the matter up and it must be ours too  if that knave ghisbert ever gives me the chance he shall hang like a dog but for the rest he shrugged his shoulders  and said malcolm ghisbert only meant to serve his lady  any vassal of mine would do the like for me or my sister  bedford half smiled then sighed and said once we were like to get laws more obeyed than lords but that is all over now  yet you young sir have seen a great pattern you will have great powers  sir interrupted malcolm i pray you believe me great powers i shall not have  as i told you last night i do but hold this precious troth in trust  it must be a secret or it would not save her but youoh sir you will believe that  if it be so said bedford gravely it is too sacred a trust to be spoken of  you will deserve greater honour if you keep your word than ever you will receive from the world  farewelland recover fast  malcolm did not meet with much encouragement from the few to whom he thought fit to confide the conditions of his espousal  the king allowed that he could not have acted otherwise but was concerned at it because of the hindrance that might for years be interposed in the way of his welfare and secretly hoped that malcolm in his new capacity would so gain on esclairmondes esteem and gratitude as to win her affection and that by mutual consent they would lay aside their loftier promises and take up their espousal where they had left it  and what james secretly desired sir patrick drummond openly recommended in his eyes malcolm would be no better than a fool if he let his ladye love with all her lands slip through his fingers when she was lawfully his own  patrick held that a monastery was a good place to be nursed in if wounded and a convenience for disposing of dull or weakly younger sons and he preferred that there should be some holy men to pray for those who did the hard and bloody work of the world but he had no desire that any one belonging to himself should plunge into extra sanctity and the more he saw malcolm developing into a man among men the more he opposed the notion of his dedicating himself  a man  yes malcolm was rising from his bed notably advanced in manliness  as the kings keen eye had seen from the first and as esclairmonde had felt there was an elevation tenderness and refinement in his cast of character which if left to his natural destiny would have either worn out his life early in the world or carried him to the obscure shelter of a convent  in the novelty of the secular life and temptations of all kinds dread of ridicule and the flood of excitements which came with reviving health that very sensitiveness led him astray and the elevated aims fell with a heavier fall when diverted from heavenly palaces to earthly ones  selfreproach and dejection drove him further from the right course and in proportion to the greater amount of conscience he had by nature his character was the more deteriorating his deeds were far less evil in themselves than those of many of his companions but inasmuch as they were not thoughtless in him they were injuring him more  but the sudden shock of patricks danger roused him to a new sense of shame  king henrys death had lifted his mind out of the earthly atmosphere and then the treasure of esclairmondes pure and perfect trust seemed to be the one thing to be guarded worthily and truly  it gave him weight drew him out of himself lifted him above the boyish atmosphere of random selfindulgence and amusement  to be the protector who should guard her vows for the heavenly bridegroom to whom her soul was devoted was indeed a championship that in his eyes could only have befitted sir galahad and a galahad would he strive to be so long as that championship held him to the secular life  james and bedford both told him he had won his spurs and should have them on the next fit occasion but he had ceased to care for knighthood save in that halfconsecrated aspect which he thought would render his guardianship less unmeet for esclairmonde  she had not shunned to send him a kind greeting on hearing of his wound and by way of token a fresh leaf of vellum with a few more of those meditations from zwollmeditations that he spelled over from latin into english and dwelt upon in great tranquillity and soothing of spirit during the days that he was confined to his bed  these were not many  he was on his feet by the time the funeral cavalcade was in readiness to move from vincennes to convey henry of monmouth to his last restingplace in westminster abbey  bedford could not be spared to return to england and was only to go as far as calais and james of scotland was therefore to act as chief mourner attended by his own small personal suite  sir patrick drummondthough shrugging his shoulders he muttered that he should as soon have thought of becoming mourner at the foul fiends funeral as at the king of englandscould not object to swell the retinue of his sovereign by his knighthood and though neither he nor malcolm were in condition for a campaign both could ride at the slow pace of the mournful procession  the coffin was laid on a great car drawn by four black horses and surmounted by henrys effigy made in boiled leather and coloured to the life robed in purple and ermine crown on head sceptre and orb in either hand  the great knights and nobles rode on each side carrying the banners of the saints and close behind came james and bedford each with his immediate attendants then the household officers of the king fitzhugh his chamberlain montagu his cupbearer ralf percy and his other squires and all the rest  four hundred menatarms in black armour with lances pointed downwards formed the guard behind and the vanguard was of clergy robed in white bearing banners and wax lights and chanting psalms  at the border of every parish all the ecclesiastics thereto appertaining parochial chantry and monastic turned out to meet the procession with their tapers escorted it to the principal church performed mass there if it were in the forenoon and then accompanied the coffin to the other limit of their ground and consigned it to the clerks of the next parish  at night the royal remains always rested in a church guarded by alternate watches of the english menatarms and sung over by the local clergy while the escort were quartered in the town village or abbey where the halt chanced to be made  very slow was this progress almost like a continual dream was that long column moving moving onwhite in front black behindwhen seen winding over a hill or sometimes the banners peering over the autumn foliage of some thicket all composed to profound silence and tardy measured tread while the chants rose and fell with the breeze like unearthly music  many moved on more than half asleep and others of the younger men felt like ralf percy who for all his real sorrow for the king declared that were it not for rushing out morning and evening for a bathe and a gallop to fly a hawk or chase a hare he should some day run crazed blow out all the wax lights or play some mad prank to break the intolerable oppression  malcolm smiled at this but to him still in the dreamy inertness of recovery this tranquil onward movement in the still autumn weather had some thing in it of healing influence and the sweet chants the continual offices of devotion were accordant with his present tone of mind and deepened the purpose he had formed  queen catherine and her ladies joined the funeral march at rouen or rather followed it at a miles interval but the two trains kept apart and only occasional messages were sent from one to the other  some of the gentlemen who had a wife or sister in the queens suite would ride at nightfall to pay her a hasty visit but malcolmthough he longed to be sentdurst not intrude upon esclairmonde and the duke of bedford was not only forced to spend all the evening and half the night in business but was not loth to put off the day of the meeting with his dear sister catherineto say nothing of the woman of hainault  therefore it was not until all had arrived at calais where a fleet was waiting to meet them that any visits were openly made by the one party to the other  bedford and james went together to the apartments of the queen and while they saw her in private malcolm came blushing towards esclairmonde and was welcomed by her with a frank smile outstretched hand and kind inquiry after his recovery  she treated him indeed as a brother as one on whom she depended and had really wished to see and arrange with  she told him that alice montagu and her husband were returning to england and that her little friend had so earnestly prayed her to abide with her at middleham for the present that she had consenteduntil such time as the way be open said esclairmonde with her steady patient smile  malcolm bowed his head  i am glad you will not be forced to be with your countess he said  my poor lady  maybe i have spoken too plainly  but i owe her much  i must ever pray for her  and you my lord  i said malcolm shall go to study at oxford  dr bennet intends returning thither to continue his course of teaching and my king has consented to my studying with him  it will not cut me off lady from that which you permit me to be  king henry and his brothers have all been scholars there  i understand said esclairmonde slightly colouring  it is well  and truly i trust that matters may be so guided that care for me may not long detain you from more lasting vowsbe they of heaven or earth  lady said malcolm earnestly none who had been plighted to you could pledge himself to aught else save one above  then feeling in himself or seeing in esclairmondes face that he was treading on dangerous ground he asked leave to present to her his cousin patrick drummond and this was accordingly done the lady comporting herself with so much sweet graciousness that the good knight as they left the hall exclaimed by st andrew malcolm if you let that maiden escape you now she is more than halfwedded to you youll be the greatest fool in broad scotland  why she is a very queen for beauty and would rule glenuskie like a princessay and defend the castle like black agnes of dunbar herself  if you give her up yell be no better than a clod  malcolm and patrick had been borne off by jamess quitting the castle bedford remained longer having affairs to arrange with the queen  as he left her he too turned aside to the window where esclairmonde sat as usual spinning and lady montagu not far off but at present absorbed by her father who was to remain in france  one moments hesitation and then bedford stepped towards the demoiselle de luxemburg and greeted her  she looked up in his face and saw its settled look of sad patient energy which made it full ten years older in appearance than when they had sat together at pentecost and she marked the badge that he had assumed a tornup root with the motto the root is dead  ah my lord things are changed she could not help saying as she felt that he yearned for comfort  changed indeed he said gods will be done  lady he added you wot of that which once passed between us  i was grieved at first that you chose a different protector in your need  you could not my lord faltered esclairmonde crimson as she never had been when speaking to malcolm  no i could not said bedford and lady my purpose was to thank you for the generous soul that perceived that so it is  you spared me from a cruel case  i have no self any longer esclairmonde all i am all i have all i can must be spent in guarding harrys work for his boy  to all else i am henceforth dead and all i can do is to be thankful lady that you have spared me the sorest trial of all both to heart and honour  esclairmondes eyes were downcast as she said heaven is the protector of those of true and kind purpose and then gathering courage as being perfectly aware to whom bedford must give his hand if he would conciliate burgundy she added and verily sir the way of policy is this time a happy one  let me but tell you how i have known and loved gentle lady anne  bedford shook his head with a half smile and a heavy sigh  time fails me dear lady he said and i cannot brook any maidens praise even from you  i only wait to ask whether there be any way yet left wherein i can serve you  i will strive to deal with your kinsmen to restore your lands  hold said esclairmonde  never for lands of mine will i have your difficulties added to  nolet them go  it was a vain proud dream when i thought myself most humble to become a foundress and if i know my kinsmen they will be too much angered to bestow on me the dower required by a convent  no sir all i would dare to inquire would be whether you have any voice in choosing the bedeswomen of st katharines hospital  the bedeswomen  they come chiefly from the citizens not from princely houses like yours said john in consternation  i have done with princely houses said esclairmonde  a flemish maiden would be of no small service among the many whom trade brings to your port from the netherlands and my longing has ever been to serve my lord through his poor and afflicted  it is my fathers widow who holds the appointments said john  between her and me there hath been little goodwill but my dear brothers last act towards her was of forgiveness  she may wish to keep well with us of the regencyand more like still she will be pleased that one of so great a house as yours should sue to her  i will give you a letter to her praying her to remember you at the next vacancy and mayhap if the lady montagu could take you to visit her you could prevail with her but surely some nunnery more worthy of your rank  there is none that i should love so well said esclairmonde smiling mayhap i have learnt to be a vagabond but i cannot but desire to toil as well as pray  and you are willing to wait for a vacancy  when once safe from my kinsmen in england i will wait under my kind alices wing tilltill it becomes expedient that yonder gentleman be set free  you trust him said bedford  entirely responded esclairmonde heartily  happy lad half sighed the duke but even as he did so he stood up to bid the lady adieulingering for a moment more to gaze at the face he had longed for permission to loveand thus take leave of all his youth and joy addressing himself again to that burthen of care which in thirteen years laid him in his grave at rouen  as he left the castle and came out into the steep fortified street ralf percy came up to him laughing  here my lord are those two honest yorkshire knights running all over calais to make a petition to you  whattrenton and kitson  i thought their year of service was up and they were going home  ay my lord said kitson who with his comrade had followed close in percys wake we were going home to bid mistress agnes take her choice of us but this morn weve met a pursuivant that is come with norroy king atarms and what doth he but tell us that no sooner were our backs turned than what doth mistress agnes but weday wed outrightone tom of the lee a sneaking rogue that either of us would have beat black and blue had we ever seen him utter a word to her  a knights ladynot to say twoas she might have been  so my lord we not being willing to go home and be a laughingstock crave your license to be of your guard as we were of king harrys and show how far we can go among the french  and welcome no good swords can be other than welcome said bedford not diverted as his brother would have been but with a heartiness that never failed to win respectful affection  long did james and bedford walk up and down the castle court together while the embarkation was going on  the question weighed on them both whether they should ever meet more after eighteen years of youth spent together  youth is gone said bedford  we have been under a mighty master and now god help us to do his work  you said james but for meit is like to be the library and the round tower again  scarcely said bedford the beauforts will never rest till joan is on a throne  james smiled  ay said bedford the bishop of winchester will be no small power you will find  would that i could throw up this france and come home for he and humfrey will clash for ever  james an you love me see humfrey alone and remind him that all the welfare of harrys child may hang on his forbearanceon union with the bishop  tell him if he ever loved the noblest brother that ever lived to rein himself in and live only for the childs good not his own  tell him that bedford and gloucester must be nothing henceforthonly heads and hands doing harrys will for his babe  oh james what can you tell humfrey that will make him put himself aside  you have writ to him harrys words as to dame jac  the wanton ay i have and if you can whisper in his ear that matter of malcolm and the signet it might lessen his inclination  but he sighed i have little hope james i see nothing for lancaster but that which the old man at york invoked upon us  yet when i look at you and humfrey and think of the contrast with my own fathers brethren i see nothing but hope and promise for england said james  we must do our best however heavyhearted said john of bedford pausing in his walk and standing steadfast  the rod becomes a palm to those who do not freshly bring it on themselves  may this poor child of harrys be bred up so that he may be fit to meet evil or good  poor child repeated james  were he not there and you  peace james said bedford it is well that such a weight is not added  while i act for my nephew i know my duty were it for myself methinks i should be crazed with doubts and questions  well as a messenger came up with tidings that all was ready fare thee well jamie  in you i lose the only man with whom i can speak my mind or take counsel  youll not let me gain a foe as well as lose a friend when you get home  never in heart john said the king  as to handscotland must be to england what she will have her  would that i saw my way thither  windsor will have lost all that made captivity wellnigh sweet  and so farewell dear brother  i thank you for the granting to me of this sacred charge  and so with hands clasped and wrung together with tears raining from jamess eyes and a dry settled melancholy more sad than tears on johns countenance the two friends parted never again to meet each to run a course true brave and shortextinguished the one in bitter grief the other in blood  on all saints day while james stood with humfrey of gloucester at the head of the grave at westminster where henrys earthly form was laid to rest amid the kings his fathers amid the wail of a people as sorrowful as if they knew all the woes that were to ensue bedford was in like manner standing over a grave at the royal abbey of st denis  he the victors brother represented all the princely kindred of charles vi of france and with his heart at westminster filled the chief mourners place over the king who had pined to death for his conqueror  the same infant was proclaimed king over each graveheir to france and england to valois and lancaster  poor child his real heirloom was the insanity of the one and the doom of the other  well for him that there was within him that holy innocence that made his life a martyrdom     chapter xvi the cage open   more than a year had passed and it was march when malcolm was descending the stone stair that leads so picturesquely beneath the archway of its tower up to the hall of the college of st mary winton then really new college  he had been residing there with dr bennet associating with the young members of the foundation educated at winchester and studying with all the freshness of a recent institution  it had been a very happy time for him within the gray stone walls that pleasantly recalled coldingham though without coldinghams defensive aspect and with ample food for the mind which had again returned to its natural state of inquiring reflection and ardour for knowledge  daily malcolm woke early attended matins and mass in the chapel studied grammar and logic mastered difficult passages in the fathers or copied out portions for himself in the chamber which he as a gentleman commoner as we should call him possessed instead of living in a common dormitory with the other scholars  or in the open cloister he listened and took notes of the lectures of the fellows and tutors of the college and seated on a bench or walking up and down received special instructions then ensued the meal spread in the hall the period of recreation in the meadows or in the licensed sports or on the river fresh studies chapel and a social but quiet evening over the supper in the hall  all this was varied by latin sermons at st marys or disputations and lectures by notable doctors and public arguments between scholars by which they absolutely fought out their degrees  there were few colleges as yet and those resident in them were the elite beyond there was a great mob of scholars living in rooms as they could generally very poor and often very disorderly but they did not mar the quiet semimonastic stillness within the foundations and to malcolm it seemed as if the truly congenial home was opened  the curriculum of science began to reveal itself to him with all the stages so inviting to a mind conscious of power and longing for cultivation  the books the learned atmosphere the infinite possibilities were delightful to him and opened a more delightful future  his metaphysical scottish mind delighted in the scholastic arguments that were now first set before him and his readiness appreciation and eager power of acquiring surprised his teachers and made him the pride of new college  when he looked back at his year of court and camp he could only marvel at having ever preferred them  in war his want of bodily strength would make real distinction impossible here he felt himself excelling here was absolute enjoyment and of a kind without drawback  scholarship must be his true element and study the deep universal study of the sisterhood of science that the university offered was his veritable vocation  surely it was not without significance that the ring that shone on his finger betrothed him to esclairmonde the light of the world for though in person the maiden was never to be his own she was the emblem to him of the pure virgin light of truth and wisdom that he would be for ever wooing and winning only to see further lights beyond  human nature felt a pang at the knowledge that he was bound to deliver up the ring and resign his connection with that fair and stately maiden but the pain that had been sore at first had diminished under the sense that he stood in a post of generous trust and that his sacrifice was the passport to her grateful esteem  he knew her to be with lady montagu awaiting a vacancy at st katharines and this would be the signal for dissolving the contract of marriage after which his present vision was to bestow lilias upon patrick make over his estates to them take minor orders and set forth for italy there to pursue those deeper studies in theology and language for which padua and bologna were famous  it was many months since he had heard of lilias but this did not give him any great uneasiness for messengers were few and letterwriting far from being a common practice  he had himself written at every turningpoint of his life and sent his letters when the king communicated with scotland but from his sister he had heard nothing  he had lately won his first degree as bachelor of arts and was descending the stair from the hall after a lenten meal on salt fish when he saw below him the wellknown figure of king jamess english servant who doffing his cap held out to him a small strip of folded paper fastened by a piece of crimson silk and the royal seal  it only bore the words     to our right trusty and wellbeloved cousin the lord malcolm stewart    of glenuskie this letter be taken     dear cousin     we greet you well and pray you to come to us without loss of time    having need of you we being a free man and no captive     yours    james r     written at the castle of windsor this st davids day 1424  a free man the words kept ringing in malcolms ears while he hastened to obtain license from warden john bonke and to take leave of dr bennet  he had not left oxford since the beginning of his residence there  vacations were not general dispersions when ways and means of transit were so scarce and tardy and malcolm had been long without seeing his king  joy on his sovereigns account and his countrys seemed to swallow up all other thoughts as to himself when he bade his friends and masters farewell he declared it was merely for a time and when they shook their heads and augured otherwise he replied nay think you i could live in the cimmerian darkness yonder dear sirs  our poor country hath nothing better than mere monastery schools and light of science having once shone on me i cannot but dwell in her courts for ever  soon shall i be altogether her son and slave  nevertheless malcolm was full of eagerness and pressed on rapidly through the lanes between oxford and windsor rejoicing to find himself amid the noble trees of the forest over which arose in all its grandeur the castle and round tower as beautiful though less unique than now and bearing on it the royal standard for the little king was still nursed there  under the vaulted gateway jameswith patrick and bairdsbrae behind himmet malcolm and threw his arms round him crying ay kiss me boy tis a king and no caitiff you kiss now  another six weeks and then for the mountain and the moor and the bonnie north countree  and why not for a month was malcolms question as hand and eye and face responded heartily  why  why because moneys must be told down and treaties signed ay and lent is no time for weddings nor march for southland roses to travel to our cold winds  ay malcolm you see a bridegroom that is to be  did you think i was going home without her  i did not think you would be in such glee even at being free my lord if you were  and now malcolm ken ye of ony fair scottish lassiea cousin of mine ain who could be had to countenance my bride at our wedding and ride with us thereafter to scotland  i know whom your grace means said malcolm smiling  an if you do maybe malcolm sin she bides not far frae the border yed do me the favour of riding with sir patrick here and bringing her to the bridal said the king making his accent more homelike and scottish than malcolm had ever heard it before  the happiness of that spring afternoon was surpassing  the king linked his arm into malcolms and walked up and down with him on the slopes telling him all that had led to this consummation how walter stewart and his brothers had become so insolent and violent as to pass the endurance of their father the regent as well as of all honest scots and how after secret negotiations and vain endeavours to obtain from him a pledge of indemnity for all that had happened the matter had been at length opened with gloucester beaufort and the council  the scottish nation with albany at the head was really recalling the king  this was the condition on which henry v had always declared that he should be liberated these were the terms on which he had always hoped to return and his patience was at last rewarded  bedford had sent his joyful consent and all was now concluded  james was really free and waited only for his marriage  i would not tell you malcolm while there might yet be a slip between cup and lip said the king it might have hindered the humanities and yet i needed you as much when i was glad as when all seemed like to fail  you had patrick said malcolm  patricks a tall and trusty fellow said the king with a shrewd wit and like to be a righthand man but theres something in you malcolm that makes a man turn to you for fellowfeeling even as to a wife  nevertheless the king and patrick had grown much attached to each other though the latter being no lover of books had wearied sorely of the sojourn at windsor which the king himself only found endurable by much study and reflection  their only variety had been keeping christmas at hertford with queen catherine sorry pastime as drummond reported it to him though gladdened to the king by joan beauforts presence in all her charms  the demoiselle of luxemburg was there too statelier than ever said james  she is now at middleham castle with the lady montagu and you might make it your way northward and lodge a night there  if you can win her consent it were well to be wedded when we are  never shall i my lord  i should not dare even to speak of it  it is well but malcolm you merit something from the damsel  you are ten times the man you were when she flouted you  if women were not mostly witless you would be much to be preferred to any mere ajax or fierabras and if this damsel should have come to the wiser mind that it were pity to be buried to the world  sir i pray you say no more  i were forsworn to ask such a thing  i bid you not only i would i were there to see that all be not lost for want of a word in season and it is high time that something be done here be letters from my lord of therouenne demanding the performance of the contract ere our return home  he cannot reach her here said malcolm  no but his outcry can reach your honour and it were ill to have such a house as that of luxemburg crying out upon you for breach of faith to their daughter  malcolm smiled  that i should heed little sir  i would fain bear something for her  why this is mere sublimated devoir too fine for our gross understandings said james ironically  mayhap the sight of the soft roseate cheek may bring it somewhat down to poor human flesh and blood once more  once i was tempted sir said malcolm blushing deeply but did i not know that her holiness is the guardian of her earthly beauty i would not see her again  nay there i command you said the king soon i shall have subjects enough but while i have but half a dozen i cannot be disobeyed by them i bid you go to middleham and there i leave all to the sight  the king spoke gaily and with such kind goodhumour that malcolm humiliated by the thought of the past durst not make fresh asseverations  james in the supreme moment of the pure and innocent romance of which he was the hero looked on love like his own as the highest crown of human life and distrusted the efforts after the superhuman which too often were mere simulation or imitation but a certain recollection of henrys warnings withheld him from pressing the matter and he returned to his own joys and hopes looking on the struggles he expected with a strong mans exulting joy and not even counting the years of his captivity wasted though they had taken away his first youth  what should i have been he said bred up in the tumults at home  what could i have known better than perth  nay had i been sent home when i came to age as a raw lad how would one or other by fraud or force have got the upper hand so as i might never have won it back  no i would not have foregone one year of studyfar less that campaign in france and the sight of harry in war and in policy  james also took malcolm to see the child king his little master  this the third king of jamess captivity was now a fair creature of two years old  he trotted to meet his visitor calling him by a baby name for brother and stretching out his arms to be lifted up and fondled for as dame alice boteller his gouvernante muttered he knew the king of scots better than he did his own mother  a retinue had been already collected and equipments prepared so that there was no delay in sending forth malcolm and patrick upon their northward journey  at the nearest town they halted sending forward a messenger to announce their neighbourhood to the old countess of salisbury and her granddaughter lady montagu and to request permission to halt for mothering sunday at the castle  in return a whole band of squires and retainers came forth headed by the knightly seneschal to invite lord malcolm stewart and his companion to the castle whereupon sir patrick proceeded to don his gayest gown and chaperon and was greatly scandalized that malcolms preparation consisted in putting on his black serge bachelors gown and hood of rabbits fur such as he wore at oxford looking as patrick declared no better than a begging scholar  but malcolm had made up his mind that if he appeared before esclairmonde at all it should be in no other guise and thus it was that he rode like a black spot in the midst of the cavalcade bright with the colours of nevil and of montagu and was marshalled up the broad stairs by the silver wand of the seneschal  lord montagu had gone back to the wars so the family at home consisted of the grand stately and distant old countess of salisbury and her young granddaughter the lady montagu with her three months old son each had an almost royal suite of wellborn dames and damsels in attendance among whom the demoiselle de luxemburg alone was on an equality with the mistresses of the house  even queen catherines presencechamber had hardly equalled the grand baronial ceremony of the hall where sat the three ladies in the midst of their circle of attendants male and female ranged on opposite sides and old lady salisbury knew the exact number of paces that it befitted her and lady montagu to advance to receive the royal infusion of blood that flowed in the veins of my lord of glenuskie  and yet it was the cheek and not the hand that were offered in salutation by both ladies as well as by esclairmonde  malcolm however only durst kneel on one knee and salute her hand and felt himself burning with crimson as the touch and voice brought back those longings that as james had said proved him human still  he was almost glad that etiquette required him to hand the aged countess to her seat and to devote his chief attention to her  punctilio reigned supreme in such a house as this  nowhere had malcolm seen such observance of ceremony save in the court of the duke of burgundy and there it was modified by the presence of rough and ready warriors but an ancient dame like lady salisbury thought it both the due and the safeguard of her sons honour and exacted it rigorously of all who approached her  alice of montagu had the sweet fragile look of a young mother about her but her frightened fawn air was gone she was in her home had found her place and held it with a simple dignity of her own quite ready to ripen into all the matronly authority without the severe formality of her granddame  she treated malcolm with a gentle smiling courtesy such as she had never vouchsafed to him before and all the shyness that had once made her silent was gone when at the suppertable and afterwards seated around the fire the tidings of the camp and court were talked over with all the zest of those to whom king harrys last campaign was becoming old times and what with her husbands letters and opinions little alice was really the bestinformed as to the present state of things esclairmonde took her part in the conversation but there was no opportunity of exchanging a private or personal word between her and malcolm in a party of five where one was as vigilant and graveeyed as my lady salisbury  however the next was a peculiar day the fourth sunday in lent called mothering sunday because on that day it was originally the custom for offerings to be carried from all the country round to the cathedral or mother church on that day  this custom had been modified but it was still the rule that all the persons who at other times worshipped at the nearest monastery chapel or at a private chapel in their own houses should on that day repair to their parish church and there make a special offering at the massthat offering which has since become the easter dues  it was a festival sunday toorefreshing sundaythen as now marked by the gospel on the feeding of the multitude and from this as well as from the name the pretty custom had begun of offering the mother of each house her rich simnal cake with some other gift from each of her children  hearing a pattering of feet in the early morning malcolm looked out and beheld a whole troop of small children popping in and out of a low archway  if he could have peeped in he would have known how many simnals ladies esclairmonde and alice were sending downwith something more substantialto be given to mothers by the children who as yet had nothing to bring of their own  but when the household assembled in the castle hall they did see fair young lady montagu kneel at the chair of the grave old countess and hold up a silver dish wherein lay the simnal mixed kneaded and moulded by her own hands and bearing on it a rich ruby clasp sent by her father the earl as his special gift to his mother on this sunday  and then when the old lady with glistening eyes had spoken her blessing on the fair young head bent down before her and the grandchild rose up there was the pretty surprise for her of her little swaddled son lying in esclairmondes arms and between the small fingers that as yet knew not how to grasp the tiny simnal and moreover a fair pearl devised in like manner by the absent sir richard as a gift for his wifes first mothering sunday  there was no etiquette here to hinder sweet alice from passionately clasping her child and covering him with kisses as many for his father as for himself as she laughed at the baby smiles and helpless gestures of the future kingmaker whose ambition and turbulence were to be the ruin of that fair and prosperous household and bring the gentle alice to a widowed bereaved and attainted old age  well that none there present saw the future as she proudly claimed the admiration of malcolm for her babe  she was equipped for the expedition to the parish church as likewise were esclairmonde and almost all the rest but the aged countess could not encounter the cold march winds and had a dispensation and thus alice being the lady of the procession contrived at the same time to call sir patrick to her side and bid lord malcolm lead the lady esclairmonde  for as the weather was dry and cold lady montagu had chosen to go on foot and a grand procession it was that she led of gentlemen and ladies two and two in their bright dresses and adornments that delighted the eyes of the homely yeomen and their wives flocking in from their homesteads with baskets of offerings often in kind  meantime malcolm holding the tips of esclairmondes fingers durst not speak till she began this is a devout and pious householdfull of peace and good government  and your time goes happily here asked malcolm  yes it has been a peaceful harbour wherein to wait said esclairmonde and even if alice were called to her husband in france my lady countess will keep me with her till there be a vacancy for me at st katharines  have you the promise from queen joan  yes replied esclairmonde  the countess had been a lady of hers and wrought with her so that whenever the post of bedeswoman is in her gift i shall be preferred to it  you the heiress accept the charity malcolm could not help exclaiming  the better for all remnants of pride returned the lady  and you my lord has it fared well with you  malcolm happy in her interest poured forth all that he had to tell and she listened as esclairmonde alone could listen  there was something in her very expression of attention that seemed to make the speaker take out the alloy and leave only his purest gold to meet her ears  malcolm forgot those throbs of foolish wild hope that had shot across him like demon temptations to hermit saints and only felt that the creature of his love and reverence was listening benignly as he told her of the exceeding delight that he was unravelling in learned lore how each step showed him further heights and how he had come to view the light of the world as the light of wisdom to the research of which he meant to devote his entire life among universities and manuscripts  the light of wisdom repeated esclairmondeso it may be for christ is heavenly wisdom but i doubt me if the light of the world lies solely in books and universities  nay said malcolm  once i was fool enough to fancy it was the light of glory calling knights to deeds of fame and chivalry  i have seen mine error now andoh lady what mean you where should that light be save in the writings of wise and holy men  methinks said esclairmonde that the light is there even as the light is also before the eyes of the true knight but it is not only there  where is it then said malcolm  in helmet or in cowl i am the sworn champion of the light of the world  the light said esclairmonde looking upwards the true light of the world is the blessed saviour the heavenly wisdom of god and his champions find him and serve him in camp cloister or school or wherever he has marked their path so as they seek not their own profit or glory and lay not up their treasure for themselves on earth  then surely said malcolm the hoards of deep study within the mind are treasures beyond the earth  your schoolmen speak of spirit mind and body said esclairmondeat least so i an ignorant woman have been told  should not the true light for eternity lighten the spirit rather than the mind  malcolm pondered and said i thought i had found the right path at last  naynever never did i say otherwise cried esclairmonde  to seek gods light in good mens words and pursue it must be a blessed task every task must be blessed to which he leads  and when you are enlightened with that light you will hold it up to others  when you have found the treasure you will scatter it here and so lay it up above  esclairmondes words were almost a riddle to malcolm but his reverence for her made him lay them up deeply as he watched her kneeling at the mass her upturned face beaming with an angelic expression  his mind was much calmed by this meeting  it had had an absolutely contrary effect to what king james had expected by spiritualizing his love and increasing that reverence which cast out its earthliness  that first throb which had been so keen at meeting and knowing her not for him had passed away in the refining of that distant worship he had paid her in those days of innocence  lady montagu was quite satisfied with him now  he was the malcolm of her first acquaintance only without his foolish diffidence and with a weight and earnestness that made him a man and not a boy and she cordially invited him to bring his sister with him and rest on the way southward  he agreed most thankfully since this would be the only opportunity of showing esclairmonde and lilias one to the other as well as one of his own few chances of seeing esclairmonde  once they must meet that their promises might be restored the one to the other but as the betrothal remained the ladys security this could not be done till she became pledged at st katharines  when the opportunity came she was to send malcolm a messenger and he would come to her at once  until then he promised that he would not leave great britain  on monday the cousins proceeded coming after a time to the route by which malcolm had ridden three years before and where he was now at home in comparison with patrick  how redolent it was with recollections of king harry in all his gaiety and grace ere the shock of his brothers death had fallen on him  at thirsk malcolm told of the prowess and the knighthood of honest trenton and kitson to somewhat incredulous ears the two squires had been held as clownish fellows and the sentiment of the country was that mistress agnes was well quit of them and the rough guardianship by which they had kept off all other suitors  as mine host concluded tis a fine thing to go to the wars  hearing that kitsons mother lived not a mile out of his way malcolm rode to the fine old moated grange where he found her sitting at her spinning presiding over a great plentiful household while her second son a much shrewderlooking man than sir christopher managed the farm  the travellers were welcomed with eager hospitality so soon as it was understood that they brought tidings of our kit and malcolms story was listened to with tears of joy by the old lady while the brother could not get over his amazement at hearing that trenton and kitson had become a proverb in the camp for oneness in friendship  made it up with will trenton  and never fought it out  id never know our kit again after that  his steady bravery his knighthood and the kings praise his having assisted in saving lord glenuskies life against such odds did not seem to strike wilfred kitson half as much as the friendship with trenton and malcolm did not think the regret was very great at the two knights having given up their intention of returning  our kits place seemed to have closed up behind him wilfred seemed to be too much master to be ready to give up to the elder brother and even the mother had learnt to do without him  ill warrant quoth she that now he is a knight and got used to fine french ways hell think nothing good enow for him  and if he brought will trenton with him id not sit at the board with the fellowbut yell ride over wilfred and take care the minx agnes knows what shes lost  ay and if you knew of a safe hand sir when the shearing is over id send the lad a purse of nobles to keep up his knighthood in the camp forsooth  certes said malcolm as after a saltfish dinner he mounted again if honest kitson knew he would scarce turn back from the camp where he is somebody  shall we find ourselves as little wanted when we get home patie  patrick drew himself up with a happy face of secret assurance  nothing could make lilias forsake him he well knew  at durham they found their good friend father akefield erst prior of coldingham but who had been violently dispossessed by the house of albany in favour of their candidate drax about a year before and was thankful to have been allowed with a few english monks to retire across the border to the mother abbey at durham  the good father could hardly believe his eyes when he beheld malcolm now a comely and personable young gentleman less handsome and graceful indeed than many but with all his painful personal peculiarities gone with none of the scared imploring look but with a grave thoughtful earnestness about his face as though all that once was timid and wandering was now fixed and steadfast  father akefield could tell nothing of lilias since his own expulsion but as the prioress of st abbs was herself a drummond and no one durst interfere with her he had no alarms for her safety  but he advised the two gentlemen to go straight to st abbs without showing themselves at coldingham lest prior drax being in the albany interest should make any demur at giving her up to the care of the brother who still wanted some months of his twentyfirst year  accordingly they pushed on and in due time slept at berwick receiving civilities from the english governor that chafed patricks blood which became inflammable as soon as he neared the border and rising early the next morning they passed the gates and were on scottish ground once more their hearts bounding at the sense that it was their own land and would soon be no more a land of misrule  with their knowledge of king james and his intentions well might they have unlimited hopes for the country over which he was about to reign  they turned aside from coldingham and made for the sea and at length the promontory of st abbs head rose before them they passed through the outer buildings intended as shelter for the attendants of ladies coming to the nunnery and knocked at the gateway  a wicket in the door was opened and the portress looked out through a grating  benedicite good sister said malcolm  prithee tell the mother abbess that malcolm stewart of glenuskie is here from the king and craves to speak with her and the lady lilias  lord malcolm  lady lilias  st ebbas good mercy shrieked the affrighted portress  they heard her rushing headlong across the court and looked on one another in consternation  patrick betook himself to knocking as if he would beat down the door and malcolm leant against it with a foreboding that took away his breathdreading the moment when it should be opened  the portress and her keys returned again and parleyed a moment  you are the lord malcolm in very deedin the flesh  wherefore not demanded malcolm  nay but we heard ye were slain my lord explained the portressletting him in however and leading them across the court to where the mother abbess annabel drummond awaited them in the parlour  alas sirs what grievous error has this been was her exclamation while malcolm scarcely waiting for salutation demanded where is my sister  how  in st hildas keeping at whitby whither the king sent for her said the abbess  the king cried malcolm we come from the king  oh what treachery has been here  and you lord malcolmand you my kinsman sir patrick of the braes how do i see you here  we had heard you both were dead  you heard a lying tale then good mother said patrick gruffly no doubt devised for the misery of theof my  he could not finish the sentence and malcolm entreated the abbess to tell the whole  it appeared that about a year previously the chaplain of the monastery had learnt at coldingham that sir john swinton of swinton had sent home tidings that patrick drummond had been thrown from his horse and left behind in a village which the english had harried and as he could not move he was sure to have been either burnt or hung  this conclusion was natural and argued no malice in the reporter and while poor lilias was still in her first agony of grief prior drax sent over intelligence derived from the duke of albany himself that malcolm stewart of glenuskie had been stabbed in the forest of vincennes  this report malcolm himself accounted for  he had heard a scots tongue among his foes though national feeling had made him utterly silent on that head to the duke of bedford and he guessed it to belong to a certain mkay whose clan regarded themselves as at feud with the stewarts and of whom he had heard as living a wild routier life  he had probably been hired by ghisbert for the attack and had returned home and spread the report of its success  some few weeks later the abbess annabel continued there had arrived two monks from coldingham with an escort declaring themselves to have received orders from king james to transport the lady lilias to the nunnery at whitby where the abbess had promised to receive her till he could determine her fate  the forlorn and desolate lilias believing herself to stand alone in the world was very loth to quit her shelter and her friends at st abbs but the abbess doubting her own ability to protect her from the rapacious grasp of walter stewart now that she had as she believed become an heiress and glad to avert from her house the persecution that such protection would bring upon it had gratefully heard of this act of consideration on the kings part and expedited her departure  the two monks simon bell and ringan johnstone had not returned to the monastery but had been thought to be in the parent house at durham but malcolm who knew brother simon by sight was clear that he had not seen him there  all this had taken place a year ago and there could be no doubt that some treachery had been exercised  nothing had since been heard of lilias none of malcolms letters had reached st abbs having doubtless been suppressed by the prior of coldingham and all that was certain was that walter stewart to whom their first suspicions directed themselves had not publicly avouched any marriage with lilias or claimed the glenuskie estates or the king who had of late been in close correspondence with scotland must have heard of it  and it was also hardly possible that the regent murdoch and his sons though they might for a few weeks have been misled by mkays report should not have soon become aware of malcolms existence  unless then walter had married her on the first brash as patrick called it he might not have thought her a prize worth the winning but the whole aspect of affairs had become most alarming and malcolm turned pale as death at the thought that his sister might be suffering retribution for the sin he had contemplated  the danger was terrible  he could not imagine lilias to have the moral grandeur and force of esclairmonde  moreover she supposed her lover dead and had not the same motive for guarding her troth  forlorn and despairing she might have yielded and walter stewart was malcolm verily believed worse to deal with than even boemond  as the whole danger and uncertainty came over him his senses seemed to reel he leant back in his seat and heard as in the midst of a dream his sisters sobs and groans patricks fierce and furious exclamations and the abbesss attempts at consoling him  dizzy with horror at the scene he realized liliass cries and shrieks of entreaty were ringing in his ear when suddenly a sweet full low voice seemed to come through them i am bound ever to pray for you and your sister  mingled with the cry came ever the sweet soft litany cadencesfor all that are desolate and oppressed we beseech thee to hear us good lord gradually the cries seemed to be swallowed up both voices blended in kyrie eleison and then in the gloria and at that moment he became aware of patrick crying i will seek her in every castle in scotland  stay patrick he said rising though forced to hold by his chair that must be my part  youwhy the laddie is white as a sheet  he wellnigh swooned at the tidings  you seek her forsooth and patrick laughed bitterly  yes patie said malcolm for this i am strong  it is my duty and not yours and god will strengthen me for it  patrick burst out at this neither man nor devil shall tell me it is not mine  you are the kings prisoner still said malcolm rising to energy you are bound to return to him  the tidings must be taken to him at once  a groom could do that  neither so swiftly nor surely as you  moreover your word of honour binds you not to wander at your own pleasure  my honour binds me not to trust youwee malcolmto wander into the wolfs cage alone  i am not the silly feckless callant i once was patie answered malcolm  there are many places where my students serge gown will take me safely where your corslet and lance would never find entrance  no one will know me again as i am now will they holy mother  assuredly not said the abbess  a student is too mean a prey to be meddled with proceeded malcolm and is sure of hospitality in castle or convent  i can try at coldingham to find out whither the two monks are gone and then follow up the track  patrick stormed at the plan and was most unwilling it should be adopted he at least must follow and keep watch over his young cousin or it would be a mere throwing the helve after the hatcheta betrayal of his trust  but a little reflection convinced him that thus to follow would only bring suspicion on malcolm and defeat his plans and that it were better to obtain some certain information ere the king should come home and have to interfere with a high hand and malcolms arguments about his obligations as a captive too had their effect  he perceived his own incapacity to act and in his despair at nothing being done consented to risk malcolm in the search while he himself should proceed to the king only ascertaining on the way that lilias was not at whitby  and so in grief and anxiety the cousins parted and malcolm alone durst speak a word of hope     chapter xvii the begging scholar   the poor scholar now only existing in ireland and brittanynay we believe extinct there since the schoolmaster has become not abroad but at home in government collegeswas to be found throughout the commonwealth of europe in the middle ages  young lads in whom convent schools had developed a thirst for learning could only gratify it by making their way to some university where between begging singing teaching receiving doles earning rewards in encounters of wit and learning doing menial services and using all manner of shifts they contrived to live a hard life half savage on the one side highly intellectual upon the other  they would suck the marrow of one university and then migrate to another and the rank they had gained in the first was available in the second so that it was no means uncommon for them to bring away degrees from half the universities in europe all of which formed one general systemall were like islands of one country whose common language was queer latin and whose terms manners and customs were alike in all main points  scotland contributed many of her sons to this curious race of vagabond students when she herself was without any university to satisfy the cravings of her thoughtful and intellectual people  no country without a scot or a flea was an uncomplimentary proverb due to the numerous young clerks equally fierce for frays and for lectures who flocked to the seats of learning on the continent and sometimes became naturalized there sometimes came home again to fight their way to the higher benefices of the church or to become councillors of state  it was true that malcolm was an oxford scholar or rather bachelor and that oxford and cambridge were almost the only universities where scots were nottheir place being taken by multitudinous irish yet not only were all universities alike in essentials but he had seen and heard enough of that at paris to be able to personate a clerk from thence  it was no small plunge for one hitherto watched tended and guarded as malcolm had been to set forth entirely alone but as he had approached manhood and strengthened in body his spirit had gained much in courage and the anxiety about his sister swallowed up all other considerations even while he entreated the prayers of the abbess he felt quite sure that he had those of esclairmonde and when he had hunted out of his mails the plain bachelors rabbitskin hood and black gownwhich perhaps was a little too fine in texture for the poor wandererand fastened on his back with a leathern thong a package containing a few books and a change of linen his pale and intellectual face made him look so entirely the young clerk that patrick hardly believed it was malcolm  and when the roads parted and drummond and his escort had to turn towards berwick while malcolm took the path to the monastery it was the younger who was the stronger and more resolute of the two for patrick could neither reconcile himself to peril the boy who had always been his anxious trust nor to return to the king without him and yet no one who loved lilias could withhold him from his quest  malcolm did not immediately speed to the monastery on taking leave of patrick  he stood first to watch the armour flashes gradually die away and the little troop grow smaller to his eye across the brown moor till they were entirely out of sight and he himself left alone  then he knelt by a bush of gorse told his beads and earnestly entreated direction and aid for himself and protection for his sister and when the sun grew so low as to make it time for a wanderer to seek harbour he stained and daggled his gown in the mire and water of a peatmoss so as to destroy its oxford gloss took a book in his hand and walked towards the monastery reciting latin verses in the singsong tone then universally followed  as he came among the fields he saw that the peasants and lay brethren who had been working among them were returning some from sowing others from herding the cattle which they drove before them to the byre within the protecting wall of the monastery  a monkwith a weatherbeaten face and athletic figure much like a farmers of the present dayovertook him and hailed him with benedicite you there and welcome to your clerkship  are you coming for supper and bed in the convent  malcolm knew goodnatured brother nicolas and kept his hood well over his face after the first salutation though he felt confident that lord malcolm could hardly be recognized in the begging scholar as he made reply salve reverende frater  venio de lutetia parisiorum 1  whisht with your latin laddie said the brother  speak out if youve a scots tongue in your head and have not left it in foreign parts  for bed and board holy father i shall be most thankful replied malcolm  thats more like it said the brother who acted as a kind of farming steward and was a hearty goodnatured gossip  an whats the name of ye  he gave his real christian name and added that he came from glenuskie where the good tutor of glenuskie had been kind enough to notice him  ay said brother nicolas he was a guid man to all towardly youths  he died in this house mores the pity  yea sirso i heard say returned malcolm  he was a good friend to me he added to cover his heavy sigh  and sir how went it with the young laird and leddy  for the young lairda feckless ugsome sickly wean he was puir laddiea knight cam by an behoved to take him to the king  nay but if youve been at parishif thats what ye mean with your lutetiayell have seen him an the king  i saw the king answered malcolm but among the englishry  a sorry sight enow said the monk but hell soon find his scots heart again and here weve got rid of the english leaven from the house and be all sound and leal scots here  and the lady malcolm ventured to ask  she had a winsome face  ho ho what have young clerks to do wi winsome faces laughed the benedictine  she was good to me malcolm could truly say  they had her in st abbs yonder said the monk  is she there asked malcolm  i would pay my duty and thanks to her  nowthere i cannot say replied brother nicolas  my good mother abbess and our prior are not the friends they were in prior akefields time and theres less coming and going between the houses  there was a noise that lord malcolm had been slain and i did hear that thereupon she had been claimed as a ward of the crown  but i cannot say  if ye gang to st abbs the morn ye may hear if she be thereand at any rate get the dole  it was clear that the good brother knew no more and malcolm could only thank him for his condescension and follow among the herdsmen into the wellknown monastery court  here he availed himself of his avowed connection with glenuskie to beg to be shown good old sir david drummonds grave  a flat gray stone in the porch was pointed out to him and beside this he knelt until the monks flocked in for prayerswhich were but carelessly and hurriedly sung and then followed supper  it was all so natural to him that it was with an effort that he recalled that his place was not at the high table as lord malcolm stewart but that malcolm the nameless begging scholar must be trencherfellow with the servants and lay brethren  he was the less concerned that here there was less danger of recognition and more freedom of conversation  things were evidently much altered  a novice was indeed as usual placed aloft in the refectory pulpit to read aloud to the brethren during their repast but no one seemed to think it needful to preserve the decorous silence that had been rigidly exacted during prior akefields time and there was a continual buzz of conversation  lent though it was the fish was of the most esteemed kinds and it was evident that like the monks of melrose they made gude kale  few of the kindly old faces that malcolm remembered were to be seen under their cowls  prior drax himself had much more the countenance of a mosstrooper than of a monkmayhap he was then meditating that which he afterwards carried out successfully ie the capture and appropriation of a whole instalment of king jamess ransom on its way across the border and there was a rude recklessness and selfindulgence about the looks voices and manners of the brethren he had brought with him such as made malcolm feel that if he had had his wish and remained at coldingham he should soon have found it no haven of peace  the laybrothers and old servants were fixtures but the old faithful and devout ones looked forlorn and unhappy and there had been a great importation of the ruffianly menatarms whom the more pugnacious ecclesiastics as well as nobles of scotland were apt to maintain guards there had been in old times but kept under strict discipline whereas in the rude conduct of these men there was no sign that they knew themselves to be in a religious house  malcolm keeping aloof from these as much as might be gave such an account of himself as was most consistent with truth since it was necessary to account for his returning so young from his studies  he had he said been told that there was an inheritance fallen due to him and that the kinsman in whose charge his sister had been left was dead and he had come home to seek her out and inquire into the matter of his heirship  rude jokes from some of the new denizens of the monastery were spent on the improbability of his finding sister or lands if it were in the barony of glenuskie the house of albany had taken the administration of that into their own hands  naybut said malcolm could i but see my young lady lilias she might make suit for me  the grayheaded laybrother to whom he addressed himself replied that it was little the lady lilias could do but directed him to st abbs to find her whereat one of the menatarms burst out laughing and crying thats a that ye ken auld davie  as though the master of albany would let a bonnie lassie ware hersel and her tocher on stone walls and dour old nuns  has she wedded the master of albany then asked malcolm concealing his anxiety as best he might  thats as he pleases and by my troth he took pains enow to get her  what pains  why once she slipped out of his very fingers that time that he had laid hands on her and the hirpling doited brother of hers cam down with a strange knight put her into st abbs and made off for englandso they said  some of the rogues would have it twas st andrew in bodily shape and that he tirled the young laird as was only fit for a saint aff to heaven wi him for he was no more seen in these parts  nay that couldna be put in another soldier  sandy mkay took his aith that he was in the english campmore shame till himan was stickit dead for meddling between king harrys brother and his luve  it sorted him weel i say  aweel continued the first gane is he and sma loss wi him  an yon old beldame over at st abbs she kens weel how to keep a lass wi a tocherso what does the master but sends a letter ower to our prior bidding him send two trusty brethren as though from the king to conduct her to whitby  ha said malcolm but thats ower the border  even so but the glenuskies are all english at heart and it sicker trained away the silly lassie  and thenthe other manatarms laughed  why at the first hostelry ye can guess what sort of nuns were ready to meet her  i promise ye she skirled and caed heaven and earth to help but brother simon and brother ringan gave their word theyd see nae ill dune to her and she rade with them on each side of her and us tall fellows behind and before till we cam to doune  and what became of her the poor lassie then inquired malcolm steadying his voice with much effort  ye maun ask the master that said the soldier  i ken nae mair i was sent on anither little errand of the earl of fife into the highlands and only cam back hither a week syne to watch the border  had it been st andrew that saved her before he wad hae come again pondered the laybrother  hed hardly hae given her up  weel i heard the lassie cry on the master to mind the aith he had made the former time an though he tried to laugh her to scorn his eyes grew wild and there were some that telld me they lookit to see that glittering awsome knight among them again  my certie they maun hae been feared enow the time he did come  malcolm had now had his fears and suspicions so far confirmed that he perceived what his course should next be  strange to say in spite of the horror of knowing his sister to have been a whole year in walter stewarts power he was neither hopeless nor disheartened  lilias seemed to have kept her persecutor at bay once and she might have done so againif only by the appeal to the mysterious relic on which his oath to abstain from violence had been sworn  and confidence in esclairmondes prayers continued to buoy him up as he recited his own and formed his designs for ascertaining whether she were to be found at douneeither as wife or as captive to walter earl of fife and heir of albany  so soon as the doors of coldingham priory were opened he was on his way northward  it was a sore and trying journey in the bitter march weather for one so little used to hardship  he did not fail in obtaining shelter or food his garb was everywhere a passport but he grew weary and footsore and his anxiety greatly increased when he found that fatigue was bringing back the lameness which greatly enhanced the likelihood of his being recognized  kind monks and friendly gudewives hospitably persuaded the worn student to remain and rest till his blistered feet were whole but he pressed on whenever he found it possible to travel and after the first week found his progress less tardy and painful  resting at edinburgh for passiontide and easter day he found that the regent albany himself with all his family were at doune and he accordingly made his way thither rejoicing that he had had some little time to perfect himself in his part before rehearsing it to the persons most likely to detect his disguise  along the banks and braes of bonny doune he slowly moved with weary limbs looking up to the huge pile of the majestic castle in sickening of heart at the doubt that was about to become a certainty and that involved the happiness or the absolute misery of his sisters life  nay he would almost have preferred to find that she had perished in her resistance rather than have become wife to such a man as walter stewart  the duke of albany as representing majesty kept up all the state that scottish majesty was capable of in its impoverished irregular state hosts of rough lawless warriors menatarms squires and knights lived at free quarters in a sort of rude plenty in and about the castle eating and drinking at the regents expense sleeping where they could in hall or stable and for clothing and armour trusting to spulzie always ready for violence without much caring on whom exercisedotherwise hunting or lounging or swelling their masters disorderly train  this retinue was almost at its largest at this time being swelled by the following of the two younger sons of murdoch robert and alexander and the courts of the castle were filled with rude savagelooking men some few grooming horses others with nothing to do but to shout forth their jeers at the pale blackgowned student who timidly limped into their lair  timidlyyes for the awful chances heavily oppressed him and the horrible scurrility and savagery that greeted him on all sides made his heart faint at the thought of his lily in this cage of foul animals  he did not fear for himself and never paused until a shouting circle of idle ruffians set themselves full in his way to badger and bait the poor scholar with taunts and insultshemming him in bawling out ribald mirth as a pack of hounds fall on some stray dog or as malcolm thought in a moment half of sick horror half of resolute resignation like wild cattlefat bulls of bashan closing in on every side  so horrible a moment of distress he had never known but suddenly as he stood summoning all his strength panting with dismay inwardly praying and trying to close his ears and commend himself to one who knew what mockery is there was an opening of the crowd a youth darted down among them with a loud cry of shame  out on you  a poor scholar and taking malcolms hand led him forward while a laugh of mockery rose in the distancelike to like  ay my friend and brother i am baccalaureus even as you are eagerly said the young gentleman in whom malcolm somewhat to his alarm recognized his cousin james kennedy the kings nephew a real parisian bejanus or bec jaune 2 when they last had met in the hotel de st pol and thus not only qualified to confute and expose him should he show any ignorance of details but also much more likely to know him than those who had not seen him for many months before he had left scotland  but james kennedy asked no questions only said kindly in the latin that was always spoken in the university pray pardon us  mores hyperboreis desunt 3  the regent would be grieved if he knew how these scelerati 4 have sorted you  come rest and washit will soon be suppertime  he took malcolm to an inner court filled for him a cup of ale for his immediate refreshment and led him to a spout of clear water in the side of the rock on which the castle stood where a stone basin afforded the only facilities for washing that the greater part of the inhabitants of the castle expected and in effect more than they commonly used malcolm however was heartily glad of the refreshment of removing the dust from his weary face and feetand heartily thanked his protector in the same doglatin  kennedy waited for him and as a great bell began to ring said pro caena 5 and conducted him towards the great hall while malcolm felt much impelled to make himself known but was conscious that he had not so comported himself towards his cousin at paris as to deserve much favour from him  a high table was spread in the hall with the usual appliances befitting princes and nobles  the other tables below the dais were of the rudest description and stained with accumulations of grease and ale and no wonder since trenchers were not and each man hacked a gobbet for himself from the huge pieces of beef carried round on spitsnor would the guests have had any objection during a campaign to cook the meat in the fashion described by froissart between themselves and the saddle these were the squirearchy malcolms late persecutors did not aspire to the benches around these boards or only at second hand and for the most part had no seat but the unclean straw and rushes that strewed the floor  as james kennedy entered the hall with malcolm there came from another door marshalled by the seneschal in full feudal state the regent duke of albany himself his wife a daughter or two two sonsand malcolm saw with beating heart lilias herself pale worn sorrowfullooking grievously altered but still his own lily  others followed chiefly knights and attendants but malcolm saw no one but lily  she took her place dejectedly and never raised her eyes towards him even when on the regents question what have ye there jamie  kennedy stood forth and answered that it was a scholar a student for whom he asked the hospitality of his kinsman  he is welcome said the regent a man of easy goodnature whose chief misfortune was that being of weak nature he came between a wicked father and wickeder sons  he was a handsome man with much of the stately appearance of king james himself and the same complexion but it was that sort of likeness which was almost provoking by seeming to detract from the majesty of the lineaments themselves as seen in him who alone knew how to make them a mask for a great soul  his two sons robert and alexander laughed as they saw kennedys companion and called out so thats the brotherhood of learning is it jamieforgathering with any beggar in the street  yea said kennedy nothing daunted and finding him much better mannered than you  ay sighed murdoch feebly when i grew up it was at the castles of perth and doune that we looked for the best manners  now  we leave them to the lickplatters that have to live by them said alexander rudely  kennedy meanwhile gave the young scholar in charge to a grayheaded retainer who seemed one of the few who had any remains of goodbreeding and then offered to say gracehe being the nearest approach to an ecclesiastic presentas the chaplain was gone to an easter festivity at his abbey  malcolm thus obtained a seat at the second table and a tolerable share of supper but he could hardly eat from intense anxiety and scarcely knew whether to be glad or sorry that he was out of sight of lily  by and by a moments lull of the universal din enabled malcolm to hear the regent saying verily there is a look of gentle nurture about the lad  look you james when the tables are drawn you shall hold a disputation with him  it will be sport to hear how you chop logic at your universities yonder  malcolms spirit sank  such disputations were perfectly ordinary work at both oxford and paris and usually he was quite capable of sustaining his part in them but his heart was so full his mind so anxious his condition so dangerous that he felt as if he could by no means rally that alertness of argument and readiness of quotation that were requisite even in the merest tyro  however he made a great effort  he secretly invoked the light of wisdom tried to think himself back into the aisles of st marys church and to call up the keynotes of some of the stock arguments hoping that if the selection of the subject were left to kennedy he would hit on one of those most familiar at oxford  the supper was ended the tables were removed and the challenge took place  duke murdoch leaning back in his high chair by the peatfire while the ladies sat round at their spinning called for the two young clerks to begin their tourney of words  they stood opposite one another on the step of the dais and kennedy as host and challenger assigned to his opponent the choice of a subject when malcolm brightening proposed one that he had so often heard and practised on as to have the arguments at his fingers ends namely that the real consists only in that which is substantial to the senses and which we see hear taste smell or touch  kennedys shrewd gray eye glanced at him in a manner that startled him as he made reply fellowalumnus you speak as oxford scholars speak but i rede ye well that the real is not that which is grossly tangible to the corporeal sense but the idea that is conceived within the immortal intelligence  the argument was carried on in the vernacular but there was an unlimited license of quotation from authors of all kinds classics fathers and schoolmen  it was like a game at chess in which the first moves were always so much alike that they might have been made by automatons and malcolm was repeating reply and counterreply almost by rote when a citation brought in by kennedy again startled him  outward things said james are the mere mark for have we not heard how     telephus et peleus quum pauper et exsul uterque    projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba 6  was this to prove that he recognized a wandering prince in his opponent thought malcolm but much on his guard he made answer as usual in his native tongue  that which is not touched and held is but a vain and fleeting shadowsolvitur in nube 7  negatur it is denied said kennedy fixing his eyes full upon him the speculum of the soul which is immortal retains the image even while the bodily presence is far away  wherefore else was it that ulysses sat as a beggar by his paternal hearth or that cadmus wandered to seek his sister  this was anything but the regular illustrationthe argument was far too directly ad hominemand malcolm hesitated for a moment ere framing his reply  if the image had satisfied the craving of their hearts they had never wandered nor endangered themselves  nor said kennedy endeared themselves to all who love the leal and the brave and count these indeed as verities for which to live  from the manner in which these words were spoken malcolm had no further doubt either that kennedy knew him or that he meant to assist him and the discussion thenceforth proceeded without further departures from the regular style and was sustained with considerable spirit till the regent grew weary of it and bedtime approached when kennedy announced his intention of taking his fellowstudent to share his chamber and as this did not appear at all an unnatural proposal in the crowded castle malcolm followed him up various winding stairs into a small circular chamber with a loophole window within one of the flanking towers  carefully closing the heavy door kennedy held out his hands  fair cousin he said this is bravely done of you  will it save my sister asked malcolm anxiously  it should said his kinsman but how can it be  whatever is done must be ere walter stewart returns  tell me all  i know nothingsave that she was cruelly lured from st abbs  i know little more said kennedy  it was on a false report of your death and walter had wellnigh obtained a forcible marriage when her resistance and cries to heaven daunted the monk who was to have performed the rite so that he in a sort became her protector  when she was brought here walter swore he would bend her to his will shut her up in the old keep and kept her there scantily fed and a close prisoner while he went forth on one of his forays  the regent coming here meantime found the poor maiden in her captivity and freed her so far that she lives to all appearance as becomes his kinswoman but the duchess is cruelly strict with her being resolved as she says to take down her pride  they must know that i live said malcolm  they do but walter is none the less resolved not to be balked  things came to a wild pass a few weeks syne  the regent had never dared tell him how far matters had gone for bringing back the king when one day walter came in clad for hawking and in his rudest manner demanded the falcon that was wont to sit on his fathers wrist and that had never been taken out by any other  the regent refused to part with the bird as he had oft done before whereupon his son in his fury snatched her from his wrist and wrung her head off before all our eyes then turning fiercely on your poor sister told her that yon gled should be a token to her of how they fared who withheld themselves from him  then rose the duke trembling within rage ay wat said he ye hae been owermuch for me  we will soon have ane at home that will ken how to guide ye  walter looked at him insolently and muttered ive heard of this before  they that wad have a master may live under a masterbut im not ane of them and then turning upon lady lilias he pointed to the dead hawk and told her that unless she yielded to him with a good grace that bird showed her what she might expect long ere the king or her brother were across the border  and where is he now  in fife striving to get a force together to hinder the kings return hell not do that men are too weary of misrule to join him against king james but he is like any day to come back with reivers enough to terrify his father and get your sister into his handsindeed his mother is ready to give her up to him whenever he asks  he has sworn to have her now were it merely to vex the king and you and show that he is to be daunted neither by man heaven nor hell  and he may come  any day or any night said james  since he went i have striven in vain to devise some escape for your sister but heaven has surely sent you to hinder so foul a wrong  yet if you went to glenuskie and raised your vassals  it would be loss of time said malcolm and this matter may not be put to the doubtful issue of a fray between my men and his villains  out of this place must she go at once  but alas how win to the speech of her  that can i do said kennedy  for a few brief moments each day have i spoken to her in the chapel  nay i had left this place before now had she not prayed me to remain as her only friend  heaven must requite you cousin james said malcolm warmly  i deserved not this of you  all that i desire said kennedy is to see this land of ours cease to be full of darkness and cruel habitations  malcolm you know the king better than i may we not trust that he will come as a redresser of wrongs  know you not his pledge to himselfi will make the key keep the castle and the bracken bush keep the cow though i live the life of a dog to bring it about  god strengthen his hand said kennedy with tears in his eyes and bring better days to our poor land  cousin has not your heart burnt within you to be doing somewhat to bring these countrymen of ours to better mind  i have grieved said malcolm  the sight has been the woe and horror of my whole life and either it is worse now than when i went away or i see it clearer  it is both said kennedy and malcolm it is borne in on me that we who have seen better things have a heavy charge  the king may punish marauders and enforce peace but it will be but the rule of the strong hand unless mens hearts be moved  our clergythey bear the office of priestsbut their fierceness and their ignorance would scarce be believed in france or england and how should it be otherwise with no schools at home save the abbeysand the abbeys almost all fortresses held by fierce noblemens sons  malcolm would much rather have discussed the means of rescuing his sister but james kennedys heart was full of a youths ardent plans for the reawakening of religion in his country chiefly through the improved education of the clergy and it was not easy to bring his discourse to a close  youyou were to wed a great flemish heiress he said  you will do your part cousin in the founding of a universitysuch as has changed ourselves so greatly  malcolm smiled  my only bride is learning he said my other betrothal is but in name for the safety of the lady  then cried kennedy joyfully you will give yourself  learning and culture turned to gods service for this poor countrys sake in one of birth like you may change her indeed  was this the reading of esclairmondes riddle suddenly thought malcolm was the true search for heavenly light then to consist in holding up to his countrymen the lamp he was kindling for himself  must true wisdom consist in treasuring knowledge not for his own honour among learned men or the delectation of his own mind but to scatter it among these rude northern souls  must the vision of learned research and scholarly calm vanish as cloistral peace and chivalrous love and glory had vanished before and was the lot of a hardworking secular priest that which called him     chapter xviii clerk davie   for malcolm to speak with his sister was wellnigh an impossibility  had he been detected he would have been immediately treated as a spy and the suspicion thus excited would have been a dangerous preparation for the king as well as for himself nor was there any pretext for giving the wandering scholar an interview with her  but harsh and strict as was the duchess of albanya tall rawboned red haired woman daughter of the fierce old earl of lennoxand resolved as she was to bend lilias by persecution to accept her son she could not debar a young gentleman of the royal kindred like james kennedy from entering the apartment where the ladies of the family sat with their needles and the regent half from pity half from shame had refused to permit lilias stewarts being treated as a mere captive  thus malcolm remained in kennedys room in much anxiety while his cousin went forth to do his best in his cause and after some hours returned to him with the tidings that he had succeeded in letting lily know that he was in the castle  standing over her while she bent over her embroidery and thus concealing her trembling agitation he had found it possible to whisper in her ears the tidings of her brother having come to save her and of hearing her insist that malcolm wee malcolm must run no peril but that she would do and dare everythingnay would prefer death itself to walter stewart  have you any device in this matter demanded james kennedy when he had thus spoken  have you your college gown here inquired malcolm  i have in yon kist said kennedy  would you disguise her therein you and she are nearly of a height  ay said malcolm  the plot i thought on is thisthe worst is that the risk rests with you  that is naught less than naught said kennedy  i had risked myself ten times over had i seen any hope for her in so doing  malcolm then explained his plan namely that if lilias could have kennedys gown conveyed to her she should array herself therein and be conducted out of the castle by her cousin by one gate he himself in secular garb going by another and joining at some place of meeting whence as a pair of brothers malcolm and she might gain the english border  james kennedy considered and then added that he could improve on the plan  he had long intended leaving doune for his brothers castle but only tarried in case he could do anything for lilias  he would at supper publicly announce to the regent his departure for the next day and also say that he had detained his fellowscholar to go within him  then arranging for malcolms exit in a secular dress among his escort as one of the many unobserved loungers lilias should go with him in very early morning in the bachelors gown which he would place in a corner of a dark passage where she could find it  then if malcolm and she turned aside from his escort as the pursuit as soon as her evasion was discovered would be immediately directed on himself they would have the more time for escape  it was a complicated plan but there was this recommendation that malcolm need not lose sight of his sister  clerk as he was young kennedy could not ride without an escort and among his followers he could place malcolm  accordingly at supper he announced his desire to leave doune at dawn next morning and was as a matter of course courteously pressed to remain  malcolm in the meantime eluded observation as much as possible while watching his sister who in spite of all her efforts was pale and red by turns never durst glance towards him and trembled whenever any one went near him  the ladies at length swept out of the hall and robert and alexander called for more wine for a reresupper to drink to jamess good journey but kennedy tore himself from their hospitable violence and again he and malcolm were alone spending a night of anxiety and consultation  morning came malcolm arrayed himself in a somewhat worn dress of kennedys with the belt and dirk he had carried under his scholars garb now without and a steel cap that his cousin had procured for him on his head  with a parcel in his arms of kennedys gear he might pass for a servant sent from home to meet him and so soon as this disguise was complete kennedy opened the door  on the turret stair stood a hooded black figure that started as the door opened  malcolms heart might well seem to leap to his lips but both brother and sister felt the tension of nerve that caution required too much to give way for a moment  kennedy whispered your license fair cousin and passed on with the free step of lordly birth while a few paces behind the seeming scholar humbly followed and malcolm putting on his soldiers tread and the careless freeandeasy bearing he had affected before meaux brought up the rear with master kennedys mails  as they anticipated the household was not troubling itself to rise to see the priest off  not that this made the coast clear for the floor of the hall was cumbered with snoring sleepers in all sorts of attitudesnay at the upper table the flushed debauched though young and handsome faces of robert and alexander stewart might have been detected among those who lay snoring among the relics of their last nights revel  the old steward was however up and alert ready to offer the stirrup cup and the horses were waiting in the court but what they had by no means expected or desired was that duke murdoch himself in his long furred gown came slowly across the hall to bid his young kinsman kennedy farewell  speed you well my lad he said kindly  i ask ye not to tarry in what ye must deem a graceless household and he looked sadly across at his two sons boys in age but seniors in excess  i would we had mair lads like you  i fear me a heavy reckoning is coming  you have ever been good lord to all sir said kennedy affectionately for he really loved and pitied the softhearted duke  too good maybe said murdoch  what the scholar goes with you and he fixed a look on lilys face that brought the colour deep into it under her hood  yes sir answered kennedy respectfully  here you tam indicating malcolm take him behind you on the sumpterhorse  fare ye weel gentle scholar said murdoch taking the hand that lily was far from offering  may ye win to your journeys end safe and sound and remember he added holding the fingers tight and speaking under the hood if ye have been hardly served twas to make ye the second lady in scotland  take care of herhim young laddie he added turning on malcolm tis best so and mind he spoke in the same wheedling tone of selfexcuse if ye tell the tale down south nae ill hath been dune till her and where could she have been mair fitly than beneath her kinsmans roof  id not let her go but that young blude is hot and ill to guide  an answer would have been hard to find and it was well that he did not look for any  indeed malcolm could not have spoken without being heard by the seneschal and therefore could only bow take his seat on the baggagehorse and then feel his sister mounting behind him in an attitude less unfamiliar on occasion even to the highborn ladies of the fifteenth century than to those of our day  four years it was since he had felt her touch four years since she had sat behind him as they followed the king to coldingham  his heart swelled with thankfulness as he passed under the gateway and the arms that clung round his waist clasped him fervently but neither ventured on a word amid kennedys escort and they rode on a couple of miles in the same silence  then kennedy pausing said there lies your way brother  tam you may show the scholar the way to the gray friars grange bear them greetings frae me and halt till ye hear from me  fare ye well  lilias trusted her voice to say blessings on ye sir for all ye have done for me but malcolm thought it wiser in his character of retainer to respond only by a bow  of course they understood that the direction kennedy gave was the very one they were not to take but they followed it till a tall bush of gorse hid them from the escort and then malcolm grasping his sisters hand plunged down among the rowans ferns and hazels that covered the steep bank of the river and so soon as a footing was gained under shelter of a tall rock threw his arms round her almost sobbing in an undertone my lily my tittiesafe at last  oh god be thanked  i knew her prayers would be heard  oh would that patrick were here  then as her face changed and quivered ready to weep he cried eh what art still deeming him dead  how she cried wildly  he fell into the hands of your english and  he fell into the hands of your king and mine said malcolm  yes king james dragged him out of the burning house and wrung his pardon out of king harry  he came with me to st abbs to fetch you lily and only went back because his knighthood would not serve in this quest like my clerkship  patrick living patrick safe  oh she fell on her knees among the ferns hid her face in her hands and drew a long breath  malcolm this is joy overmuch  the desolation of yesterday the joy today  malcolm seeing her like one stifled by emotion fell on his knees beside her and whispered forth a thanksgiving  she rested with her head on his shoulder in content till he started up saying in a lively manner come lily we must be on our way  a very bonnie young clerk you are with your berrybrown locks cut so short round your face  lilias blushed up to the short dark curls she had left herself  had i thought he lived i could scarce have done it  what not to get to him silly maid  here as he shook out and donned the gown he had brought rolled up now am i a scholar too  stay you must take off this badge of the bachelor you have only been in a monastery school you know you are my young brotherwhat shall we call you  davie softly suggested lilias  ay davie then that ive come home to fetch to share my paris lear  you can be very shy and bashful you know and leave all the knapping of latin and logic to me  if it is such as you did with jamie kennedy said lilias it will indeed be well  oh malcolm i sat and marvelled at yeso gleg ye took him up  how could ye learn it  and ye are a brave warrior too in battles she added looking him over with a sisters fond pride  we have had no battle no pitched field said malcolm but i have seen war  so that ugly words can never be flung in your face again cried lilias are you knighted brother  no but they say i have won my spurs  ill tell you all lily as we walk  only let me bestow this iron cap where some mavis may nestle in it  ay and the boots too which scarce befit a clerk  there your hand clerk davie we must make westward today lest poor duke murdoch be forced to send to chase us  after that for the border and patie  so brother and sister set forth on their wanderingand truly it was a happy journey  the weather favoured them and their hearts were light lilias delivered from terrible hopeless captivity her brother beside her and now not a brother to be pitied and protected but to protect her and be exulted in trod the heather with an exquisite sense of joy and freedom that buoyed her up against all hardships and malcolm was at peace as he had seldom been  his happiness was not exactly like his sisters in her renewed liberty and restoration to love and joy for he had known a wider range of life and though really younger than lily his more complicated history could not but make him older in thought and mind  another selfabnegation was beginning to rise upon him as he travelled slowly southwards by stages suited to his sisters powers and by another track than that by which he had gone  on the moor or by the burn side there was peace and brightness but wherever he met with man he found something to sadden him  did they rest in a monastery there was often irregularity seldom devotion always crass ignorance  the manse was often a scene of such dissolute life that malcolm shunned to bring his sister into the sight of it the peel tower was the dwelling of savagery the farm homestead either rude and lawless or in constant terror the black spaces on many a brae side showed where dwellings had been burned more than once they passed skeletons depending from the trees or lying rotting by the wayside  and it was frightful to malcolm after his four years absence to find how little lilias shared his horror taking quite naturally what to alice montagu would have seemed beyond the bounds of possibility and would have set esclairmondes soul on fire while lilias seemed to think it her brothers amiable peculiarity to be shocked or to long to set such things straight  he felt the truth of james kennedys wordsthat reformation could not be the sole work of the king but that his hands must be strengthened by all the few who knew that a different state of things was possible and that above all the clergy needed to be awakened into vigour and intelligence formerly the miserable aspect of the country had merely terrified him and driven him to strive to hide his head in a convent but the strength and the sense of duty he had acquired had brought his heart to respond to kennedys call to work  esclairmondes words wrought within him beyond her own ken or purpose in speaking them  he began to understand that to bury himself in an italian university and dive into aristotles sayings to heap up his own memory with the stores of thought he loved or to plunge into the mazes of mathematics philosophy and music while his brethren in his own country were tearing one another to pieces for lack of any good influence to teach or show them better things would be a storing of treasure for himself on earth a pursuit of the light of knowledge indeed but not a wooing of the light of wisdom the true light of the world as seen in him who went about doing good  to complete his present course was he knew necessary  he had seen enough of really learned scholars to know the depths of his own ignorance and to be aware that certain books must be read under guidance and certain studies gone through before his cultivation would be on a level with the standard of the best working clergy of the english churchsuch as chicheley waynflete or the like he would therefore remain at oxford he thought long enough to take his master of arts degree and then though to his own perceptions only the oneeyed among the blind he would make the real sacrifice of himself in the rude and cruel world of scotland  he knew that his king was well satisfied with patrick and also that a man of sound heart and prompt hard hand was far fitter to rule as a secular lord than his own more finedrawn mature could ever be but as a priest with the influence that his birth and the kings friendship would give him he already saw chances of raising the tone of the clergy and thus improving the wild and lawless people  a deep purpose of selfdevotion was growing up in his soul but without saddening him only rendering him more energetic and cheerful than his sister had ever known him  as they walked together over the long stretches of moor many were lilys questions and malcolm beguiled the way with many a story of camp and court told both for his own satisfaction in her sympathy and with the desire to make the scottish lassie see what was the life and what the thoughts of ladies of her own degree in other lands so that the lady of glenuskie might be awake to somewhat of the high purpose of virtuous home government to which alice of salisbury had been trained  as to the flemish heiress no representation would induce lilias to love her  reject malcolm for a convents sake  it was unpardonable and as to a bedeswoman working uncloistered in the streets lily viewed that as neither the one thing nor the other neither religious nor secular and she was persuaded that a little exertion on the part of the brother whom she viewed as a paladin would overcome all coyness on the ladys part  malcolm found it vain to try to show his sister his sense of his own deserts and equally so to declare that if the maiden should so yield she would indeed be the demoiselle de luxemburg to whom he was pledged but not the esclairmonde whom his better part adored  so he let the matter pass by and both enjoyed their masquing in one anothers company as a holiday such as they could never have again  they had no serious alarms the pursuit must have been disconcerted and the two young scholars were not worth the attention of freebooters  their winsomeness of manner won them kindness wherever they harboured and thus after many days without molestation they came to the walls of berwick  and now while malcolm thought his difficulties at an end a horror of bashfulness fell upon lilias  she had been clerk davie merrily enough while there was no one to suspect her but the transmutation into her proper self filled her with shame  she hung back and could be hardly dragged forward to the embattled gateway of the bridge by her brotherwho as the guards jealously cautious even in this time of peace called out to him to stand showed his ring bearing the royal arms and desired to speak within the captain of the garrison who was commanding in the name of the earl of northumberland governor of berwick and warden of the marches and who had entertained him on his way north and would have been warned by patrick of his probable return in this guise  instead of the stalwart form of the veteran subgovernor however a quick step came hurrying to the gateway and the light figure of a young knight stood before him with outstretched hands crying welcome to the good town of berwickupontweed dear comrade  and he added in a lower tone so you have succeeded in your questif as i trow this fairest of clerks be your lady sister  may i  hold softly said malcolm  she is so shamefast that she cannot brook a word and in fact lilias had pulled her hood over her face and shrunk behind him at the first approach of the young gentleman  we will to my mother said ralf aloud  she has always a soft corner in her heart for a young clerk or a wanderer  and so saying without even looking at the disguised figure he gave the password and holding malcolm by the arm led him followed by lilias through the defences and into the court of the castle then to a side door where bounding up several steps at once of a stone stair he opened a sort of anteroom door and bade the two strangers wait there while he fetched his mother  that is well  who would have looked to see him here cried malcolm joyously  what you knew him not  it was ralf percy my dear old companion  ralf percy he that was so bold and daring cried lilias  nay but how can it be he was as meek and shamefast  as yourself smiled malcolm  ah sister you have much to learn of the ways of an english gentleman among ladies  before many further words could be exchanged there entered a fair and matronly dame in the widows veil she had worn ever since the fatal day of shrewsburythat eager loving yet almost childish woman whom we know so well as hotspurs gentle kate only that unfortunately her name was elizabeth fondling teasing being fondled and teased in return and then with all her pretty puerilities scorched away when she upbraids northumberland with his fatal delay  could malcolm and lilias have known her as we do in shakespeare they would have been the more gratified by her welcome whereas they only saw her kind face and the courtly sweep of her curtsey as going straight up to the disguised girl blushing and trembling now more than ever she said poor child come with me and we will soon have you yourself again ere any other eye see you and then moved away again holding lily by the hand while ralf who had followed close behind her again grasped malcolms hand  well done glenuskie you have all the adventures  they seek you i believe  so you have borne off your damosel errant and are just in time to receive your king  is he wedded then  ay and you find us all here in full state prepared to banquet him and lodge him and his bride for a night and then i fancy my brother is to go through some ceremony ere giving him up to his own subjects  we are watching for him every day  come to my chamber and ill apparel you  nay but what brings you here ralfyou whom i thought in france  twas a scottish bill that brought me answered ralf  what are you too lost in parchment at oxford to hear of us poor soldiers or knew you not how we fought at crevant  i heard of the battle and that you were hurt but that was months ago and i deemed you long since in the field again  was it so sore a matter  chiefly sore for that it hindered me from taking the old rogue douglas and meriting my spurs as befitted a percy  i was knighted while the trumpet was sounding and i did think that i was on the way to prowess for fully in the melee i saw a fellow with the douglas banner  i made at it thinking of my fathers and of otterburn and malcolm this very hand was on the staff when what must a big scot do but chop at me with his bill like a butchers axe  had it fallen on mine arm it would have been lopped off like a bough of a tree but by st georges grace it lit here between my neck and shoulder and stuck fast as i went down and the fellow was swept away from me  twas so fixed in the very bone that they had much ado to wrench it out when there was time after the fight to look after us who had come by the worse  and what dye think they found malcolm  why those honest yorkshiremen trenton and kitson stark dead both of them  trenton must have gone down first with a lancethrust in the throat and there was kitson over him his shield over his head and his own cleft open with an axe  they laid them side by sideso i was toldin their grave and sure twas as strange and as true a brotherhood as ever was between two brave men  the good fellows cried malcolm  nay after what i saw i can hardly grieve  i went to kitsons home where they knew as little as i did of his death and verily his place had closed up behind him so that i scarce think his mother even cared to see him more and the whole of them seemed more concerned at his amity with trenton than proud of his feats of arms  i was marvelling if their friendship would be allowed to subsist at home even when they poor fellows were lying side by side in their french grave  we warriors should never come home said percy we are spoilt for aught but our french camp  i am wearying to get back once more but so long as i cannot swing my swordarm i must play the idler here  it must have been a fearsome wound said malcolm  the marvel is your overgetting it  so say they all and truly it has lasted no small time  they shipped me off home so soon as i could leave my bed and bade me rest  nay and my mother herself came even to london when my brother was summoned to parliamentshe who had never been there since the first year after she was wedded  you can scarce complain of such kin as that said malcolm  tis not the kin but this petty border life that frets me  here we move from castle to castle and now and then come tidings of a cattle lifting and harry dons his helm and rides forth but nine times out of ten tis a false alarm or if it be true the thieves have made off and being time of peace he as warden cannot make a raid in return  im sick of the life after the only warfare fit for a knight with french nobles instead of border thieves and back i will  if my right arm will not serve me the left shall  i can use a lance indifferent well already  as sir ralf percy spoke a buglecall rang through the castle  he started  hark thats the warders horn and flying to the door he soon returned cryingyour king is in sight malcolm  how soon will he be here  in less than half an hour  theres time to array yourself  ill take you to my chamber  thanks said malcolm but this gown is no disguise to me  i had rather meet the king thus for it is my fitting garb  only i would remove the soil of the journey and then take my sister by the hand  for this there was ample time and malcolm had arranged his hair and brushed away the dust from his gown washed his face and hands and made himself look more like an oxford bachelor and less like a begging clerk than he had of late judged it prudent to appear ere ralf took him to the great hall where he found lord northumberland and the chief gentlemen of his household with his mother lady percy and his young wife together with their ladies assembling for the reception of their royal guests  malcolm was presented to and kindly greeted by each of the principal personages and then the earl sir ralf and their officers went forth to meet the king at the gateway  malcolm however at his sisters entreaty remained with her for in the doubt whether patrick were really at hand and a fond unreasonable vexation that he had had no part in her liberation her colour was coming and going and she looked as if she might almost faint in her intense excitement  but when marshalled by the two percies king james and queen joan had entered the hall and the blare of trumpets without and rejoicings within and had been welcomed with deep reverences by the two ladies ralf said sir methinks you have here what you may be glad to see  and standing aside he made way for the two figures to stand forth one in the plain black gown and hood the other in the rich robes of a high born maiden her dark eyes on the ground her fair face quivering within emotion as both she and her brother bent the knee before their royal master  ha cried james this is well indeed  thou hast her then lad  see patrick  where is he  nay but fair wife i must present thee the first kinswoman of mine thou hast seen  how didst bring her off malcolm  and he embraced malcolm with the ardour of a happy man as he added this is all that was wanting  truly james looked as if nothing were wanting to his joy as there he stood after his years of waiting a bridegroom free and on the borders of his native land  his eyes shone with joy and there was a bright energy and alacrity in his bearing that when malcolm bethought him of those former grave movements and the quiet demeanour as though only interested by an effort marked the change from the captive to the free man  and beautiful joan lovelier than ever took on her her queenly dignity with all her wonted grace and graciousness  she warmly embraced lilias hailing her as cousin and auguring joyously of the future from the sight of this first stewart maiden whom she had seen and the next moment patrick drummond hurrying forward fell on his knee before his lady grasped kissed fondled her hand and struggled and stammered between his rejoicing over her liberation and despair that he had no part in it  yea said the king it was wellnigh a madman whom you sent home to me malcolm  he was neither to have nor to hold and what he would have had me do or have let him do ill not say nor doth he know either  i must hear your story ere i sleep malcolm  the king did not ask for it then he would not brook the exposure of the disunion and violence of scotland to the english especially the percies and it was not till he could see malcolm alone that he listened to his history  cousin he said you have done both bravely and discreetly  methinks you have redeemed my pledge to your good guardian that in the south you should be trained to true manhood though i am free to own that twas not under my charge that you had the best training  how is it to be malcolm  patrick tells me you saw the lady of light  ay sir but neither her purpose nor mine is shaken  my lord i believe i see how best to serve god and yourself  if you will consent i will finish my first course at oxford and then offer myself for the priesthood  not hide thyself in cloister or schoolthat is well exclaimed the king  no sir  methinks i could serve yonder rude people best if i were among them as a priest  james considered then said i pledged myself not to withstand your conscience malcolm and though i grieve that the lady should be lost she has never wavered and cannot be balked of her will  godly and learned priests will indeed be needed and between you and james kennedy when both are come to elder years we may perchance lift our poor scottish church to some clearer sense of what a church should be meanwhile  the king stopped and considered  study in england  ay you see malcolm i must take my seat and have the reins of my unruly steed firm in my hand ere i take cognizance of these offences  the caitiff waltermansworn that he ishe shall abye it but that can scarce be as yet and methinks it were not well that i entered scotland with you and your sister at my side for then must i seem to have overlooked an offence that by this holy relic i will never pardon  so malcolm instead of entering scotland with mebonnie land how sweet its air blows from the northye must een turn south  but how to dispose of your sister  some nunnery  poor lily she is weary of convents said malcolm but if lady montagu would let her be with her and the lady esclairmonde then would she learn somewhat of the ways of a wellordered english noble house  and i could well provide for her being there as befits her station  well thought of  the gentle lady alice will no doubt welcome her said the king and patrick must endure  thus then was it fixed  the king and queen stately and beautiful royally robed and mounted on splendid steeds were escorted the next morning to the scottish gate of berwick by lord northumberland and his retinue and they were met by an imposing band of scottish nobles with the whitehaired earl of lennox at their head  to these the captive was formally surrendered by northumberland and james flinging himself from his horse kissed his native soil and gave thanks aloud to god ere he stood up and received the homage of his subjects to most of whom he was a total stranger  malcolm and lilias on the walls could see all but could not hear and finally beheld the glittering troop wind their way over the hills to make ready for the coronation of james and joan as king and queen of scotland     chapter xix the lions wrath   it was the 24th of may 1425 when in the vaulted hall of the castle of stirling the nobles of scotland were convened to try as the peers of the realm men of rankno less than murdoch duke of albany his sons walter and alexander the earl of lennox and twentytwo other nobles most of whom had been arraigned in the parliament of perth two months previously and had been shut up in different castles  robert stewart had escaped to the highlands and walterwho had neither been at the coronation of scone nor at the parliament of perth nor indeed had ever bowed his pride so as to present himself to the king at allhad been separately arrested and shut up for two months in the strong castle on the bass rock  the charge was termed treason and violence and assuredly there had been perpetual acts of spoil and barbarous infractions of the law by men who deemed themselves above all law  the only curiosity was for which of these acts they were to be tried and this affected many of their judges likewise for there was hardly a man in that court who was not conscious of some deed that would not exactly bear to be set beside the code of scotland and who had not been in the habit of regarding those laws as all very well for burghers but not meant for gentlemen  there on seats behind the throne sat the twentyone jurors earl douglas among thema new earl for the grim old archibald had died in the battle of verneuil some months before  angus march and mar and all the most powerful names in scotland were there and upon his throne in regal robes of crimson and ermine the crown upon his brow the sceptre in his hand the sword of state held before him sat king james the most magnificentlooking king then reigning in europe but with the sternest saddest most resolute of countenances as one unalterably fixed upon the terrible duty of not bearing the sword in vain  something of henrys avengingangel look seemed to have passed into his face but with far more of melancholy weight  walter stewart was led into the court  he too was a man of lofty stature and princely bearing and his grand stewart features were set in an expression of easy nonchalance and scorn aware as he was that of whatever he might be accused there were few of his judges that did not share the guilt and moreover persuaded that this was a mere ceremony and that the king would never dare to go beyond this futile attempt to overawe him  he stood alonehis father and the others were reserved for another trial and as richly arrayed he stood opposite to the jury gazing fixedly first at one then at the other as though challenging their right to sit in judgment on him one eye after another fell beneath his gaze  walter stewart of albany earl of fife proclaimed the criers voice you stand here arraigned of murder and of robbery  at whose suit demanded walter undaunted  at the suit of malcolm and lilias stewart of glenuskie and of patrick drummond of the braes returned the crier an ecclesiastic as were all lawyers and at the same moment three figures came forward namely a tall knightly gentleman with gold chain and spurs a lady whose veil disclosed a blushing darkeyed face and a slender youth of deep and earnest countenance  at the suit of these here present you stand arraigned sir walter stewart of albany for having feloniously and of malice aforethought on the eve of the annunciation of our lady of the year of grace 1421 set upon the said malcolm and lilias stewart sir david drummond of the braes tutor of glenuskie and divers other persons on the muir of hetherfield and having there cruelly and maliciously wounded the said david of the braes to the death and of having forcibly stolen and abducted the person of the said lilias stewart  the crier was not permitted to proceed for walter stewart broke forth passionately addressing the jurors  so this is all that can be found to be laid against me  this is the way that matters of five years back are raked up to vex the princes and nobles of scotland  i am sorry for you lords and gentlemen if this is the way that vexatious are to be stirred up against those who have defended their country so long  this is no answer to the accusation sir walter said the earl of mar  accusation forsooth said walter stewart scornfully  who dares to bear witness if i did maintain my fathers lawful authority over peevish runaway wards of the crown  sir walter said the king you would have done better to have waited and heard the whole indictment ere answering one charge  but since you demand who will dare to bear witness in this matter of the murder of sir david drummond of the braes and of the seizure of the lady lilias here is one  so saying and rising as he spoke he held forth the reliquary that hung from a chain round his neck keeping his gleaming tawny eyes fixed steadily straight upon walter stewarts face  that face as he first had stood up expressed the utmost amazement and this gradually under the lion glance became more and more of dismay quailing collapsing visibly under the passionless gravity of that look even the tall form seemed to shrink the eyes dilated the brows drew closer together and the chest seemed to pant as the relic was held forth  there was a dead silence throughout the court as the king ceased to speak only he continued to bend that searching gaze upon his prisoner  was it youwas it your own self my lord he stammered forth at last in the tone of one stricken  yea walter stewart  to me it was and on this holy relic that you made oath to abstain from all further spoil and violence until the king should come again in peace  how that oath has been kept the further indictments will show  i deemed it was st andrew faltered the prisoner  and therefore that the oath to a heavenly saint would better bear breaking than one to an earthly sinner replied james gravely  read on clerk of the court  the roll continueda long and terrible record of violence and cruelty the private warfare of the lawless young prince the crimes of reckless barbarity and of savage passiona deadly roll in which indeed even the second abduction of lilias was one of the least acts laid to his charge  no lack of witnesses were there to prove deeds that had been done in the open face of day in utter fearlessness of earthly justice and defiance of heaven  the defence that the prisoner seemed to have been prepared to usthat those who sat to judge him had shared in his offences and his daring power of browbeating them as he had so often done before as son of the man who sat in the kings seathad utterly failed him now  he was mute and the forms of the trial were gone through as of one whose doom was already sealed but who must receive his sentence according to the strictest form of law lest the just reward of his deeds should partake of their own violence  by the end of the day the jurors had found walter stewart guilty and the doomster a blackrobed clerk rising up pronounced the sentence that condemned walter stewart of albany to suffer death by beheading  even then no one believed that the doom would be inflicted  royal blood had never flowed beneath the headsmans axe and it would have been infinitely more congenial to scottish feelings if the king had sent a party of menatarms to fall on the master in the high road and cut him off or had burnt him alive in his castle  the verdict served him right would have been universally returned and rejoiced in but a regular trial of a man of such birth was unheard of and shocking to the feelings even of those whom that irresistible force of the kings had compelled to sit in judgment upon him  no one could avow it face to face with the king but every one felt it an outrage to find that no rank was exempt from law  duke murdoch his son alexander and his fatherinlaw lennox were tried the next day and many a deed of dark treason was laid to their charge the earl of lennox had been the scourge of scotland for more than half the eighty years of his life but his extreme age might have excited some pity murdoch had erred rather negatively than positively and alexander ruffian as he was had been bred to nothing better  each had deserved the utmost penalty of the law again and again and yet there did seem more scope for mercy in their case than in that of walter  but the king was inexorable  he set malcolm aside as he had set others  i know what you would say lad  lennox is old and alexander is young and albany is a fool and walter has injured you so you are bound to speak for him  take it all as said  but these are the men who have been foremost in making our country a desert  did i pardon them with what face could i ever make any man suffer for crime  and in the state of this land ruth to the guilty high would be treason to the sackless low  so stirling saw the unprecedented sight of three generations suffering for their crimes upon the same scaffoldthe whitehaired lennox the duke of albany in the prime of life walter in the flush and strength of early manhood alexander in the bloom of youth  they all met their fate undauntedly for if murdochs heart in any measure failed him he was afraid to give way in presence of the proud bold walter who maintained an iron rigidity of demeanour with the wild fortitude of a red indian at the stake and in like manner could by no means comprehend that king james acted from any motive save malice for having been so long kept out of his kingdom  it was his turn now said poor murdoch even when most desirous of bringing himself to die in a state of christian forgiveness nor could any power on earth show any of the criminals that the king acted in the eternal interests of right and justice  thus it was with the whole country and when the four majesticlooking men stood bareheaded on the scaffold in view even of their own fair towers of doune and one by one bowed their heads on the block perverse scottish nature broke out into pity for their fate and wrath against the king who could thus turn against his own blood and disgrace the royal lineage  on that same day malcolm received esclairmondes token there being at present full peace with england and set forth on her summons  he met her at pontefract where she was residing with the dowager queen joan of navarre alice of salisbury having been summoned to return to her husband in france  there then it was that malcolm and esclairmonde in presence of the chaplain gave each other back the rings and therewith their troth to wed none other and were once more declared free  esclairmonde held out her hand to malcolm saying the thanks i owe you sir are beyond what tongue can tell  may he to whom my first vows were due requite it to you  and malcolm with his knee to the ground pressing for the last time that fair hand said the thanks lady are mine  had you been one whit lower in aims or in constancy what had i been  you were my light of the world but to light me to seek that higher light that shone forth in you and which may i show truly to the darkened spirits of my countrymen lady you will permit me to take to myself the ring you have worn so long  it will be my token of my betrothal to that true light  such was their parting when the one went forth to her tasks of charity among the poor in london the other to divest himself of land and lordship on behalf of his sister and her husband and then to begin his task in the priesthood of trying to hold up the true light to hearts darkened by many an age of crime and ignorance  lived very happy ever after  yes we would fain always leave the creatures with whom our thoughts have been busy in such felicity but when we have linked them with real events the sense of the veritable course of history reminds us that we cannot even suppose beings possible in real life without endowing them with the common lot of humanity and the personages of our tale lived in a time of more than ordinary reverse and trouble  yet sir patrick drummond and lilias his wife the lord and lady of glenuskie nearly did fulfil these conditions  they had not feelings beyond their age but they were good specimens of that age and they did their duty in it he as a trustworthy noble ready to aid in council or war and she as the beneficent dame bringing piety and charity to heal the sufferings of her vassals and serfs  his hand was strong enough to repel the attacks of his foes her intelligence backed by malcolms counsel introduced improvements and the little ravine of glenuskie was a happy valley of peace and prosperity for many years among the convulsions of scotland  nor was esclairmonde de luxemburgs life in the hospital of st katharine otherwise than the holy and beneficent career that she had always longed forworshipping in the fair church and going forth from thence into the streets and lanes of the city to fulfil queen philippas pious behest to seek out the suffering and the ignorant and to tend and instruct them  the tall form and beautiful countenance of sister clare were loved and reverenced as those of an angel messenger among the high houses and courts that closed in on the banks of the thames and while luxemburgs in france and flanders intrigued and fought plotted and fell their kinswomans days passed by in busy almsdeeds and ever loftier devotion till those who watched her steps felt that she was verily a light of the world manifesting forth the true light in many a dark place  and her light of sympathy shone upon many an old friend both in joy and in grief  when the dissensions of gloucester and beaufort had summoned bedford to england to endeavour to appease their strife his burgundian duchess sought out her early friend and esclairmonde saw her gentle companion the lady anne fulfilling her daily task of mediation and living a life not indeed very sunshiny but full of all that esteem and respect could give her and of calm gratitude and affection although anne like all others believed that john of bedfords heart had been buried in his brothers grave and that of youthful love he had none to give  his whole soul was absorbed in his care for the welfare of the pale gentle dreamy inanimate boy who from his very meekness and docility gave so little promise of representing the father whose name he bore  the loving alice of montagu though the mother of many a bold boy and girl and busy with all the cares of the great nevil household regarded as the chief delight in a journey to court the sight of her dear sister clare  it was to sister clare that alice turned for comfort when her brave old father died at the siege of orleans and it was while daily soothing and ministering to her sorrow that esclairmonde heard the strange wild tales of the terrible witch maiden who had appeared on behalf of the french and turned whole english armies to flight by power that the french declared to come from the saints but which the english never doubted to be infernal  maimed and wounded soldiers whom esclairmonde relieved and tended as they returned from lost battles gave her fearful accounts of the panic that la pucelle inspired  even the hardy veteran sir john fastolfe had not been able to withstand her spells but had fled from the field of jergeau where gallant sir ralf percy had died in a vain attempt to gather the men to resist the irresistible maiden  his groom who had succumbed for a time to wounds and weakness on his way home to alnwick was touched by the warmth and emotion with which the kind bedeswoman listened to his lamentation over the good and loyal knight whom she pictured to herself resisting the enchantresss dread power as dauntlessly as he had defied the phantoms of the dance of death  no whisper ever reached esclairmonde that the terrible pucelle was a maiden as pure and highsouled as herself  all that she heard more was that this terror of the english and burgundians was taken imprisoned for a time by her own luxemburg kindred and then carried to rouen where the kind duchess anne of bedford did her best to persuade her to overcome the superstition that kept her in male garments thus greatly tending to increase the belief in her connection with the powers of evil  french and burgundian bishops and even the university of paris were the judges of the maiden and the dastard prince she had crowned never stirred a finger nor uttered a protest in her behalf  bedford always disposed to belief in witchcraft acquiesced in the decision of churchmen which was therefore called the judgment of the church but when he removed himself and his duchess from rouen and left the conduct of the matter to the sterner and harder beauchamp earl of warwick it was with little thought that aftergenerations would load his memory with the fate of jeanne darc as though her sufferings had proceeded from his individual malice  esclairmonde never saw bedford again and only heard through alice now countess of salisbury how when good duchess anne was dead and her gentle influence removed burgundys disinclination to the english cause was no longer balanced and how bedford perplexed disheartened broken in health but still earnest to propitiate friends for his helpless nephew had listened to the wily whisper of the bishop of therouenne that his niece jaquette would secure the devotion of the count de st pol and that she was moreover like unto another demoiselle de luxemburg  how like esclairmonde could judge when her kinswoman widowed in her eighteenth year at six months end came to london to claim her dower never since her days of wandering and anxiety had esclairmonde felt such pain as when she perceived how little store the thoughtless girl had set by the great and noble spirit that had been quenched under the load of toil and care with which it had battled for thirteen long years faithful greathearted bedford striving to uphold a losing cause to reconcile selfish contentions to retain conquests that though unjustly made he had no power to relinquish and all without one trustworthy relation with friends and fellowwarriors dying disputing betraying or deserting his was as selfdevoted and as mournful a career as ever was run by any prince at any age of the world and while he slept in his grave at rouen that grave which even louis xi respected esclairmonde as like a true bedeswoman of st katharine she joined in the orisons for the repose of the souls of the royal kindred never heard the name of the lord john without a throb of prayer and a throb too that warmed her heart with tenderness  it was some four years later and the even tenor of sister clares course had only been interrupted by her kinswoman jaquette making her way to her to confess her marriage with richard wydville and to entreat her intercession with the luxemburg family when one summer night she was called on to attend a pilgrim priest from the holy land who had been landed from a flemish vessel and lay dangerously sick at the gods house or hospital by the river side  he was thought by his accent to be foreign and sister clare was always called on to wait upon the stranger  as she stood by his bedside she beheld a man of middle age but wasted with sickness and with a certain strange look of horror so imprinted on his brow that even as he lay asleep though his mouth was grave and peaceful the lines were still there and the locks that hung from around his tonsure were of a whiteness that scarce accorded with the features it was a face that esclairmonde could not look at without waking strange memories but it was not till the sleeper awakened opened two dark eyes gazed on her with dreamy doubtful wonder and then clasped his hands with the murmured thanksgiving my god hast thou granted me this  light of my life that she was assured to whom she was speaking  malcolm stewart it verily was  canon malcolm stewart of dunkeld was his proper title for he had as she knew long ceased to be lord of glenuskie  it was not at first that she knew how he had been brought where she now saw him but after some few days of her tender care and skilful leechcraft he somewhat rallied and she gathered his history from his conversation when he was able to speak  he had had a time of happy labour in scotland fully carrying out the designs with which he and his cousin james kennedy had taken upon them the ministry  their own birth and the appointments their king gave them so soon as their age permitted made them able to exert an influence that told upon the rude and unenlightened clergy around  it had been almost a mission of conversion to awaken a spirit of christianity in the country that had so long been a prey to anarchy  the kings declaration i will make the key keep the castle and the bracken bush keep the cow though i live the life of a dog to bring it about had been the moving spring of their lives  james had fought hour by hour with the foul habits of lawlessness savagery and violence that had hitherto been absolutely unchecked and while he strove with the sword of justice the two young priests worked within the word of truth to implant some sense of conscience in the neglected people  it had been a life of constant exertion but full of hope and cheerfulness  amid that rude country jamess own home was always a bright spot of peace sunshine and refinement  with his beloved queen and their fair little brood of children the king cast aside his cares and was all and more than all he had been as the ornament of henrys court  there all that was sweet innocent and beautiful was to be found and there malcolm his royal kinsmans confidant counsellor and chaplain was always welcome as one of the home circle and family till he broke away from such delights to labour in his task of reviving religion in the land  a little band of men were gathering round clergy awakening from their sloth or worldliness young nobles who began to see what chivalry meant burghers who rejoiced in order and hope and encouragement strengthened the hands of the three kinsmen  but alas there were those who deemed jamess justice on the savage prince and noble mere sacrilege on high blood and who absolutely hated and loathed peace and order  those thirteen years of cheerful progress ended in that murder so unspeakably horrible in all its circumstances which almost merits the name of a martyrdom to right and justice  malcolm so shuddered when he did but touch on it and was so rent with agitation that esclairmonde perceived that when his beloved king had perished he had indeed received the deathwound to his own fragile nature  he had been actually in the abbey of perth and had been one of those who lifted the mangled corpse from the vault and sought in vain for a remnant of life if but to grant the absolution for which the victim had so piteously besought his murderers  no wonder that fasterns een had whitened malcolms hair  but when the assassins were captured and joan of beaufort was resolved that their death should be as atrocious as their crime it was malcolm who strove to bend her to forgiveness  he bade her recollect king henry and how when dealing with that cruel monster the castellane of meaux he had merely required death without enhancing the agony but joan in her rage and misery had left the englishwoman behind her and was implacable  all that human cruelty could invent was to be the lot of robert graham and his associates and whereas they had granted no priest to their victim none should be granted to them  and then it was that all malcolm had learnt of the true spirit of the christian triumphednot only over the dark keltic spirit of revenge but over the shuddering of a tender and pitiful nature  where no other priest durst venture he went  through all the frightful and protracted sufferings of athol graham hall and the rest it was malcolm stewart who never flinching prayed with and for them gathered their agonized sobs of confession or strove to soften their hardness spoke the words of absolution and commended their departing souls  when he awoke from the long unconsciousness and delirium that ensued upon the force he had put on himself he found himself tended by his sister at glenuskie  patrick drummond had transported him thither finding that the angry queen in the madness of her vindictiveness was wellnigh disposed to connect him with the treasonable designs of athol and graham he slowly and partially recovered but his influence was gone the queen would not brook the sound of his name the little king was beyond his reach james kennedy was biding his time and the country was returned to its state of misrule and violence wherein an individual priest could do little yet malcolm would have held by his post had not his health been so utterly shattered that he was incapable of the work he had hitherto done as a confessor and a preacher  and therefore as the state of his beloved king sent to his account unhouselled disappointed unannealed hung heavy on his mind he determined so soon as he was in any degree convalescent to set forth on pilgrimage to jerusalem the object of so many dreams of king henry there to offer masses and prayers for the welfare of his departed prince as well as of the unhappy murderers and for the country in its distracted condition  and there at the holy sepulchre had malcolm in the fervour of his heart offered the greatest treasure he possessednay the only one that he still really cared fornamely his betrothal ring which esclairmonde had worn for so long and had returned to him  as a priest he had deemed that it was not unlawful for him to retain the memorial of the link that had bound him to her who had been the light that led him to the true light beyond but as youth passed away as devotion burned brighter as the experiences of those years became more dreamlike and the horror grief and misery of his kings death had been assuaged only by the steadier contemplation of the light of eternity he had felt that this last pledge of his once lower aims and hopes ought to be resigned and that if it cost him a pang it was well that it should be so to render the offering a sacrifice  so the ring that had once been esclairmondes protection was laid on the altar of the holy tomb  there malcolm had wellnigh died under the influences of agitation fatigue and climate but he had revived enough to set out on his return from his pilgrimage and had made his way tardily and wearily losing his attendants through death and desertion on the road and passing from one religious house to another as his strength and nearly exhausted means served him  unable to find any vessel bound for leith he had taken ship for london concealing his quality lest in the always probable contingency of a war it might lead to his being made prisoner and thus he had arrived sick indeed unto death but peaceful rejoicing and hopeful  sister he said the morn that i had offered my ring i was feeble and faint and when i knelt on before the altar in continued prayeri know not whether i slept or whether it were a vision but it was to me as though i were again on the river and again the hymn of bernard of morlaix was sung around and above me by the voice i never thought to hear again  i looked up and behold it was i that was in the boatmy king was there no more  nay he stood on the shore and his eyes beamed on me while the ghastly wounds that i once strove in anguish to staunch shone out like a ruby cross on his breastthe hands that were so sorely gashed were to me as though marked by the impress of the sacred wounds he spake not but by his side stood king henry beautiful and spiritlike and smiled on me and seemed as though he pointed to the wounds as he said blessed is the king who died by his peoples hand for withstanding his peoples sin  blessed is every faint image of the true king  then methought they held out their arms to me and i would have come to them on their shore of rest but the river bore me awayand i looked up to find i was as yet only in the earthly jerusalem but i watch for them every hour to call me once and for ever     footnotes   1  hail reverend brother  i come from paris  2  student of the first year  3  manners are lacking to the northerners  4  wretches  5
