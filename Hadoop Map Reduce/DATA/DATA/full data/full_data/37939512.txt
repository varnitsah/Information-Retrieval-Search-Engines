guardboat lay across the mouth of the bathingpool her crew idly spanking the water with the flat of their oars a redcoated militiaman rifle in hand sat at the bows and a petty officer at the stern between the snowwhite cutter and the flattopped honeycoloured rocks on the beach the green water was troubled with shrimppink prisonersofwar bathing behind their orderly tin camp and the electriclight poles rose those stonedotted spurs that throw heat on simonstown beneath them the little barracouta nodded to the big gibraltar and the old penelope that in ten years has been bachelors club natural history museum kindergarten and prison rooted and dug at her fixed moorings far out a threefunnelled atlantic transport with turtle bow and stern waddled in from the deep sea  said the sentry assured of the visitors good faith talk to em you can to any that speak english youll find a lot that do  here and there earnest groups gathered round ministers of the dutch reformed church who doubtless preached conciliation but the majority preferred their bath the god who looks after small things had caused the visitor that day to receive two weeks delayed mails in one from a casual postman and the whole heavy bundle of newspapers tied with a strap he dangled as bait at the edge of the beach crosslegged undressed to his skyblue army shirt sat a lean gingerhaired man on guard over a dozen heaps of clothing his eyes followed the incoming atlantic boat  excuse me mister he said without turning and the speech betrayed his nationality would you mind keeping away from these garments ive been elected janitoron the dutch vote  the visitor moved over against the barbedwire fence and sat down to his mail at the rustle of the newspaperwrappers the gingercoloured man turned quickly the hunger of a pressridden people in his closeset iron grey eyes  have you any use for papers said the visitor  have i any use a quick curved forefinger was already snicking off the outer covers why thats the new york postmark give me the ads at the back of harpers and mclures and im in touch with gods country again did you know how i was aching for papers  the visitor told the tale of the casual postman  providential said the gingercoloured man keen as a terrier on his task both in time and matter yes  the scientific american yet once more oh its good its good his voice broke as he pressed his hawklike nose against the heavilyinked patentspecifications at the end can i keep it i thank youi thank you whywhywellwell the american tyler of all things created do you subscribe to that  im on the free list said the visitor nodding  he extended his bluetanned hand with that air of oriental spaciousness which distinguishes the nativeborn american and met the visitors grasp expertly i can only say that you have treated me like a brother yes ill take every last one you can spare and if ever he plucked at the bosom of his shirt psha i forgot id no card on me but my names ziglerlaughton g zigler an american if ohios still in the union i am sir but im no extreme statesrights man ive used all of my native country and a few others as i have found occasion and now i am the captive of your bow and spear im not kicking at that i am not a coerced alien nor a naturalised texas muletender nor an adventurer on the instalment plan i dont tag after our consul when he comes around expecting the american eagle to lift me out o this by the slack of my pants no sir if a britisher went into indian territory and shot up his surroundings with a colt automatic not that shes any sort of weapon but i take her for an illustration hed be strung up quickern a snowflake ud melt in hell no ambassador of yours ud save him im my neck ahead on this game anyway thats how i regard the proposition  have i gone gunning against the british to a certain extent i presume you never heard tell of the laughtonzigler automatic twoinch fieldgun with selffeeding hopper single oilcylinder recoil and ballbearing gear throughout or laughtite the new explosive absolutely uniform in effect and oneninth the bulk of any present effete chargeflake cannonite cordite troisdorf cellulose cocoa cord or prismi dont care what it is laughtites immense sos the zigler automatic its me its fifteen years of me you are not a gunsharp i am sorry i could have surprised you apart from my gun my tale dont amount to much of anything i thank you but i dont use any tobacco youd be likely to carry bull durham bull durham i take it all backevery last word bull durhamhere if ever you strike akron ohio when this foolwars over remember youve laughton o zigler in your vest pocket including the city of akron weve a little club there hell whats the sense of talking akron with no pants  my gun  for two cents id have shipped her to our filipeens came mighty near it too but from what id read in the papers you cant trust aguinaldos crowd on scientific matters why dont i offer it to our army well youve an effete aristocracy running yours and weve a crowd of politicians the results are practically identical i am not taking any us army in mine  i went to amsterdam with herto this dutch junta that supposes its bossing the war i wasnt brought up to love the british for one thing and for another i knew that if she got in her fine work my gun id stand more chance of receiving an unbiassed report from a crowd of damfool british officers than from a hatful of politicians nephews doing duty as commissaries and ordnance sharps as i said i put the brown man out of the question thats the way i regarded the proposition  the dutch in holland dont amount to a row of pins maybe i misjudge em maybe theyve been swindled too often by selfseeking adventurers to know a enthusiast when they see him anyway theyre slower than the wrath o god but on delusionsas to their winning out next thursday week at 9 amthey areif i may say soquite british  ill tell you a curious thing too i fought em for ten days before i could get the financial side of my game fixed to my liking i knew they didnt believe in the zigler but theyd no call to be crazymean i fixed itfree passage and freight for me and the gun to delagoa bay and beyond by steam and rail then i went aboard to see her crated and there i struck my fellowpassengersall deadheads same as me well sir i turned in my tracks where i stood and besieged the ticketoffice and i said look at here van dunk im paying for my passage and her room in the holdevery square and cubic foot guess he knocked down the fare to himself but i paid i paid i wasnt going to deadhead along o that crowd of pentecostal sweepings twould have hoodooed my gun for all time that was the way i regarded the proposition no sir they were not pretty company  when we struck pretoria i had a hellandahalf of a time trying to interest the dutch vote in my gun an her potentialities the bottom was out of things rather much just about that time kruger was praying some and stealing some and the hollander lot was singing if you havent any money you neednt come round nobody was spending his dough on anything except tickets to europe we were both grossly neglected when i think how i used to give performances in the public streets with dummy cartridges filling the hopper and turning the handle till the sweat dropped off me i blush sir ive made her to do her stunts before kaffirsnaked sons of hamin commissioner street trying to get a holt somewhere  did i talk i despise exaggerationtaint american or scientificbut as true as im sitting here like a blueended baboon in a kloof teddy roosevelts western tour was a maidens sigh compared to my advertising work  long in the spring i was rescued by a commandant called van zyla big fleshy man with a lame leg take away his hair and his gun and hed make a firstclass schenectady barkeep he found me and the zigler on the veldt pretoria wasnt wholesome at that time and he annexed me in a somnambulistic sort o way he was dead against the war from the start but being a dutchman he fought a sight better than the rest of that god and the mauser outfit adrian van zyl slept a heap in the daytimeand didnt love niggers i liked him i was the only foreigner in his commando the rest was georgia crackers and pennsylvania dutchwith a dash o philadelphia lawyer i could tell you things about them would surprise you religion for one thing women for another but i dont know as their notions o geography werent the craziest guess that must be some sort of automatic compensation there wasnt one blamed anthill in their district they didnt know and use but the world was flat they said and england was a days trek from cape town  they could fight in their own way and dont you forget it but i guess you will not they fought to kill and by what i could make out the british fought to be killed so both parties were accommodated  i am the captive of your bow and spear sir the position has its obligationson both sides you could not be offensive or partisan to me i cannot for the same reason be offensive to you therefore i will not give you my opinions on the conduct of your war  anyway i didnt take the field as an offensive partisan but as an inventor it was a condition and not a theory that confronted me yes sir im a democrat by conviction and that was one of the best things grover cleveland ever got off  after three months trek old man van zyl had his commando in good shape and refitted off the british and he reckoned hed wait on a british general of his acquaintance that did business on a circuit between stompiesneuk jackhalputs vrelegen and odendaalstroom year in and year out he was a fixture in that section  hes a dam good man says van zyl hes a friend of mine he sent in a fine doctor when i was wounded and our hollander doc wanted to cut my leg off ya ill guess well stay with him up to date me and my zigler had lived in innocuous desuetude owing to little odds and ends riding out of gear how in thunder was i to know there wasnt the ghost of any road in the country but raw hides cheap and lastin i guess ill make my next gun a thousand pounds heavier though  well sir we struck the general on his beatvrelegen it wasand our crowd opened with the usual compliments at two thousand yards van zyl shook himself into his greasy old saddle and says now we shall be quite happy mr zigler no more trekking joost twelve miles a day till the apricots are ripe  then we hitched on to his outposts and vedettes and cossackpicquets or whatever they was called and we wandered around the veldt arm in arm like brothers  the way we worked lodge was this way the general he had his breakfast at 845 am to the tick he might have been a long island commuter at 842 am id go down to the thirtyfourth street ferry to meet himi mean id see the zigler into position at two thousand i began at three thousand but that was cold and distantand blow him off to two full hopperseighteen roundsjust as they were bringing in his coffee if his crowd was busy celebrating the anniversary of waterloo or the last royal kids birthday theyd open on me with two guns ill tell you about them later on but if they were disengaged theyd all stand to their horses and pile on the ironmongery and washers and typewriters and five weeks grub and in half an hour theyd sail out after me and the rest of van zyls boys lying down and firing till 1145 am or maybe high noon then wed go from labour to refreshment resooming at 2 pm and battling till teatime tuesday and friday was the generals moving days hed trek ahead ten or twelve miles and wed loaf around his flankers and exercise the ponies a piece sometimes hed get hung up in a driftstalled crossin a crickand wed make playful snatches at his wagons first time that happened i turned the zigler loose with high hopes sir but the old man was well posted on rearguards with a gun to em and i had to haul her out with three mules instead of six i was pretty mad i wasnt looking for any experts back of the royal british artillery otherwise the game was mostly even hed lay out three or four of our commando and wed gather in four or five of his once a week or thereon one time i remember long towards dusk we saw em burying five of their boys they stood pretty thick around the graves we wasnt more than fifteen hundred yards off but old van zyl wouldnt fire he just took off his hat at the proper time he said if you stretched a man at his prayers youd have to hump his bad luck before the throne as well as your own i am inclined to agree with him so we browsed along week in and week out a warsharp might have judged it sort of docile but for an inventor needing practice one day and peace the next for checking his theories it suited laughton o zigler  and friendly friendly was no word for it we was brothers in arms  why i knew those two guns of the royal british artillery as well as i used to know the old fifth avenoo stages they might have been brothers too  theyd jolt into action and wiggle around and skid and spit and cough and prize emselves back again during our hours of bloody battle till i could have wept sir at the spectacle of modern white men chained up to these old handpower backnumber flintandsteel reaping machines one of emi called her baldyshed a long white scar all along her barrel id made sure of twenty times i knew her crew by sight but shed come switching and teturing out of the dust of my shells likelike a hen from under a buggyand shed dip into a gully and next thing id know ud be her old nose peeking over the ridge sniffin for us her runnin mate had two grey mules in the lead and a natural wood wheel repainted and a whole raft of ropeends trailin around jever see tom reed with his vest off steerin congress through a heatwave ive been to washington often too oftenfilin my patents i called her tom reed we three ud play pussywantsacorner all round the outposts on offdayscrosslots through the sage and along the mezas till we was shortcircuited by canons o it was great for me and baldy and tom reed i dont know as we didnt neglect the legitimate interests of our respective commanders sometimes for this ballplay i know i did  long towards the fall the royal british artillery grew shyhung back in their breeching sort ofand their shooting was wayway off i observed they wasnt taking any chances not though i acted kitten almost underneath em  i mentioned it to van zyl because it struck me i had about knocked their royal british moral endways  no says he rocking as usual on his pony my captain mankeltow he is sick that is all  sos your captain mankeltows guns i said but im going to make em a heap sicker before he gets well  no says van zyl he has had the enteric a little now he is better and he was let out from hospital at jackhalputs ah that mankeltow he always makes me laugh so i told himlong backat colesberg i had a little home for him at nooitgedacht but he would not comeno he has been sick and i am sorry  how dyou know that i says  why only today he sends back his love by johanna van der merwe that goes to their doctor for her sick babys eyes he sends his love that mankeltow and he tells her tell me he has a little garden of roses all ready for me in the dutch indiesumballa he is very funny my captain mankeltow  the dutch and the english ought to fraternise sir theyve the same notions of humour to my thinking  when he gets well says van zyl you look out mr americaan he comes back to his guns next tuesday then they shoot better  i wasnt so well acquainted with the royal british artillery as old man van zyl i knew this captain mankeltow by sight of course and considering what sort of a man with the hoe he was i thought hed done right well against my zigler but nothing epochmaking  next morning at the usual hour i waited on the general and old van zyl come along with some of the boys van zyl didnt hang round the zigler much as a rule but this was his luck that day  he was peeking through his glasses at the camp and i was helping pepper the generals sowbellyjust as usualwhen he turns to me quick and says almighty how all these englishmen are liars you cannot trust one he says captain mankeltow tells our johanna he comes not back till tuesday and today is friday and there he is almighty the english are all chamberlains  if the old man hadnt stopped to make political speeches hed have had his supper in laager that night i guess i was busy attending to tom reed at two thousand when baldy got in her fine work on me i saw one sheet of white flame wrapped round the hopper and in the middle of it there was one o my mules straight on end nothing out of the way in a mule on end but this mule hadnt any head i remember it struck me as incongruous at the time and when id ciphered it out i was doing the santosdumont act without any balloon and my motor out of gear then i got to thinking about santosdumont and how much better my new way was then i thought about professor langley and the smithsonian and wishing i hadnt lied so extravagantly in some of my specifications at washington then i quit thinking for quite a while and when i resumed my train of thought i was nude sir in a very stale stretcher and my mouth was full of fine dirt all flavoured with laughtite  i coughed up that dirt  hullo says a man walking beside me youve spoke almost in time have a drink  i dont use rum as a rule but i did then because i needed it  what hit usi said  me he said i got you fair on the hopper as you pulled out of that donga but im sorry to say every last round in the hoppers exploded and your guns in a shocking state im real sorry he says i admire your gun sir  are you captain mankeltow i says  yes he says i presoom youre mister zigler your commanding officer told me about you  have you gathered in old man van zyl i said  commandant van zyl he says very stiff was most unfortunately wounded but i am glad to say its not serious we hope hell be able to dine with us tonight and i feel sure he says the general would be delighted to see you too though he didnt expect he says and no one else either by jove he says and blushed like the british do when theyre embarrassed  i saw him slide an episcopalian prayerbook up his sleeve and when i looked over the edge of the stretcher there was halfadozen enlisted men privateshad just quit digging and was standing to attention by their spades i guess he was right on the general not expecting me to dinner but it was all of a piece with their sloppy british way of doing business any gods quantity of fuss and flubdub to bury a man and not an ounce of forehandedness in the whole outfit to find out whether he was rightly dead and i am a congregationalist anyway  well sir that was my introduction to the british army id write a book about it if anyone would believe me this captain mankeltow royal british artillery turned the doctor on me i could write another book about him and fixed me up with a suit of his own clothes and fed me canned beef and biscuits and give me a cigara henry clay and a whiskyand sparklet he was a white man  yees by jove he said dragging out his words like a twist of molasses weve all admired your gun and the way youve worked it some of us betted you was a british deserter i won a sovereign on that from a yeoman and by the way he says youve disappointed me groom pretty bad  where does your groom come in i said  oh he was the yeoman hes a dam poor groom says my captain but hes a wayup barrister when hes at home hes been running around the camp with his tongue out waiting for the chance of defending you at the courtmartial  what courtmartial i says  on you as a deserter from the artillery youd have had a good run for your money anyway youd never have been hung after the way you worked your gun deserter ten times over he says id have stuck out for shooting you like a gentleman  well sir right there it struck me at the pit of my stomachsort of sickish sweetish feelingthat my position needed regularising pretty bad i ought to have been a naturalised burgher of a years standing but ohios my state and i wouldnt have gone back on her for a desertful of dutchmen that and my enthoosiasm as an inventor had led me to the existing crisis but i couldnt expect this captain mankeltow to regard the proposition that way there i sat the rankest breed of unreconstructed american citizen caught redhanded squirting hell at the british army for months on end i tell you sir i wished i was in cincinnatah that summer evening id have compromised on brooklyn  what dyou do about aliens i said and the dirt id coughed up seemed all back of my tongue again  oh says he we dont do much of anything theyre about all the society we get im a bit of a proboer myself he says but between you and me the average boer aint over and above intellectual youre the first american weve met up with but of course youre a burgher  it was what i ought to have been if id had the sense of a common tick but the way he drawled it out made me mad  of course i am not i says would you be a naturalised boer  im fighting against em he says lighting a cigarette but its all a matter of opinion  well i says you can hold any blame opinion you choose but im a white man and my present intention is to die in that colour  he laughed one of those big thickended british laughs that dont lead anywhere and whacked up some sort of compliment about america that made me mad all through  i am the captive of your bow and spear sir but i do not understand the alleged british joke it is depressing  i was introdooced to five or six officers that evening and every blame one of em grinned and asked me why i wasnt in the filipeens suppressing our war and that was british humour they all had to get it off their chests before theyd talk sense but they was sound on the zigler they had all admired her i made out a fairystory of me being wearied of the war and having pushed the gun at them these last three months in the hope theyd capture it and let me go home that tickled em to death they made me say it three times over and laughed like kids each time but half the british are kids specially the older men my captain mankeltow was less of it than the others he talked about the zigler like a lover sir and i drew him diagrams of the hopperfeed and recoilcylinder in his notebook he asked the one british question i was waiting for hadnt i made my workingparts too light the british think weights strength  at lastid been shy of opening the subject beforeat last i said gentlemen you are the unprejudiced tribunal ive been hunting after i guess you aint interested in any other gunfactory and politics dont weigh with you how did it feel your end of the game whats my gun done anyway  i hate to disappoint you says captain mankeltow because i know you feel as an inventor i wasnt feeling like an inventor just then i felt friendly but the british havent more tact than you can pick up with a knife out of a plate of soup  the honest truth he says is that youve wounded about ten of us one way and another killed two battery horses and four mules andoh yes he said youve bagged five kaffirs but buck up he said weve all had mighty close callsshaves he called em i remember look at my pants  they was repaired right across the seat with minneapolis flourbagging i could see the stencil  i aint bluffing he says get the hospital returns doc  the doctor gets em and reads em out under the proper dates that doctor alone was worth the price of admission  i was right pleased right through that i hadnt killed any of these cheerful kids but none the less i couldnt help thinking that a few more kaffirs would have served me just as well for advertising purposes as white men no sir anywhichway you regard the proposition twentyone casualties after months of close friendship like ours waspaltry  they gave me taffy about the gunthe british use taffy where we use sugar its cheaper and gets there just the same they sat around and proved to me that my gun was too good too uniformshot as close as a mannlicher rifle  says one kid chewing a bit of grass i counted eight of your shells sir burst in a radius of ten feet all of em would have gone through one waggontilt it was beautiful he says it was too good  i shouldnt wonder if the boys were right my laughtite is too mathematically uniform in propelling power yes she was too good for this refractory fool of a country the training gear was broke too and we had to swivel her around by the trail but ill build my next zigler fifteen hundred pounds heavier might work in a gasoline motor under the axles i must think that up  well gentlemen i said id hate to have been the death of any of you and if a prisoner can deed away his property id love to present the captain here with what hes seen fit to leave of my zigler  thanks awfly says my captain id like her very much shed look fine in the mess at woolwich that is if you dont mind mr zigler  go right ahead i says ive come out of all the mess ive any use for but shell do to spread the light among the royal british artillery  i tell you sir theres not much of anything the matter with the royal british artillery theyre brainy men languishing under an effete system which when you take good holt of it is englandjust all england times id feel i was talking with real live citizens and times id feel id struck the beef eaters in the tower  how well this way i was telling my captain mankeltow what van zyl had said about the british being all chamberlains when the old man saw him back from hospital four days ahead of time  oh damn it all he says as serious as the supreme court its too bad he says johanna must have misunderstood me or else ive got the wrong dutch word for these blarsted days of the week i told johanna id be out on friday the womans a fool oah daam it all he says i wouldnt have sold old van zyl a pup like that he says ill hunt him up and apologise  he must have fixed it all right for when we sailed over to the generals dinner my captain had van zyl about halffull of sherry and bitters as happy as a clam the boys all called him adrian and treated him like their prodigal father hed been hit on the collarbone by a wad of shrapnel and his arm was tied up  but the general was the peach i presume youre acquainted with the average run of british generals but this was my first i sat on his left hand and he talked likelike the ladies home journal jever read that paper its refined sirand innocuous and full of nickelplated sentiments guaranteed to improve the mind he was it he began by a lydia pinkham hearttoheart talk about my health and hoped the boys had done me well and that i was enjoying my stay in their midst then he thanked me for the interesting and valuable lessons that id given his crowd specially in the matter of placing artillery and rearguard attacks hed wipe his long thin moustache between drinkslimejuice and water he used and blat off into a long aaah and ladle out more taffy for me or old man van zyl on his right i told him how id had my first pisgahsight of the principles of the zigler when i was a fourthclass postmaster on a starroute in arkansas i told him how id worked it up by instalments when i was machinist in waterbury where the dollarwatches come from he had one on his wrist then i told him how id met zalinski hed never heard of zalinski when i was an extra clerk in the naval construction bureau at washington i told him how my uncle who was a truckfarmer in noo jersey he loaned money on mortgage too for ten acres aint enough now in noo jersey how hed willed me a quarter of a million dollars because i was the only one of our kin that called him down when he used to come home with a hardcider jag on him and heave oxbows at his nieces i told him how id turned in every red cent on the zigler and i told him the whole circus of my coming out with her and so on and so following and every forty seconds hed wipe his moustache and blat how interesting really now how interesting  it was like being in an old english book sir like bracebridge hall but an american wrote that i kept peeking around for the boars head and the rosemary and magna charta and the cricket on the hearth and the rest of the outfit then van zyl whirled in he was no ways jagged but thawedthawed sir and among friends they began discussing previous scraps all along the old mans beatabout sixty of emas well as side shows with other generals and columns van zyl told im of a big beat hed worked on a column a week or so before id joined him he demonstrated his strategy with forks on the table  there said the general when hed finished that proves my contention to the hilt maybe im a bit of a proboer but i stick to it he says that under proper officers with due regard to his race prejudices the boerud make the finest mounted infantry in the empire adrian he says youre simply squandered on a cattlerun you ought to be at the staff college with de wet  you catch de wet and i come to your staff collegeeh says adrian laughing but you are so slow generaal why are you so slow for a month he says you do so well and strong that we say we shall handsup and come back to our farms then you send to england and make us a present of twothreesix hundred young men with rifles and wagons and rum and tobacco and such a great lot of cartridges that our young men put up their tails and start all over again if you hold an ox by the horn and hit him by the bottom he runs round and round he never goes anywhere so too this war goes round and round you know that generaal  quite right adrian says the general but you must believe your bible  hooh says adrian and reaches for the whisky ive never known a dutchman a professing atheist but some few have been rather active agnostics since the british sat down in pretoria old man van zylhe told mehad soured on religion after bloemfontein surrendered he was a free stater for one thing  he that believeth says the general shall not make haste thats in isaiah we believe were going to win and so we dont make haste as far as im concerned id like this war to last another five years wed have an army then its just this way mr zigler he says our people are brimfull of patriotism but theyve been born and brought up between houses and england aint big enough to train emnot if you expect to preserve  preserve what i says england  no the game he says and that reminds me gentlemen we havent drunk the king and foxhunting  so they drank the king and foxhunting i drank the king because theres something about edward that tickles me hes so blame british but i rather stood out on the foxhunting ive ridden wolves in the cattle country and needed a drink pretty bad afterwards but it never struck me as i ought to drink about ithereditarily  no as i was saying mr zigler he goes on we have to train our men in the field to shoot and ride i allow six months for it but many columncommandersnot that i ought to say a word against em for theyre the best fellows that ever stepped and most of em are my dearest friendsseem to think that if they have men and horses and guns they can take tea with the boers its generally the other way about aint it mr zigler  to some extent sir i said  im so glad you agree with me he says my command here i regard as a training depot and you if i may say so have been one of my most efficient instructors i mature my men slowly but thoroughly first i put em in a town which is liable to be attacked by night where they can attend ridingschool in the day then i use em with a convoy and last i put em into a column it takes time he says but i flatter myself that any men who have worked under me are at least grounded in the rudiments of their profession adrian he says was there anything wrong with the men who upset van besters applecart last month when he was trying to cross the line to join piper with those horses hed stole from gabbitas  no generaal says van zyl your men got the horses back and eleven dead and van besters he ran to delarey in his shirt they was very good those men they shoot hard  so pleased to hear you say so i laid em down at the beginning of this centurya 1900 vintage you remember em mankeltow he says the central middlesex buncho bustersclerks and floorwalkers mostly and he wiped his moustache it was just the same with the liverpool buckjumpers but they were stevedores lets seethey were a lastcentury draft werent they they did well after nine months you know em van zyl you didnt get much change out of em at pootfontein  no says van zyl at pootfontein i lost my son andries  i beg your pardon commandant says the general and the rest of the crowd sort of cooed over adrian  excoose says adrian it was all right they were good men those but it is just what i say some are so dam good we want to handsup and some are so dam bad we say take the vierkleur into cape town it is not upright of you generaal it is not upright of you at all i do not think you ever wish this war to finish  its a firstclass dressparade for armageddon says the general with luck we ought to run half a million men through the mill why we might even be able to give our native army a look in oh not here of course adrian but down in the colonysay a campofexercise at worcester you mustnt be prejudiced adrian ive commanded a district in india and i give you my word the native troops are splendid men  oh i should not mind them at worcester says adrian i would sell you forage for them at worcesteryes and paarl and stellenbosch but almighty he says must i stay with cronje till you have taught half a million of these stupid boys to ride i shall be an old man  well sir then and there they began arguing whether st helena would suit adrians health as well as some other places they knew about and fixing up letters of introduction to dukes and lords of their acquaintance sos van zyl should be well looked after we own a fair sized block of real estateamerica doesbut it made me sickish to hear this crowd fluttering round the atlas oh yes they had an atlas and choosing stray continents for adrian to drink his coffee in the old man allowed he didnt want to roost with cronje because one of cronjes kin had jumped one of his farms after paardeberg i forget the rights of the case but it was interesting they decided on a place called umballa in india because there was a firstclass doctor there  so adrian was fixed to drink the king and foxhunting and study up the native army in india id like to see em myself till the british general had taught the male white citizens of great britain how to ride dont misunderstand me sir i loved that general after ten minutes i loved him and i wanted to laugh at him but at the same time sitting there and hearing him talk about the centuries i tell you sir it scared me it scared me cold he admitted everythinghe acknowledged the corn before you spokehe was more pleased to hear that his men had been used to wipe the geldt with than i was when i knocked out tom reeds two lead horsesand he sat back and blew smoke through his nose and matured his men like cigars andhe talked of the everlastin centuries  i went to bed nearer nervous prostration than id come in a long time next morning me and captain mankeltow fixed up what his shrapnel had left of my zigler for transport to the railroad she went in on her own wheels and i stencilled her royal artillery mess woolwich on the muzzle and he said hed be grateful if id take charge of her to cape town and hand her over to a man in the ordnance there how are you fixed financially youll need some money on the way home he says at last  for one thing cap i said im not a poor man and for another im not going home i am the captive of your bow and spear i decline to resign office  skittles he says that was a great word of his youll take parole and go back to america and invent another zigler a trifle heavier in the working partsi would weve got more prisoners than we know what to do with as it is he says youll only be an additional expense to me as a taxpayer think of schedule d he says and take parole  i dont know anything about your tariffs i said but when i get to cape town i write home for money and i turn in every cent my boardll cost your country to any tencenturyold department thats been ordained to take it since william the conqueror came along  but confound you for a thickheaded mule he says this war aint any more than just started do you mean to tell me youre going to play prisoner till its over  thats about the size of it i says if an englishman and an american could ever understand each other  but in heavens holy name why he says sitting down of a heap on an anthill  well cap i says i dont pretend to follow your ways of thought and i cant see why you abuse your position to persecute a poor prisoner o war on his  my dear fellow he began throwing up his hands and blushing ill apologise  but if you insist i says there are just one and a half things in this world i cant do the odd half dont matter here but taking parole and going home and being interviewed by the boys and giving lectures on my singlehanded campaign against the hereditary enemies of my beloved country happens to be the one well let it go at that cap  but itll bore you to death he says the british are a heap more afraid of what they call being bored than of dying ive noticed  ill survive i says i aint british i can think i says  by god he says coming up to me and extending the right hand of fellowship you ought to be english zigler  its no good getting mad at a compliment like that the english all do it theyre a crazy breed when they dont know you they freeze up tightern the st lawrence when they do they go out like an icejam in april up till we prisoners leftfour daysmy captain mankeltow told me pretty much all about himself there was his mother and sisters and his bad brother that was a trooper in some colonial corps and how his father didnt get on with him andwell everything as ive said theyre undomesticated the british compared with us they talk about their own family affairs as if they belonged to someone else taint as if they hadnt any shame but it sounds like it i guess they talk out loud what we think and we talk out loud what they think  i liked my captain mankeltow i liked him as well as any man id ever struck he was white he gave me his silver drinkingflask and i gave him the formula of my laughtite thats a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in his vestpocket on the lowest count if he has the knowledge to use it no i didnt tell him the moneyvalue he was english hed send his valet to find out  well me and adrian and a crowd of dam dutchmen was sent down the road to cape town in firstclass carriages under escort what did i think of your enlisted men they are largely different from ours sir very largely as i was saying we slid down south with adrian looking out of the car window and crying dutchmen cry mighty easy for a breed that fights as they do but i never understood how a dutchman could curse till we crossed into the orange free state colony and he lifted up his hand and cursed steyn for a solid ten minutes then we got into the colony and the rebs ministers mostly and schoolmasterscame round the cars with fruit and sympathy and texts van zyl talked to em in dutch and one man a big redbearded minister at beaufort west i remember he jest wilted on the platform  keep your prayers for yourself says van zyl throwing back a bunch of grapes youll need em and youll need the fruit too when the war comes down here you done it he says you and your picayune church thats deader than cronjes dead horses what sort of a god have you been unloading on us you black aas vogels the british came and we beat em he says and you sat still and prayed the british beat us and you sat still he says you told us to hang on and we hung on and our farms was burned and you sat stillyou and your god see here he says i shot my bible full of bullets after bloemfontein went and you and god didnt say anything take it and pray over it before we federals help the british to knock hell out of you rebels  then i hauled him back into the car i judged hed had a fit but lifes curiousand suddenand mixed i hadnt any more use for a reb than van zyl and i knew something of the lies theyd fed us up with from the colony for a year and more i told the minister to pull his freight out of that and went on with my lunch when another man come along and shook hands with van zyl hed known him at close range in the kimberley seige and before van zyl was well seen by his neighbours i judge as soon as this other man opened his mouth i said youre kentucky aint you i am he says and what may you be i told him right off for i was pleased to hear good united states in any mans mouth but he whipped his hands behind him and said im not knowing any man that fights for a tammany dutchman but i presoom youve been well paid you dam gunrunnin yank  well sir i wasnt looking for that and it near knocked me over while old man van zyl started in to explain  dont you waste your breath mister van zyl the man says i know this breed the souths full of em then he whirls round on me and says look at here you yank a little thing like a kings neither here nor there but what youve done he says is to go back on the white man in six places at oncetwo hemispheres and four continentsamerica england canada australia new zealand and south africa dont open your head he says you know well if youd been caught at this game in our country youd have been jiggling in the bight of a lariat before you could reach for your naturalisation papers go on and prosper he says and youll fetch up by fighting for niggers as the north did and he threw me halfacrownenglish money  sir i do not regard the proposition in that light but i guess i must have been somewhat shook by the explosion they told me at cape town one rib was driven in on to my lungs i am not adducing this as an excuse but the cold gods truth of the matter isthe money on the floor did it i give up and cried put my head down and cried  i dream about this still sometimes he didnt know the circumstances but i dream about it and its hell  how do you regard the propositionas a brother if youd invented your own gun and spent fiftyseven thousand dollars on herand had paid your own expenses from the word go an american citizen has a right to choose his own side in an unpleasantness and van zyl wasnt any krugerite  and id risked my hide at my own expense i got that mans address from van zyl he was a mining man at kimberley and i wrote him the facts but he never answered guess he thought i lied damned southern rebel  oh say did i tell you my captain gave me a letter to an english lord in cape town and he fixed things sos i could lie up a piece in his house i was pretty sick and threw up some blood from where the rib had gouged into the lunghere this lord was a crank on guns and he took charge of the zigler he had his knife into the british system as much as any american he said he wanted revolution and not reform in your army he said the british soldier had failed in every point except courage he said england needed a monroe doctrine worse than americaa new doctrine barring out all the continent and strictly devoting herself to developing her own colonies he said hed abolish half the foreign office and take all the old hereditary families clean out of it because he said they was expressly trained to fool around with continental diplomats and to despise the colonies his own family wasnt more than six hundred years old he was a very brainy man and a good citizen we talked politics and inventions together when my lung let up on me  did he know my general yes he knew em all called em teddie and gussie and willie they was all of the very best and all his dearest friends but he told me confidentially they was none of em fit to command a column in the field he said they were too fond of advertising generals dont seem very different from actors or doctors oryes sirinventors  he fixed things for me lovelily at simonstown had the biggest sort of pulleven for a lord at first they treated me as a harmless lunatic but after a while i got em to let me keep some of their books if i was left alone in the world with the british system of bookkeeping id reconstruct the whole british empirebeginning with the army yes im one of their most trusted accountants and im paid for it as much as a dollar a day i keep that ive earned it and i deduct it from the cost of my board when the wars over im going to pay up the balance to the british government yes sir thats how i regard the proposition  adrian oh he left for umballa four months back he told me he was going to apply to join the national scouts if the war didnt end in a year tisnt in nature for one dutchman to shoot another but if adrian ever meets up with steyn therell be an exception to the rule yees when the wars over itll take some of the british army to protect steyn from his fellowpatriots but the war wont be over yet awhile he that believeth dont hurry as isaiah says the ministers and the schoolteachers and the rebsll have a war all to themselves long after the north is quiet  im pleased with this countryits big not so many folk on the ground as in america theres a boom coming sure ive talked it over with adrian and i guess i shall buy a farm somewhere near bloemfontein and start in cattleraising its big and peacefula tenthousandacre farm i could go on inventing there too ill sell my zigler i guess ill offer the patent rights to the british government and if they do the reellynowhowinteresting act over her ill turn her over to captain mankeltow and his friend the lord theyll pretty quick find some gussie or teddie or algie who can get her accepted in the proper quarters im beginning to know my english  and now ill go in swimming and read the papers after lunch i havent had such a good time since willie died he pulled the blue shirt over his head as the bathers returned to their piles of clothing and speaking through the folds added  but if you want to realise your assets you should lease the whole proposition to america for ninetynine years     the bonds of discipline  poseidons law    when the robust and brassbound man commissioned first for sea   his fragile raft poseidon

in the british navythe  whole embellished with profile plates the teuton approaches the matter with pagan thoroughness the muscovite runs him close but the gaul ever an artist breaks enclosure to study the morale at the present day of the british sailorman  in this i conceive he is from time to time aided by the zealous amateur though i find very little in his dispositions to show that he relies on that amateurs hardwon information there existsunlike some other publication it is not bound in lead boardsa work by one m de c based on the absolutely unadorned performances of one of our wellknown acolyte type of cruisers it contains nothing that did not happen it covers a period of two days runs to twentyseven pages of large type exclusive of appendices and carries as many exclamation points as the average dumas novel  i read it with care from the adorably finished prologueit is the disgrace of our navy that we cannot produce a commissioned officer capable of writing one page of lyric proseto the eloquent the joyful the impassioned end and my first notion was that i had been cheated in this sort of bookcollecting you will see how entirely the bibliophile lies at the mercy of his agent  m de c i read opened his campaign by stowing away in one of her boats what time hms archimandrite lay off funchal m de c was always on behalf of his country a madeira portuguese fleeing from the conscription they discovered him eighty miles at sea and bade him assist the cook so far this seemed fairly reasonable next day thanks to his histrionic powers and his ingratiating address he was promoted to the rank of supernumerary captains servanta post which i give his words i flatter myself was created for me alone and furnished me with opportunities unequalled for a task in which one word malapropos would have been my destruction  from this point onward earth and water between them held no marvels like to those m de c had envisagedif i translate him correctly it became clear to me that m de c was either a pyramidal liar or  i was not acquainted with any officer seaman or marine in the archimandrite but instinct told me i could not go far wrong if i took a thirdclass ticket to plymouth  i gathered information on the way from a leading stoker two seaman gunners and an odd hand in a torpedo factory they courteously set my feet on the right path and that led me through the alleys of devonport to a publichouse not fifty yards from the water we drank with the proprietor a huge yellowish man called tom wessels and when my guides had departed i asked if he could produce any warrant or petty officer of the archimandrite  the bedlamite dyou meaner last commission when they all went crazy  shouldnt wonder i replied fetch me a sample and ill see  youll excuse me o course butwhat dyou want im for  i want to make him drunk i want to make you drunkif you like i want to make him drunk here  spoke very andsome ill do what i can he went out towards the water that lapped at the foot of the street i gathered from the potboy that he was a person of influence beyond admirals  in a few minutes i heard the noise of an advancing crowd and the voice of mr wessels  e only wants to make you drunk at is expense dessay ell stand you all a drink come up an look at im e dont bite  a square man with remarkable eyes entered at the head of six large bluejackets behind them gathered a contingent of hopeful freedrinkers  es the only one i could get transferred to the postulant six months back i found im quite accidental mr wessels beamed  im in charge o the cutter our wardroom is dinin on the beach en masse they wont be home till mornin said the square man with the remarkable eyes  are you an archimandrite i demanded  thats me i was as you might say  hold on im a archimandrite a red marine with moist eyes tried to climb on the table was you lookin for a bedlamite iveive been invalided an what with that an visitin my family ome at lewes peraps ive come late ave i  youve ad all thats good for you said tom wessels as the red marine sat crosslegged on the floor  there are those oo havent ad a thing yet cried a voice by the door  i will take this archimandrite i said and this marine will you please give the boats crew a drink now and another in half an hour if if mr  pyecroft said the square man emanuel pyecroft secondclass petty officer  mr pyecroft doesnt object  he dont clear out goldin you picket the hill by yourself throwin out a skirmishinline in ample time to let me know when number ones comin down from his vittles  the crowd dissolved we passed into the quiet of the inner bar the red marine zealously leading the way  and what do you drink mr pyecroft i said  only water warm water with a little whisky an sugar an peraps a lemon  mines beer said the marine it always was  look ere glass you take an go to sleep the picketll be comin for you in a little time an peraps youll ave slep it off by then whats your ship now said mr wessels  the ship o statemost important said the red marine magnificently and shut his eyes  thats right said mr pyecroft hes safest where he is an now heres santy to us allwhat dyou want o me  i want to read you something  tracts again said the marine never opening his eyes well im game a little more ead to it miss please  he thinks es drinkinlucky beggar said mr pyecroft im agreeable to be read to twont alter my convictions i may as well tell you beforehand im a plymouth brother  he composed his face with the air of one in the dentists chair and i began at the third page of m de c  at the moment of asphyxiation for i had hidden myself under the boats cover i heard footsteps upon the superstructure and coughed with empresscoughed loudly mr pyecroft by this time i judged the vessel to be sufficiently far from land a number of sailors extricated me amid language appropriate to their national brutality i responded that i named myself antonio and that i sought to save myself from the portuguese conscription  ho said mr pyecroft and the fashion of his countenance changed then pensively ther beggar what might you have in your hand there  its the story of antonioa stowaway in the archimandrites cutter a french spy when hes at home i fancy what do you know about it  an i thought it was tracts an yet someow i didnt mr pyecroft nodded his head wonderingly our old man was quite rightso was opso was i ere glass he kicked the marine heres our antonio as written a impromptu book he was a spy all right  the red marine turned slightly speaking with the awful precision of the halfdrunk as e got anythin in about my orrible death an execution excuse me but if i open my eyes i shant be well thats where im different from all other men ahem  what about glasss execution demanded pyecroft  the books in french i replied  then its no good to me  precisely now i want you to tell your story just as it happened ill check it by this book take a cigar i know about his being dragged out of the cutter what i want to know is what was the meaning of all the other things because theyre unusual  they were said mr pyecroft with emphasis lookin back on it as i set here more an more i see what an ighly unusual affair it was but it happened it transpired in the archimandritethe ship you can trust antonio ther beggar  take your time mr pyecroft  in a few moments we came to it thus  the old man was displeased i dont deny he was quite a little displeased with the mailboats trottin into madeira every twenty minutes he didnt see why a lopeared portugee had to take liberties with a manowars first cutter anyow we couldnt turn ship round for him we drew him out and took him out to number one drown im e says drown im before e dirties my fine new decks but our owner was tenderhearted take him to the galley e says boil im skin im cook im cut is bloomin hair take is bloomin number well have him executed at ascension  retallick our chief cook an a carthlic was the ony one any way near grateful bein shortanded in the galley he annexes the blighter by the left ear an right foot an sets him to work peelin potatoes so then this antonio that was avoidin the conscription  subscription you pinkeyed matlow said the marine with the face of a stone buddha and whimpered sadly pye dont see any fun in it at all  conscriptioncome to his illegitimate sphere in her majestys navy an it was just then that old op our yeoman of signals an a fastidious joker made remarks to me about is hands  those ands says op properly considered never done a days honest labour in their life tell me those hands belong to a blighted portugee manual labourist and i wont call you a liar but ill say you an the admiralty are pretty much unique in your statements op was always a fastidious jokerin his language as much as anything else he pursued is investigations with the eye of an awk outside the galley he knew better than to advance linehead against retallick so he attacked ong eshlong speakin his remarks as much as possible into the breech of the starboard four point seven an ummin to imself our chief cook ated ummin whats the matter of your bowels he says at last fistin out the mess pork agitated like dont mind me says op im only a mildewed buntintosser e says but speakin for my mess i do hope e says you aint goin to boil your portugee friends boots along o that pork youre smellin so gay  boots boots boots says retallick an he run round like a earwig in a alderstalk boots in the galley e says cooks mate cast out an abolish this cuttercuddlin aborigines boots  they was hove overboard in quick time an that was what op was lyin to for as subsequently transpired  fine arab arch to that cuttercuddlers hinstep he says to me run your eye over it pye e says nails all present an correct e says bunion on the little toe too e says which comes from wearin a tight boot what do you think  dook in trouble peraps i says he aint got the hang of spud skinnin no more he ad e was simply cannibalisin em  i want to know what e as got the ang of says op obstructedlike watch im e says these shoulders were foreigndrilled somewhere  when it comes to down ammicks which is our naval way o goin to byebye i took particular trouble over antonio oo had is ammick ove at im with general instructions to sling it an be sugared in the ensuin melly i pioneered him to the afteratch which is a orifice communicatin with the afterflat an similar suites of apartments he havin navigated at three fifths power immejit ahead o me i wasnt goin to volunteer any assistance nor he didnt need it  mong jew says e sniffin round an twice more mong jewwhich is pure french then he slings is ammick nips in an coils down not bad for a portugee conscript i says to myself casts off the tow abandons him and reports to op  about three minutes later im overauled by our sublootenant navigatin under forced draught with his bearins eated e had the temerity to say id instructed our antonio to sling his carcass in the alleyway an e was peevish about it o course i prevaricated like ell you get to do that in the service nevertheless to oblige mr ducane i went an readjusted antonio you may not ave ascertained that there are two ways o comin out of an ammick when its cut down antonio came out tother wayslidin andsome to his feet that showed me two things first e had been in an ammick before an next he hadnt been asleep then i reproached im for goin to bed where ed been told to go instead o standin by till some one gave him entirely contradictory orders which is the essence o naval discipline  in the middle o this argument the gunner protrudes his rambow from is cabin an brings it all to an urried conclusion with some remarks suitable to is piebald warrantrank navigatin thence under easy steam an leavin antonio to resling his little foreign self my large flat foot comes in detonatin contact with a small objec on the deck not altin for the obstacle nor changin step i shuffles it along under the ball of the big toe to the foot o the hatchway when lightly stoopin i catch it in my right hand and continue my evolutions in rapid time till i eventuates under ops lee  it was a small moroccerbound pocketbook full of indelible pencil writinin french for i could plainly discern the doodeladays which is about as far as my education runs  op fists it open and peruses ed known an arfcaste frenchwoman pretty intricate before he was married when he was trained man in a stinkin gunboat up the saigon river he understood a lot o french domestic brands chieflythe kind that isnt in print  pye he says to me youre a tattician o no mean value i am a trifle shady about the precise bearin an import o this beggars private log here e says but its evidently a case for the owner youll ave your share o the credit e says  nay nay pauline i says you dont catch emanuel pyecroft mine droppin under any postcaptains bows i says in search of honour i says ive been there oft  well if you must you must e says takin me up quick but ill speak a good word for you pye  youll shut your mouth op i says or you an mell part brassrags the owner has his duties an i have mine we will keep station i says nor seek to deviate  deviate to blazes says op im goin to deviate to the owners comfortable cabin direct so he deviated  mr pyecroft leaned forward and dealt the marine a large pattern navy kick ere glass you was sentry when op went to the old manthe first time with antonios washinbook tell us what transpired youre sober you dont know how sober you are  the marine cautiously raised his head a few inches as mr pyecroft said he was soberafter some rmli fashion of his own devising op bounds in like a startled anteloper carryin is signalslate at the ready the old man was settin down to is bountiful platternot like you an me without anythin more in sight for an ole night an arf a day talkin about food  no no no cried pyecroft kicking again what about op i thought the marines ribs would have snapped but he merely hiccuped  oh im e ad it written all down on is little slatei thinkan e shoves it under the old mans nose shut the door says op for eavins sake shut the cabin door then the old man must ha said somethin bout irons ill put em on sir in your very presence says op only ear my prayer orwords to that fect it was jus the same with me when i called our sergeant a bladderbellied lardeaded perspirin pensioncheater they ony put on the chargesheet words to that effect spoiled the ole fect  op op op what about op thundered pyecroft  op oh shame thing words t that fect door shut nushin more transphired till op comes outnose exshtreme angle plungin fire oror words that effect prouds parrot oh you prou old parrot i says  mr glass seemed to slumber again  lord how a little moisture disintegrates dont it when we had ships theatricals off vigo glass ere played dick deadeye to the moral though of course the lower deck wasnt pleased to see a leatherneck interpretin a strictly maritime part as you might say its only his repartees which e cant contain that conquers him shall i resume my narrative  another drink was brought on this hint and mr pyecroft resumed  the essence o strategy bein forethought the essence o tattics is surprise peraps you didnt know that my forethought avin secured the initial advantage in attack it remained for the old man to ladle out the surprisepackets eavens what surprises that night he dines with the wardroom bein of the kindive told you as we were a appy shipthat likes it and the wardroom liked it too this aint common in the service they had up the new madeiraawful undisciplined stuff which gives you a cordite mouth next morning they told the messmen to navigate towards the extreme an remote orizon an they abrogated the sentry about fifteen paces out of earshot then they had in the gunner the bosun an the carpenter an stood them large round drinks it all come out later wardroom joints bein lowerdeck hash as the sayin isthat our number one stuck to it that e couldnt trust the ship for the job the old man swore e could avin commanded er over two years he was right there wasnt a ship i dont care in what fleet could come near the archimandrites when we give our mind to a thing we held the cruiser biggun records the sailingcutter fancyrig championship an the challengecup row round the fleet we ad the best niggerminstrels the best football an cricket teams an the best squeejee band of anything that ever pushed in front of a brace o screws an yet our number one mistrusted us e said wed be a floatin hell in a week an it ud take the rest o the commission to stop our way they was arguin it in the wardroom when the bridge reports a light three points off the port bow we overtakes her switches on our searchlight an she discloses herself as a collier o no mean reputation makin about seven knots on er lawful occasionsto the cape most like  then the ownerso we eard in good timebroke the boom springin all mines together at close interval  look ere my jokers e says im givin the grist of is arguments remember number one says we cant enlighten this cuttercuddlin gaulish lootenant on the manners an customs o the navy without makin the ship a marketgarden theres a lot in that e says specially if we kept it up lavish till we reached ascension but e says the appearance o this strange sail has put a totally new aspect on the game we can run to just one days amusement for our friend or else whats the good o discipline an then we can turn im over to our presumably shortanded fellowsubject in the smallcoal line out yonder hell be pleased says the old man an so will antonio mrover he says to number one ill lay you a dozen o liquorice an inkit must ha been that new tawny portthat ive got a ship i can trustfor one day e says wherefore he says will you have the extreme goodness to reduce speed as requisite for keepin a proper distance behind this providential tramp till further orders now thats what i call tattics  the other manoeuvres developed next day strictly in accordance with the plans as laid down in the wardroom where they sat long an steady op whispers to me that antonio was a number one spy when e was in commission and a french lootenant when e was paid off so i navigated at three undred and ninety six revolutions to the galley never avin kicked a lootenant up to date i may as well say that i did not manoeuvre against im as a frenchman because i like frenchmen but stricly on is rank an ratin in is own navy i inquired after is health from retallick  dont ask me e says sneerin beind his silver spectacles es promoted to be captains second supernumerary servant to be dressed and addressed as such if e does is dooties same as he skinned the spuds i aint for changin with the old man  in the balmy dawnin it was given out all among the olystones by our sublootenant who was a threewaydischarge devil that all orders after eight bells was to be executed in inverse ration to the cube o the velocity the reglar routine he says was arrogated for reasons o state an policy an any flatfoot who presumed to exhibit surprise annoyance or amusement would be slightly but firmly reproached then the gunner mops up a heathenish large detail for some hankypanky in the magazines an led em off along with our gunnery jack which is to say our gunnery lootenant  that put us on the viva voceparticularly when we understood how the owner was navigatin abroad in his swordbelt trustin us like brothers we shifts into the dress o the day an we musters an we prays ong reggle an we carries on anticipatory to bafflin antonio  then our sergeant of marines come to me wringin his ands an weepin ed been talkin to the sublootenant an it looked like as if his upperworks were collapsin  i want a guarantee e says wringin is ands like this i avent ad sunstroke slavedhowin in tajurrah bay an been compelled to live on quinine an chlorodyne ever since i dont get the horrors off glasses o brown sherry  what ave you got now i says  i aint an officer e says my sword wont be handed back to me at the end o the courtmartial on account o my little weaknesses an no stain on my character im only a pore beggar of a red marine with eighteen years service an why for says he wringin is hands like this all the time must i chuck away my pension sublootenant or no sublootenant look at em he says only look at em marines fallin in for smallarm drill  the leathernecks was layin aft at the double an a more insanitary set of accidents i never wish to behold most of em was in their shirts they had their trousers on of courserolled up nearly to the knee but what i mean is belts over shirts three or four ad our caps an them that had drawn helmets wore their chinstraps like portugee earrings oh yes an three of em ad only one boot i knew what our bafflin tattics was goin to be but even i was mildly surprised when this gay fantasia of brazee drummers halted under the poop because of an ammick in charge of our navigator an a small but ighly efficient landinparty  ard astern both screws says the navigator room for the captains ammick the captains servantcockburn is name washad one end an our newly promoted antonio in a blue slop rig ad the other they slung it from the muzzle of the port poop quickfirer thortships to a stanchion then the old man flickered up smokin a cigarette an brought is stern to an anchor slow an oriental  what a blessin it is mr ducane e says to our sublootenant to be out o sight o the ole pack o blighted admirals whats an admiral after all e says why es only a postcaptain with the pip mr ducane the drill will now proceed what o antonio descendez an get me a split  when antonio came back with the whiskyansoda he was told off to swing the ammick in slow time an that massacritin smallarm party went on with their oratorio the sergeant had been kindly excused from participating an he was jumpin round on the poopladder stretchin is leather neck to see the disgustin exhibition an cluckin like a ash hoist a lot of us went on the fore an aft bridge an watched em like listen to the band in the park all these evolutions i may as well tell you are highly unusual in the navy after ten minutes o muckin about glass erepity es so drunksays that ed had enough exercise for is simple needs an he wants to go ome mr ducane catches him a sanakatowzer of a smite over the ead with the flat of his sword down comes glasss rifle with language to correspond and he fiddles with the bolt up jumps macleanoo was a gosport ighlanderan lands on glasss neck thus bringin him to the deck fully extended  the old man makes a great show o wakin up from sweet slumbers mistah ducane he says what is this painful interregnum or words to that effect ducane takes one step to the front an salutes only nother case of attempted assassination sir he says  is that all says the old man while maclean sits on glasss collar button take him away e says he knows the penalty  ah i suppose that is the invincible morgue britannic in the presence of brutally provoked mutiny i muttered as i turned over the pages of m de c  so glass e was led off kickin an squealin an hove down the ladder into is sergeants volupshus arms e run glass forward an was all for puttin im in irons as a maniac  you refill your waterjacket and cool off says glass sittin down rather winded the trouble with you is you havent any imagination  havent i ive got the remnants of a little poor authority though e says lookin pretty vicious  you ave says glass then for pitys sake ave some proper feelin too im goin to be shot this evenin youll take charge o the firin party  someow or other that made the sergeant froth at the mouth e ad no more play to his intellects than a spitkid e just took everything as it come well that was about all i think unless youd care to have me resume my narrative  we resumed on the old terms but with rather less hot water the marine on the floor breathed evenly and mr pyecroft nodded  i may have omitted to inform you that our number one took a general row round the situation while the smallarm party was at work an o course he supplied the outlines but the details we coloured in by ourselves these were our tattics to baffle antonio it occurs to the carpenter to ave the steamcutter down for repairs e gets is cheeroparty together an down she comes youve never seen a steamcutter let down on the deck ave you its not usual an she takes a lot o humourin thus we ave the starboard side completely blocked an the general traffic tricklin overead along the foreanaft bridge then chips gets into her an begins balin out a mess o small reckonins on the deck simultaneous there come up three o those dirty engineroom objects which we call tiffies an a stoker or two with orders to repair her steamingadgets they get into her an bale out another young christmastreeful of small reckoninsbrass mostly simultaneous it hits the pusser that ed better serve out mess pork for the poor matlow these things half shifted retallick our chief cook off is bedplate yes you might say they broke im wide open e wasnt at all used to em  number one tells off five or six prime ablebodied seamengunners to the pork barrels you never see pork fisted out of its receptacle ave you simultaneous it hits the gunner that nows the day an nows the hour for a noncontinuous class in maxim instruction so they all give way together and the general effect was non plus ultra there was the cutters innards spread out like a fratton pawnbrokers shop there was the tiffies hammerin in the stern of er an they aint antiseptic there was the maxim class in light skirmishin order among the pork an forrard the blacksmith had is forge in full blast makin orseshoes i suppose well that accounts for the starboard side the ony warrant officer oo hadnt a look in so far was the bosun so e stated all out of is own ead that chipss reserve o wood an timber which chips ad stole at our last refit needed restowin it was on the port boomsa young an healthy forest of it for charley peace wasnt to be named longside o chips for burglary  all right says our number one you can ave the whole port watch if you like hells hell e says an when there study to improve  jarvis was our bosuns name he hunted up the ole of the port watch by hand as you might say callin em by name loud an lovin which is not precisely navy makeepigeon they ad that timberloft off the booms an they dragged it up and down like so many sweatin little beavers but jarvis was jealous o chips an went round the starboard side to envy at him  taint enough e says when he had climbed back chips as got his bazaar lookin like a coalhulk in a cyclone we must adop more drastic measures off e goes to number one and communicates with im number one got the old mans leave on account of our goin so slow we were keepin beind the tramp to fit the ship with a full set of patent supernumerary sails four trysailsyes you might call em trysailswas our admiralty allowance in the uneard of event of a cruiser breakin down but we had our awnins as well they was all extricated from the various flats an oles where they was stored an at the end o two hours hard work number one e made out eleven sails o different sorts and sizes i dont know what exact nature of sail youd call empyjamastunsles with a touch of sarahs shimmy perapsbut the riggin of em an all the supernumerary details as you might say bein carried on through an over an between the cutter an the forge an the pork an cleanin guns an the maxim class an the bosuns calaboose and the paintwork was sublime theres no other word for it sublime  the old man keeps swimmin up an down through it all with the faithful antonio at is side fetchin him numerous splits e had eight that mornin an when antonio was detached to get is spyglass or his gloves or his lilywhite andkerchief the old man man would waste em down a ventilator antonio must ha learned a lot about our navy thirst  he did  ah would you kindly mind turnin to the precise page indicated an givin me a résumé of is tattics said mr pyecroft drinking deeply id like to know ow it looked from is side o the deck  how will this do i said once clear of the land like voltaires habakkuk  one o their new commercedestroyers i suppose mr pyecroft interjected  each man seemed veritably capable of allto do according to his will the boats dismantled and forlorn are lowered upon the planking one cries aid me flourishing at the same time the weapons of his business a dozen launch themselves upon him in the orgasm of zeal misdirected he beats them off with the howlings of dogs he has lost a hammer this ferocious outcry signifies that only eight men seek the utensil colliding on the way with some many others which seated in the stern of the boat tear up and scatter upon the planking the ironwork which impedes their brutal efforts elsewhere one detaches from on high wood canvas iron bolts coaldustwhat do i know  thats where es comin the bloomin onjeuew e knows a lot reely  they descend thundering upon the planking and the spectacle cannot reproduce itself in my capacity of valet to the captain whom i have well and beautifully plied with drink since the rising of the sun behold me also ganymede i pass throughout observing it may be not a little they ask orders there is none to give them one sits upon the edge of the vessel and chants interminably the lugubrious roule britanniato endure how lomg  that was me ony twas a life on the ocean wavewhich i hate more than any stinkin tune i know havin dragged too many nasty little guns to it yes number one told me off to that for ten minutes an i aint musical you might say  then come marines halfdressed seeking vainly through this tohu bohu thats one of his names for the archimandrite mr pyecroft for a place whence they shall not be dislodged the captain heavy with drink rolls himself from his hammock he would have his people fire the maxims they demand which maxim that to him is equal the breechlock indispensable is not there they demand it of one who opens a barrel of pork for this navy feeds at all hours he refers them to the cook yesterday my master  yes an retallick nearly had a fit what a truthful an observin little antonio we ave  it is discovered in the hands of a boy who says and they do not rebuke him that he has found it by hazard im afraid i havent translated quite correctly mr pyecroft but ive done my best  why its beautifulyou ought to be a frenchmanyou ought you dont want anything o me youve got it all there  yes but i like your side of it for instance heres a little thing i cant quite see the end of listen of the domain which britannia rules by sufferance my gross captain knew nothing and his navigator if possible less from the bestial recriminations and the indeterminate chaos of the grand deck i ascendedalways with a whiskyandsoda in my handsto a scene truly grotesque behold my captain in plain sea at issue with his navigator a crisis of nerves due to the enormous quantity of alcohol which he had swallowed up to then has filled for him the ocean with dangers imaginary and fantastic incapable of judgment menaced by the phantasms of his brain inflamed he envisages islands perhaps of the hesperides beneath his keelvigias innumerable i dont know what a vigia is mr pyecroft he creates shoals sad and farreaching of the midatlantic what was that now  oh i see that come after dinner when our navigator threw is cap down an danced on it danby was quartermaster they ad a teaparty on the bridge it was the old mans contribution does he say anything about the leadsmen  is this it overborne by his superiors causeless suspicion the navigator took off the badges of his rank and cast them at the feet of my captain and sobbed a disgusting and maudlin reconciliation followed the argument renewed itself each grasping the wheel crapulous that means drunk i think mr pyecroft shouting it appeared that my captain would chenaler i dont know what that means mr pyecroft to the cape at the end he placed a sailor with the sound thats the lead i think in his hand garnished with suet was it garnished with suet  he put two leadsmen in the chains o course he didnt know that there mightnt be shoals there e said morgan went an armed his lead to enter into the spirit o the thing they eaved it for twenty minutes but there wasnt any suetonly tallow o course  garnished with suet at two thousand metres of profundity decidedly the britannic navy is well guarded well thats all right mr pyecroft would you mind telling me anything else of interest that happened  there was a good deal one way an another id like to know what this antonio thought of our sails  he merely says that the engines having broken down an officer extemporised a mournful and useless parody of sails oh yes he says that some of them looked like bonnets in a needlecase i think  bonnets in a needlecase they were stunsles that shows the beggars no sailor that trick was really the one thing we did pho i thought he was a sailorman an e hasnt sense enough to see what extemporisin eleven good an drawin sails out o four trysles an a few awnins means e must have been drunk  never mind mr pyecroft i want to hear about your targetpractice and the execution  oh we had a special targetpractice that afternoon all for antonio as i told my crewme bein captain of the portbow quickfirer though im a torpedo man nowit just showed how you can work your gun under any discomforts a shelltwenty sixinch shellsburstin inboard couldnt ave begun to make the varicose collection o titbits which we had spilled on our deck it was a lathera rich creamy lather  we took it very easythat gunpractice we did it in a complimentary jennyaveanothercupo tea style an the crew was strictly ordered not to rupture emselves with unnecessary exertion this isnt our custom in the navy when were in puris naturalibus as you might say but we wasnt so then we was impromptu an antonio was busy fetchin splits for the old man and the old man was wastin em down the ventilators there must ave been four inches in the bilges i should thinkwardroom whisky ansoda  then i thought i might as well bear a hand as look pretty so i let my bundoop go at fifteen undredsightin very particular there was a sort of appy little belch likeno more i give you my wordan the shell trundled out maybe fifty feet an dropped into the deep atlantic  government powder sir sings out our gunnery jack to the bridge laughin horrid sarcastic an then of course we all laughs which we are not encouraged to do in puris naturalibus then of course i saw what our gunnery jack ad been after with his subcutaneous details in the magazines all the mornin watch he had redooced the charges to a minimum as you might say but it made me feel a trifle faint an sickish notwithstanding this spitintheeye business every time such transpired our gunnery lootenant would say somethin sarcastic about government stores an the old man fair howled op was on the bridge with im an e told mecause es a freeknowledgeist an reads characterthat antonios face was sweatin with pure joy op wanted to kick him does antonio say anything about that  not about the kicking but he is great on the gunpractice mr pyecroft he has put all the results into a sort of appendixa table of shots he says that the figures will speak more eloquently than words  what nothin about the way the crews flinched an hopped nothin about the little shells rumblin out o the guns so casual  there are a few pages of notes but they only bear out what you say he says that these things always happen as soon as one of our ships is out of sight of land oh yes ive forgotten he says from the conversation of my captain with his inferiors i gathered that no small proportion of the expense of these nominally efficient cartridges finds itself in his pockets so much indeed was signified by an officer on the deck below who cried in a high voice i hope sir you are making something out of it it is rather monotonous this insult so flagrant albeit well merited was received with a smile of drunken bonhommythats cheerfulness mr pyecroft your glass is empty  resumin afresh said mr pyecroft after a wellwatered interval i may as well say that the targetpractice occupied us two hours and then we had to dig out after the tramp then we half an threequarters cleaned up the decks an mucked about as requisite haulin down the patent awnin stunsles which number one ad made the old man was a shade doubtful of his course cause i eard him say to number one you were right a week o this would turn the ship into a hayti beanfeast but he says pathetic havent they backed the band noble  oh its a picnic for them says number one  but when do we get rid o this whiskypeddlin blighter o yours sir  thats a cheerful way to speak of a viscount says the old man es the bluest blood o france when hes at home  which is the precise landfall i wish im to make says number one itll take all ands and the captain of the head to clean up after im  they wont grudge it says the old man just as soon as its dusk well overhaul our tramp friend an waft him over  then a snomidshipmanmoorshed was is namecome up an says somethin in a low voice it fetches the old man  youll oblige me e says by takin the wardroom poultry for that ive earmarked every fowl weve shipped at madeira so there cant be any possible mistake mrover e says tell em if they spill one drop of blood on the deck he says theyll not be extenuated but hung  mr moorshed goes forward lookin unusual appy even for him the marines was enjoyin a committeemeetin in their own flat  after that it fell dark with just a little streaky oily light on the seaan any thin more chronic than the archimandrite id trouble you to behold she looked like a fancy bazaar and a auctionroomyes she almost looked like a passengersteamer wed picked up our tramp an was about four mile beind er i noticed the wardroom as a class you might say was manoeuvrin en masse an then come the order to cockbill the yards we hadnt any yards except a couple o signallin sticks but we cockbilled em i hadnt seen that sight not since thirteen years in the west indies when a postcaptain died o yellow jack it means a sign o mourning the yards bein canted opposite ways to look drunk an disorderly they do  an what might our last giddygoround signify i asks of op  good evins e says are you in that habit o permittin leathernecks to assassinate lootenants every morning at drill without immejitly avin em shot on the focsle in the horrid crawlycrawly twilight  yes i murmured over my dear book the infinitely lugubrious crepuscule a spectacle of barbarity unparalleledhideouscoldblooded and yet touched with appalling grandeur  ho was that the way antonio looked at it that shows he ad feelins to resoom without anyone givin us orders to that effect we began to creep about an whisper things got stiller and stiller till they was as still asmushrooms then the bugler let off the dead march from the upper bridge he done it to cover the remarks of a cockbird bein killed forrard but it came out paralysin in its tout ensemble you never heard the dead march on a bugle then the pipes went twitterin for both watches to attend public execution an we came up like so many ghosts the ole ships company why mucky arcourt one o our boys was that took in he give tongue like a beaglepup an was properly kicked down the ladder for so doin well there we layengines stopped rollin to the swell all dark yards cockbilled an that merry tune yowlin from the upper bridge we fell in on the focsle leavin a large open space by the capstan where our sailmaker was sittin sewin broken firebars into the foot of an old ammick e looked like a corpse an mucky had another fit o hysterics an you could ear us breathin ard it beat anythin in the theatrical line that even us archimandrites had donean we was the ship you could trust then come the doctor an lit a red lamp which he used for his photographic muckins an chocked it on the capstan that was finally gashly  then come twelve marines guardin glass ere you wouldnt think to see im what a gratooitous an aboundin terror he was that evenin e was in a white shirt ed stole from cockburn an his regulation trousers barefooted ed pipeclayed is ands an face an feet an as much of his chest as the openin of his shirt showed e marched under escort with a firm an undeviatin step to the capstan an came to attention the old man reinforced by an extra strong splithis seventeenth an e didnt throw that down the ventilatorcome up on the bridge an stood like a image op oo was with im says that e heard antonios teeth singin not chatterinsingin like funnelstays in a typhoon yes a moanin æolian harp op said  when you are ready sir drop your andkerchief number one whispers  good lord says the old man with a jump eh what what a sight what a sight an he stood drinkin it in i suppose for quite two minutes  glass never says a word e shoved aside an andkerchief which the sublootenant proffered im to bind is eyes withquiet an collected an if we adnt been feelin so very much as we did feel his gestures would ave brought down the ouse i cant open my eyes or ill be sick said the marine with appalling clearness im pretty far gonei know itbut there wasnt anyone could ave beaten edwardo glass rmli that time why i scared myself nearly into the orrors go on pye glass is in supportas ever  then the old man drops is andkerchief an the firinparty fires like one man glass drops forward twitchin an eavin horrid natural into the shotted ammick all spread out before him and the firin party closes in to guard the remains of the deceased while sails is stitchin it up an when they lifted that ammick it was one wringin mess of blood they ony expended one wardroom cockbird too did you know poultry bled that extravagant i never did  the old manso op told mestayed on the bridge brought up on a dead centre number one was similarly though lesser impressed but o course is duty was to think of is fine white decks an the blood arf a mo sir he says when the old man was for leavin we have to wait for the burial which i am informed takes place immejit  its beyond me says the owner there was general instructions for an execution but i never knew i had such a dependable push of mountebanks aboard he says im all cold up my back still  the marines carried the corpse below then the bugle give us some more dead march then we eard a splash from a bow sixpounder port an the bugle struck up a cheerful tune the whole lower deck was complimentin glass oo took it very meek e is a good actor for all es a leatherneck  now said the old man we must turn over antonio hes in what i have eard called one perspirin funk  of course im tellin it slow but it all appened much quicker we run down our trampowithout o course informin antonio of is appy destiny an inquired of er if she had any use for a free and gratis stowaway oh yes she said shed be highly grateful but she seemed a shade puzzled at our generosity as you might put it an we lay by till she lowered a boat then antoniowho was unappy distinctly unappywas politely requested to navigate elsewhere which i dont think he looked for op was deputed to convey the information an op got in one sixteeninch kick which oisted im all up the ladder op aint really vindictive an es fond of the french especially the women but his chances o kicking lootenants was like the cartridgereduced to a minimum  the boat adnt more than shoved off before a change as you might say came oer the spirit of our dream the old man says like elphinstone an bruce in the portsmouth election when i was a boy gentlemen he says for gentlemen you have shown yourselves to befrom the bottom of my heart i thank you the status an position of our late lamented shipmate made it obligate e says to take certain steps not strictly included in the regulations an nobly says e have you assisted me now e says you hold the false and felonious reputation of bein the smartest ship in the service pigsties e says is plane trigonometry alongside our present disgustin state efface the effects of this indecent orgy he says jump you lopeared flatfooted butterbacked amalekites dig out you brinyeyed beggars  do captains talk like that in the navy mr pyecroft i asked  ive told you once i only give the grist of his arguments the bosuns mate translates it to the lower deck as you may put it and the lower deck springs smartly to attention it took us half the night fore we got er anyway shipshape but by sunrise she was beautiful as ever and we resoomed ive thought it over a lot since yes an ive thought a lot of antonio trimmin coal in that tramps bunkers e must ave been highly surprised wasnt he  he was mr pyecroft i responded but now were talking of it werent you all a little surprised  it come as a pleasant relief to the regular routine said mr pyecroft we appreciated it as an easy way o workin for your country butthe old man was righta week o similar manoeuvres would ave knocked our moral doublebottoms bung out now couldnt you oblige with antonios account of glasss execution  i obliged for nearly ten minutes it was at best but a feeble rendering of m de cs magnificent prose through which the soul of the poet the eye of the mariner and the heart of the patriot bore magnificent accord his account of his descent from the side of the infamous vessel consecrated to blood in the vast and gathering dusk of the trembling ocean could only be matched by his description of the dishonoured hammock sinking unnoticed through the depths while above the bugler played music of an indefinable brutality  by the way what did the bugler play after glasss funeral i asked  him oh e played the strict qt its a very old song we ad it in fratton nearly fifteen years back said mr pyecroft sleepily  i stirred the sugar dregs in my glass suddenly entered armed men wet and discourteous tom wessels smiling nervously in the background  where is thatminutely particularised personglass said the sergeant of the picket  ere the marine rose to the strictest of attentions an its no good smelling of my breath because im strictly an ruinously sober  oh an what may you have been doin with yourself  listenin to tracts you can look ive had the evenin of my little life lead on to the cornucopias midmost dunjing cell theres a crowd of brassatted blighters there which will say ive been absent without leaf never mind i forgive them beforeand the evenin of my life an please dont forget it then in a tone of most ingratiating apology to me i soaked it all in beind my shut eyes imhe jerked a contemptuous thumb towards mr pyecroftes a flatfoot a indigoblue matlow e never saw the fun from first to last a mournful beggarmost depressin private glass departed leaning heavily on the escorts arm  mr pyecroft wrinkled his brows in thoughtthe profound and farreaching meditation that follows five glasses of hot whiskyandwater  well i dont see anything comicalgreatlyexcept here an there specially about those redooced charges in the guns do you see anything funny in it  there was that in his eye which warned me the night was too wet for argument  no mr pyecroft i dont i replied it was a beautiful tale and i thank you very much     a sahibs war  the runners                                     news   what is the word that they tell nownownow   the

punjab lahore amritzar attaree belike my village is north over the fields three miles from attaree near the big white house which was copied from a certain place of the great queens by byi have forgotten the name can the presence recall it sirdar dyal singh attareewalla yes that is the very man but how does the presence know born and bred in hind was he oooh this is quite a different matter the sahibs nurse was a surtee woman from the bombay side that was a pity she should have been an upcountry wench for those make stout nurses there is no land like the punjab there are no people like the sikhs umr singh is my name yes an old man yes a trooper only after all these years yees look at my uniform if the sahib doubts naynay the sahib looks too closely all marks of rank were picked off it long ago butbut it is truemine is not a common cloth such as troopers use for their coats andthe sahib has sharp eyesthat black mark is such a mark as a silver chain leaves when long worn on the breast the sahib says that troopers do not wear silver chains noo troopers do not wear the arder of beritish india no the sahib should have been in the police of the punjab i am not a trooper but i have been a sahibs servant for nearly a yearbearer butler sweeper any and all three the sahib says that sikhs do not take menial service true but it was for kurban sahib my kurban sahibdead these three months                                youngof a reddish facewith blue eyes and he lilted a little on his feet when he was pleased and cracked his fingerjoints so did his father before him who was deputycommissioner of jullundur in my fathers time when i rode with the gurgaon rissala my father jwala singh a sikh of sikhshe fought against the english at sobraon and carried the mark to his death so we were knit as it were by a bloodtie i and my kurban sahib yes i was a trooper firstnay i had risen to a lanceduffadar i rememberand my father gave me a dun stallion of his own breeding on that day and he was a little baba sitting upon a wall by the paradeground with his ayahall in white sahiblaughing at the end of our drill and his father and mine talked together and mine beckoned to me and i dismounted and the baba put his hand into mineeighteentwentyfive twentyseven years gone nowkurban sahibmy kurban sahib oh we were great friends after that he cut his teeth on my swordhilt as the saying is he called me big umr singhbuwwa umwa singh for he could not speak plain he stood only this high sahib from the bottom of this truck but he knew all our troopers by nameevery one and he went to england and he became a young man and back he came lilting a little in his walk and cracking his fingerjointsback to his own regiment and to me he had not forgotten either our speech or our customs he was a sikh at heart sahib he was rich openhanded just a friend of poor troopers keen eyed jestful and careless i could tell tales about him in his first years there was very little he hid from me i was his umr singh and when we were alone he called me father and i called him son yes that was how we spoke we spoke freely together on everythingabout war and women and money and advancement and such all  we spoke about this war too long before it came there were many box wallas pedlars with pathans a few in this country notably at the city of yunasbagh johannesburg and they sent news in every week how the sahibs lay without weapons under the heel of the boerlog and how big guns were hauled up and down the streets to keep sahibs in order and how a sahib called eger sahib edgar was killed for a jest by the boerlog the sahib knows how we of hind hear all that passes over the earth there was not a gun cocked in yunasbagh that the echo did not come into hind in a month the sahibs are very clever but they forget their own cleverness has created the dak the post and that for an anna or two all things become known we of hind listened and heard and wondered and when it was a sure thing as reported by the pedlars and the vegetablesellers that the sahibs of yunasbagh lay in bondage to the boerlog certain among us asked questions and waited for signs others of us mistook the meaning of those signs wherefore sahib came the long war in the tirah this kurban sahib knew and we talked together he said there is no haste presently we shall fight and we shall fight for all hind in that country round yunasbagh here he spoke truth does the sahib not agree quite so it is for hind that the sahibs are fighting this war ye cannot in one place rule and in another bear service either ye must everywhere rule or everywhere obey god does not make the nations ringstraked truetrue true  so did matters ripena step at a time it was nothing to me except i thinkand the sahib sees this toothat it is foolish to make an army and break their hearts in idleness why have they not sent for men of the tochithe men of the tirahthe men of buner folly a thousand times we could have done it all so gentlyso gently  then upon a day kurban sahib sent for me and said ho dada i am sick and the doctor gives me a certificate for many months and he winked and i said i will get leave and nurse thee child shall i bring my uniform he said yes and a sword for a sick man to lean on we go to bombay and thence by sea to the country of the hubshis niggers mark his cleverness he was first of all our men among the native regiments to get leave for sickness and to come here now they will not let our officers go away sick or well except they sign a bond not to take part in this wargame upon the road but he was clever there was no whisper of war when he took his sickleave i came also assuredly i went to my colonel and sitting in the chair i ami wasof that rank for which a chair is placed when we speak with the colonel i said my child goes sick give me leave for i am old and sick also  and the colonel making the word double between english and our tongue said yes thou art truly sikh and he called me an old devil jestingly as one soldier may jest with another and he said my kurban sahib was a liar as to his health that was true too and at long last he stood up and shook my hand and bade me go and bring my sahib safe again my sahib back againaie me  so i went to bombay with kurban sahib but there at sight of the black water wajib ali his bearer checked and said that his mother was dead then i said to kurban sahib what is one mussulman pig more or less give me the keys of the trunks and i will lay out the white shirts for dinner then i beat wajib ali at the back of watsons hotel and that night i prepared kurban sahibs razors i say sahib that i a sikh of the khalsa an unshorn man prepared the razors but i did not put on my uniform while i did it on the other hand kurban sahib took for me upon the steamer a room in all respects like to his own and would have given me a servant we spoke of many things on the way to this country and kurban sahib told me what he perceived would be the conduct of the war he said they have taken men afoot to fight men ahorse and they will foolishly show mercy to these boerlog because it is believed that they are white he said there is but one fault in this war and that is that the government have not employed us but have made it altogether a sahibs war very many men will thus be killed and no vengeance will be taken true talktrue talk it fell as kurban sahib foretold  and we came to this country even to cape town over yonder and kurban sahib said bear the baggage to the big dakbungalow and i will look for employment fit for a sick man i put on the uniform of my rank and went to the big dakbungalow called maun nihâl seyn footnote mount nelson and i caused the heavy baggage to be bestowed in that dark lower placeis it known to the sahibwhich was already full of the swords and baggage of officers it is fuller nowdead mens kit all i was careful to secure a receipt for all three pieces i have it in my belt they must go back to the punjab  anon came kurban sahib lilting a little in his step which sign i knew and he said we are born in a fortunate hour we go to eshtellenbosch to oversee the despatch of horses remember kurban sahib was squadron leader of the gurgaon rissala and i was umr singh so i said speaking as we dowe didwhen none was near thou art a groom and i am a grass cutter but is this any promotion child at this he laughed saying it is the way to better things have patience father aye he called me father when none were by this war ends not tomorrow nor the next day i have seen the new sahibs he said and they are fathers of owlsall allall  so we went to eshtellenbosch where the horses are kurban sahib doing the service of servants in that business and the whole business was managed without forethought by new sahibs from god knows where who had never seen a tent pitched or a peg driven they were full of zeal but empty of all knowledge then came little by little from hind those pathansthey are just like those vultures up there sahibthey always follow slaughter and there came to eshtellenbosch some sikhsmuzbees thoughand some madras monkeymen they came with horses puttiala sent horses jhind and nabha sent horses all the nations of the khalsa sent horses  all the ends of the earth sent horses god knows what the army did with them unless they ate them raw they used horses as a courtesan uses oil with both hands these needed many men kurban sahib appointed me to the command what a command for me of certain woolly oneshubshiswhose touch and shadow are pollution they were enormous eaters sleeping on their bellies laughing without cause wholly like animals some were called fingoes and some i think red kaffirs but they were all kaffirs filth unspeakable i taught them to water and feed and sweep and rub down yes i oversaw the work of sweepersa jemadar of mehtars headman of a refusegang was i and kurban sahib little better for five months evil months the war went as kurban sahib had said our new men were slain and no vengeance was taken it was a war of fools armed with the weapons of magicians guns that slew at half a days march and men who being new walked blind into high grass and were driven off like cattle by the boerlog as to the city of eshtellenbosch i am not a sahibonly a sikh i would have quartered one troop only of the gurgaon rissala in that cityone little troopand i would have schooled that city till its men learned to kiss the shadow of a government horse upon the ground there are many mullahs priests in eshtellenbosch they preached the jehad against us this is trueall the camp knew it and most of the houses were thatched a war of fools indeed  at the end of five months my kurban sahib who had grown lean said the reward has come we go up towards the front with horses tomorrow and once away i shall be too sick so return make ready the baggage thus we got away with some kaffirs in charge of new horses for a certain new regiment that had come in a ship the second day by terain when we were watering at a desolate place without any sort of a bazaar to it slipped out from the horseboxes one sikander khan that had been a jemadar of saises headgroom at eshtellenbosch and was by service a trooper in a border regiment kurban sahib gave him big abuse for his desertion but the pathan put up his hands as excusing himself and kurban sahib relented and added him to our service so there were three of uskurban sahib i and sikander khansahib sikh and sag dog but the man said truly we be far from our homes and both servants of the raj make truce till we see the indus again i have eaten from the same dish as sikander khan beef too for aught i know he said on the night he stole some swines flesh in a tin from a messtent that in his book the koran it is written that whoso engages in a holy war is freed from ceremonial obligations wah he had no more religion than the swordpoint picks up of sugar and water at baptism he stole himself a horse at a place where there lay a new and very raw regiment i also procured myself a grey gelding there they let their horses stray too much those new regiments  some shameless regiments would indeed have made away with our horses on the road they exhibited indents and requisitions for horses and once or twice would have uncoupled the trucks but kurban sahib was wise and i am not altogether a fool there is not much honesty at the front notably there was one congregation of hardbitten horsethieves tall light sahibs who spoke through their noses for the most part and upon all occasions they said oah hell which in our tongue signifies jehannum ko jao they bore each man a vineleaf upon their uniforms and they rode like rajputs nay they rode like sikhs they rode like the ustrelyahs the ustrelyahs whom we met later also spoke through their noses not little and they were tall dark men with grey clear eyes heavily eyelashed like camels eyesvery proper mena new brand of sahib to me they said on all occasions no feeah which in our tongue means durro mut do not be afraid so we called them the durro muts dark tall men most excellent horsemen hot and angry waging war as war and drinking tea as a sandhill drinks water thieves a little sahib sikander khan swore to me and he comes of a horsestealing clan for ten generations he swore a pathan was a babe beside a durro mut in regard to horselifting the durro muts cannot walk on their feet at all they are like hens on the high road therefore they must have horses very proper men with a just lust for the war aahno feeah say the durro muts they saw the worth of kurban sahib they did not ask him to sweep stables they would by no means let him go he did substitute for one of their troopleaders who had a fever one long day in a country full of little hillslike the mouth of the khaibar and when they returned in the evening the durro muts said wallah this is a man steal him so they stole my kurban sahib as they would have stolen anything else that they needed and they sent a sick officer back to eshtellenbosch in his place  thus kurban sahib came to his own again and i was his bearer and sikander khan was his cook the law was strict that this was a sahibs war but there was no order that a bearer and a cook should not ride with their sahiband we had naught to wear but our uniforms we rode up and down this accursed country where there is no bazaar no pulse no flour no oil no spice no red pepper no firewood nothing but raw corn and a little cattle there were no great battles as i saw it but a plenty of gunfiring when we were many the boerlog came out with coffee to greet us and to show us purwanas permits from foolish english generals who had gone that way before certifying they were peaceful and welldisposed when we were few they hid behind stones and shot us now the order was that they were sahibs and this was a sahibs war good but as i understand it when a sahib goes to war he puts on the cloth of war and only those who wear that cloth may take part in the war good that also i understand but these people were as they were in burma or as the afridis are they shot at their pleasure and when pressed hid the gun and exhibited purwanas or lay in a house and said they were farmers even such farmers as cut up the madras troops at hlinedatalone in burma even such farmers as slew cavagnari sahib and the guides at kabul we schooled those men to be surefifteen aye twenty of a morning pushed off the verandah in front of the bala hissar i looked that the jungilat sahib the commanderinchief would have remembered the old days butno all the people shot at us everywhere and he issued proclamations saying that he did not fight the people but a certain army which army in truth was all the boerlog who between them did not wear enough of uniform to make a loincloth a fools war from first to last for it is manifest that he who fights should be hung if he fights with a gun in one hand and a purwana in the other as did all these people yet we when they had had their bellyful for the time received them with honour and gave them permits and refreshed them and fed their wives and their babes and severely punished our soldiers who took their fowls so the work was to be done not once with a few dead but thrice and four times over i talked much with kurban sahib on this and he said it is a sahibs war that is the order and one night when sikander khan would have lain out beyond the pickets with his knife and shown them how it is worked on the border he hit sikander khan between the eyes and came near to breaking in his head then sikander khan a bandage over his eyes so that he looked like a sick camel talked to him half one march and he was more bewildered than i and vowed he would return to eshtellenbosch but privately to me kurban sahib said we should have loosed the sikhs and the gurkhas on these people till they came in with their foreheads in the dust for the war was not of that sort which they comprehended  they shot us assuredly they shot us from houses adorned with a white flag but when they came to know our custom their widows sent word by kaffir runners and presently there was not quite so much firing no fee ah all the boerlog with whom we dealt had purwanas signed by mad generals attesting that they were welldisposed to the state  they had also rifles not a few and cartridges which they hid in the roof the women wept very greatly when we burned such houses but they did not approach too near after the flames had taken good hold of the thatch for fear of the bursting cartridges the women of the boerlog are very clever they are more clever than the men the boerlog are clever never never no it is the sahibs who are fools for their own honours sake the sahibs must say that the boerlog are clever but it is the sahibs wonderful folly that has made the boerlog the sahibs should have sent us into the game  but the durro muts did well they dealt faithfully with all that country thereaboutsnot in any way as we of hind should have dealt but they were not altogether fools one night when we lay on the top of a ridge in the cold i saw far away a light in a house that appeared for the sixth part of an hour and was obscured anon it appeared again thrice for the twelfth part of an hour i showed this to kurban sahib for it was a house that had been sparedthe people having many permits and swearing fidelity at our stirrupleathers i said to kurban sahib send half a troop child and finish that house they signal to their brethren and he laughed where he lay and said if i listened to my bearer umr singh there would not be left ten houses in all this land i said what need to leave one this is as it was in burma they are farmers today and fighters tomorrow let us deal justly with them he laughed and curled himself up in his blanket and i watched the far light in the house till day i have been on the border in eight wars not counting burma the first afghan war the second afghan war two mahsud waziri wars that is four two black mountain wars if i remember right the malakand and tirah i do not count burma or some small things i know when house signals to house  i pushed sikandar khan with my foot and he saw it too he said one of the boerlog who brought pumpkins for the mess which i fried last night lives in yonder house i said how dost thou know he said because he rode out of the camp another way but i marked how his horse fought with him at the turn of the road and before the light fell i stole out of the camp for evening prayer with kurban sahibs glasses and from a little hill i saw the pied horse of that pumpkinseller hurrying to that house i said naught but took kurban sahibs glasses from his greasy hands and cleaned them with a silk handkerchief and returned them to their case sikander khan told me that he had been the first man in the zenab valley to use glasseswhereby he finished two bloodfeuds cleanly in the course of three months leave but he was otherwise a liar  that day kurban sahib with some ten troopers was sent on to spy the land for our camp the durro muts moved slowly at that time they were weighted with grain and forage and carts and they greatly wished to leave these all in some town and go on light to other business which pressed so kurban sahib sought a short cut for them a little off the line of march we were twelve miles before the main body and we came to a house under a high bushed hill with a nullah which they call a donga behind it and an old sangar of piled stones which they call a kraal before it two thorn bushes grew on either side of the door like babul bushes covered with a golden coloured bloom and the roof was all of thatch before the house was a valley of stones that rose to another bushcovered hill there was an old man in the verandahan old man with a white beard and a wart upon the left side of his neck and a fat woman with the eyes of a swine and the jowl of a swine and a tall young man deprived of understanding his head was hairless no larger than an orange and the pits of his nostrils were eaten away by a disease he laughed and slavered and he sported sportively before kurban sahib the man brought coffee and the woman showed us purwanas from three general sahibs certifying that they were people of peace and goodwill here are the purwanas sahib does the sahib know the generals who signed them  they swore the land was empty of boerlog they held up their hands and swore it that was about the time of the evening meal i stood near the verandah with sikander khan who was nosing like a jackal on a lost scent at last he took my arm and said see yonder there is the sun on the window of the house that signalled last night this house can see that house from here and he looked at the hill behind him all hairy with bushes and sucked in his breath then the idiot with the shrivelled head danced by me and threw back that head and regarded the roof and laughed like a hyena and the fat woman talked loudly as it were to cover some noise after this passed i to the back of the house on pretence to get water for tea and i saw fresh fresh horsedung on the ground and that the ground was cut with the new marks of hoofs and there had dropped in the dirt one cartridge then kurban sahib called to me in our tongue saying is this a good place to make tea and i replied knowing what he meant there are over many cooks in the cookhouse mount and go child then i returned and he said smiling to the woman prepare food and when we have loosened our girths we will come in and eat but to his men he said in a whisper ride away no he did not cover the old man or the fat woman with his rifle that was not his custom some fool of the durro muts being hungry raised his voice to dispute the order to flee and before we were in our saddles many shots came from the rooffrom rifles thrust through the thatch upon this we rode across the valley of stones and men fired at us from the nullah behind the house and from the hill behind the nullah as well as from the roof of the houseso many shots that it sounded like a drumming in the hills then sikandar khan riding low said this play is not for us alone but for the rest of the durro muts and i said be quiet keep place for his place was behind me and i rode behind kurban sahib but these new bullets will pass through five men arow we were not hitnot one of usand we reached the hill of rocks and scattered among the stones and kurban sahib turned in his saddle and said look at the old man he stood in the verandah firing swiftly with a gun the woman beside him and the idiot alsoboth with guns kurban sahib laughed and i caught him by the wrist buthis fate was written at that hour the bullet passed under my armpit and struck him in the liver and i pulled him backward between two great rocks atilt kurban sahib my kurban sahib from the nullah behind the house and from the hills came our boerlog in number more than a hundred and sikandar khan said now we see the meaning of last nights signal give me the rifle he took kurban sahibs riflein this war of fools only the doctors carry swordsand lay bellyflat to the work but kurban sahib turned where he lay and said be still it is a sahibs war and kurban sahib put up his handthus and then his eyes rolled on me and i gave him water that he might pass the more quickly and at the drinking his spirit received permission  thus went our fight sahib we durro muts were on a ridge working from the north to the south where lay our main body and the boerlog lay in a valley working from east to west there were more than a hundred and our men were ten but they held the boerlog in the valley while they swiftly passed along the ridge to the south i saw three boers drop in the open then they all hid again and fired heavily at the rocks that hid our men but our men were clever and did not show but moved away and away always south and the noise of the battle withdrew itself southward where we could hear the sound of big guns so it fell stark dark and sikandar khan found a deep old jackals earth amid rocks into which we slid the body of kurban sahib upright sikandar khan took his glasses and i took his handkerchief and some letters and a certain thing which i knew hung round his neck and sikandar khan is witness that i wrapped them all in the handkerchief then we took an oath together and lay still and mourned for kurban sahib sikandar khan wept till daybreakeven he a pathan a mohammedan all that night we heard firing to the southward and when the dawn broke the valley was full of boerlog in carts and on horses they gathered by the house as we could see through kurban sahibs glasses and the old man who i take it was a priest blessed them and preached the holy war waving his arm and the fat woman brought coffee and the idiot capered among them and kissed their horses presently they went away in haste they went over the hills and were not and a black slave came out and washed the doorsills with bright water sikandar khan saw through the glasses that the stain was blood and he laughed saying wounded men lie there we shall yet get vengeance  about noon we saw a thin high smoke to the southward such a smoke as a burning house will make in sunshine and sikandar khan who knows how to take a bearing across a hill said at last we have burned the house of the pumpkinseller whence they signalled and i said what need now that they have slain my child let me mourn it was a high smoke and the old man as i saw came out into the verandah to behold it and shook his clenched hands at it so we lay till the twilight foodless and without water for we had vowed a vow neither to eat nor to drink till we had accomplished the matter i had a little opium left of which i gave sikandar khan the half because he loved kurban sahib when it was full dark we sharpened our sabres upon a certain softish rock which mixed with water sharpens steel well and we took off our boots and we went down to the house and looked through the windows very softly the old man sat reading in a book and the woman sat by the hearth and the idiot lay on the floor with his head against her knee and he counted his fingers and laughed and she laughed again so i knew they were mother and son and i laughed too for i had suspected this when i claimed her life and her body from sikandar khan in our discussion of the spoil then we entered with bare swords indeed these boerlog do not understand the steel for the old man ran towards a rifle in the corner but sikandar khan prevented him with a blow of the flat across the hands and he sat down and held up his hands and i put my fingers on my lips to signify they should be silent but the woman cried and one stirred in an inner room and a door opened and a man bound about the head with rags stood stupidly fumbling with a gun his whole head fell inside the door and none followed him it was a very pretty strokefor a pathan they then were silent staring at the head upon the floor and i said to sikandar khan fetch ropes not even for kurban sahibs sake will i defile my sword so he went to seek and returned with three long leather ones and said four wounded lie within and doubtless each has a permit from a general and he stretched the ropes and laughed then i bound the old mans hands behind his back and unwillinglyfor he laughed in my face and would have fingered my beardthe idiots at this the woman with the swines eyes and the jowl of a swine ran forward and sikandar khan said shall i strike or bind she was thy property on the division and i said refrain i have made a chain to hold her open the door i pushed out the two across the verandah into the darker shade of the thorntrees and she followed upon her knees and lay along the ground and pawed at my boots and howled then sikandar khan bore out the lamp saying that he was a butler and would light the table and i looked for a branch that would bear fruit but the woman hindered me not a little with her screechings and plungings and spoke fast in her tongue and i replied in my tongue i am childless tonight because of thy perfidy and my child was praised among men and loved among women he would have begotten mennot animals thou hast more years to live than i but my grief is the greater  i stooped to make sure the noose upon the idiots neck and flung the end over the branch and sikandar khan held up the lamp that she might well see then appeared suddenly a little beyond the light of the lamp the spirit of kurban sahib one hand he held to his side even where the bullet had struck him and the other he put forward thus and said no it is a sahibs war and i said wait a while child and thou shalt sleep but he came nearer riding as it were upon my eyes and said no it is a sahibs war and sikandar khan said is it too heavy and set down the lamp and came to me and as he turned to tally on the rope the spirit of kurban sahib stood up within arms reach of us and his face was very angry and a third time he said no it is a sahibs war and a little wind blew out the lamp and i heard sikandar khans teeth chatter in his head  so we stayed side by side the ropes in our hand a very long while for we could not shape any words then i heard sikandar khan open his water bottle and drink and when his mouth was slaked he passed to me and said we are absolved from our vow so i drank and together we waited for the dawn in that place where we stoodthe ropes in our hand a little after third cockcrow we heard the feet of horses and gun wheels very far off and so soon as the light came a shell burst on the threshold of the house and the roof of the verandah that was thatched fell in and blazed before the windows and i said what of the wounded boerlog within and sikandar khan said we have heard the order it is a sahibs war stand still then came a second shellgood line but shortand scattered dust upon us where we stood and then came ten of the little quick shells from the gun that speaks like a stammereryes pompom the sahibs call itand the face of the house folded down like the nose and the chin of an old man mumbling and the forefront of the house lay down then sikandar khan said if it be the fate of the wounded to die in the fire i shall not prevent it and he passed to the back of the house and presently came back and four wounded boerlog came after him of whom two could not walk upright and i said what hast thou done and he said i have neither spoken to them nor laid hand on them they follow in hope of mercy and i said it is a sahibs war let them wait the sahibs mercy so they lay still the four men and the idiot and the fat woman under the thorntree and the house burned furiously then began the known sound of cartouches in the roofone or two at first then a trill and last of all one loud noise and the thatch blew here and there and the captives would have crawled aside on account of the heat that was withering the thorntrees and on account of wood and bricks flying at random but i said abide abide ye be sahibs and this is a sahibs war o sahibs there is no order that ye should depart from this war they did not understand my words yet they abode and they lived  presently rode down five troopers of kurban sahibs command and one i knew spoke my tongue having sailed to calcutta often with horses so i told him all my tale using bazaartalk such as his kidney of sahib would understand and at the end i said an order has reached us here from the dead that this is a sahibs war i take the soul of my kurban sahib to witness that i give over to the justice of the sahibs these sahibs who have made me childless then i gave him the ropes and fell down senseless my heart being very full but my belly was empty except for the little opium  they put me into a cart with one of their wounded and after a while i understood that they had fought against the boerlog for two days and two nights it was all one big trap sahib of which we with kurban sahib saw no more than the outer edge they were very angry the durro muts very angry indeed i have never seen sahibs so angry they buried my kurban sahib with the rites of his faith upon the top of the ridge overlooking the house and i said the proper prayers of the faith and sikandar khan prayed in his fashion and stole five signallingcandles which have each three wicks and lighted the grave as if it had been the grave of a saint on a friday he wept very bitterly all that night and i wept with him and he took hold of my feet and besought me to give him a remembrance from kurban sahib so i divided equally with him one of kurban sahibs handkerchiefsnot the silk ones for those were given him by a certain woman and i also gave him a button from a coat and a little steel ring of no value that kurban sahib used for his keys and he kissed them and put them into his bosom the rest i have here in that little bundle and i must get the baggage from the hotel in cape townsome four shirts we sent to be washed for which we could not wait when we went upcountryand i must give them all to my colonelsahib at sialkote in the punjab for my child is deadmy baba is dead i would have come away before there was no need to stay the child being dead but we were far from the rail and the durro muts were as brothers to me and i had come to look upon sikandar khan as in some sort a friend and he got me a horse and i rode up and down with them but the life had departed god knows what they called meorderly chaprassi messenger cook sweeper i did not know nor care but once i had pleasure we came back in a month after wide circles to that very valley i knew it every stone and i went up to the grave and a clever sahib of the durro muts we left a troop there for a week to school those people with purwanas had cut an inscription upon a great rock and they interpreted it to me and is was a jest such as kurban sahib himself would have loved oh i have the inscription well copied here read it aloud sahib and i will explain the jests there are two very good ones begin sahib    in memory of   walter decies corbyn   late captain 141st punjab cavalry    the gurgaon rissala that is go on sahib    treacherously shot near this place by   the connivance of the late   hendrik dirk uys   a minister of god   who thrice took the oath of neutrality   and piet his son   this little work  aha this is the first jest the sahib should see this little work     was accomplished in partial   and inadequate recognition of their loss   by some men who loved him    si monumentum requiris circumspice  that is the second jest it signifies that those who would desire to behold a proper memorial to kurban sahib must look out at the house and sahib the house is not there nor the well nor the big tank which they call dams nor the little fruittrees nor the cattle there is nothing at all sahib except the two trees withered by the fire the rest is like the desert hereor my handor my heart empty sahiball empty    their lawful occasions  the wet litany    when the waters countenance   blurrs twixt glance and second glance   when the tattered smokes forerun   ashen neath a silvered sun   when the curtain of the haze   shuts upon our helpless ways        hear the channel fleet at sea

disregarding the inventions of the marine captain whose other name is gubbins let a plain statement suffice  hms caryatid went to portland to join blue fleet for manoeuvres i travelled overland from london by way of portsmouth where i fell among friends when i reached portland hms caryatid whose guest i was to have been had with blue fleet already sailed for some secret rendezvous off the west coast of ireland and portland breakwater was filled with red fleet my official enemies and joyous acquaintances who received me with unstinted hospitality for example lieutenantcommander al hignett in charge of three destroyers wraith stiletto and kobbold due to depart at 6 pm that evening offered me a berth on his thirtyknot flagship but i preferred my comforts and so accepted sleepingroom in hms pedantic 15000 tons leader of the second line after dining aboard her i took boat to weymouth to get my kit aboard as the battleships would go to war at midnight in transferring my allegiance from blue to red fleet whatever the marine captain may say i did no wrong i truly intended to return to the pedantic and help to fight blue fleet all i needed was a new toothbrush which i bought from a chemist in a side street at 915 p m as i turned to go one entered seeking alleviation of a gumboil he was dressed in a checked ulster a black silk hat three sizes too small cordbreeches boots and pure brass spurs these he managed painfully stepping like a prisoner fresh from legirons as he adjusted the pepperplaster to the gum the light fell on his face and i recognised mr emanuel pyecroft late secondclass petty officer of hms archimandrite an unforgettable man met a year before under tom wessels roof in plymouth it occurred to me that when a petty officer takes to spurs he may conceivably meditate desertion for that reason i though a taxpayer made no sign indeed it was mr pyecroft following me out of the shop who said hollowly what might you be doing here  im going on manoeuvres in the pedantic i replied  ho said mr pyecroft an what manner o manoeuvres dyou expect to see in a blighted cathedral like the pedantic i know er i knew her in malta when the vulcan was her permanent tender manoeuvres you wont see more than man an arm watertight doors in your little woollen undervest  im sorry for that  why he lurched heavily as his spurs caught and twanged like tuning forks wars declared at midnight pedantics be sugared buy an am an see life  for the moment i fancied mr pyecroft a fugitive from justice purposed that we two should embrace a robin hood career in the uplands of dorset the spurs troubled me and i made bold to say as much them he said coming to an intricate halt theyre part of the prima facie evidence but as for melet me carry your bagim second in command leadinhand cook steward an lavatory man with a few incidentals for sixpence a day extra on no 267 torpedoboat  they wear spurs there  well said mr peycroft seein that two six seven belongs to blue fleet which left the day before yesterday disguises are imperative it transpired thus the right honourable lord gawd almighty admiral master frankie frobisher kcb commandin blue fleet cant be bothered with one tintorpedoboat more or less and what with lyin in the reserve four years an what with the new kind o tiffy which cleans dynamos with brickdust and oil blast these spurs they wont render two six sevens steamgadgets was paralytic our mr moorshed done his painstakin bestits his first command of a warcanoe matoor age nineteen down that alleyway please but be that as it may his holiness frankie is aware of us crabbin ourselves round the breakwater at five knots an steerin pari passu as the french say up this alleyway please if hed given mr hinchcliffe our chief engineer a little time it would never have transpired for what hinch cant drive he can coax but the new port bein a trifle cloudy an is joints tinglin after a postcaptain dinner frankie come on the upper bridge seekin for a sacrifice we offerin a broadside target got it he told us what is grandmamma oo was a lady an went to sea in stickand stringbatteaus had told him about steam he throwed in his own prayers for the ealth an safety of all steampackets an their officers then he give us several distinct orders the first fewi kept tallywas all about going to hell the next many was about not evolutin in his company when there an the last all was simply repeatin the motions in quick time knowin frankies groovin to be badly eroded by age and lack of attention i didnt much panic but our mr moorshed e took it a little to heart me an mr hinchcliffe consoled im as well as service conditions permits of an we had a résumésupper at the back o the cambersecluded an lugubrious then one thing leadin up to another an our orders except about anchorin where hes booked for leavin us a clear orizon number two six seven is nowmind the edge of the wharfhere  by mysterious doublings he had brought me out on to the edge of a narrow strip of water crowded with coastwise shipping that runs far up into weymouth town a large foreign timberbrig lay at my feet and under the round of her stern cowered close to the wharfedge a slatecoloured unkempt twofunnelled craft of a typebut i am no expertbetween the firstclass torpedoboat and the fullblooded destroyer from her archaic torpedotubes at the stern and quickfirers forward and amidship she must have dated from the early nineties hammerings and clinkings with spurts of steam and fumes of hot oil arose from her inside and a figure in a striped jersey squatted on the engineroom gratings  she aint much of a warcanoe but youll see more life in er than on an whole squadron of bleedin pedantics  but shes laid up hereand blue fleet have gone i protested precisely only in his comprehensive orders frankie didnt put us out of action thus were a nonneglectable fightin factor which you mightnt think from this elevation an mrover red fleet dont know were ere most of ushe glanced proudly at his bootsdidnt run to spurs but were disguised pretty devious as you might say morgan our signaliser when last seen was a dawlish bathingmachine proprietor hinchcliffe was naturally a german waiter and me you behold as a squire of low degree while yonder levantine dragoman on the hatch is our mr moorshed he was the second cutters snottymy snottyon the archimandritetwo yearscape station likewise on the west coast mangrove swampin an gettin the cutter stove in on small an unlikely bars an manufacturin lies to correspond what i dont know about mr moorshed is precisely the same gauge as what mr moorshed dont know about mehalf a millimetre as you might say he comes into awful opulence of his own when es of age an judgin from what passed between us when frankie cursed im i dont think e cares whether hes broke tomorrow orthe day after are you beginnin to follow our tatties theyll be worth followin or are you goin back to your nice little cabin on the pedanticwhich i lay theyve just dismounted the third engineer out ofto eat four fat meals per diem an smoke in the casement  the figure in the jersey lifted its head and mumbled  yes sir was mr pyecrofts answer i ave ascertained that stiletto wraith and kobbold left at 6 p m with the first division o red fleets cruisers except devulotion and cryptic which are delayed by engineroom defects then to me wont you go aboard mr moorshed ud like some one to talk to you buy an am an see life  at this he vanished and the demon of pure irresponsibility bade me lower myself from the edge of the wharf to the teatray plates of no 267  what dyou want said the striped jersey  i want to join blue fleet if i can i replied ive been left behind byan accident  well  mr pyecroft told me to buy a ham and see life about how big a ham do you need  i dont want any ham thank you thats the way up the wharf good night  goodnight i retraced my steps wandered in the dark till i found a shop and there purchased of sardines canned tongue lobster and salmon not less than half a hundredweight a belated sausageshop supplied me with a partially cut ham of pantomime tonnage these things i sweating bore out to the edge of the wharf and set down in the shadow of a crane it was a clear dark summer night and from time to time i laughed happily to myself the adventure was preordained on the face of it pyecroft alone spurred or barefoot would have drawn me very far from the paths of circumspection his advice to buy a ham and see life clinched it presently mr pyecrofti heard spurs clinkpassed me then the jersey voice said what the mischiefs that  asnt the visitor come aboard sir e told me hed purposely abandoned the pedantic for the pleasure of the trip with us told me he was official correspondent for the times an i know hes littery by the way e tries to talk navytalk havent you seen im sir  slowly and dispassionately the answer drawled long on the night pye you are without exception the biggest liar in the service  then what am i to do with the bag sir its marked with his name there was a pause till mr moorshed said oh in a tone which the listener might construe precisely as he pleased  he was the maniac who wanted to buy a ham and see lifewas he if he goes back to the pedantic  precisely sir gives us all away sir  then what possessed you to give it away to him you owl  ive got his bag if e gives anything away hell have to go naked  at this point i thought it best to rattle my tins and step out of the shadow of the crane  ive bought the ham i called sweetly have you still any objection to my seeing life mr moorshed  all right if youre insured wont you come down  i descended pyecroft by a silent flank movement possessing himself of all the provisions which he bore to some hole forward  have you known mr pyecroft long said my host  met him once a year ago at devonport what do you think of him  what do you think of him  ive left the pedanticher boat will be waiting for me at ten oclock toosimply because i happened to meet him i replied  thats all right if youll come down below we may get some grub  we descended a naked steel ladder to a steelbeamed tunnel perhaps twelve feet long by six high leathertopped lockers ran along either side a swinging table with tray and lamp above occupied the centre other furniture there was none  you cant shave here of course we dont wash and as a rule we eat with our fingers when were at sea dyou mind  mr moorshed blackhaired blackbrowed sallowcomplexioned looked me over from head to foot and grinned he was not handsome in any way but his smile drew the heart you didnt happen to hear what frankie told me from the flagship did you his last instructions and ive logged them here in shorthand werehe opened a neat pocketbookget out of this and conduct your own damned manoeuvres in your own damned tinker fashion youre a disgrace to the service and your boats offal  awful i said  nooffaltripesswipesullage mr pyecroft entered in the costume of his calling with the ham and an assortment of tin dishes which he dealt out like cards  i shall take these as my orders said mr moorshed im chucking the service at the end of the year so it doesnt matter  we cut into the ham under the illtrimmed lamp washed it down with whisky and then smoked from the foreside of the bulkhead came an uninterrupted hammering and clinking and now and then a hiss of steam  thats mr hinchcliffe said pyecroft hes what is called a first class engineroom artificer if you hand im a drum of oil an leave im alone he can coax a stolen bicycle to do typewritin  very leisurely at the end of his first pipe mr moorshed drew out a folded map cut from a newspaper of the area of manoeuvres with the rules that regulate these wonderful things below  well i suppose i know as much as an average stickandstring admiral he said yawning is our petticoat ready yet mr pyecroft  as a preparation for naval manoeuvres these councils seemed inadequate i followed up the ladder into the gloom cast by the wharf edge and the big lumberships side as my eyes stretched to the darkness i saw that no 267 had miraculously sprouted an extra pair of funnelssoft for they gave as i touched them  more prima facie evidence you runs a rope fore an aft an you erects perpendickuarly two canvas tubes which you distends with cane hoops thus avin as many funnels as a destroyer at the word o command up they go like a pair of concertinas an consequently collapses equally andy when requisite comin aft we shall doubtless overtake the dawlish bathinmachine proprietor fittin on her bustle  mr pyecroft whispered this in my ear as moorshed moved toward a group at the stern  none of us who aint built that way can be destroyers but we can look as near it as we can let me explain to you sir that the stern of a thorneycroft boat which we are not comes out in a pretty bulge totally different from the yarrow mark which again we are not but on the other and dirk stiletto goblin ghoul djinn and afritered fleet deestroyers with oom we hope to consort later on terms o perfect equalityare thorneycrofts an carry that grecian bend which we are now adjustin to our arrierepenséeas the french would put itby means of painted canvas an iron rods bent as requisite between you an me an frankie we are the gnome now in the fleet reserve at pompey portsmouth i should say  the first sea will carry it all away said moorshed leaning gloomily outboard but it will do for the present  weve a lot of prima facie evidence about us mr pyecroft went on a firstclass torpedo boat sits lower in the water than a destroyer hence we artificially raise our sides with a black canvas washstreak to represent extra freeboard at the same time paddin out the cover of the forward threepounder like as if it was a twelvepounder an variously fakin up the bows of er as you might say weve took thought an added a cubic to our stature its our lenth that sugars us a undred an forty feet which is our lenth into two undred and ten which is about the gnomes leaves seventy feet over which we havent got  is this all your own notion mr pyecroft i asked  in spots you might sayyes though we all contributed to make up deficiencies but mr moorshed not much carin for further navy after what frankie said certainly threw himself into the part with avidity  what the dickens are we going to do  speaking as a seaman gunner i should say wed wait till the sights came on an then fire speakin as a torpedocoxswain lto ti md etc i presume we fall innumber one in rear of the tube etc secure tube to ball or diaphragm clear away securinbar release safetypin from lockinlevers an pray heaven to look down on us as second in command o 267 i say wait an see  whats happened were off i said the timber ship had slid away from us  we are stern first an broadside on if we dont hit anything too hard well do  come on the bridge said mr moorshed i saw no bridge but fell over some sort of conningtower forward near which was a wheel for the next few minutes i was more occupied with cursing my own folly than with the science of navigation therefore i cannot say how we got out of weymouth harbour nor why it was necessary to turn sharp to the left and wallow in what appeared to be surf  excuse me said mr pyecroft behind us i dont mind rammin a bathinmachine but if only one of them weekend weymouth blighters has thrown his empty baccytin into the sea here well rip our plates open on it 267 isnt the archimandrites old cutter  i am hugging the shore was the answer  theres no actual arm in huggin but it can come expensive if pursooed  righto said moorshed putting down the wheel and as we left those scant waters i felt 267 move more freely  a thin cough ran up the speakingtube  well what is it mr hinchcliffe said moorshed  i merely wished to report that she is still continuin to go sir  righto can we whack her up to fifteen dyou think  ill try sir but wed prefer to have the engineroom hatch openat first sir  whacked up then she was and for half an hour was careered largely through the night turning at last with a suddenness that slung us across the narrow deck  this said mr pyecroft who received me on his chest as a large rock receives a shadow represents the gnome arrivin cautious from the direction o portsmouth with admiralty orders  he pointed through the darkness ahead and after much staring my eyes opened to a dozen destroyers in two lines some few hundred yards away  those are the red fleet destroyer flotilla which is too frail to panic about among the fullblooded cruisers inside portland breakwater and several millimetres too excited over the approachin war to keep a look out inshore hence our tattics  we wailed through our sirena long malignant hyenalike howland a voice hailed us as we went astern tumultuously  the gnomecarteretjonesfrom portsmouth with ordersmmmm stiletto moorshed answered through the megaphone in a high whining voice rather like a chaplains  who was the answer  carteretjones  oh lord  there was a pause a voice cried to some friend its podgie adrift on the high seas in charge of a whole deestroyer  another voice echoed podgie and from its note i gathered that mr carteretjones had a reputation but not for independent command  whos your sub said the first speaker a shadow on the bridge of the dirk  a gunner at present sir the stilettobroken downturns over to us  when did the stiletto break down  off the start sir two hours afterafter she left here this evening i believe my orders are to report to you for the manoeuvre signalcodes and join commander hignetts flotilla which is in attendance on stiletto  a smothered chuckle greeted this last moorsheds voice was high and uneasy said pyecroft with a sigh the amount o trouble me an my bright spurs ad fishin out that information from torpedo coxswains and similar blighters in pubs all this afternoon you would never believe  but has the stiletto broken down i asked weakly  how else are we to get red fleets private signalcode any way if she asnt now she will before manoeuvres are ended its only executin in anticipation  go astern and send your coxswain aboard for orders mr jones water carries sound well but i do not know whether we were intended to hear the next sentence they must have given him one intelligent keeper  thats me said mr pyecroft as a black and coalstained dinghyi did not foresee how well i should come to know herwas flung overside by three men  havin bought an am we will now see life he stepped into the boat and was away  i say podgiethe speaker was in the last of the line of destroyers as we thumped asternarent you lonely out there  oh dont rag me said moorshed do you suppose ill have to manoeuvre with your flotilla  no podgie im pretty sure our commander will see you sifting cinders in tophet before you come with our flotilla  thank you she steers rather wild at high speeds  two men laughed together  by the way who is mr carteretjones when hes at home i whispered  i was with him in the britannia i didnt like him much but im grateful to him now i must tell him so some day  they seemed to know him hereabouts  he rammed the caryatid twice with her own steampinnace  presently moved by long strokes mr pyecroft returned skimming across the dark the dinghy swung up behind him even as his heel spurned it  commander fassets compliments to mr l carteretjones and the sooner he digs out in pursuance of admiralty orders as received at portsmouth the better pleased commander fasset will be but theres a lot more  whack her up mr hinchcliffe come on to the bridge we can settle it as we go well  mr pyecroft drew an important breath and slid off his cap  day an night private signals of red fleet complete sir he handed a little paper to moorshed you see sir the trouble was that mr carteretjones bein so to say a little new to his duties ad forgot to give is gunner his admiralty orders in writin but as i told commander fasset mr jones had been repeatin em to me nervouslike most of the way from portsmouth so i knew em by heartan better the commander recognisin in me a man of agility cautioned me to be a father an mother to mr carteretjones  didnt he know you i asked thinking for the moment that there could be no duplicates of emanuel pyecroft in the navy  whats a torpedogunner more or less to a full lootenant commanding six thirtyknot destroyers for the first time e seemed to cherish the ope that e might use the gnome for is own orrible purposes but what i told him about mr joness sad lack o nerve comin from pompey an going dead slow on account of the dark shortcircuited that connection mrover i says to him our orders is explicit stilettos reported broke down somewhere off the start an weve been tryin to coil down a new stiff wire hawser all the evenin so it looks like towin er back dont it i says that more than ever jams his turrets an makes him keen to get rid of us e even hinted that mr carteretjones passin hawsers an assistin the impotent in a seaway might come pretty expensive on the taxpayer i agreed in a disciplined way i aint proud gawd knows i aint proud but when im really diggin out in the fancy line i sometimes think that me in a copper punt singleanded ud beat a cutterfull of de rougemongs in a row round the fleet  at this point i reclined without shame on mr pyecrofts bosom supported by his quivering arm  well said moorshed scowling into the darkness as 267s bows snapped at the shore seas of the broader channel and we swayed together  youd better go on says commander fassett an do what youre told to do i dont envy hignett if he has to drynurse the gnomes commander but what dyou want with signals e says its criminal lunacy to trust mr jones with anything that steams  may i make an observation sir i says suppose i says you was torpedogunner on the gnome an mr carteretjones was your commandin officer an you had your reputation as a second in command for the first time i says well knowin it was his first command of a flotilla what ud you do sir that gouged is unprotected ends openclear back to the citadel  what did he say moorshed jerked over is shoulder  if you were mr carteretjones it might be disrespect for me to repeat it sir  go ahead i heard the boy chuckle  do e says id rub the young blighters nose into it till i made a perishin man of him or a perspirin pillowcase e says which he adds is forty per cent more than he is at present  whilst hes gettin the private signalstheyre rather particular ones i went forrard to see the dirks gunner about borrowin a holdindown bolt for our twelvepounder my open ears while i was rovin over his packet got the followin authentic particulars i heard his voice change and his feet shifted theres been a last council o war of destroyercaptains at the flagship an a lot of things as come out to begin with cryptic and devolution captain panke and captain malan  cryptic and devolution firstclass cruisers said mr moorshed dreamily go on pyecroft  bein delayed by minor defects in engineroom did not as we know accompany red fleets first division of scouting cruisers whose rendezvous is unknown but presumed to be somewhere off the lizard cryptic an devolution left at 930 pm still reportin copious minor defects in engineroom admirals final instructions was they was to put into torbay an mend themselves there if they can do it in twentyfour hours theyre to come on and join the battle squadron at the first rendezvous down channel somewhere i couldnt get that sir if they cant hell think about sendin them some destroyers for escort but his present intention is to go ammer and tongs down channel usin is destroyers for all theyre worth an thus keepin blue fleet too busy off the irish coast to sniff into any eshtuaries  but if those cruisers are crocks why does the admiral let em out of weymouth at all i asked  the taxpayer said mr moorshed  an newspapers added mr pyecroft in torbay theyll look as they was muckin about for strategical purposeshanamerin like blazes in the engine room all the weary day an the skipper droppin questions down the engineroom hatch every two or three minutes ive been there now sir i saw the white of his eye turn broad on mr moorshed  the boy dropped his chin over the speakingtube  mr hinchcliffe whats her extreme economical radius  three hundred and forty knots down to swept bunkers  can do said moorshed by the way have her revolutions any bearing on her speed mr hinchcliffe  none that i can make out yet sir  then slow to eight knots well jog down to fortynine fortyfive or four about and three east that puts us say forty miles from torbay by nine oclock tomorrow morning well have to muck about till dusk before we run in and try our luck with the cruisers  yes sir their picket boats will be panickin round them all night its considered good for the young gentlemen  hallo wars declared theyre off said moorshed  he swung 267s head round to get a better view a few miles to our right the low horizon was spangled with small balls of fire while nearer ran a procession of tiny cigar ends  red hot set em alight said mr pyecroft thats the second destroyer flotilla diggin out for commander fassetts reputation  the smaller lights disappeared the glare of the destroyers funnels dwindled even as we watched  theyre going down channel with lights out thus showin their zeal an drivin all watchofficers crazy now if youll excuse me i think ill get you your pyjamas an youll turn in said pyecroft  he piloted me to the steel tunnel where the ham still swung majestically over the swaying table and dragged out trousers and a coat with a monks hood all hewn from one hairy inchthick board  if you fall over in these youll be drowned theyre lammies ill chock you off with a pillow but sleepin in a torpedoboats what you might call an acquired habit  i coiled down on an ironhard horsehair pillow next the quivering steel wall to acquire that habit the sea sliding over 267s skin worried me with importunate halfcaught confidences it drummed tackily to gather my attention coughed spat cleared its throat and on the eve of that portentous communication retired up stage as a multitude whispering anon i caught the tramp of armies afoot the hum of crowded cities awaiting the event the single sob of a woman and dry roaring of wild beasts a dropped shovel clanging on the stokehold floor was naturally enough the unbarring of arena gates our sucking uplift across the crest of some little swell nothing less than the haling forth of new worlds our halfturning descent into the hollow of its mate the abysmal plunge of godforgotten planets through all these phenomena and morethough i ran with wild horses over illimitable plains of rustling grass though i crouched bellyflat under appalling fires of musketry though i was livingstone painless and incurious in the grip of his lionmy shut eyes saw the lamp swinging in its gimbals the irregularly gliding patch of light on the steel ladder and every elastic shadow in the corners of the frail angleirons while my body strove to accommodate itself to the infernal vibration of the machine at the last i rolled limply on the floor and woke to real life with a bruised nose and a great call to go on deck at once  its all right said a voice in my booming ears morgan and laughton are worse than you  i was gripping a rail mr pyecroft pointed with his foot to two bundles beside a torpedotube which at weymouth had been a signaller and a most able seaman shed do better in a bigger sea said mr pyecroft this lop is what fetches it up  the sky behind us whitened as i laboured and the first dawn drove down the channel tipping the wavetops with a chill glare to me that round wind which runs before the true day has ever been fortunate and of good omen it cleared the trouble from my body and set my soul dancing to 267s heel and toe across the northerly set of the wavessuch waves as i had often watched contemptuously from the deck of a tenthousandton liner they shouldered our little hull sideways and passed scalloped and splayed out toward the coast carrying our white wake in loops along their hollow backs in succession we looked down a leadgrey cutting of water for half a clear mile were flung up on its ridge beheld the channel trafficfullsailed to that fair breezeall about us and swung slantwise light as a bladder elastic as a basket into the next furrow then the sun found us struck the wet gray bows to living leaping opal the colourless deep to hard sapphire the many sails to pearl and the little steamplume of our escape to an inconstant rainbow  a fair day and a fair wind for all thank god said emanuel pyecroft throwing back the cowllike hood of his blanket coat his face was pitted with coaldust and grime pallid for lack of sleep but his eyes shone like a gulls  i told you youd see life think o the pedantic now think o her number one chasin the mobilised gobbies round the lower deck flats think o the pore little snotties now bein washed fed and taught an the yeoman o signals with a pink eye wakin bright an brisk to another perishin day of fiveflag hoists whereas we shall caulk an smoke cigarettes same as the spanish destroyers did for three weeks after war was declared he dropped into the wardroom singing  if youre going to marry me marry me bill its no use muckin about  the man at the wheel uniformed in what had once been a tamoshanter a pair of very worn rmli trousers rolled up to the knee and a black sweater was smoking a cigarette moorshed in a gray balaclava and a brown mackintosh with a flapping cape hauled at our supplementary funnel guys and a thing like a waiter from a soho restaurant sat at the head of the engineroom ladder exhorting the unseen below the following wind beat down our smoke and covered all things with an inchthick layer of stokers so that eyelids teeth and feet gritted in their motions i began to see that my previous experiences among battleships and cruisers had been altogether beside the mark   part ii    the wind went down with the sunset     the fog came up with the tide   when the witch of the north took an eggshell bis     with a little blue devil inside   sink she said or swim she said     its all you will get from me   and that is the finish of him she said     and the eggshell went to sea    the wind got up with the morning     and the fog blew off with the rain   when the witch of the north saw the eggshell     and the little blue devil again   did you swim she said did you sink she said     and the little blue devil replied   for myself i swam but i think he said     theres somebody sinking outside  but for the small detail that i was a passenger and a civilian and might not alter her course torpedoboat no 267 was mine to me all that priceless day moorshed after breakfastfrizzled ham and a devil that pyecroft made out of sardines anchovies and french mustard smashed together with a spannershowed me his few and simple navigating tools and took an observation morgan the signaller let me hold the chamois leathers while he cleaned the searchlight we seemed to be better equipped with electricity than most of our class that lived under a bulbous umbrellacover amidship then pyecroft and morgan standing easy talked together of the kings service as reformers and revolutionists so notably that were i not engaged on this tale i would for its conclusion substitute theirs  i would speak of hinchcliffehenry salt hinchcliffe firstclass engine room artificer and genius in his line who was prouder of having taken part in the hat crusade in his youth than of all his daring his skill and his nickelsteel nerve i consorted with him for an hour in the packed and dancing engineroom when moorshed suggested whacking her up to eighteen knots to see if she would stand it the floor was ankledeep in a creamy batter of oil and water each moving part flicking more oil in zoetropecircles and the gauges invisible for their dizzy chattering on the chattering steel bulkhead leading stoker grant said to be a bigamist an oxeyed man smothered in hair took me to the stokehold and planted me between a searing white furnace and some hellhot iron plate for fifteen minutes while i listened to the drone of fans and the worry of the sea without striving to wrench all that palpitating firepot wide open  then i came on deck and watched moorshedrevolving in his orbit from the canvas bustle and torpedotubes aft by way of engineroom conningtower and wheel to the dolls house of a focslelearned in experience withheld from me moved by laws beyond my knowledge authoritative entirely adequate and yet in heart a child at his play i could not take ten steps along the crowded deck but i collided with some body or thing but he and his satellites swung passed and returned on their vocations with the freedom and spaciousness of the wellpoised stars  even now i can at will recall every tone and gesture with each dissolving picture inboard or oversidehinchcliffes white arm buried to the shoulder in a hornets nest of spinning machinery moorsheds halt and jerk to windward as he looked across the water pyecrofts back bent over the berthon collapsible boat while he drilled three men in expanding it swiftly the outflung white water at the foot of a homewardbound chinaman not a hundred yards away and her shadowslashed ropepurfled sails bulging sideways like insolent cheeks the ribbed and pitted coaldust on our decks all iridescent under the sun the first filmy haze that paled the shadows of our funnels about lunch time the gradual diedown and dulling over of the short cheery seas the sea that changed to a swell the swell that crumbled up and ran allwhither oilily the triumphant almost audible roll inward of wandering fogwalls that had been stalking us for two hours andwelt upon welt chill as the gravethe drive of the interminable main fog of the atlantic we slowed to little more than steerageway and lay listening presently a handbellows foghorn jarred like a corncrake and there rattled out of the mist a big ship literally above us we could count the rivets in her plates as we scrooped by and the little drops of dew gathered below them  wonder why theyre always barksalways steelalways fourmastedan never less than two thousand tons but they are said pyecroft he was out on the turtlebacked bows of her moorshed was at the wheel and another man worked the whistle  this fog is the best thing could ha happened to us said moorshed it gives us our chance to run in on the quiet hallo  a cracked bell rang clean and sharp beautifully grained too a bowsprit surged over our starboard bow the bobstay confidentially hooking itself into our forward rail  i saw pyecrofts arm fly up heard at the same moment the severing of the tense rope the working of the wheel moorsheds voice down the tube saying astern a little please mr hinchcliffe and pyecrofts cry trawler with her gear down look out for our propeller sir or well be wrapped up in the rope  267 surged quickly under my feet as the pressure of the downwardbearing bobstay was removed halfadozen men of the focsle had already thrown out fenders and stood by to bear off a just visible bulwark  still going astern we touched slowly broadside on to a suggestive crunching of fenders and i looked into the deck of a brixham trawler her crew struck dumb  any luck said moorshed politely  not till we met yeou was the answer the lard he saved us from they big ships to be spitted by the little wan where bee gwine tu with our fine new bobstay  yah youve had time to splice it by now said pyecroft with contempt  aie but wem all crushed to port like aigs you was runnin twentyseven knots us reckoned it didnt us albert  liker twentynine an niver no whistle  yes we always do that do you want a tow to brixham said moorshed  a great silence fell upon those wet men of the sea  we lifted a little toward their side but our silent quickbreathing crew braced and strained outboard bore us off as though we had been a mere picketboat  what for said a puzzled voice  for love for nothing youll be abed in brixham by midnight  yiss but trawls down  no hurry ill pass you a line and go ahead sing out when youre ready a rope smacked on their deck with the word they made it fast we slid forward and in ten seconds saw nothing save a few feet of the wire rope running into fog over our stern but we heard the noise of debate  catch a brixham trawler letting go of a free tow in a fog said moorshed listening  but what in the world do you want him for i asked  oh hell came in handy later  was that your first collision  yes i shook hands with him in silence and our tow hailed us  aie yeou little manowar the voice rose muffled and wailing after usve upped trawl usll be glad of a tow leave line just slack abaout as tis now and kip a good fine lookout beind ee  theres an accommodatin blighter for you said pyecroft where does he expect well be with these currents evolutin like sailormen at the agricultural hall  i left the bridge to watch the wirerope at the stern as it drew out and smacked down upon the water by what instinct or guidance 267 kept it from fouling her languidly flapping propeller i cannot tell the fog now thickened and thinned in streaks that bothered the eyes like the glare of intermittent flashlamps by turns granting us the vision of a sick sun that leered and fled or burying all a thousand fathom deep in gulfs of vapours at no time could we see the trawler though we heard the click of her windlass the jar of her trawlbeam and the very flap of the fish on her deck forward was pyecroft with the lead on the bridge moorshed pawed a channel chart aft sat i listening to the whole of the british mercantile marine never a keel less returning to england and watching the fogdew run round the bight of the tow back to its motherfog  aie yeou little manowar wem done with trawl you can take us home if you know the road  right o said moorshed well give the fishmonger a run for his money whack her up mr hinchcliffe  the next few hours completed my education i saw that i ought to be afraid but more clearly this was when a liner hooted down the back of my neck that any fear which would begin to do justice to the situation would if yielded to incapacitate me for the rest of my days a shadow of spread sails deeper than the darkening twilight brooding over us like the wings of azrael pyecroft said she was a swede and miraculously withdrawn persuaded me that there was a working chance that i should reach the beachany beachalive if not dry and this was when an economical tramp laved our portrail with her condenser water were i so spared i vowed i would tell my tale worthily  thus we floated in space as souls drift through raw time night added herself to the fog and i laid hold on my limbs jealously lest they too should melt in the general dissolution  wheres that prevaricatin fishmonger said pyecroft turning a lantern on a scant yard of the gleaming wirerope that pointed like a stick to my left hes doin some fancy steerin on his own no wonder mr hincheliffe is blasphemious the tows sheered off to starboard sir hell fair pull the stern out of us  moorshed invisible cursed through the megaphone into invisibility  aie yeou little manowar the voice butted through the fog with the monotonous insistence of a strayed sheeps we dont all like the road youm takin tis no road to brixham youll be buckled up under prawle point bymbye  do you pretend to know where you are the megaphone roared  iss i reckon but theres no pretence to me  o peter said pyecroft lets hang him at is own gaff  i could not see what followed but moorshed said take another man with you if you lose the tow youre done ill slow her down  i heard the dinghy splash overboard ere i could cry murder heard the rasp of a boathook along the wirerope and then as it had been in my ear pyecrofts enormous and jubilant bellow astern why hes here right atop of us the blighter as pouched half the tow like a shark a long pause filled with soft devonian bleatings then pyecroft solo arpeggie rum rum rum is that all come an try it uncle  i lifted my face to where once gods sky had been and besought the trues i might not die inarticulate amid these halfworked miracles but live at least till my fellowmortals could be made onemillionth as happy as i was happy i prayed and i waited and we went slowslow as the processes of evolutiontill the boathook rasped again  hes not what you might call a scientific navigator said pyecroft still in the dinghy but rising like a fairy from a pantomime trap the leads what e goes by mostly rum is what hes come for an brixham is is ome lay on mucduff  a white whiskered man in a frockcoatas i live by bread a frockcoat seaboots and a comforter crawled over the torpedotube into moorsheds grip and vanished forward  ell probably old three gallon look sharp with that dinghy but is nephew left in charge of the agatha wants two bottles command allowance youre a taxpayer sir do you think that excessive  lead there lead rang out from forward  didnt i say e wouldnt understand compass deviations watch him close itll be worth it  as i neared the bridge i heard the stranger say let me zmell un and to his nose was the lead presented by a trained man of the kings navy  ill tell ee where to goo if yeoull tell your donkeyman what to du im no hand wi steam on these lines we proceeded miraculously and under moorsheds ordersi was the fishermans ganymede even as m de c had served the captaini found both rum and curaçoa in a locker and mixed them equal bulk in an enamelled iron cup  now wem just abeam o where we should be he said at last an here well lay till she lifts id take e in for another bottleand wan for my nevvy but i reckon yeoum shartallowanced for rum thats nivver no navy rum yeoum give me knowed ee by the smack tu un anchor now  i was between pyecroft and moorshed on the bridge and heard them spring to vibrating attention at my side a man with a lead a few feet to port caught the panic through my body and checked like a wild boar at gaze for not far away an unmistakable ships bell was ringing it ceased and another began  them said pyecroft anchored  more said our pilot passing me the cup and i filled it the trawler astern clattered vehemently on her bell pyecroft with a jerk of his arm threw loose the forward threepounder the bar of the backsight was heavily blobbed with dew the foresight was invisible  nothey wouldnt have their picketboats out in this weather though they ought to he returned the barrel to its crotch slowly  be yeou gwine to anchor said macduff smacking his lips or be yeou gwine straight on to livermead beach  tell him what were driving at get it into his head somehow said moorshed and pyecroft snatching the cup from me enfolded the old man with an arm and a mist of wonderful words  and if you pull it off said moorshed at the last ill give you a fiver  lard whats fivers to me young man my nevvy he likes em but i do cherish more on fine drink than filthy lucre any day o gods good weeks leave goo my arm yeou common sailorman i tall ee gentlemen i haint the ramfaced ruddlenosed old fule yeou reckon i be before the

busy sellin fish no need tall me so twanty taime over usll find they ships usll find em if us has to break our fine new bowsprit so close as crumps bulls horn  good egg quoth moorshed and brought his hand down on the wide shoulders with the smack of a beavers tail  usll go look for they by hand usll give they something to play upon an do ee deal with them faithfully an may the lard have mercy on your sowls amen put i in dinghy again  the fog was as dense as everwe moved in the very womb of nightbut i cannot recall that i took the faintest note of it as the dinghy guided by the towrope disappeared toward the agatha pyecroft rowing the bell began again on the starboard bow  were pretty near said moorshed slowing down out with the berthon well sell em fish too and if any one rows navystroke ill break his jaw with the tiller mr hinchcliffe this down the tube youll stay here in charge with gregory and shergold and the engineroom staff morgan stays too for signalling purposes a deep groan broke from morgans chest but he said nothing if the fog thins and youre seen by any one keepem quiet with the signals i cant think of the precise lie just now but you can morgan  yes sir  suppose their torpedonets are down i whispered shivering with excitement  if theyve been repairing minor defects all day they wont have any one to spare from the engineroom and out nets is a job for the whole ships company i expect theyve trusted to the foglike us well pyecroft  that great soul had blown up on to the bridge like a feather ad to see the first o the rum into the agathites sir they was a bit jealous o their commandin officer comin ome so richly lacquered and at first the conversazione languished as you might say but they sprang to attention ere i left six sharp strokes on the bells if any of em are sober enough to keep tally will be the signal that our consort as cast off her tow an is manceuvrin on er own  right o take laughton with you in the dinghy put that berthon over quietly there are you all right mr hinchcliffe  i stood back to avoid the rush of halfadozen shadows dropping into the berthon boat a hand caught me by the slack of my garments moved me in generous arcs through the night and i rested on the bottom of the dinghy  i want you for prima facie evidence in case the vaccination dont take said pyecroft in my ear push off alf  the last bellringing was high overhead it was followed by six little tinkles from the agatha the roar of her falling anchor the clash of pans and loose shouting  where be gwine tu port your ellum aie you muddredger in the fairway goo astern out boats shell sink us  a clearcut navy voice drawled from the clouds quiet you gardeners there this is the cryptic at anchor  thank you for the range said pyecroft and paddled gingerly feel well out in front of you alf remember your fat fist is our only marconi installation the voices resumed  bournemouth steamer he says she be  then where be brixham harbor  damme im a taxpayer tu theyve no right to cruise about this way ill have the laa on ee if anything carries away  then the manofwar  short on your anchor heave short you howling maniacs youll get yourselves smashed in a minute if you drift  the air was full of these and other voices as the dinghy checking swung i passed one hand down laughtons stretched arm and felt an iron gooseneck and a foot or two of a backwardsloping torpedonet boom the other hand i laid on broad cold ironeven the flanks of hms cryptic which is twelve thousand tons  i heard a scrubby raspy sound as though pyecroft had chosen that hour to shave and i smelled paint drop aft a bit alf well put a stencil under the stern sixinch casements  boom by boom laughlin slid the dinghy along the towering curved wall once twice and again we stopped and the keen scrubbing sound was renewed  umpires are ardearted blighters but this ought to convince em captain pankes sternwalk is now above our defenceless eads repeat the evolution up the starboard side alf  i was only conscious that we moved around an iron world palpitating with life though my knowledge was all by touchas for example when pyecroft led my surrendered hand to the base of some bulging sponson or when my palm closed on the knifeedge of the stem and patted it timidlyyet i felt lonely and unprotected as the enormous helpless ship was withdrawn and we drifted away into the void where voices sang     tom pearce tom pearce lend me thy gray mare   all along out along down along lea   i want for to go to widdicombe fair   with bill brewer sam sewer peter gurney harry hawke   old uncle tom cobley an all  thats old sinbad an is little lot from the agatha give way alf you might sing somethin too  im no burnin patti aint there noise enough for you pye  yes but its only amateurs give me the tones of earth and ome ha list to the blighter on the orizon sayin his prayers navyfashion eaven elp me argue that way when im a warrantofficer  we headed with little lapping strokes toward what seemed to be a fair sized riot  an ive eard the devolution called a happy ship too said pyecroft just shows ow a mans misled by prejudice shes peevishthats what she isnastypeevish probly all because the agathites are scratching er paint well rub along alf ive got the lymph  a voice which mr pyecroft assured me belonged to a chief carpenter was speaking through an aperture starboard bow twelvepounder on the lower deck he did not wish to purchase any fish even at grossly reduced rates nobody wished to buy any fish this ship was the devolution at anchor and desired no communication with shore boats  mark how the navy olds its own hes sober the agathites are not as you might say an yet they cant live with im its the discipline that does it ark to the bald an unconvincin watchofficer chimin in i wonder where mr moorshed has got to  we drifted down the devolutions side as we had drifted down her sisters and we dealt with her in that dense gloom as we had dealt with her sister  whai tis a manowar after all i can see the captains whisker all gilt at the edges we took ee for the bournemouth steamer three cheers for the real manowar  that cry came from under the devolutions stern pyecroft held something in his teeth for i heard him mumble our mister moorshed  said a boys voice above us just as we dodged a jet of hot water from some valve i dont half like that cheer if id been the old man id ha turned loose the quickfirers at the first gooff arent they rowing navystroke yonder  true said pyecroft listening to retreating oars its time to go ome when snotties begin to think the fogs thinnin too  i felt a chill breath on my forehead and saw a few feet of the steel stand out darker than the darkness disappearit was then the dinghy shot away from itand emerge once more  hallo what boats that said the voice suspiciously  why i do believe its a real manowar after all said pyecroft and kicked laughton  whats that for laughton was no dramatist  answer in character you blighter say somethin opposite  what boats thatt the hail was repeated  what do yee sayay pyecroft bellowed and under his breath to me give us a hand  its called the mariettaf j stokestorquay i began quaveringly at least thats the name on the nameboard ive been diningon a yacht  i see the voice shook a little and my way opened before me with disgraceful ease  yesh dining private yacht eshmesheralda i belong to torquay yacht club are you member torquay yacht club  youd better go to bed sir goodnight we slid into the rapidly thinning fog  dig out alf put your nix mangiare back into it the fogs peelin off like a petticoat wheres two six seven  i cant see her i replied but theres a light low down ahead  the agatha they rowed desperately through the uneasy dispersal of the fog for ten minutes and ducked round the trawlers bow  well emanuel means god with usso far pyecroft wiped his brow laid a hand on the low rail and as he boosted me up to the trawler i saw moorsheds face white as pearl in the thinning dark  was it all right said he over the bulwarks  vaccination aint in it shes took beautiful but wheres 267 sir pyecroft replied  gone we came here as the fog lifted i gave the devolution four was that you behind us  yes sir but i only got in three on the devolution i gave the cryptic nine though theyre what you might call more or less vaccinated  he lifted me inboard where moorshed and six pirates lay round the agathas hatch there was a hint of daylight in the cool air  where is the old man i asked  still selling em fish i suppose hes a darling but i wish i could get this filthy paint off my hands hallo what the deuce is the cryptic signalling  a pale masthead light winked through the last of the fog it was answered by a white pencil to the southward  destroyer signalling with searchlight pyecroft leaped on the stern rail the first part is private signals ah now shes morsing against the fog postyes postponedep go on departuretill furtherorderswhichwillbe com hes dropped the other m unicatedverbally end he swung round cryptic is now answering readyproceedimmediately whatnewspromiseddestroyer flotilla  hallo said moorshed well never mind theyll come too late  whew thats some ighborn suckling on the destroyer destroyer signals care not all will be known later what merry beehives broken loose now  what odds weve done our little job  whywhyits two six seven  here pyecroft dropped from the rail among the fishy nets and shook the agatha with heavings moorshed cast aside his cigarette looked over the stern and fell into his subordinates arms i heard the guggle of engines the rattle of a little anchor going over not a hundred yards away a cough and morgans subdued hail  so far as i remember it was laughton whom i hugged but the men who hugged me most were pyecroft and moorshed adrift among the fishy nets  there was no semblance of discipline in our flight over the agathas side nor indeed were ordinary precautions taken for the common safety because i was in the berthon they held that patent boat open by hand for the most part we regained our own craft cackling like wild geese and crowded round moorshed and hinchcliffe behind us the agathas boat returning from her fishselling cruise yelled have ee done the trick have ee done the trick and we could only shout hoarsely over the stern guaranteeing them rum by the holdfull  fog got patchy here at 1227 said henry salt hinchcliffe growing clearer every instant in the dawn went down to brixham harbour to keep out of the road heard whistles to the south and went to look i had her up to sixteen good morgan kept on shedding private red fleet signals out of the signalbook as the fog cleared till we was answered by three destroyers morgan signalled em by searchlight alter course to south seventeen east so as not to lose time they came round quick we kept well awayon their port beamand morgan gave em their orders he looked at morgan and coughed  the signalman acting as second in command said morgan swelling then informed destroyer flotilla that cryptic and devolution had made good defects and in obedience to admirals supplementary orders i was afraid they might suspect that but they didnt had proceeded at seven knots at 1123 p m to rendezvous near channel islands seven miles nnw the casquet light ive rendezvoused there myself sir destroyer flotilla would therefore follow cruisers and catch up with them on their course destroyer flotilla then dug out on course indicated all funnels sparking briskly  who were the destroyers  wraith kobbold stiletto lieutenantcommander a l hignett acting under admirals orders to escort cruisers received off the dodman at 7 p m theyd come slow on account of fog  then who were you  we were the afrite portengine broke down put in to torbay and there instructed by cryptic previous to her departure with devolution to inform commander hignett of change of plans lieutenantcommander hignett signalled that our meeting was quite providential after this we returned to pick up our commanding officer and being interrogated by cryptic marked time signalling as requisite which you may have seen the agatha representing the last known rallyingpointor as i should say pivot ship of the evolutionit was decided to repair to the agatha at conclusion of manoeuvre  is there such a thing as one fine big drink aboard this one fine big battleship can do sir said pyecroft and got it beginning with mr moorshed and ending with myself junior to the third firstclass stoker we drank and it was as water of the brook that two and a half inches of stiff treacly navy rum and we looked each in the others face and we nodded brighteyed burning with bliss  moorshed walked aft to the torpedotubes and paced back and forth a captain victorious on his own quarterdeck and the triumphant day broke over the greenbedded villas of torquay to show us the magnitude of our victory there lay the cruisers i have reason to believe that they had made good their defects they were each four hundred and forty feet long and sixtysix wide they held close upon eight hundred men apiece and they had cost say a million and a half the pair and they were ours and they did not know it indeed the cryptic senior ship was signalling vehement remarks to our address which we did not notice  if you take these glasses youll get the general run o last nights vaccination said pyecroft each one represents a torpedo got ome as you might say  i saw on the cryptics port side as she lay half a mile away across the glassy water four neat white squares in outline a white blur in the centre  there are five more to starboard eres the original he handed me a paintdappled copper stencilplate two feet square bearing in the centre the sixinch initials gm  ten minutes ago id ha eulogised about that little trick of ours but morgans performance has shortcircuited me are you happy morgan  bustin said the signalman briefly  you may be gawd forgive you morgan for as queen enrietta said to the ousemaid i never will id ha given a years pay for ten minutes o your signallin work this mornin  i wouldnt ave took it up was the answer perishin eavens above look at the devolutions semaphore two black wooden arms waved from the junior ships upper bridge theyve seen it  the mote on their neighbours beam of course said pyecroft and read syllable by syllable captain malan to captain panke issten cilled frieze your starboard side new admiralty regulation or your number ones private expense now cryptic is saying not understood poor old crippy the devolutes raggin er sore who is gm she says thats fetched the cryptic shes answerin you ought to know examine own paintwork oh lord theyre both on to it now this is balm this is beginning to be balm i forgive you morgan  two frantic pipes twittered from either cruiser a whaler dropped into the water and madly rowed round the ship as a gaycoloured hoist rose to the cryptics yardarm destroyer will close at once wish to speak by semaphore then on the bridge semaphore itself have been trying to attract your attention last half hour send commanding officer aboard at once  our attention after all the attention weve given er too said pyecroft what a greedy old woman to moorshed signal from the cryptic sir  never mind that said the boy peering through his glasses our dinghy quick or theyll paint our marks out come along  by this time i was long past even hysteria i remember pyecrofts bending back the surge of the driven dinghy a knot of amazed faces as we skimmed the cryptics ram and the dropped jaw of the midshipman in her whaler when we barged fairly into him  mind my paint he yelled  you mind mine snotty said moorshed i was all night putting these little earmarks on you for the umpires to sit on leave em alone  we splashed past him to the devolutions boat where sat no one less than her first lieutenant a singularly unhandylooking officer  what the deuce is the meaning of this he roared with an accusing forefinger  youre sunk thats all youve been dead half a tide  dead am i ill show you whether im dead or not sir  well you may be a survivor said moorshed ingratiatingly though it isnt at all likely  the officer choked for a minute the midshipman crouched up in stern said half aloud then i was rightlast night  yesh i gasped from the dinghys coaldust are you member torquay yacht club  hell said the first lieutenant and fled away the cryptics boat was already at that cruisers side and semaphores flicked zealously from ship to ship we floated a minute speck between the two hulls while the pipes went for the captains galley on the devolution  thats all right said moorshed wait till the gangways down and then board her decently we oughtnt to be expected to climb up a ship weve sunk  pyecroft lay on his disreputable oars till captain malan fulluniformed descended the devolutions side with due complimentsnot acknowledged i grieve to saywe fell in behind his sumptuous galley and at last upon pressing invitation climbed black as sweeps all the lowered gangway of the cryptic at the top stood as fine a constellation of marine stars as ever sang together of a morning on a kings ship every one who could get within earshot found that his work took him aft i counted eleven able seamen polishing the breechblock of the stern ninepointtwo four marines zealously relieving each other at the lifebuoy six callboys nine midshipmen of the watch exclusive of naval cadets and the higher ranks past all census  if i die o joy said pyecroft behind his hand remember i died forgivin morgan from the bottom of my eart because like martha we ave scoffed the better part youd better try to come to attention sir  moorshed ran his eye voluptuously over the upper deck battery the huge beam and the immaculate perspective of power captain panke and captain malan stood on the wellbrowned flashplates by the dazzling hatch precisely over the flagstaff i saw two six seven astern her black petticoat half hitched up meekly floating on the still sea she looked like the pious abigail who has just spoken her mind and with folded hands sits thanking heaven among the pieces i could almost have sworn that she wore black worsted gloves and had a little dry cough but it was captain panke that coughed so austerely he favoured us with a lecture on uniform deportment and the urgent necessity of answering signals from a senior ship he told us that he disapproved of masquerading that he loved discipline and would be obliged by an explanation and while he delivered himself deeper and more deeply into our hands i saw captain malan wince he was watching moorsheds eye  i belong to blue fleet sir i command number two six seven said moorshed and captain planke was dumb have you such a thing as a frame plan of the cryptic aboard he spoke with winning politeness as he opened a small and neatly folded paper  i have sir the little mans face was working with passion  ah then i shall be able to show you precisely where you were torpedoed last night inhe consulted the paper with one finely arched eyebrowin nine places and since the devolution is i understand a sister ship he bowed slightly toward caplain malanthe same plan  i had followed the clear precision of each word with a dumb amazement which seemed to leave my mind abnormally clear i saw captain malans eye turn from moorshed and seek that of the cryptics commander and he telegraphed as clearly as moorshed was speaking my dear friend and brother officer i know panke you know panke we know pankegood little panke in less than three greenwich chronometer seconds panke will make an enormous ass of himself and i shall have to put things straight unless you who are a man of tact and discernment  carry on the commanders order supplied the unspoken word the cruiser boiled about her business around us watch and watch officers together up to the limit of noise permissible i saw captain malan turn to his senior  come to my cabin said panke gratingly and led the way pyecroft and i stayed still  its all right said pyecroft they darent leave us loose aboard for one revolution and i knew that he had seen what i had seen  you too said captain malan returning suddenly we passed the sentry between white enamelled walls of speckless small arms and since that royal marine light infantryman was visibly suffocating from curiosity i winked at him we entered the chintzadorned photospeckled brass fendered tilestoved main cabin moorshed with a ruler was demonstrating before the frameplan of hms cryptic  making nine stencils in all of my initials gm i heard him say further you will find attached to your rudder and you too sirhe bowed to captain malan yet againone fourteeninch mark iv practice torpedo as issued to firstclass torpedoboats properly buoyed i have sent full particulars by telegraph to the umpires and have requested them to judge on the facts as theyappear he nodded through the large window to the stencilled devolution awink with brass work in the morning sun and ceased  captain panke faced us i remembered that this was only play and caught myself wondering with what keener agony comes the real defeat  good god johnny he said dropping his lower lip like a child this young pup says he has put us both out of action inconceivableeh my first command of one of the class eh what shall we do with him what shall we do with himeh  as far as i can see theres no getting over the stencils his companion answered  why didnt i have the nets down why didnt i have the nets down the cry tore itself from captain pankes chest as he twisted his hands  i suppose wed better wait and find out what the umpires will say the admiral wont be exactly pleased captain malan spoke very soothingly moorshed looked out through the stern door at two six seven pyecroft and i at attention studied the paintwork opposite captain panke had dropped into his desk chair and scribbled nervously at a blottingpad  just before the tension became unendurable he looked at his junior for a lead whatwhat are you going to do about it johnnyeh  well if you dont want him im going to ask this young gentleman to breakfast and then well make and mend clothes till the umpires have decided  captain panke flung out a hand swiftly  come with me said captain malan your men had better go back in the dinghy totheirownship  yes i think so said moorshed and passed out behind the captain we followed at a respectful interval waiting till they had ascended the ladder  said the sentry rigid as the naked barometer behind him for gawds sake ere come ere for gawds sake whats appened oh come ere an tell  tell you said pyecroft neither mans lips moved and the words were whispers your ultimate illegitimate grandchildren might begin to understand not younor ever will  captain malans galley away sir cried a voice above and one replied then get those two greasers into their dinghy and hoist the blue peter were out of action  can you do it sir said pyecroft at the foot of the ladder do you think it is in the english language or do you not  i dont think i can but ill try if it takes me two years ill try                                there are witnesses who can testify that i have used no artifice i have on the contrary cut away priceless slabs of opus alexandrinum my gold i have lacquered down to dull bronze my purples overlaid with sepia of the sea and for hellhearted ruby and blinding diamond i have substituted pale amethyst and mere jargoon because i would say again disregarding the inventions of the marine captain whose other name is gubbins let a plain statement suffice     the comprehension of private copper  the kings task    after the sack of the city when rome was sunk to a name   in the years when the lights were darkened or ever saint wilfrid came   low on the borders of britain the ancient poets sing   between the cliff and the forest there ruled a saxon king    stubborn all were his people a stark and a jealous horde   not to be schooled by the cudgel scarce to be cowed by the sword   blithe to turn at their pleasure bitter to cross in their mood   and set on the ways of their choosing as the hogs of andreds wood     they made them laws in the witan the laws of flaying and fine   folkland common and pannage the theft and the track of kine   statutes of tun and of market for the fish and the malt and the meal   the tax on the bramber packhorse and the tax on the hastings keel   over the graves of the druids and over the wreck of rome   rudely but deeply they bedded the plinth of the days to come   behind the feet of the legions and before the northmans ire   rudely but greatly begat they the body of state and of shire   rudely but greatly they laboured and their labour stands till now   if we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eightox plough   the comprehension of private copper  private coppers father was a southdown shepherd in early youth copper had studied under him five years army service had somewhat blunted private coppers pastoral instincts but it occurred to him as a memory of the chalk that sheep or in this case buck do not move towards one across turf or in this case the colesberg kopjes unless a stranger or in this case an enemy is in the neighbourhood copper helmet backfirst advanced with caution leaving his mates of the picket full a mile behind the picket concerned for its evening meal did not protest a year ago it would have been an officers command moving as such today it paid casual allegiance to a canadian nominally a sergeant actually a trooper of irregular horse discovered convalescent in naauwport hospital and forthwith employed on odd jobs private copper crawled up the side of a bluish rockstrewn hill thinly fringed with brush atop and remembering how he had peered at sussex conies through the edge of furzeclumps cautiously parted the dry stems before his face at the foot of the long slope sat three farmers smoking to his natural lust for tobacco was added personal wrath because spiky plants were pricking his belly and private copper slid the backsight up to fifteen hundred yards  good evening khaki please dont move said a voice on his left and as he jerked his head round he saw entirely down the barrel of a wellkept leemetford protruding from an insignificant tuft of thorn very few graven images have moved less than did private copper through the next ten seconds  its nearer seventeen hundred than fifteen said a young man in an obviously readymade suit of grey tweed possessing himself of private coppers rifle thank you weve got a post of thirtyseven men out yonder youve eleveneh we dont want to kill em we have no quarrel with poor uneducated khakis and we do not want prisoners we do not keep it is demoralising to both sideseh  private cooper did not feel called upon to lay down the conduct of guerilla warfare this darkskinned darkhaired and darkeyed stranger was his first intimate enemy he spoke allowing for a clipped cadence that recalled to copper vague memories of umballa in precisely the same offensive accent that the young squire of wilmington had used fifteen years ago when he caught and kicked alf copper a rabbit in each pocket out of the ditches of cuckmere the enemy looked copper up and down folded and repocketed a copy of an english weekly which he had been reading and said you seem an inarticulate sort of swinelike the rest of themeh  you said copper thinking somehow of the crushing answers he had never given to the young squire are a renegid why you aint dutch youre english same as me  no khaki if you cannot talk civilly to a gentleman i will blow your head off  copper cringed and the action overbalanced him so that he rolled some six or eight feet downhill under the lee of a rough rock his brain was working with a swiftness and clarity strange in all his experience of alf copper while he rolled he spoke and the voice from his own jaws amazed him if you did twouldnt make you any less of a renegid as a useful afterthought he added ive sprained my ankle  the young man was at his side in a flash copper made no motion to rise but crosslegged under the rock grunted ow much did old krujer pay you for this what was you wanted for at ome where did you desert from  khaki said the young man sitting down in his turn you are a shade better than your mates you did not make much more noise than a yoke of oxen when you tried to come up this hill but you are an ignorant diseased beast like the rest of your peopleeh when you were at the ragged schools did they teach you any history tommyistory i mean  dont need no schoolin to know a renegid said copper he had made three yards down the hillout of sight unless they could see through rocks of the enemys smoking party  the young man laughed and tossed the soldier a black sweating stick of true affection private copper had not smoked a pipe for three weeks  you dont get thiseh said the young man we do we take it from the trains as we want it you can keep the cakeyou poah tommee copper rammed the good stuff into his longcold pipe and puffed luxuriously two years ago the sister of gunnerguard de souza east india railway had at a dance given by the sergeants to the allahabad railway volunteers informed copper that she could not think of waltzing with a pooah tommee private copper wondered why that memory should have returned at this hour  im going to waste a little trouble on you before i send you back to your picket quite nakedeh then you can say how you were overpowered by twenty of us and fired off your last roundlike the men we picked up at the drift playing cards at strydens farmeh whats your nameeh  private copper thought for a moment of a faraway housemaid who might still if the local postman had not gone too far be interested in his fate on the other hand he was by temperament economical of the truth pennycuik he said john pennycuik  thank you well mr john pennycuik im going to teach you a little istory as youd call iteh  ow said copper stuffing his left hand in his mouth so long since ive smoked ive burned my andan the pipes dropped too no objection to my movin down to fetch it is theresir  ive got you covered said the young man graciously and private copper hopping on one leg because of his sprain recovered the pipe yet another three yards downhill and squatted under another rock slightly larger than the first a roundish boulder made a pleasant rest for his captor who sat crosslegged once more facing copper his rifle across his knee his hand on the triggerguard  well mr pennycuik as i was going to tell you a little after you were born in your english workhouse your kind honourable brave country england sent an english gentleman who could not tell a lie to say that so long as the sun rose and the rivers ran in their courses the transvaal would belong to england did you ever hear that khakieh  oh no sir said copper this sentence about the sun and the rivers happened to be a very aged jest of mcbride the professional humorist of d company when they discussed the probable length of the war copper had thrown beeftins at mcbride in the grey dawn of many wet and dry camps for intoning it  of course you would not now mann i tell you listen he spat aside and cleared his throat because of that little promise my father he moved into the transvaal and bought a farma little place of twenty or thirty thousand acres dontyouknow  the tone in spite of the singsong cadence fighting with the laboured parody of the english drawl was unbearably like the young wilmington squires and copper found himself saying i ought to ive elped burn some  yes youll pay for that later and he opened a store  ho shopkeeper was he  the kind you call sir and sweep the floor for pennycuik you see in those days one used to believe in the british government my father did then the transvaal wiped thee earth with the english they beat them six times running you know thatteh  isnt what weve come ere for  but my father he knows better now kept on believing in the english i suppose it was the pretty talk about rivers and suns that cheated himeh anyhow he believed in his own country inn his own country soyou seehe was a little startled when he found himself handed over to the transvaal as a prisoner of war thats what it came to tommya prisoner of war you know what that iseh england was too honourable and too gentlemanly to take trouble there were no terms made for my father  so e made em imself useful old bird private copper sliced up another pipeful and looked out across the wrinkled sea of kopjes through which came the roar of the rushing orange river so unlike quiet cuckmere  the young mans face darkened i think i shall sjambok you myself when ive quite done with you no my father he was a fool made no terms for eight yearsninetysix monthsand for every day of them the transvaal made his life hell for my father andhis people  im glad to hear that said the impenitent copper  are you you can think of it when im taking the skin off your back eh my father he lost everythingeverything down to his selfrespect you dont know what thatt meanseh  why said copper im smokin baccy stole by a renegid why wouldnt i know  if it came to a flogging on that hillside there might be a chance of reprisals of course he might be marched to the boer camp in the next valley and there operated upon but army life teaches no man to cross bridges unnecessarily  yes after eight years my father cheated by your bitch of a country he found out who was the upper dog in south africa  thats me said copper valiantly if it takes another alf century its me an the likes of me  you heaven help you youll be screaming at a wagonwheel in an hour then it struck my father that hed like to shoot the people whod betrayed him youyouyou he told his son all about it he told him never to trust the english he told him to do them all the harm he could mann i tell you i dont want much telling i was born in the transvaalim a burgher if my father didnt love the english by the lord mann i tell you i hate them from the bottom of my soul  the voice quavered and ran high once more for no conceivable reason private copper found his inward eye turned upon umballa cantonments of a dry dusty afternoon when the saddlecoloured son of a local hotelkeeper came to the barracks to complain of a theft of fowls he saw the dark face the ploverseggtinted eyeballs and the thin excited hands above all he remembered the passionate queerlystrung words slowly he returned to south africa using the very sentence his sergeant had used to the poultry man  go on with your complaint im listenin  complaint complaint about you you ox we strip and kick your sort by thousands  the young man rocked to and fro above the rifle whose muzzle thus deflected itself from the pit of private coppers stomach his face was dusky with rage  yess im a transvaal burgher it took us about twenty years to find out how rotten you were we know and you know it now your armyit is the laughingstock of the continent he tapped the newspaper in his pocket you think youre going to win you poor fools your peopleyour own peopleyour silly rotten fools of people will crawl out of it as they did after majuba they are beginning now look what your own working classes the diseased lying drinking white stuff that you come out of are saying he thrust the english weekly doubled at the leading article on coppers knee see what dirty dogs your masters are they do not even back you in your dirty work we cleared the country down to ladysmith to estcourt we cleared the country down to colesberg  yes we ad to clean up beind you messy i call it  youve had to stop farmburning because your people darent do it they were afraid you darent kill a spy you darent shoot a spy when you catch him in your own uniform you darent touch our loyall people in cape town your masters wont let you you will feed our women and children till we are quite ready to take them back you cant put your cowardly noses out of the towns you say youve occupied you darent move a convoy twenty miles you think youve done something youve done nothing and youve taken a quarter of a million of men to do it there isnt a nigger in south africa that doesnt obey us if we lift our finger you pay the stuff four pounds a month and they lie to you we flog em as i shall flog you  he clasped his hands together and leaned forward his outthrust chin within two feet of coppers left or pipe hand  yuss said copper its a fair knockout the fist landed to a hair on the chinpoint the neck snicked like a gunlock and the back of the head crashed on the boulder behind  copper grabbed up both rifles unshipped the crossbandoliers drew forth the english weekly and picking up the lax hands looked long and intently at the fingernails  no not a sign of it there he said is nails are as clean as mine but he talks just like em though and hes a landlord too a landed proprietor shockin i call it  the arms began to flap with returning consciousness private copper rose up and whispered if you open your head ill bash it there was no suggestion of sprain in the flungback left boot now walk in front of me both arms perpendicularly elevated im only a thirdclass shot so if you dont object ill rest the muzzle of my rifle lightly but firmly on your collarbuttoncoverin the serviceable vertebree if your friends see us thus engaged you prayard  private and prisoner staggered downhill no shots broke the peace of the afternoon but once the young man checked and was sick  theres a lot of things i could say to you copper observed at the close of the paroxysm but it doesnt matter look ere you call me pore tommy again  the prisoner hesitated  oh i aint goin to do anythin to you im

farmer with dynamite in both boots tell us all about it burjer  you leave my prisoner alone said private copper es ad losses an trouble an its in the family too e thought i never read the papers so e kindly lent me his very own jerrolds weeklyan e explained it to me as patronisin as aas a militia subaltern doin railway staff officer es a leftover from majubaone of the worst kind an earin the evidence as i did i dont exactly blame im it was this way  to the picket private copper held forth for ten minutes on the life history of his captive allowing for some purple patches it was an absolute fair rendering  but what i disliked was this baccypriggin beggar oos people on is own showin couldnt ave been more than thirty or forty years in the counon this gawdforsaken dusteap comin the

moppet reservists flung themselves on mcbrides shoulders pinning him to the ground  lie over your own bloomin side of the bed an we can all look he protested  theyre only poah tommies said copper apologetically to the prisoner poah unedicated khakis they dont know what theyre fightin for theyre lookin for what the diseased lying drinkin white stuff that they come from is sayin about em  the prisoner set down his tin of coffee and stared helplessly round the circle  ii dont understand them  the canadian sergeant picking his teeth with a thorn nodded sympathetically  if it comes to that we dont in my country say boys when youre through with your english mail you mights well provide an escort for your prisoner hes waitin  arf a mo sergeant said mcbride still reading  eres old barbarity

barbarities all over you to keep up the reputation of the british army  from that english weekly to bar out which a large and perspiring staff of press censors toiled seven days of the week at cape town did pinewood of the reserve read unctuously excerpts of the speeches of the accredited leaders of his majestys opposition the nightpicket arrived in the middle of it but stayed entranced without paying any compliments till pinewood had entirely finished the leading article and several occasional notes  gentlemen of the jury said alf copper hitching up what war had left to him of trousersyouve eard what es been fed up with do you blame the beggar cause i dont  leave im alone mcbride hes my first and only capture an im goin to walk ome with im aint i ducky  fall in burjer its bermuda or

married aint e said pinewood ive seen em go like this before just at the last old on old man no ones goin to urt you  the last of the sun threw the enormous shadow of a kopje over the little anxious wriggling group  quit that said the serjeant of a sudden youre only making him worse hands up prisoner now you get a holt of yourself or thisll go off  and indeed the revolverbarrel square at the mans panting chest seemed to act like a tonic he choked recovered himself and fell in between copper and pinewood  as the picket neared the camp it broke into song that was heard among the officers tents    e sent us is blessin from london town     the beggar that kep the cordite down   but what do we care if e smile or frown     the beggar that kep the cordite down   the mildly nefarious   wildly barbarious     beggar that kept the cordite down  said a captain a mile away why are they singing that we havent had a mail for a month have we  an hour later the same captain said to his servant jenkins i understand the picket have got agot a newspaper off a prisoner today i wish you could lay hands on it jenkins copy of the times i think  yes sir copy of the times sir said jenkins without a

i want to ave a squint myself  something gurgled in the darkness and private copper fell back smacking his lips  gawd bless my prisoner and make me a good boy amen ere you are jenkins its dirt cheap at a tot     steam tactics   the necessitarian    i know not in whose hands are laid     to empty upon earth   from unsuspected ambuscade     the very urns of mirth    who bids the heavenly lark arise     and cheer our solemn round   the jest beheld with streaming eyes     and grovellings on the ground    who joins the flats of time and chance     behind the prey preferred   and thrones on shrieking circumstance     the sacredly absurd    till laughter voiceless through excess     waves mute appeal and sore   above the midriffs deep distress     for breath to laugh once more    no creed hath dared to hail him lord     no raptured choirs proclaim   and natures strenuous overword     hath nowhere breathed his name    yet may it be on wayside jape     the selfsame power bestows   the selfsame power as went to shape     his planet or his rose  steam tactics i caught sight of their faces as we came up behind the cart in the narrow sussex lane but though it was not eleven oclock they were both asleep  that the carrier was on the wrong side of the road made no difference to his language when i rang my bell he said aloud of motorcars and specially of steam ones all the things which i had read in the faces of superior coachmen then he pulled slantwise across me  there was a vociferous steam airpump attached to that car which could be applied at pleasure  the cart was removed about a bowshots length in seven and a quarter seconds to the accompaniment of parcels clattering at the foot of the next hill the horse stopped and the two men came out over the tailboard  my engineer backed and swung the car ready to move out of reach  the blighted eggboiler has steam up said mr hinchcliffe pausing to gather a large stone temporise with the beggar pye till the sights come on  i cant leave my orse roared the carrier but bring em up ere an ill kill em all over again  good morning mr pyecroft i called cheerfully can i give you a lift anywhere  the attack broke up round my forewheels  well we do ave the knack o meeting in puris naturalibus as ive so often said mr pyecroft wrung my hand yes im on leaf sos hinch were visiting friends among these kopjes  a monotonous bellowing up the road persisted where the carrier was still calling for corpses  thats agg hes hinchs cousin you arent fortunit in your family connections hinch es usin language in derogation of good manners go and abolish im  henry salt hinchcliffe stalked back to the cart and spoke to his cousin i recall much that the wind bore to me of his words and the carriers it seemed as if the friendship of years were dissolving amid throes  ave it your own silly way then roared the carrier an get into linghurst on your own silly feet ive done with you two runagates he lashed his horse and passed out of sight still rumbling  the fleets sailed said pyecroft leavin us on the beach as before had you any particular port in your mind  well i was going to meet a friend at instead wick but i dont mind  oh thatll do as well as anything were on leaf you see  shell hardly hold four said my engineer i had broken him of the foolish habit of being surprised at things but he was visibly uneasy  hinchcliffe returned drawn as by ropes to my steamcar round which he walked in narrowing circles  whats her speed he demanded of the engineer  twentyfive said that loyal man  easy to run  no very difficult was the emphatic answer  that just shows that you aint fit for your rating dyou suppose that a man who earns his livin by runnin 30knot destroyers for a parstimefor a parstime mark youis going to lie down before any blighted land crabbing steampinnace on springs  yet that was what he did directly under the car he lay and looked upward into pipespetrol steam and waterwith a keen and searching eye  i telegraphed mr pyecroft a question  notintheleast was the answer steam gadgets always take him that way we had a bit of a riot at parsley green through his tryin to show a tractionengine haulin gipsywagons how to turn corners  tell him everything he wants to know i said to the engineer as i dragged out a rug and spread it on the roadside  he dont want much showing said the engineer now the two men had not counting the time we took to stuff our pipes been together more than three minutes  this said pyecroft driving an elbow back into the deep verdure of the hedgefoot is a little bit of all right hinch i shouldnt let too much o that hot muckings drop in my eyes your leafs up in a fortnight an youll be wantin em  here said hinchcliffe still on his back to the engineer come here and show me the lead of this pipe and the engineer lay down beside him  thats all right said mr hinchcliffe rising but shes more of a bag of tricks than i thought unship this superstructure afthe pointed to the back seatand ill have a look at the forced draught  the engineer obeyed with alacrity i heard him volunteer the fact that he had a brother an artificer in the navy  they couple very well those two said pyecroft critically while hinchcliffe sniffed round the asbestoslagged boiler and turned on gay jets of steam  now take me up the road he said my man for forms sake looked at me  yes take him i said hes all right  no im not said hinchcliffe of a suddennot if im expected to judge my water out of a little shavingglass  the watergauge of that steamcar was reflected on a mirror to the right of the dashboard i also had found it inconvenient  throw up your arm and look at the gauge under your armpit only mind how you steer while youre doing it or youll get ditched i cried as the car ran down the road  i wonder said pyecroft musing but after all its your steamin gadgets hes usin for his libretto as you might put it he said to me after breakfast only this mornin ow he thanked his maker on all fours that he wouldnt see nor smell nor thumb a runnin bulgine till the nineteenth prox now look at him only look at im  we could see down the long slope of the road my driver surrendering his seat to hinchcliffe while the car flickered generously from hedge to hedge  what happens if he upsets  the petrol will light up and the boiler may blow up  how rambunkshus andpyecroft blew a slow cloudaggs about three hoops up this mornin too  whats that to do with us hes gone down the road i retorted  yees but well overtake him hes a vindictive carrier he and hinch ad words about pigbreeding this morning o course hinch dont know the elements o that evolution but he fell back on is naval rank an office an agg grew peevish i wasnt sorry to get out of the cart  have you ever considered how when you an i meet so to say theres nearly always a remarkable hectic day ahead of us hullo behold the beefboat returnin  he rose as the car climbed up the slope and shouted in bow way nuff  you be quiet cried hinchcliffe and drew up opposite the rug his dark face shining with joy shes the poetry o motion shes the angels dream shes he shut off steam and the slope being against her the car slid soberly downhill again  whats this ive got the brake on he yelled  it doesnt hold backwards i said put her on the midlink  thats a nasty one for the chief engineer o the djinn 31knot tbd said pyecroft do you know what the midlink is hinch  once more the car returned to us but as pyecroft stooped to gather up the rug hinchcliffe jerked the lever testily and with prawnlike speed she retired backwards into her own steam  apparently e dont said pyecroft whats he done now sir  reversed her ive done it myself  but hes an engineer  for the third time the car manoeuvred up the hill  ill teach you to come alongside properly if i keep you tiffies out all night shouted pyecroft it was evidently a quotation hinchcliffes face grew livid and his hand ever so slightly working on the throttle the car buzzed twenty yards uphill  thats enough well take your word for it the mountain will go to maommed stand fast  pyecroft and i and the rug marched up where she and hinchcliffe fumed together  not as easy as it lookseh hinch  it is dead easy im going to drive her to instead wickarent i said the firstclass engineroom artificer i thought of his performances with no 267 and nodded after all it was a small privilege to accord to pure genius  but my engineer will stand byat first i added  an you a family man too muttered pyecroft swinging himself into the right rear seat sure to be a remarkably hectic day when we meet  we adjusted ourselves and in the language of the immortal navy doctor paved our way towards linghurst distant by milepost 1134 miles  mr hinchcliffe every nerve and muscle braced talked only to the engineer and that professionally i recalled the time when i too had enjoyed the rack on which he voluntarily extended himself  and the county of sussex slid by in slow time  how cautious is the tiffybird said pyecroft  even in a destroyer hinch snapped over his shoulder you aint expected to con and drive simultaneous dont address any remarks to me  pump said the engineer your waters droppin  i know that where the heavens is that blighted bypass  he beat his right or throttle hand madly on the side of the car till he found the bent rod that more or less controls the pump and neglecting all else twisted it furiously  my engineer grabbed the steeringbar just in time to save us lurching into a ditch  if i was a burnin peacock with two hundred bloodshot eyes in my shinin tail id need em all on this job said hinch  dont talk steer this aint the north atlantic pyecroft replied  blast my stokers why the steams dropped fifty pounds hinchcliffe cried  fires blown out said the engineer stop her  does she do that often said hinch descending  sometimes  anytime  any time a crosswind catches her  the engineer produced a match and stooped  that car now thank heaven no more than an evil memory never lit twice in the same fashion this time she backfired superbly and pyecroft went out over the right rear wheel in a column of rich yellow flame  ive seen a mine explode at bantryonceprematoor he volunteered  thats all right said hinchcliffe brushing down his singed beard with a singed forefinger he had been watching too closely has she any more little surprises up her dainty sleeve  she hasnt begun yet said my engineer with a scornful cough some one as opened the petrolsupplyvalve too wide  change places with me pyecroft i commanded for i remembered that the petrolsupply the steamlock and the forced draught were all controlled from the right rear seat  me why theres a whole switchboard full o nickelplated muckins which i havent begun to play with yet the starboard sides crawlin with em  change or ill kill you said hinchcliffe and he looked like it  thats the tiffy all over when anything goes wrong blame it on the lower deck navigate by your automatic self then i wont help you any more  we navigated for a mile in dead silence  talkin o wakes said pyecroft suddenly  we werent hinchcliffe grunted  theres some wakes would break a snakes back but this of yours so to speak would fair turn a tapeworm giddy thats all i wish to observe hinch  cart at anchor on the portbow its agg  far up the shaded road into secluded bromlingleigh we saw the carriers cart at rest before the postoffice  hes bung in the fairway howm i to get past said hinchcliffe theres no room here pye come and relieve the wheel  nay nay pauline youve made your own bed youve as good as left your happy home an family cart to steal it now you lie on it  ring your bell i suggested  glory said pyecroft falling forward into the nape of hinchcliffes neck as the car stopped dead  get out o my backhair that must have been the brake i touched off hinchcliffe muttered and repaired his error tumultuously  we passed the cart as though we had been all bruges belfry agg from the portoffice door regarded us with a too pacific eye i remembered later that the pretty postmistress looked on us pityingly  hinchcliffe wiped the sweat from his brow and drew breath it was the first vehicle that he had passed and i sympathised with him  you neednt grip so hard said my engineer she steers as easy as a bicycle  ho you suppose i ride bicycles up an down my engineroom was the answer ive other things to think about shes a terror shes a whistlin lunatic id sooner run the old southeaster at simons town than her  one of the nice things they say about her i interrupted is that no engineer is needed to run this machine  no theyd need about seven  commonsense only is needed i quoted  make a note of that hinch just commonsense pyecroft put in  and now i said well have to take in water there isnt more than a couple of inches of water in the tank  where dyou get it from  ohcottages and suchlike  yes but that being so where does your muchadvertised twentyfive miles an hour come in aint a dungcart more to the point  if you want to go anywhere i suppose it would be i replied  i dont want to go anywhere im thinkin of you whove got to live with her shell burn her tubes if she loses her water  she will  ive never scorched yet and i not beginnin now he shut off steam firmly out you get pye an shove her along by hand  where to  the nearest watertank was the reply and sussex is a dry county  she ought to have dragropeslittle pipeclayed ones said pyecroft  we got out and pushed under the hot sun for halfamile till we came to a cottage sparsely inhabited by one child who wept  all out haymakin o course said pyecroft thrusting his head into the parlour for an instant whats the evolution now  skirmish till we find a well i said  hmm but they wouldnt ave left that kid without a chaperon so to say i thought so wheres a stick  a bluish and silent beast of the true old sheepdog breed glided from behind an outhouse and without words fell to work  pyecroft kept him at bay with a rakehandle while our party in rallying square retired along the boxbordered brickpath to the car  at the garden gate the dumb devil halted looked back on the child and sat down to scratch  thats his threemile limit thank heaven said pyecroft fall in pushparty and proceed with landtransport o pinnace ill protect your flanks in case this sniffin fleabag is tempted beyond is strength  we pushed off in silence the car weighed 1200 lb and even on ballbearings was a powerful sudorific from somewhere behind a hedge we heard a gross rustic laugh  those are the beggars we lie awake for patrollin the high seas there aint a port in china where we wouldnt be better treated yes a boxer ud be ashamed of it said pyecroft  a cloud of fine dust boomed down the road  some happy craft with a wellfound engineroom how different panted hinchcliffe bent over the starboard mudguard  it was a claretcoloured petrol car and it stopped courteously as good cars will at sight of trouble  water only water i answered in reply to offers of help  theres a lodge at the end of these oak palings theyll give you all you want say i sent you gregorymichael gregory goodbye  ought to ave been in the service probly is was pyecrofts comment  at that thriceblessed lodge our watertank was filled i dare not quote mr hinchcliffes remarks when he saw the collapsible rubber bucket with which we did it and we reembarked it seemed that sir michael gregory owned many acres and that his park ran for miles  no objection to your going through it said the lodgekeeper itll save you a goodish bit to instead wick  but we needed petrol which could be purchased at pigginfold a few miles farther up and so we held to the main road as our fate had decreed  weve come seven miles in fiftyfour minutes so far said hinchcliffe he was driving with greater freedom and less responsibility and now we have to fill our bunkers this is worse than the channel fleet  at pigginfold after ten minutes we refilled our petrol tank and lavishly oiled our engines mr hinchcliffe wished to discharge our engineer on the grounds that he mr hinchcliffe was now entirely abreast of his work to this i demurred for i knew my car she had in the language of the road held up for a day and a half and by most bitter experience i suspected that her time was very near therefore three miles short of linghurst i was less surprised than any one excepting always my engineer when the engines set up a lunatic clucking and after two or three kicks jammed  heaven forgive me all the harsh things i may have said about destroyers in my sinful time wailed hinchcliffe snapping back the throttle whats worryin ada now  the forward eccentricstrap screws dropped off said the engineer investigating  that all i thought it was a propellerblade  we must go an look for it there isnt another  not me said pyecroft from his seat out pinnace hinch an creep for it it wont be more than five miles back  the two men with bowed heads moved up the road  look like etymologists dont they does she decant her innards often so to speak pyecroft asked  i told him the true tale of a racefull of ball bearings strewn four miles along a hampshire road and by me recovered in detail he was profoundly touched  poor hinch poorpoor hinch he said and thats only one of her little games is it hell be homesick for the navy by night  when the searchparty doubled back with the missing screw it was hinchcliffe who replaced it in less than five minutes while my engineer looked on admiringly  your boilers only seated on four little paperclips he said crawling from beneath her shes a wickerwillow lunchbasket below shes a runnin miracle have you had this combustible spiritlamp long  i told him  and yet you were afraid to come into the nightmares engineroom when we were runnin trials  its all a matter of taste pyecroft volunteered but i will say for you hinch youve certainly got the hang of her steamin gadgets in quick time  he was driving her very sweetly but with a worried look in his eye and a tremor in his arm  she dont seem so answer her helm somehow he said  theres a lot of play to the steeringgear said my engineer we generally tighten it up every few miles  like me to stop now weve run as much as one mile and a half without incident he replied tartly  then youre lucky said my engineer bristling in turn  theyll wreck the whole turret out o nasty professional spite in a minute said pyecroft thats the worst o machinery man dead ahead hinchsemaphorin like the flagship in a fit  amen said hinchcliffe shall i stop or shall i cut him down  he stopped for full in the centre of the linghurst road stood a person in pepperandsalt raiment readymade with a brown telegraph envelope in his hands  twentythree and a half miles an hour he began weighing a small beam engine of a waterbury in one red paw from the top of the hill over our measured quartermiletwentythree and a half  you manurial gardener hinchcliffe began i prodded him warningly from behind and laid the other hand on pyecrofts stiffening knee  alsoon information receiveddrunk and disorderly in charge of a motorcarto the common dangertwo men like sailors in appearance the man went on  like sailors  thats aggs little roose no wonder he smiled at us said pyecroft  ive been waiting for you some time the man concluded folding up the telegram  whos the owner  i indicated myself  then i want you as well as the two seafaring men drunk and disorderly can be treated summary you come on  my relations with the sussex constabulary have so far been of the best but i could not love this person  of course you have your authority to show i hinted  ill show it you at linghurst he retorted hotlyall the authority you want  i only want the badge or warrant or whatever it is a plainclothes man has to show  he made as though to produce it but checked himself repeating less politely the invitation to linghurst the action and the tone confirmed my manytimes tested theory that the bulk of english shoregoing institutions are based on conformable strata of absolutely impervious inaccuracy i reflected and became aware of a drumming on the back of the front seat that pyecroft bowed forward and relaxed was tapping with his knuckles the hardlychecked fury on hinchcliffes brow had given place to a greasy imbecility and he nodded over the steeringbar in longs and shorts as laid down by the pious and immortal mr morse pyecroft tapped out sham drunk get him in the car  i cant stay here all day said the constable  pyecroft raised his head then was seen with what majesty the british sailorman envisages a new situation  met gennelman heavy sheeway said he do tell me british gelman cant give ole brish navy lif own blighted ste cart have another drink  i didnt know they were as drunk as all that when they stopped me i explained  you can say all that at linghurst was the answer come on  quite right i said but the question is if you take these two out on the road theyll fall down or start killing you  then id call on you to assist me in the execution o my duty  but id see you further first youd better come with us in the car ill turn this passenger out this was my engineer sitting quite silent you dont want him and anyhow hed only be a witness for the defence  thats true said the constable but it wouldnt make any oddsat linghurst  my engineer skipped into the bracken like a rabbit i bade him cut across sir michael gregorys park and if he caught my friend to tell him i should probably be rather late for lunch  i aint going to be driven by him our destined prey pointed at hinchcliffe with apprehension  of course not you sake my seat and keep the big sailor in order hes too drunk to do much ill change places with the other one only be quick i want to pay my fine and get it over  thats the way to look at it he said dropping into the left rear seat were making quite a lot out o you motor gentry he folded his arms judicially as the car gathered way under hinchcliffes stealthy hand  but you arent driving he cried half rising  youve noticed it said pyecroft and embraced him with one anaconda like left arm  dont kill him said hinchcliffe briefly i want to show him what twentythree and a quarter is we were going a fair twelve which was about the cars limit  our passenger swore something and then groaned  hush darling said pyecroft or ill have to hug you  the main road white under the noon sun lay broad before us running north to linghurst we slowed and looked anxiously for a side track  and now said i i want to see your authority  the badge of your ratin pyecroft added  im a constable he said and kicked indeed his boots would have bewrayed him across half a countys plough but boots are not legal evidence  i want your authority i repeated coldly some evidence that you are not a common drunken tramp  it was as i had expected he had forgotten or mislaid his badge he had neglected to learn the outlines of the work for which he received money and consideration and he expected me the taxpayer to go to infinite trouble to supplement his deficiencies  if you dont believe me come to linghurst was the burden of his almost national anthem  but i cant run all over sussex every time a blackmailer jumps up and says he is a policeman  why its quite close he persisted  twont besoon said hinchcliffe  none of the other people ever made any trouble to be sure they was gentlemen he cried all i can say is it may be very funny but it aint fair  i laboured with him in this dense fog but to no end he had forgotten his badge and we were villains for that we did not cart him to the pub or barracks where he had left it  pyecroft listened critically as we spun along the hard road  if he was a concentrated boer he couldnt expect much more he observed now suppose id been a lady in a delicate state o health youd ha made me very ill with your doings  i wish i ad ere elp elp hi  the man had seen a constable in uniform fifty yards ahead where a lane ran into the road and would have said more but that hinchcliffe jerked her up that lane with a wrench that nearly capsized us as the constable came running heavily  it seemed to me that both our guest and his fellowvillain in uniform smiled as we fled down the road easterly betwixt the narrowing hedges  youll know all about it in a little time said our guest youve only yourselves to thank for runnin your ead into a trap and he whistled ostentatiously  we made no answer  if that man ad chose e could have identified me he said  still we were silent  but ell do it later when youre caught  not if you go on talking e wont be able to said pyecroft i dont know what traverse you think youre workin but your duty till youre put in cells for a highway robber is to love honour an cherish me most specialperformin all evolutions signalled in rapid time i tell you this in case o anything turnin up  dont you fret about things turnin up was the reply  hinchcliffe had given the car a generous throttle and she was well set to work when without warning the roadthere are two or three in sussex like itturned down and ceased  holy muckins he cried and stood on both brakes as our helpless tyres slithered over wet grass and brackendown and down into forestearly british woodland it was the change of a nightmare and that all should fit fifty yards ahead of us a babbling brook barred our way on the far side a velvet green ride sprinkled with rabbits and fern gently sloped upwards and away but behind us was no hope forty horsepower would never have rolled wet pneumatic tyres up that verdurous cliff we had descended  hm our guest coughed significantly a great many cars thinks they can take this road but they all come back we walks after em at our convenience  meanin that the other jaunty is now pursuin us on his lily feet said pyecroft  precisely  an you think said pyecroft i have no hope to render the scorn of the words thatll make any odds get out  the man obeyed with alacrity  see those spars upended over there i mean that wickyupthing hoppoles then you rural blighter keep on fetching me hoppoles at the double  and he doubled pyecroft at his heels for they had arrived at a perfect understanding  there was a stack of hurdles a few yards down  stream laid aside after sheepwashing and there were steppingstones in the brook hinchcliffe rearranged these last to make some sort of causeway i brought up the hurdles and when pyecroft and his subaltern had dropped a dozen hoppoles across the stream laid them down over all  talk o the agriculturl hall he said mopping his browtisnt in it with us the approach to the bridge must now be paved with hurdles owin to the squashy nature o the country yes an wed better have one or two on the far side to lead her on to terror fermior now hinch give her full steam and op along if she slips off were done shall i take the wheel  no this is my job said the firstclass engineroom artificer get over the far side and be ready to catch her if she jibs on the uphill  we crossed that elastic structure and stood ready amid the bracken hinchcliffe gave her a full steam and she came like a destroyer on her trial there was a crack a flicker of white water and she was in our arms fifty yards up the slope or rather we were behind her pushing her madly towards a patch of raw gravel whereon her wheels could bite of the bridge remained only a few wildly vibrating hoppoles and those hurdles which had been sunk in the mud of the approaches  sheshe kicked out all the loose ones behind her as she finished with em hinchcliffe panted  at the agricultural hall they would ave been fastened down with ribbons said pyecroft but this aint olympia  she nearly wrenched the tiller out of my hand dont you think i conned her like a cockangel pye  i never saw anything like it said our guest propitiatingly and now gentlemen if youll let me go back to linghurst i promise you you wont hear another word from me  get in said pyecroft as we puffed out on to a metalled road once more we avent begun on you yet  a jokes a joke he replied i dont mind a little bit of a joke myself but this is going beyond it  miles an miles beyond it if this machine stands up well want water pretty soon  our guests countenance brightened and pyecroft perceived it  let me tell you he said earnestly i wont make any difference to you whatever happens barrin a dhow or two tajurrahway prizes are scarce in the navy hence we never abandon em  there was a long silence pyecroft broke it suddenly  robert he said have you a mother  yes  have you a big brother  yes  an a little sister  yes  robert does your mamma keep a dog  yes why  all right robert i wont forget it  i looked for an explanation  i saw his cabinet photograph in full uniform on the mantelpiece o that cottage before faithful fido turned up pyecroft whispered aint you glad its all in the family somehow  we filled with water at a cottage on the edge of st leonards forest and despite our increasing leakage made shift to climb the ridge above instead wick knowing the car as i did i felt sure that final collapse would not be long delayed my sole concern was to run our guest well into the wilderness before that came  on the roof of the worlda naked plateau clothed with young heathershe retired from active life in floods of tears her feedwaterheater hinchcliffe blessed it and its maker for three minutes was leaking beyond hope of repair she had shifted most of her packing and her water pump would not lift  if i had a bit of piping i could disconnect this tin cartridgecase an feed direct into the boiler it ud knock down her speed but we could get on said he and looked hopelessly at the long dun ridges that hove us above the panorama of sussex northward we could see the london haze southward between gaps of the whalebacked downs lay the channels zinc blue but all our available population in that vast survey was one cow and a kestrel  its down hill to instead wick we can run her there by gravity i said at last  then hell only have to walk to the station to get home unless we take off is boots first pyecroft replied  that said our guest earnestly would be theft atop of assault and very serious  oh lets hang him an be done hinchcliffe grunted its evidently what hes sufferin for  somehow murder did not appeal to us that warm noon we sat down to smoke in the heather and presently out of the valley below came the thick beat of a petrolmotor ascending i paid little attention to it till i heard the roar of a horn that has no duplicate in all the home counties  thats the man i was going to lunch with i cried hold on and i ran down the road  it was a big black blackdashed tonneaued twentyfour horse octopod and it bore not only kysh my friend and salmon his engineer but my own man who for the first time in our acquaintance smiled  did they get you what did you get i was coming into linghurst as witness to characteryour man told me what happenedbut i was stopped near instead wick myself cried kysh  what for  leaving car unattended an infernal swindle when you think of the loose carts outside every pub in the county i was jawing with the police for an hour but its no use theyve got it all their own way and were helpless  hereupon i told him my tale and for proof as we topped the hill pointed out the little group round my car  all supreme emotion is dumb kysh put on the brake and hugged me to his bosom till i groaned then as i remember he crooned like a mother returned to her suckling  divine divine he murmured command me  take charge of the situation i said youll find a mr pyecroft on the quarterdeck im altogether out of it  he shall stay there who am i but the instrument of vengeance in the hands of an overruling providence and i put in fresh sparkingplugs this morning salmon take that steamkettle home somehow i would be alone  leggat i said to my man help salmon home with my car  home now its hard its cruel hard said leggat almost with a sob  hinchcliffe outlined my cars condition briefly to the two engineers mr pyecroft clung to our guest who stared with affrighted eyes at the palpitating octopod and the free wind of high sussex whimpered across the ling  i am quite agreeable to walkin ome all the way on my feet said our guest i wouldnt go to any railway station it ud be just the proper finish to our little joke he laughed nervously  whats the evolution said pyecroft do we turn over to the new cruiser  i nodded and he escorted our guest to the tonneau with care when i was in he sat himself broadarmed on the little flapseat which controls the door hinchcliffe sat by kysh  you drive kysh asked with the smile that has won him his chequered way through the world  steam only and ive about had my whack for today thanks  i see  the long low car slid forward and then dropped like a bullet down the descent our steam toy had so painfully climbed our guests face blanched and he clutched the back of the tonneau  new commanders evidently been trained on a destroyer said hinchcliffe  whats is wonderful name whispered pyecroft ho well im glad it aint saul weve run up againstnor nimshi for that matter this is makin me feel religious  our impetus carried us halfway up the next slope where we steadied to a resonant fifteen an hour against the collar  what do you think i called to hinchcliffe  taint as sweet as steam o course but for power its twice the furious against half the jaseur in a headsea  volumes could not have touched it more exactly his bright eyes were glued on kyshs hands juggling with levers behind the discreet backward sloping dash  an what sort of a brake might you use he said politely  this kysh replied as the last of the hill shot up to one in eight he let the car run back a few feet and caught her deftly on the brake repeating the performance cup and ball fashion it was like being daped above the pit at the end of an uncoiled solar plexus even pyecroft held his breath  it aint fair it aint fair our guest moaned youre makin me sick  what an ungrateful blighter he is said pyecroft money couldnt buy you a run like this  do it well overboard  well just trundle up the forest and drop into the park row i think said kysh theres a bit of good going hereabouts  he flung a careless knee over the low raking tiller that the ordinary expert puts under his armpit and down four miles of yellow road cut through barren waste the octopod sang like a sixinch shell  whew but you know your job said hinchcliffe youre wasted here id give something to have you in my engineroom  hes steering with is little hindlegs said pyecroft stand up and look at him robert youll never see such a sight again  nor dont want to was our guests reply five undred pounds wouldnt begin to cover is fines even since ive been with him  park row is reached by one hill which drops three hundred feet in half a mile kysh had the thought to steer with his hand down the abyss but the manner in which he took the curved bridge at the bottom brought my few remaining hairs much nearer the grave  were in surrey now better look out i said  never mind ill roll her into kent for a bit weve lots of time its only three oclock  wont you want to fill your bunkers or take water or oil her up said hinchcliffe  we dont use water and shes good for two hundred on one tank o petrol if she doesnt break down  two hundred miles from ome and mother and faithful fido tonight robert said pyecroft slapping our guest on the knee cheer up why ive known a destroyer do less  we passed with some decency through some towns till by way of the hastings road we whirled into cramberhurst which is a deep pit  now said kysh we begin  previous service not reckoned towards pension said pyecroft we are doin you lavish robert  but whens this silly game to finish anyow our guest snarled  dont worry about the when of it robert the wheres the interestin point for you just now  i had seen kysh drive before and i thought i knew the octopod but that afternoon he and she were exalted beyond my knowledge he improvised on the keysthe snapping levers and quivering acceleratorsmarvellous variations so that our progress was sometimes a fugue and sometimes a barndance varied on open greens by the weaving of fairy rings when i protested all that he would say was ill hypnotise the fowl ill dazzle the rooster or other words equally futile and sheoh that i could do her justiceshe turned her broad black bows to the westering light and lifted us high upon hills that we might see and rejoice with her she whooped into veiled hollows of elm and sussex oak she devoured infinite perspectives of park palings she surged through forgotten hamlets whose single streets gave back reduplicated the clatter of her exhaust and tireless she repeated the motions over naked uplands she droned like a homing bee her shadow lengthening in the sun that she chased to his lair she nosed up unparochial byways and accommodation roads of the least accommodation and put old scarred turf or newraised molehills under her most marvellous springs with never a jar and since the kings highway is used for every purpose save traffic in midcareer she stepped aside for or flung amazing loops about the brainless driver the driverless horse the drunken carrier the engaged couple the female student of the bicycle and her staggering instructor the pig the perambulator and the infant school where it disembogued yelping on crossroads with the grace of nellie farren upon whom be the peace and the lithe abandon of all the vokes family but at heart she was ever judic as i remember that judic long agojudic clad in bourgeois black from wrist to ankle achieving incredible improprieties  we were silenthinchcliffe and pyecroft through professional appreciation i with a laymans delight in the expert and our guest because of fear  at the edge of the evening she smelt the sea to southward and sheered thither like the strongwinged albatross to circle enormously amid green flats fringed by martello towers  aint that eastbourne yonder said our guest reviving ive a aunt thereshes cook to a jpcould identify me  dont worry her for a little thing like that said pyecroft and ere he had ceased to praise family love our unpaid judiciary and domestic service the downs rose between us and the sea and the long man of hillingdon lay out upon the turf  trevingtonup yonderis a fairly isolated little dorp i said for i was beginning to feel hungry  no said kysh hed get a lift to the railway in no time besides im enjoying myself three pounds eighteen and sixpence infernal swindle  i take it one of his more recent fines was rankling in kyshs brain but he drove like the archangel of the twilight  about the longitude of cassocks hinchcliffe yawned arent we goin to maroon our robert im hungry too  the commodore wants his money back i answered  if he drives like this habitual there must be a tidyish little lump owin to him said pyecroft well im agreeable  i didnt know it could be done swelp me i didnt our guest murmured  but you will said kysh and that was the first and last time he addressed the man  we ran through penfield green half stupefied with open air drugged with the relentless boom of the octopod and extinct with famine  i used to shoot about here said kysh a few miles further on open that gate please and he slowed as the sun touched the skyline at this point we left metalled roads and bucked vigorously amid ditches and under trees for twenty minutes  only crosscountry car on the market he said as we wheeled into a strawyard where a lone bull bellowed defiance to our growlings open that gate please i hope the cattlebridge will stand up  ive took a few risks in my time said pyecroft as timbers cracked beneath us and we entered between thickets but im a babe to this man hinch  dont talk to me watch him its a liberal education as shakespeare says fallen tree on the port bow sir  right thats my mark sit tight  she flung up her tail like a sounding whale and buried us in a fifteen foot deep bridlepath buttressed with the exposed roots of enormous beeches the wheels leaped from root to rounded boulder and it was very dark in the shadow of the foliage  there ought to be a hammerpond somewhere about here kysh was letting her down this chute in brakeful spasms  water dead ahead sir stack o brushwood on the starboard beam andno road sang pyecroft  crrrikey said hinchcliffe as the car on a wild cant to the left went astern screwing herself round the angle of a track that overhung the pond if she only had two propellers i believe shed talk poetry she can do everything else  were rather on our port wheels now said kysh but i dont think shell capsize this road isnt used much by motors  you dont say so said pyecroft what a pity  she bored through a mass of crackling brushwood and emerged into an upward sloping fernglade fenced with woods so virgin so untouched that william rufus might have ridden off as we entered we climbed out of the violetpurple shadows towards the upland where the last of the day lingered i was filled to my moist eyes with the almost sacred beauty of sense and association that clad the landscape  does unger produce alluciations said pyecroft in a whisper because ive just seen a sacred ibis walkin arm in arm with a british cock pheasant  what are you panickin at said hinchcliffe ive been seein zebra for the last two minutes but i avent complained  he pointed behind us and i beheld a superb painted zebra burchells i think following our track with palpitating nostrils the car stopped and it fled away  there was a little pond in front of us from which rose a dome of irregular sticks crowned with a bluntmuzzled beast that sat upon its haunches  is it catching said pyecroft  yes im seeing beaver i replied  it is here said kysh with the air and gesture of captain nemo and half turned  nonono for eavens sakenot ere our guest gasped like a sea bathed child as four efficient hands swung him far outboard on to the turf the car ran back noiselessly down the slope  look look its sorcery cried hinchcliffe  there was a report like a pistol shot as the beaver dived from the roof of his lodge but we watched our guest he was on his knees praying to kangaroos yea in his bowler hat he kneeled before kangaroosgigantic erect silhouetted against the lightfour buckkangaroos in the heart of sussex  and we retrogressed over the velvet grass till our hindwheels struck wellrolled gravel leading us to sanity main roads and half an hour later the grapnel inn at horsham                                    after a great meal we poured libations and made burntofferings in honour of kysh who received our homage graciously and by the way explained a few things in the natural history line that had puzzled us england is a most marvellous country but one is not till one knows the eccentricities of large landowners trained to accept kangaroos zebras or beavers as part of its landscape  when we went to bed pyecroft pressed my hand his voice thick with emotion  we owe it to you he said we owe it all to you didnt i say we never met in puppuppuris naturalibus if i may so put it without a remarkably hectic day ahead of us  thats all right i said mind the candle he was tracing smoke patterns on the wall  but what i want to know is whether well succeed in acclimatisin the blighter or whether sir william gardners keepers ll kill im before e gets accustomed to is surroundins  some day i think we must go up the linghurst road and find out     wireless   kaspars song in varda  from the swedish of stagnelius    eyes aloft over dangerous places     the children follow where psyche flies   and in the sweat of their upturned faces     slash with a net at the empty skies    so it goes they fall amid brambles     and sting their toes on the nettletops   till after a thousand scratches and scrambles     they wipe their brows and the hunting stops    then to quiet them comes their father     and stills the riot of pain and grief   saying little ones go and gather     out of my garden a cabbage leaf    you will find on it whorls and clots of     dull grey eggs that properly fed   turn by way of the worm to lots of     radiant psyches raised from the dead                                         heaven is beautiful earth is ugly     the threedimensioned preacher saith   so we must not look where the snail and the slug lie     for psyches birth  and that is our death   wireless its a funny thing this marconi business isnt it said mr shaynor coughing heavily nothing seems to make any difference by what they tell mestorms hills or anything but if thats true we shall know before morning  of course its true i answered stepping behind the counter wheres old mr cashell  hes had to go to bed on account of his influenza he said youd very likely drop in  wheres his nephew  inside getting the things ready he told me that the last time they experimented they put the pole on the roof of one of the big hotels here and the batteries electrified all the watersupply andhe giggledthe ladies got shocks when they took their baths  i never heard of that  the hotel wouldnt exactly advertise it would it just now by what mr cashell tells me theyre trying to signal from here to poole and theyre using stronger batteries than ever but you see he being the guvnors nephew and all that and it will be in the papers too it doesnt matter how they electrify things in this house are you going to watch  very much ive never seen this game arent you going to bed  we dont close till ten on saturdays theres a good deal of influenza in town too and therell be a dozen prescriptions coming in before morning i generally sleep in the chair here its warmer than jumping out of bed every time bitter cold isnt it  freezing hard im sorry your coughs worse  thank you i dont mind cold so much its this wind that fair cuts me to pieces he coughed again hard and hackingly as an old lady came in for ammoniated quinine weve just run out of it in bottles madam said mr shaynor returning to the professional tone but if you will wait two minutes ill make it up for you madam  i had used the shop for some time and my acquaintance with the proprietor had ripened into friendship it was mr cashell who revealed to me the purpose and power of apothecaries hall what time a fellowchemist had made an error in a prescription of mine had lied to cover his sloth and when error and lie were brought home to him had written vain letters  a disgrace to our profession said the thin mildeyed man hotly after studying the evidence you couldnt do a better service to the profession than report him to apothecaries hall  i did so not knowing what djinns i should evoke and the result was such an apology as one might make who had spent a night on the rack i conceived great respect for apothecaries hall and esteem for mr cashell a zealous craftsman who magnified his calling until mr shaynor came down from the north his assistants had by no means agreed with mr cashell they forget said he that first and foremost the compounder is a medicineman on him depends the physicians reputation he holds it literally in the hollow of his hand sir  mr shaynors manners had not perhaps the polish of the grocery and italian warehouse next door but he knew and loved his dispensary work in every detail for relaxation he seemed to go no farther afield than the romance of drugstheir discovery preparation packing and exportbut it led him to the ends of the earth and on this subject and the pharmaceutical formulary and nicholas culpepper most confident of physicians we met  little by little i grew to know something of his beginnings and his hopes of his mother who had been a schoolteacher in one of the northern counties and of his redheaded father a small jobmaster at kirby moors who died when he was a child of the examinations he had passed and of their exceeding and increasing difficulty of his dreams of a shop in london of his hate for the pricecutting cooperative stores and most interesting of his mental attitude towards customers  theres a way you get into he told me of serving them carefully and i hope politely without stopping your own thinking ive been reading christies new commercial plants all this autumn and that needs keeping your mind on it i can tell you so long as it isnt a prescription of course i can carry as much as half a page of christie in my head and at the same time i could sell out all that window twice over and not a penny wrong at the end as to prescriptions i think i could make up the general run of em in my sleep almost  for reasons of my own i was deeply interested in marconi experiments at their outset in england and it was of a piece with mr cashells unvarying thoughtfulness that when his nephew the electrician appropriated the house for a longrange installation he should as i have said invite me to see the result  the old lady went away with her medicine and mr shaynor and i stamped on the tiled floor behind the counter to keep ourselves warm the shop by the light of the many electrics looked like a parisdiamond mine for mr cashell believed in all the ritual of his craft three superb glass jars red green and blueof the sort that led rosamund to parting with her shoesblazed in the broad plateglass windows and there was a confused smell of orris kodak films vulcanite toothpowder sachets and almond cream in the air mr shaynor fed the dispensary stove and we sucked cayennepepper jujubes and menthol lozenges the brutal east wind had cleared the streets and the few passersby were muffled to their puckered eyes in the italian warehouse next door some gay feathered birds and game hung upon hooks sagged to the wind across the left edge of our windowframe  they ought to take these poultry inall knocked about like that said mr shaynor doesnt it make you feel fair perishing see that old hare the winds nearly blowing the fur off him  i saw the bellyfur of the dead beast blown apart in ridges and streaks as the wind caught it showing bluish skin underneath bitter cold said mr shaynor shuddering fancy going out on a night like this oh heres young mr cashell  the door of the inner office behind the dispensary opened and an energetic spadebearded man stepped forth rubbing his hands  i want a bit of tinfoil shaynor he said goodevening my uncle told me you might be coming this to me as i began the first of a hundred questions  ive everything in order he replied were only waiting until poole calls us up excuse me a minute you can come in whenever you likebut id better be with the instruments give me that tinfoil thanks  while we were talking a girlevidently no customerhad come into the shop and the face and bearing of mr shaynor changed she leaned confidently across the counter  but i cant i heard him whisper uneasilythe flush on his cheek was dull red and his eyes shone like a drugged moths i cant i tell you im alone in the place  no you arent whos that let him look after it for half an hour a brisk walk will do you good ah come now john  but he isnt  i dont care i want you to well only go round by st agnes if you dont  he crossed to where i stood in the shadow of the dispensary counter and began some sort of broken apology about a ladyfriend  yes she interrupted you take the shop for half an hourto oblige me wont you  she had a singularly rich and promising voice that well matched her outline  all right i said ill do itbut youd better wrap yourself up mr shaynor  oh a brisk walk ought to help me were only going round by the church i heard him cough grievously as they went out together  i refilled the stove and after reckless expenditure of mr cashells coal drove some warmth into the shop i explored many of the glass knobbed drawers that lined the walls tasted some disconcerting drugs and by the aid of a few cardamoms ground ginger chloricether and dilute alcohol manufactured a new and wildish drink of which i bore a glassful to young mr cashell busy in the back office he laughed shortly when i told him that mr shaynor had stepped outbut a frail coil of wire held all his attention and he had no word for me bewildered among the batteries and rods the noise of the sea on the beach began to make itself heard as the traffic in the street ceased then briefly but very lucidly he gave me the names and uses of the mechanism that crowded the tables and the floor  when do you expect to get the message from poole i demanded sipping my liquor out of a graduated glass  about midnight if everything is in order weve got our installation pole fixed to the roof of the house i shouldnt advise you to turn on a tap or anything tonight weve connected up with the plumbing and all the water will be electrified he repeated to me the history of the agitated ladies at the hotel at the time of the first installation  but what is it i asked electricity is out of my beat altogether  ah if you knew that youd know something nobody knows its just it what we call electricity but the magicthe manifestationsthe hertzian wavesare all revealed by this the coherer we call it  he picked up a glass tube not much thicker than a thermometer in which almost touching were two tiny silver plugs and between them an infinitesimal pinch of metallic dust thats all he said proudly as though himself responsible for the wonder that is the thing that will reveal to us the powerswhatever the powers may beat workthrough spacea long distance away  just then mr shaynor returned alone and stood coughing his heart out on the mat  serves you right for being such a fool said young mr cashell as annoyed as myself at the interruption never mindweve all the night before us to see wonders  shaynor clutched the counter his handkerchief to his lips when he brought it away i saw two bright red stains  iive got a bit of a rasped throat from smoking cigarettes he panted i think ill try a cubeb  better take some of this ive been compounding while youve been away i handed him the brew  twont make me drunk will it im almost a teetotaller my word thats grateful and comforting  he sat down the empty glass to cough afresh  brr but it was cold out there i shouldnt care to be lying in my grave a night like this dont you ever have a sore throat from smoking he pocketed the handkerchief after a furtive peep  oh yes sometimes i replied wondering while i spoke into what agonies of terror i should fall if ever i saw those brightred danger signals under my nose young mr cashell among the batteries coughed slightly to show that he was quite ready to continue his scientific explanations but i was thinking still of the girl with the rich voice and the significantly cut mouth at whose command i had taken charge of the shop it flashed across me that she distantly resembled the seductive shape on a goldframed toiletwater advertisement whose charms were unholily heightened by the glare from the red bottle in the window turning to make sure i saw mr shaynors eyes bent in the same direction and by instinct recognised that the flamboyant thing was to him a shrine what do you take for yourcough i asked  well im the wrong side of the counter to believe much in patent medicines but there are asthma cigarettes and there are pastilles to tell you the truth if you dont object to the smell which is very like incense i believe though im not a roman catholic blaudetts cathedral pastilles relieve me as much as anything  lets try i had never raided a chemists shop before so i was thorough we unearthed the pastillesbrown gummy cones of benzoinand set them alight under the toiletwater advertisement where they fumed in thin blue spirals  of course said mr shaynor to my question what one uses in the shop for ones self comes out of ones pocket why stocktaking in our business is nearly the same as with jewellersand i cant say more than that but one gets themhe pointed to the pastilleboxat trade prices evidently the censing of the gay seventinted wench with the teeth was an established ritual which cost something  and when do we shut up shop  we stay like this all night the govold mr cashelldoesnt believe in locks and shutters as compared with electric light besides it brings trade ill just sit here in the chair by the stove and write a letter if you dont mind electricity isnt my prescription  the energetic young mr cashell snorted within and shaynor settled himself up in his chair over which he had thrown a staring red black and yellow austrian jute blanket rather like a tablecover i cast about amid patent medicine pamphlets for something to read but finding little returned to the manufacture of the new drink the italian warehouse took down its game and went to bed across the street blank shutters flung back the gaslight in cold smears the dried pavement seemed to rough up in gooseflesh under the scouring of the savage wind and we could hear long ere he passed the policeman flapping his arms to keep himself warm within the flavours of cardamoms and chloricether disputed those of the pastilles and a score of drugs and perfume and soap scents our electric lights set low down in the windows before the tunbellied rosamund jars flung inward three monstrous daubs of red blue and green that broke into kaleidoscopic lights on the facetted knobs of the drugdrawers the cutglass scent flagons and the bulbs of the sparklet bottles they flushed the whitetiled floor in gorgeous patches splashed along the nickelsilver counterrails and turned the polished mahogany counter panels to the likeness of intricate grained marblesslabs of porphyry and malachite mr shaynor unlocked a drawer and ere he began to write took out a meagre bundle of letters from my place by the stove i could see the scalloped edges of the paper with a flaring monogram in the corner and could even smell the reek of chypre at each page he turned toward the toiletwater lady of the advertisement and devoured her with overluminous eyes he had drawn the austrian blanket over his shoulders and among those warring lights he looked more than ever the incarnation of a drugged motha tigermoth as i thought  he put his letter into an envelope stamped it with stiff mechanical movements and dropped it in the drawer then i became aware of the silence of a great city asleepthe silence that underlaid the even voice of the breakers along the seafronta thick tingling quiet of warm life stilled down for its appointed time and unconsciously i moved about the glittering shop as one moves in a sickroom young mr cashell was adjusting some wire that crackled from time to time with the tense knucklestretching sound of the electric spark upstairs where a door shut and opened swiftly i could hear his uncle coughing abed  here i said when the drink was properly warmed take some of this mr shaynor  he jerked in his chair with a start and a wrench and held out his hand for the glass the mixture of a rich portwine colour frothed at the top  it looks he said suddenly it looksthose bubbleslike a string of pearls winking at yourather like the pearls round that young ladys neck he turned again to the advertisement where the female in the dove coloured corset had seen fit to put on all her pearls before she cleaned her teeth  not bad is it i said  eh  he rolled his eyes heavily full on me and as i stared i beheld all meaning and consciousness die out of the swiftly dilating pupils his figure lost its stark rigidity softened into the chair and chin on chest hands dropped before him he rested openeyed absolutely still  im afraid ive rather cooked shaynors goose i said bearing the fresh drink to young mr cashell perhaps it was the chloricether  oh hes all right the spadebearded man glanced at him pityingly consumptives go off in those sort of doses very often its exhaustion i dont wonder i dare say the liquor will do him good its grand stuff he finished his share appreciatively well as i was sayingbefore he interruptedabout this little coherer the pinch of dust you see is nickelfilings the hertzian waves you see come out of space from the station that despatches em and all these little particles are attracted togethercohere we call itfor just so long as the current passes through them now its important to remember that the current is an induced current there are a good many kinds of induction  yes but what is induction  thats rather hard to explain untechnically but the long and the short of it is that when a current of electricity passes through a wire theres a lot of magnetism present round that wire and if you put another wire parallel to and within what we call its magnetic fieldwhy then the second wire will also become charged with electricity  on its own account  on its own account  then lets see if ive got it correctly miles off at poole or wherever it is  it will be anywhere in ten years  youve got a charged wire  charged with hertzian waves which vibrate say two hundred and thirty million times a second mr cashell snaked his forefinger rapidly through the air  all righta charged wire at poole giving out these waves into space then this wire of yours sticking out into spaceon the roof of the house in some mysterious way gets charged with those waves from poole  or anywhereit only happens to be poole tonight  and those waves set the coherer at work just like an ordinary telegraph office ticker  no thats where so many people make the mistake the hertzian waves wouldnt be strong enough to work a great heavy morse instrument like ours they can only just make that dust cohere and while it coheres a little while for a dot and a longer while for a dash the current from this batterythe home batteryhe laid his hand on the thingcan get through to the morse printingmachine to record the dot or dash let me make it clearer do you know anything about steam  very little but go on  well the coherer is like a steamvalve any child can open a valve and start a steamers engines because a turn of the hand lets in the main steam doesnt it now this home battery here ready to print is the main steam the coherer is the valve always ready to be turned on the hertzian wave is the childs hand that turns it  i see thats marvellous  marvellous isnt it and remember were only at the beginning theres nothing we shant be able to do in ten years i want to livemy god how i want to live and see it develop he looked through the door at shaynor breathing lightly in his chair poor beast and he wants to keep company with fanny brand  fanny who i said for the name struck an obscurely familiar chord in my brainsomething connected with a stained handkerchief and the word arterial  fanny brandthe girl you kept shop for he laughed thats all i know about her and for the life of me i cant see what shaynor sees in her or she in him  cant you see what he sees in her i insisted  oh yes if thats what you mean shes a great big fat lump of a girl and so on i suppose thats why hes so crazy after her she isnt his sort well it doesnt matter my uncle says hes bound to die before the years out your drinks given him a good sleep at any rate young mr cashell could not catch mr shaynors face which was half turned to the advertisement  i stoked the stove anew for the room was growing cold and lighted another pastille mr shaynor in his chair never moving looked through and over me with eyes as wide and lustreless as those of a dead hare  pooles late said young mr cashell when i stepped back ill just send them a call  he pressed a key in the semidarkness and with a rending crackle there leaped between two brass knobs a spark streams of sparks and sparks again  grand isnt it thats the powerour unknown powerkicking and fighting to be let loose said young mr cashell there she goeskick kickkick into space i never get over the strangeness of it when i work a sendingmachinewaves going into space you know tr is our call poole ought to answer with lll  we waited two three five minutes in that silence of which the boom of the tide was an orderly part i caught the clear kisskisskiss of the halliards on the roof as they were blown against the installation pole  poole is not ready ill stay here and call you when he is  i returned to the shop and set down my glass on a marble slab with a careless clink as i did so shaynor rose to his feet his eyes fixed once more on the advertisement where the young woman bathed in the light from the red jar simpered pinkly over her pearls his lips moved without cessation i stepped nearer to listen and threwand threwand threw he repeated his face all sharp with some inexplicable agony  i moved forward astonished but it was then he found wordsdelivered roundly and clearly these  and threw warm gules on madeleines young breast  the trouble passed off his countenance and he returned lightly to his place rubbing his hands  it had never occurred to me though we had many times discussed reading and prizecompetitions as a diversion that mr shaynor ever read keats or could quote him at all appositely there was after all a certain stainedglass effect of light on the high bosom of the highlypolished picture which might by stretch of fancy suggest as a vile chromo recalls some incomparable canvas the line he had spoken night my drink and solitude were evidently turning mr shaynor into a poet he sat down again and wrote swiftly on his villainous notepaper his lips quivering  i shut the door into the inner office and moved up behind him he made no sign that he saw or heard i looked over his shoulder and read amid halfformed words sentences and wild scratches    very cold it was very cold   the harethe harethe hare   the birds  he raised his head sharply and frowned toward the blank shutters of the poulterers shop where they jutted out against our window then one clear line came    the hare in spite of fur was very cold  the head moving machinelike turned right to the advertisement where the blaudetts cathedral pastille reeked abominably he grunted and went on    incense in a censer   before her darling picture framed in gold   maidens pictureangels portrait  hsh said mr cashell guardedly from the inner office as though in the presence of spirits theres something coming through from somewhere but it isnt poole i heard the crackle of sparks as he depressed the keys of the transmitter in my own brain too something crackled or it might have been the hair on my head then i heard my own voice in a harsh whisper mr cashell there is something coming through here too leave me alone till i tell you  but i thought youd come to see this wonderful thingsir indignantly at the end  leave me alone till i tell you be quiet  i watchedi waited under the blueveined handthe dry hand of the consumptivecame away clear without erasure  and my weak spirit fails to think how the dead must freeze he shivered as he wrote  beneath the churchyard mould  then he stopped laid the pen down and leaned back  for an instant that was half an eternity the shop spun before me in a rainbowtinted whirl in and through which my own soul most dispassionately considered my own soul as that fought with an over mastering fear then i smelt the strong smell of cigarettes from mr shaynors clothing and heard as though it had been the rending of trumpets the rattle of his breathing i was still in my place of observation much as one would watch a rifleshot at the butts halfbent hands on my knees and head within a few inches of the black red and yellow blanket of his shoulder i was whispering encouragement evidently to my other self sounding sentences such as men pronounce in dreams  if he has read keats it proves nothing if he hasntlike causes must beget like effects there is no escape from this law you ought to be grateful that you know st agnes eve without the book because given the circumstances such as fanny brand who is the key of the enigma and approximately represents the latitude and longitude of fanny brawne allowing also for the bright red colour of the arterial blood upon the handkerchief which was just what you were puzzling over in the shop just now and counting the effect of the professional environment here almost perfectly duplicatedthe result is logical and inevitable as inevitable as induction  still the other half of my soul refused to be comforted it was cowering in some minute and inadequate cornerat an immense distance  hereafter i found myself one person again my hands still gripping my knees and my eyes glued on the page before mr shaynor as dreamers accept and explain the upheaval of landscapes and the resurrection of the dead with excerpts from the evening hymn or the multiplicationtable so i had accepted the facts whatever they might be that i should witness and had devised a theory sane and plausible to my mind that explained them all nay i was even in advance of my facts walking hurriedly before them assured that they would fit my theory and all that i now recall of that epochmaking theory are the lofty words if he has read keats its the chloricether if he hasnt its the identical bacillus or hertzian wave of tuberculosis plus fanny brand and the professional status which in conjunction with the mainstream of subconscious thought common to all mankind has thrown up temporarily an induced keats  mr shaynor returned to his work erasing and rewriting as before with swiftness two or three blank pages he tossed aside then he wrote muttering  the little smoke of a candle that goes out  no he muttered little smokelittle smokelittle smoke what else he thrust his chin forward toward the advertisement whereunder the last of the blaudetts cathedral pastilles fumed in its holder ah then with relief  the little smoke that dies in moonlight cold  evidently he was snared by the rhymes of his first verse for he wrote and rewrote goldcoldmould many times again he sought inspiration from the advertisement and set down without erasure the line i had overheard  and threw warm gules on madeleines young breast  as i remembered the original it is faira trite wordinstead of young and i found myself nodding approval though i admitted that the attempt to reproduce its little smoke in pallid moonlight died was a failure  followed without a break ten or fifteen lines of bald prosethe naked souls confession of its physical yearning for its belovedunclean as we count uncleanliness unwholesome but human exceedingly the raw material so it seemed to me in that hour and in that place whence keats wove the twentysixth seventh and eighth stanzas of his poem shame i had none in overseeing this revelation and my fear had gone with the smoke of the pastille  thats it i murmured thats how its blocked out go on ink it in man ink it in  mr shaynor returned to broken verse wherein loveliness was made to rhyme with a desire to look upon her empty dress he picked up a fold of the gay soft blanket spread it over one hand caressed it with infinite tenderness thought muttered traced some snatches which i could not decipher shut his eyes drowsily shook his head and dropped the stuff here i found myself at fault for i could not then see as i do now in what manner a red black and yellow austrian blanket coloured his dreams  in a few minutes he laid aside his pen and chin on hand considered the shop with thoughtful and intelligent eyes he threw down the blanket rose passed along a line of drugdrawers and read the names on the labels aloud returning he took from his desk christies new commercial plants and the old culpepper that i had given him opened and laid them side by side with a clerky air all trace of passion gone from his face read first in one and then in the other and paused with pen behind his ear  what wonder of heavens coming now i thought  mannamannamanna he said at last under wrinkled brows thats what i wanted good now then now then good good oh by god thats good his voice rose and he spoke rightly and fully without a falter    candied apple quince and plum and gourd   and jellies smoother than the creamy curd   and lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon   manna and dates in argosy transferred   from fez and spiced dainties every one   from silken samarcand to cedared lebanon  he repeated it once more using blander for smoother in the second line then wrote it down without erasure but this time my set eyes missed no stroke of any word he substituted soother for his atrocious second thought so that it came away under his hand as it is written in the bookas it is written in the book  a wind went shouting down the street and on the heels of the wind followed a spurt and rattle of rain  after a smiling pauseand good right had he to smilehe began anew always tossing the last sheet over his shoulder    the sharp rain falling on the windowpane   rattling sleetthe windblown sleet  then prose it is very cold of mornings when the wind brings rain and sleet with it i heard the sleet on the windowpane outside and thought of you my darling i am always thinking of you i wish we could both run away like two lovers into the storm and get that little cottage by the sea which we are always thinking about my own dear darling we could sit and watch the sea beneath our windows it would be a fairyland all of our owna fairy seaa fairy sea  he stopped raised his head and listened the steady drone of the channel along the seafront that had borne us company so long leaped up a note to the sudden fuller surge that signals the change from ebb to flood it beat in like the change of step throughout an armythis renewed pulse of the seaand filled our ears till they accepting it marked it no longer    a fairyland for you and me   across the foambeyond    a magic foam a perilous sea  he grunted again with effort and bit his underlip my throat dried but i dared not gulp to moisten it lest i should break the spell that was drawing him nearer and nearer to the highwater mark but two of the sons of adam have reached remember that in all the millions permitted there are no more than fivefive little linesof which one can say these are the pure magic these are the clear vision the rest is only poetry and mr shaynor was playing hot and cold with two of them  i vowed no unconscious thought of mine should influence the blindfold soul and pinned myself desperately to the other three repeating and rerepeating    a savage spot as holy and enchanted   as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted   by woman wailing for her demon lover  but though i believed my brain thus occupied my every sense hung upon the writing under the dry bony hand all brownfingered with chemicals and cigarettesmoke    our windows fronting on the dangerous foam  he wrote after long irresolute snatches and then    our open casements facing desolate seas   forlornforlorn  here again his face grew peaked and anxious with that sense of loss i had first seen when the power snatched him but this time the agony was tenfold keener as i watched it mounted like mercury in the tube it lighted his face from within till i thought the visibly scourged soul must leap forth naked between his jaws unable to endure a drop of sweat trickled from my forehead down my nose and splashed on the back of my hand    our windows facing on the desolate seas   and pearly foam of magic fairyland    not yetnot yet he muttered wait a minute   please wait a minute i shall get it then    our magic windows fronting on the sea   the dangerous foam of desolate seas    for aye  ouh my god  from head to heel he shookshook from the marrow of his bones outwardsthen leaped to his feet with raised arms and slid the chair screeching across the tiled floor where it struck the drawers behind and fell with a jar mechanically i stooped to recover it  as i rose mr shaynor was stretching and yawning at leisure  ive had a bit of a doze he said how did i come to knock the chair over you look rather  the chair startled me i answered it was so sudden in this quiet  young mr cashell behind his shut door was offendedly silent  i suppose i must have been dreaming said mr shaynor  i suppose you must i said talking of dreamsii noticed you writingbefore  he flushed consciously  i meant to ask you if youve ever read anything written by a man called keats  oh i havent much time to read poetry and i cant say that i remember the name exactly is he a popular writer  middling i thought you might know him because hes the only poet who was ever a druggist and hes rather whats called the lovers poet  indeed i must dip into him what did he write about  a lot of things heres a sample that may interest you  then and there carefully i repeated the verse he had twice spoken and once written not ten minutes ago  ah anybody could see he was a druggist from that line about the tinctures and syrups its a fine tribute to our profession  i dont know said young mr cashell with icy politeness opening the door one halfinch if you still happen to be interested in our trifling experiments but should such be the case  i drew him aside whispering shaynor seemed going off into some sort of fit when i spoke to you just now i thought even at the risk of being rude it wouldnt do to take you off your instruments just as the call was coming through dont you see  grantedgranted as soon as asked he said unbending i did think it a shade odd at the time so that was why he knocked the chair down  i hope i havent missed anything i said im afraid i cant say that but youre just in time for the end of a rather curious performance you can come in too mr shaynor listen while i read it off  the morse instrument was ticking furiously mr cashell interpreted kkv can make nothing of your signals a pause mmv mmv signals unintelligible purpose anchor sandown bay examine instruments tomorrow do you know what that means its a couple of menowar working marconi signals off the isle of wight they are trying to talk to each other neither can read the others messages but all their messages are being taken in by our receiver here theyve been going on for ever so long i wish you could have heard it  how wonderful i said do you mean were overhearing portsmouth ships trying to talk to each otherthat were eavesdropping across half south england  just that their transmitters are all right but their receivers are out of order so they only get a dot here and a dash there nothing clear  why is that  god knowsand science will know tomorrow perhaps the induction is faulty perhaps the receivers arent tuned to receive just the number of vibrations per second that the transmitter sends only a word here and there just enough to tantalise  again the morse sprang to life  thats one of em complaining now listen dishearteningmost disheartening its quite pathetic have you ever seen a spiritualistic seance it reminds me of that sometimesodds and ends of messages coming out of nowherea word here and thereno good at all  but mediums are all impostors said mr shaynor in the doorway lighting an asthmacigarette they only do it for the money they can make ive seen em  heres poole at lastclear as a bell lll now we shant be long mr cashell rattled the keys merrily anything youd like to tell em  no i dont think so i said ill go home and get to bed im feeling a little tired     the army of a dream  song of the old guard  and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and its branches his bowls his knops and his flowers shall be the same  and there shall be a knop under two branches of the same and a knop under two branches of the same and a knop under two branches of the same according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick their knops and their branches shall be the sameexodus    know this my brethren heaven is clear     and all the clouds are gone   the proper sort shall flourish now     good times are coming on   the evil that was threatened late     to all of our degree   hath passed in discord and debate     and hey then up go we    a common people strove in vain     to shame us unto toil   but they are spent and we remain     and we shall share the spoil   according to our several needs     as beauty shall decree   as age ordains or birth concedes     and hey then up go we    and they that with accursed zeal     our service would amend   shall own the odds and come to heel     ere worse befall their end   for though no naked

strictly keep     the arks integrity   till armageddon break our sleep      and hey then up go we   the army of a dream  part i  i sat down in the club smokingroom to fill a pipe                                       it was entirely natural that i should be talking to boy bayley we had met first twenty odd years ago at the indian mess of the tyneside tailtwisters our last meeting i remembered had been at the mount nelson hotel which was by no means india and there we had talked half the night boy bayley had gone up that week to the front where i think he stayed a long long time  but now he had come back  are you still a tynesider i asked  i command the imperial guard battalion of the old regiment my son he replied  guard which theyve been fusiliers since fontenoy dont pull my leg boy  i said guard not guards the i g battalion of the tailtwisters does that make it any clearer  not in the least  then come over to the mess and see for yourself we arent a step from barracks keep on my right side imim a bit deaf on the near  we left the club together and crossed the street to a vast fourstoried pile which more resembled a rowton lodginghouse than a barrack i could see no sentry at the gates  there aint any said the boy lightly he led me into a manytabled restaurant full of civilians and greygreen uniforms at one end of the room on a slightly raised dais stood a big table  here we are we usually lunch here and dine in mess by ourselves these are our chapsbut what am i thinking of you must know most of em devines my second in command now theres old luttrellremember him at cheratburgard verschoyle you were at school with him harrison pigeon and kyd  with the exception of this last i knew them all but i could not remember that they had all been tynesiders  ive never seen this sort of place i said looking round half the men here are in plain clothes and what are those women and children doing  eating i hope boy bayley answered our canteens would never pay if it wasnt for the line and militia trade when they were first started people looked on em rather as catsmeatshops but we got a duchess or two to lunch in em and theyve been grossly fashionable since  so i see i answered a woman of the type that shops at the stores came up the room looking about her a man in the dullgrey uniform of the corps rose up to meet her piloted her to a place between three other uniforms and there began a very merry little meal  i give it up i said this is guilty splendour that i dont understand  quite simple said burgard across the table the barrack supplies breakfast dinner and tea on the army scale to the imperial guard which we call i g when its in barracks as well as to the line and militia they can all invite their friends if they choose to pay for them thats where we make our profits look  near one of the doors were four or five tables crowded with workmen in the raiment of their callings they ate steadily but found time to jest with the uniforms about them and when one oclock clanged from a big halfbuilt block of flats across the street filed out  those devine explained are either our line or militiamen as such entitled to the regulation whack at regulation cost its cheaper than they could buy it an they meet their friends too a manll walk a mile in his dinner hour to mess with his own lot  wait a minute i pleaded will you tell me what those plumbers and plasterers and bricklayers that i saw go out just now have to do with what i was taught to call the line  tell him said the boy over his shoulder to burgard he was busy talking with the large verschoyle my old schoolmate  the line comes next to the guard the linesmans generally a townbird who cant afford to be a volunteer he has to go into camp in an area for two months his first year six weeks his second and a month the third he gets about five bob a week the year round for that and for being on duty two days of the week and for being liable to be ordered out to help the guard in a row he neednt live in barracks unless he wants to and he and his family can feed at the regimental canteen at usual rates the women like it  all this i said politely but intensely is the raving of delirium where may your precious recruit who neednt live in barracks learn his drill  at his precious school my child like the rest of us the notion of allowing a human being to reach his twentieth year before asking him to put his feet in the first position was raving lunacy if you like boy bayley dived back into the conversation  very good i said meekly i accept the virtuous plumber who puts in two months of his valuable time at aldershot  aldershot the table exploded i felt a little annoyed  a camp in an area is not exactly aldershot said burgard the line isnt exactly what you fancy some of them even come to us  you recruit from em  i beg your pardon said devine with mock solemnity the guard doesnt recruit it selects  it would i said with a spiers and pond restaurant pretty girls to play with and  a room apiece four bob a day and all found said verschoyle dont forget that  of course i said it probably beats off recruits with a club  no with the ballotbox said verschoyle laughing at least in all rc companies  i didnt know roman catholics were so particular i ventured  they grinned rc companies said the boy mean right of choice when a company has been very good and pious for a long time it may if the co thinks fit choose its own menall same onepiecee club all our companies are rcs and as the battalion is making up a few vacancies ere starting once more on the wild and trackless heef into the areas the linesman is here in force today sucking up to our noncoms  would some one mind explaining to me the meaning of every other word youve used i said whats a trackless heef whats an area whats everything generally i asked  oh heefs part of the british constitution said the boy it began long ago when theyd first mapped out the big military manoeuvring groundswe call em areas for shortwhere the i g spend twothirds of their time and the other regiments get their training it was slang originally for beef on the hoof because in the military areas twothirds of your meatrations at least are handed over to you on the hoof and you make your own arrangements the word heef became a parable for camping in the military areas and all its miseries there are two areas in ireland one in wales for hillwork a couple in scotland and a sort of paradeground in the lake district but the real working areas are in india africa and australia and so on  and what do you do there  we heef under service conditions which are rather like hard work we heef in an english area for about a year coming into barracks for one month to make up wastage then we may heef foreign for another year or eighteen months then we do seatime in the war boats  whatt i said  seatime bayley repeated just like marines to learn about the big guns and how to embark and disembark quick then we come back to our territorial headquarters for six months to educate the line and volunteer camps to go to hythe to keep abreast of any new ideas and then we fill up vacancies we call those six months schools then we begin all over again thus home heef foreign heef seatime schools heefing isnt precisely luxurious but its on heef that we make our headmoney  or lose it said the sallow pigeon and all laughed as men will at regimental jokes  the dove never lets me forget that said boy bayley it happened last march we were out in the second northern area at the top end of scotland where a lot of those silly deer forests used to be id sooner heef in the middle of australia myselfor athabasca with all respect to the dovehes a native of those parts we were camped somewhere near caithness and the armity thats the combined navy and army board that runs our show sent us about eight hundred raw remounts to break in to keep us warm  why horses for a foot regiment  igs dont foot it unless theyre obliged to no have geegee how can move ill show you later well as i was saying we broke those beasts in on compressed forage and small boxspurs and then we started across scotland to applecross to hand em over to a horsedepot there it was snowing cruel and we didnt know the country overmuch you remember the 30ththe old east lancashireat mian mir  their guard battalion had been heefing round those parts for six months we thought theyd be snowed up all quiet and comfy but burden their c o got wind of our coming and sent spies in to eschol  confound him said luttrell who was fat and wellliking i entertained one of emin a red worsted comforterunder bean derig he said he was a crofter gave him a drink too  i dont mind admitting said the boy that what with the cold and the remounts we were moving rather base over apex burden bottled us under sghurr mohr in a snowstorm he stampeded half the horses cut off a lot of us in a snowbank and generally rubbed our noses in the dirt  was he allowed to do that i said  there is no peace in a military area if wed beaten him off or got away without losing anyone wed have been entitled to a days pay from every man engaged against us but we didnt he cut off fifty of ours held em as prisoners for the regulation three days and then sent in his billthree days pay for each man taken fifty men at twelve bob a head plus five pounds for the dove as a captured officer and kyd here his junior three made about forty quid to burden  co they crowed over us horrid  couldnt you have appealed to an umpire oror something  we could but we talked it over with the men and decided to pay and look happy we were fairly had the 30th knew every foot of sghurr mohr i spent three days huntin em in the snow but they went off on our remounts about twenty mile that night  do you always do this shamfight business i asked  once inside an area you must look after yourself but i tell you that a fight which means that every manjack of us may lose a weeks pay isnt so damnsham after all it keeps the men nippy still in the long run its like whist on a p  o it comes out fairly level if you play long enough now and again though one gets a presentsay when a line regiments out on the heef and signifies that its ready to abide by the rules of the game you mustnt take headmoney from a line regiment in an area unless it says that itll play you but after a week or two those clever linesmen always think they see a chance of making a pot and send in their compliments to the nearest ig then the fun begins we caught a line regiment singlehanded about two years ago in irelandcaught it on the hop between a bog and a beach it had just moved in to join its brigade and we made a fortytwo mile march in fourteen hours and cut it off lock stock and barrel it went to ground like a badgeri will say those line regiments can digbut we got out privily by night and broke up the only road it could expect to get its baggage and companyguns along then we blew up a bridge that some sappers had made for experimental purposes they were rather stuffy about it on its line of retreat while we lay up in the mountains and signalled for the ac of those parts  whos an ac i asked  the adjustment committeethe umpires of the military areas theyre a set of superannuated old aunts of colonels kept for the purpose but they occasionally combine to do justice our ac came saw our dispositions and said it was a sanguinary massacre for the line and that we were entitled to our full pound of fleshheadmoney for one whole regiment with equipment four companyguns and all kit at line rates this worked out as one fat cheque for two hundred and fifty not bad  but we had to pay the sappers seventyfour quid for blowing their patent bridge to pieces devine interpolated that was a swindle  thats true the boy went on but the adjustment committee gave our helpless victims a talking to that was worth another hundred to hear  but isnt there a lot of unfairness in this headmoney system i asked  cant have everything perfect said the boy headmoney is an attempt at payment by results and it gives the men a direct interest in their job three times out of five of course the a c will disallow both sides claim but theres always the chance of bringing off a coup  do all regiments do it  heavily the line pays a bob per prisoner and the militia ninepence not to mention sidebets which are what really keep the men keen it isnt supposed to be done by the volunteers but they gamble worse than anyone why the very kids do it when they go to first camp at aldershot or salisbury  headmoneys a national institutionlike betting said burgard  i should say it was said pigeon suddenly i was roped in the other day as an adjustment committee by the kemptown board school i was riding under the brighton racecourse and i heard the whistle goin for umpirethe regulation two longs and two shorts i didnt take any notice till an infant about a yard high jumped up from a furzepatch and shouted guard guard come ere i want you perfessionally alf says e aint outflanked aint e a liar come an look ow ive posted my men you bet i looked the young demon trotted by my stirrup and showed me his whole army twenty of em laid out under cover as nicely as you please round a cowhouse in a hollow he kept on shouting ive drew alf into there is persition aint tenable say it aint tenable guard i rode round the position and alf with his army came out of his cowhouse an sat on the roof and protested like alike a militia colonel but the facts were in favour of my friend and i umpired according well alf abode by my decision i explained it to him at length and he solemnly paid up his headmoneyfarthing points if you please  did they pay you umpires fee said kyd i umpired a whole afternoon once for a village school at home and they stood me a bottle of hot ginger beer  i compromised on a halfpennya sticky oneor id have hurt their feelings said pigeon gravely but i gave em sixpence back  how were they manoeuvring and what with i asked  oh by whistle and handsignal they had the dummy board school guns and flags for positions but they were rushing their attack much too quick for that open country i told em so and they admitted it  but who taught em i said  they had learned in their schools of course like the rest of us they were all of em over ten and squaddrill begins when theyre eight they knew their companydrill a heap better than they knew their kings english  how much drill do the boys put in i asked  all boys begin physical drill to music in the board schools when theyre six squaddrill one hour a week when theyre eight companydrill when theyre ten for an hour and a half a week between ten and twelve they get battalion drill of a sort they take the rifle at twelve and record their first targetscore at thirteen thats what the code lays down but its worked very loosely so long as a boy comes up to the standard of his age  in canada we dont need your physical drill were born fit said pigeon and our tenyearolds could knock spots out of your twelveyearolds  i may as well explain said the boy that the dove is our swop officer hes an untamed huskie from nootka sound when hes at home an i g corps exchanges one officer every two years with a canadian or australian or african guard corps weve had a year of our dove an we shall be sorry to lose him he humbles our insular pride meantime morten our swop in canada keeps the ferocious canuck humble when pij goes we shall swop kyd whos next on the roster for a cornstalk or a maori but about the educationdrill a boy cant attend first camp as we call it till he is a trained boy and holds his first musketry certificate the education code says he must be fourteen and the boys usually go to first camp at about that age of course theyve been to their little private camps and boys fresh air camps and public school picnics while they were at school but first camp is where the young drafts all meetgenerally at aldershot in this part of the world first camp lasts a week or ten days and the boys are looked over for vaccination and worked lightly in brigades with lots of blank cartridge second campthats for the fifteen to eighteenyearoldslasts ten days or a fortnight and that includes a final medical examination men dont like to be chucked out on medical certificates muchnowadays i assure you second camp at salisbury say is an experience for a young ig officer were told off to em in rotation a wilderness of monkeys isnt in it the kids are apt to think emselves soldiers and we have to take the edge off em with lots of picquetwork and night attacks  and what happens after second camp  its hard to explain our system is so illogical theoretically the boys neednt show up for the next three or four years after second camp they are supposed to be making their way in life actually the young doctor or lawyer or engineer joins a volunteer battalion that sticks to the minimum of campten days per annum that gives him a holiday in the open air and now that men have taken to endowing their volunteer drillhalls with baths and libraries he finds if he cant run to a club that his own drillhall is an efficient substitute he meets men there wholl be useful to him later and he keeps himself in touch with whats going on while hes studying for his profession the townbirdssuch as the chemists assistant clerk plumber mechanic electrician and so forthgenerally put in for their town volunteer corps as soon as they begin to walk out with the girls they like takin their trueloves to our restaurants look yonder i followed his gaze and saw across the room a man and a maid at a far table forgetting in each others eyes the good food on their plates  so it is said i go ahead  then too we have some town volunteer corps that lay themselves out to attract promising youths of nineteen or twenty and make much of em on condition that they join their line battalion and play for their county under the new county qualificationsbirth or three years residencethat means a great deal in league matches and the same in county cricket  by jove thats a good notion i cried who invented it  c b frylong ago he said in his paper that county cricket and county volunteering ought to be on the same footingunpaid and genuine no cricketer no corps no corps no cricketer was his watchword there was a row among the pros at first but c b won and later the league had to come in they said at first it would ruin the gate but when county matches began to be pukka county plus interregimental affairs the gate trebled and as twothirds of the gate goes to the regiments supplying the teams some volunteer corps fairly wallow in cash its all unofficial of course but league corps as they call em can take their pick of the second camper some corps ask ten guineas entrancefee and get it too from the young bloods that want to shine in the arena i told you we catered for all tastes now as regards the line proper i believe the young artisan and mechanic puts in for that before he marries he likes the twomonths heef in his first year and five bob a week is something to go on with between times  do they follow their trade while theyre in the line i demanded  why not how many wellpaid artisans work more than four days a week anyhow remember a linesman hasnt to be drilled in your sense of the word he must have had at least eight years grounding in that as well as two or three years in his volunteer battalion he can sleep where he pleases he cant leave townlimits without reporting himself of course but he can get leave if he wants it hes on duty two days in the week as a rule and hes liable to be invited out for garrison duty down the mediterranean but his benefit societies will insure him against that ill tell you about that later if its a hard winter and trades slack a lot of the bachelors are taken into the i g barracks while the i g is out on the heef for theoretical instruction oh i assure you the line hasnt half a bad time of it  amazing i murmured and what about the others  the volunteers observe the beauty of our system were a free people we get up and slay the man who says we arent but as a little detail we never mention if we dont volunteer in some corps or anotheras combatants if were fit as noncombatants if we ainttill were thirtyfive we dont vote and we dont get poorrelief and the women dont love us  oh thats the compulsion of it said i  bayley inclined his head gravely that sir is the compulsion we voted the legal part of it ourselves in a fit of panic and we have not yet rescinded our resolution the women attend to the unofficial penalties but being free british citizens  and snobs put in pigeon the point is well taken pijwe have supplied ourselves with every sort and shape and make of volunteer corps that you can imagine and weve mixed the whole show up with our odd fellows and our iogts and our buffaloes and our burkes and our debretts not to mention leagues and athletic clubs till you cant tell tother from which you remember the young pup who used to look on soldiering as a favour done to his ungrateful countrythe gunpoking ferretpettin landed gentlemans offspringthe suckin facey romford well he generally joins a foreign service corps when he leaves college  can volunteers go foreign then  cant they just if their co or his wife has influence the armity will always send a wellconnected fs corps out to help a guard battalion in a small campaign otherwise fs corps make their own arrangements about camps you see the military areas are always open they can heef there and gamble on headmoney as long as their finances run to it or they can apply to do seatime in the ships its a cheap way for a young man to see the world and if hes any good he can try to get into the guard later  the main point said pigeon is that fs corps are swaggerthe correct thing it ud never do to be drawn for the militia dont you know he drawled trying to render the english voice  thats what happens to a chap who doesnt volunteer said bayley well after the fs corps weve about forty of em come our territorial volunteer battalions and a man who cant suit himself somewhere among em must be a shade difficult weve got those league corps i was talking about and those studious corps that just scrape through their ten days camp and weve crack corps of highlypaid mechanics who can afford a two months heef in an interesting area every other year and weve senior and junior scientific corps of earnest boilermakers and fitters and engineers who read papers on high explosives and do their heefing in a wet picketboatminedroppinat the ports then weve heavy artillery recruited from the big manufacturing towns and shipbuilding yardsand ferocious hardridin yeomanry they can ridenow genteel semi genteel and hooligan corps and so on and so forth till you come to the home defence establishmentthe young chaps knocked out under medical certificate at the second camp but good enough to sit behind hedges or clean up camp and the old wasbirds whove served their time but dont care to drop out of the fun of the yearly camps and the halls they call emselves veterans and do fancyshooting at bisley but between you and me theyre mostly fresh air benefit clubs they contribute to the volunteer journals and tell the guard that its no good but i like em i shall be one of em some daya coppernosed wasbird  so you see were mixed to a degree on the volunteer side  it sounds that way i ventured  youve overdone it bayley said devine youve missed our one strong point he turned to me and continued its embarkation the volunteers may be as mixed as the colonel says but they are trained to go down to the sea in ships you ought to see a big bankholiday rollout we suspend most of the usual railway traffic and turn on the military timetablesay on friday at midnight by 4 am the trains are running from every big centre in england to the nearest port at twominute intervals as a rule the armity meets us at the other end with shipping of sortsfleet reserves or regular men of war or hulksanything you can stick a gangplank to we pile the men on to the troopdecks stack the rifles in the racks send down the seakit steam about for a few hours and land em somewhere its a good notion because our army to be any use must be an army of embarkation why last whit monday we hadhow many were down at the dockedge in the first eight hours kyd youre the volunteer enthusiast last from school  in the first ten hours over a hundred and eighteen thousand said kyd across the table with thirtysix thousand actually put in and taken out of ship in the whole thirtysix hours we had close on ninety thousand men on the water and a hundred and thirtythree thousand on the quays fallen in with their seakit  that must have been a sight i said  one didnt notice it much it was scattered between chatham dover portsmouth plymouth bristol liverpool and so on merely to give the inland men a chance to get rid of their breakfasts we dont like to concentrate and try a big embarkation at any one point it makes the continent jumpy otherwise said kyd i believe we could get two hundred thousand men with their kits away on one tide  what dyou want with so many i asked  we dont want one of em but the continent used to point out every time relations were strained that nothing would be easier than to raid england if they got command of the sea for a week after a few years some genius discovered that it cut both ways an there was no reason why we who are supposed to command the sea and own a few ships should not organise our little raids in case of need the notion caught on among the volunteersthey were getting rather sick of manoeuvres on dry landand since then we havent heard so much about raids from the continent said bayley  its the offensivedefensive said verschoyle that they talk so much about we learned it all from the continentbless em they insisted on it so  no we learned it from the fleet said devine the mediterranean fleet landed ten thousand marines and sailors with guns in twenty minutes once at manoeuvres that was long ago ive seen the fleet reserve and a few paddlesteamers hired for the day land twentyfive thousand volunteers at bantry in four hourshalf the men seasick too youve no notion what a difference that sort of manoeuvre makes in the calculations of our friends on the mainland the continent knows what invasion means its like dealing with a man whose nerve has been shaken it doesnt cost much after all and it makes us better friends with the great european family were now as thick as thieves  where does the imperial guard come in in all this gorgeousness i asked youre unusual modest about yourselves  as a matter of fact were supposed to go out and stay out were the permanently mobilised lot i dont think there are more than eight ig battalions in england now were a hundred battalions all told mostly on the heef in india africa and so forth  a hundred thousand isnt that small allowance i suggested  you think so one hundred thousand men without a single case of venereal and an average sick list of two per cent permanently on a war footing well perhaps youre right but its a useful little force to begin with while the others are getting ready theres the native indian army also which isnt a broken reed and since no volunteer no vote is the rule throughout the empire you will find a few men in canada australia and elsewhere that are fairly hefty in their class  but a hundred thousand isnt enough for garrison duty i persisted  a hundred thousand sound men not sick boys go quite a way said pigeon  we expect the line to garrison the mediterranean ports and thereabouts said bayley dont sneer at the mechanic hes deuced good stuff he isnt rudely ordered out because this aint a military despotism and we have to consider peoples feelings the armity usually brackets three line regiments together and calls for men for six months or a year for malta gib or elsewhere at a bob a day three battalions will give you nearly a whole battalion of bachelors between em you fill up deficiencies with a call on the territorial volunteer battalion and away you go with what we call a ports battalion whats astonishing in that remember that in this country where fifty per cent of the ablebodied males have got a pretty fair notion of soldiering and which is more have all camped out in the open you wake up the spirit of adventure in the young  not much adventure at malta gib or cyprus i retorted dont they get sick of it  but you dont realise that we treat em rather differently from the soldier of the past you ought to go and see a ports battalion drawn from a manufacturing centre growin vines in cyprus in its shirt sleeves and at gib and malta of course the battalions are working with the fleet half the time  it seems to me i said angrily you are knocking esprit de corps on the head with all this armynavy jumble its as bad as  i know what youre going to say as bad as what kitchener used to do when he believed that a thousand details picked up on the veldt were as good as a column of two regiments in the old days when drill was a sort of holy sacred art learned in old age youd be quite right but remember our chaps are broke to drill from childhood and the theory we work on is that a thousand trained englishmen ought to be about as good as another thousand trained englishmen weve enlarged our horizon thats all some day the army and the navy will be interchangeable  youve enlarged it enough to fall out of i think now where in all this mess of compulsory volunteers  my dear boy theres no compulsion youve got to be drilled when youre a child same as youve got to learn to read and if you dont pretend to serve in some corps or other till youre thirtyfive or medically chucked you rank with lunatics women and minors thats fair enough  compulsory conscripts i continued where as i was going to say does the militia come in  as i have saidfor the men who cant afford volunteering the militia is recruited by ballotpretty comprehensively too volunteers are exempt but most men not otherwise accounted for are bagged by the militia they have to put in a minimum three weeks camp every other year and they get fifteen bob a week and their keep when theyre at it and some sort of a yearly fee ive forgotten how much tisnt a showy service but its very useful it keeps the mass of the men between twentyfive say and thirtyfive moderately fit and gives the armity an excuse for having more equipment readyin case of emergencies  i dont think youre quite fair on the militia drawled verschoyle theyre better than we give em credit for dont you remember the middle moor collieries strike  tell me i said quickly evidently the others knew  weell it was no end of a pitmans strike about eight years ago there were twentyfive thousand men involvedmilitia of course at the end of the first monthoctoberwhen things were looking rather blue one of those clever labour leaders got hold of the militia act and discovered that any militia regiment could by a twothirds vote go on heef in a military area in addition to its usual biennial camp twoandtwenty battalions of geordies solemnly applied and they were turned loose into the irish and scotch areas under an ig brigadier who had private instructions to knock clinkers out of em but the pitman is a strong and agile bird he throve on snowdrifts and entrenching and draggin guns through heather he was being fed and clothed for nothing besides having a chance of making headmoney and his strikepay was going clear to his wife and family you see wily man but wachtabittje when that heef finished in december the strike was still on then that same labour leader found out from the same act that if at any time more than thirty or forty men of a militia regiment wished to volunteer to do seatime and study big guns in the fleet they were in no wise to be discouraged but were to be taken on as opportunity offered and paid a bob a day accordingly about january geordie began volunteering for sea timeseven and eight hundred men out of each regiment anyhow it made up seventeen thousand men it was a splendid chance and the armity jumped at it the home and channel fleets and the north sea and cruiser squadrons were strengthened with lame ducks from the fleet reserve and between em with a little stretching and pushing they accommodated all of that young division  yes but youve forgotten how we lied to the continent about it all europe wanted to know what the dooce we were at said boy bayley and the wretched cabinet had to stump the country in the depths of winter explaining our new system of poorrelief i beg your pardon verschoyle  the armity improvised naval manoeuvres between gib and lands end with frequent coalings and landings ending in a cruise round england that fairly paralysed the pitmen the first day out they wanted the fleet stopped while they went ashore and killed their labour leader but they couldnt be obliged then they wanted to mutiny over the coalingit was too like their own job oh they had a lordly timel they came backthe combined fleets anchored off hullwith a nautical hitch to their breeches theyd had a free fight at gib with the ports battalion there they cleared out the town of lagos and theyd fought a pitched battle with the dockyardmateys at devonport so theyd done emselves well but they didnt want any more military life for a bit  and the strike  that ended all right enough when the strikemoney came to an end the pitowners were furious they said the armity had wilfully prolonged the strike and asked questions in the house the armity said that they had taken advantage of the crisis to put a six months polish on fifteen thousand fine young men and if the masters cared to come out on the same terms theyd be happy to do the same by them  and then  palaver done set said bayley everybody laughed  i dont quite understand about this seatime business i said is the fleet open to take any regiment aboard  rather the ig must the line can the militia may and the volunteers do put in seatime the coast volunteers began it and the fashion is spreading inland under certain circumstances as verschoyle told you a volunteer or militia regiment can vote whether it heefs wet or dry if it votes wet and has influence like some fs corps it can sneak into the channel or the home fleet and do a cruise round england or to madeira or the north sea the regiment of course is distributed among the ships and the fleet dry nurse em it rather breaks up shore discipline but it gives the inland men a bit of experience and of course it gives us a fairish supply of men behind the gun in event of any strain on the fleet some coast corps make a specialty of it and compete for embarking and disembarking records i believe some of the tyneside engineerin corps put ten per cent of their men through the fleet engine rooms but theres no need to stay talking here all the afternoon come and see the ig in his lairthe miserable conscript driven up to the colours at the point of the bayonet  part ii  the great hall was emptying apace as the clocks struck two and we passed out through double doors into a huge reading and smoking room blue with tobacco and buzzing with voices  were quieter as a rule said the boy but were filling up vacancies today hence the anxious faces of the line and militia look there were four tables against the walls and at each stood a crowd of uniforms the centres of disturbance were noncommissioned officers who seated growled and wrote down names  come to my table said burgard well purvis have you earmarked our little lot  ive been tellin em for the last hour weve only twentythree vacancies was the sergeants answer ive taken nearly fifty for trials and this is whats left burgard smiled  im very sorry he said to the crowd but c companys full  excuse me sir said a man but wouldnt seatime count in my favour ive put in three months with the fleet small quickfirers sir company guns any sort of light machinery  come away said a voice behind theyve chucked the best farrier between hull and dewsbury think theyll take you an your potty quick firers  the speaker turned on his heel and swore  oh damn the guard by all means said sergeant purvis collecting his papers dyou suppose its any pleasure to me to reject chaps of your build and make vote us a second guard battalion and well accommodate you now you can come into schools and watch trials if you like  most of the men accepted his invitation but a few walked away angrily i followed from the smokingroom across a wide corridor into a riding school under whose roof the voices of the few hundred assembled wandered in lost echoes  ill leave you if you dont mind said burgard company officers arent supposed to assist at these games here matthews he called to a private and put me in his charge  in the centre of the vast floor my astonished eyes beheld a group of stripped men the pink of their bodies startling the tan  these are our crowd said matthews theyve been vetted an were putting em through their paces  they dont look a bit like raw material i said  no we dont use either raw men or raw meat for that matter in the guard matthews replied lifes too short  purvis stepped forward and barked in the professional manner it was physical drill of the most searching checked only when he laid his hand over some mans heart  six or seven i noticed were sent back at this stage of the game then a cry went up from a group of privates standing near the line of contorted figures white purvis white number nine is spitting white  i know it said purvis dont you worry  unfair murmured the man who understood quickfirers if i couldnt shape better than that id hire myself out to wheel a perambulator hes cooked  nah said the intent matthews hell answer to a months training like a horse its only suet youve been training for this havent you  look at me said the man simply  yes youre overtrained was matthews comment the guard isnt a circus  guns roared purvis as the men broke off and panted number off from the right fourteen is one three is two elevens three twenty and thirtynine are four and five and five is six he was giving them their numbers at the guns as they struggled into their uniforms in like manner he told off three other guncrews and the remainder left at the double to return through the further doors with four light quickfirers jerking at the end of manropes  knock down and assemble against time purvis called  the audience closed in a little as the crews flung themselves on the guns which melted wheel by wheel beneath their touch  ive never seen anything like this i whispered  huh said matthews scornfully theyre always doin it in the line and militia drillhalls its only circuswork  the guns were assembled again and some one called the time then followed ten minutes of the quickest firing and feeding with dummy cartridges that was ever given man to behold  they look as if they might amount to somethingthis draft said matthews softly  what might you teach em after this then i asked  to be guard said matthews  spurs cried purvis as the guns disappeared through the doors into the stables each man plucked at his sleeve and drew up first one heel and then the other  what the deuce are they doing i asked  this said matthews he put his hand to a ticketpocket inside his regulation cuff showed me two very small black boxspurs drawing up a gaitered foot he snapped them into the box in the heel and when i had inspected snapped them out again  thats all the spur you really need he said  then horses were trotted out into the school barebacked and the neophytes were told to ride  evidently the beasts knew the game and enjoyed it for they would not make it easy for the men  a heap of saddlery was thrown in a corner and from this each man as he captured his mount made shift to draw proper equipment while the audience laughed derided or called the horses towards them  it was most literally wild horseplay and by the time it was finished the recruits and the company were weak with fatigue and laughter  thatll do said purvis while the men rocked in their saddles i dont see any particular odds between any of you c company does anybody here know anything against any of these men  thats a bit of the regulations matthews whispered just like forbiddin the banns in church really it was all settled long ago when the names first came up  there was no answer  youll take em as they stand  there was a grunt of assent  very good theres forty men for twentythree billets he turned to the sweating horsemen i must put you into the hat  with great ceremony and a shower of company jokes that i did not follow an enormous ally sloper tophat was produced into which numbers and blanks were dropped and the whole was handed round to the riders by a private evidently the joker of c company  matthews gave me to understand that each company owned a cherished receptacle sometimes not a respectable one for the papers of the final drawing he was telling me how his company had once stolen the sacred article used by d company for this purpose and of the riot that followed when through the west door of the schools entered a fresh detachment of stripped men and the arena was flooded with another company  said matthews as we withdrew each company does trials their own way b company is all for teaching men how to cook and camp d company keeps em to horsework mostly we call d the circusriders and b the cooks they call us the gunners  an youve rejected me said the man who had done seatime pushing out before us the armys goin to the dogs  i stood in the corridor looking for burgard  come up to my room and have a smoke said matthews private of the imperial guard  we climbed two flights of stone stairs ere we reached an immense landing flanked with numbered doors  matthews pressed a springlatch and led me into a little cabinlike room the cot was a standing bunk with drawers beneath on the bed lay a brilliant blanket by the bed head was an electric light and a shelf of books a writing table stood in the window and i dropped into a low wicker chair  this is a cut above subalterns quarters i said surveying the photos the dhurri on the floor the rifle in its rack the fieldkit hung up behind the door and the knicknacks on the walls  the line bachelors use em while were away but theyre nice to come back to after heef matthews passed me his cigarettecase  where have you heefed i said  in scotland central australia and northeastern rhodesia and the north west indian front  whats your service  four years ill have to go in a year i got in when i was twentytwoby a flukefrom the militia directon trials  trials like those we just saw  not so severe there was less competition then i hoped to get my stripes but theres no chance  why  i havent the knack of handling men purvis let me have a halfcompany for a month in rhodesiaover towards lake ngarni i couldnt work em properly its a gift  do coloursergeants handle halfcompanies with you  they can command em on the heef weve only four company officers burgard luttrell kyd and harrison pigeons our swop and hes in charge of the ponies burgard got his company on the heef you see burgard had been a lieutenant in the line but he came into the guards on trials like the men he could command they tried him in india with a wing of the battalion for three months he did well so he got his company thats what made me hopeful but its a gift you seemanaging menand so im only a senior private they let ten per cent of us stay on for two years extra after our three are finishedto polish the others  arent you even a corporal  we havent corporals or lances for that matter in the guard as a senior private id take twenty men into action but one guard dont tell another how to clean himself youve learned that before you apply  come in  there was a knock at the door and burgard entered removing his cap  i thought youd be here he said as matthews vacated the other chair and sat on the bed well has matthews told you all about it how did our trials go matthews  forty names in the hat sir at the finish theyll make a fairish lot their guntricks werent bad but d company has taken the best horsemen as usual  oh ill attend to that on heef give me a man who can handle company guns and ill engage to make him a horsemaster d company will end by thinkin emselves captain pigeons private cavalry some day  i had never heard a private and a captain talking after this fashion and my face must have betrayed my astonishment for burgard said  these are not our parade manners in our rooms as we say in the guard all men are men outside we are officers and men  i begin to see i stammered matthews was telling me that sergeants handled halfcompanies and rose from the ranksand i dont see that there are any lieutenantsand your companies appear to be two hundred and fifty strong its a shade confusing to the layman  burgard leaned forward didactically the regulations lay down that every mans capacity for command must be tested to the uttermost we construe that very literally when were on the heef fr instance any man can apply to take the command next above him and if a mans too shy to ask his company officer must see that he gets his chance a sergeant is given a wing of the battalion to play with for three weeksa month or six weeksaccording to his capacity and turned adrift in an area to make his own arrangements thats what areas are forand to experiment in a good gunnera private very oftenhas all four companyguns to handle through a weeks fight acting for the time as the major majors of guard battalions verschoyles our major are supposed to be responsible for the guns by the way theres nothing to prevent any man who has the gift working his way up to the experimental command of the battalion on heef purvis my coloursergeant commanded the battalion for three months at the back of coolgardie an very well he did it bayley verted to company officer for the time being an took harrisons company and harrison came over to me as my coloursergeant dyou see well purvis is down for a commission when theres a vacancy hes been thoroughly tested and we all like him two other sergeants have passed that three months trial in the same way just as second mates go up for extra masters certificate they have ec after their names in the army list that shows theyre capable of taking command in event of war the result of our system is that you could knock out every single officer of a guard battalion early in the day and the wheels ud still go forward not merely round were allowed to fill up half our commissioned list from the ranks direct now dyou see why theres such a rush to get into a guard battalion  indeed i do have you commanded the regiment experimentally  oh time and again burgard laughed weve all had our ec turn  doesnt the chopping and changing upset the men  it takes something to upset the guard besides theyre all in the game together they give each other a fair show you may be sure  thats true said matthews when i went to ngami with mywith the halfcompany he sighed they helped me all they knew but its a gift handling men i found that out  i know you did said burgard softly but you found it out in time which is the great thing you see he turned to me with our limited strength we cant afford to have a single man who isnt more than up to any dutyin reason dont you be led away by what you saw at trials just now the volunteers and the militia have all the monkeytricks of the tradesuch as mounting and dismounting guns and making fancy scores and doing record marches but they need a lot of working up before they can pull their weight in the boat  there was a knock at the door a note was handed in burgard read it and smiled  bayley wants to know if youd care to come with us to the park and see the kids its only a saturday afternoon walkround before the taxpayer very good if youll press the button well try to do the rest  he led me by two flights of stairs up an iron stairway that gave on a platform not unlike a ships bridge immediately above the barrelled glass roof of the ridingschool through a ribbed ventilator i could see b company far below watching some men who chased sheep burgard unlocked a glassfronted firealarm arrangement flanked with dials and speaking tubes and bade me press the centre button  next moment i should have fallen through the ridingschool roof if he had not caught me for the huge building below my feet thrilled to the multiplied purring of electric bells the men in the school vanished like minnows before a shadow and above the stamp of booted feet on staircases i heard the neighing of many horses  what in the world have i done i gasped  turned out the guardhorse foot and guns  a telephone bell rang imperiously burgard snatched up the receiver  yes sir what sir i never heard they said that he laughed but it would be just like em in an hour and a half yes sir opposite the statue yes sir  he turned to me with a wink as he hung up  bayleys playing up for you now youll see some fun  whos going to catch it i demanded  only our local foreign service corps its co has been boasting that its en  tat de partir and bayleys going to take him at his word and have a kitinspection this afternoon in the park i must tell their drillhall look over yonder between that brewery chimney and the mansard roof  he readdressed himself to the telephone and i kept my eye on the building to the southward a blue peter climbed up to the top of the flagstaff that crowned it and blew out in the summer breeze a black stormcone followed  inspection for fs corps acknowledged sir said burgard down the telephone now wed better go to the ridingschool the battalion falls in there i have to change but youre free of the corps go anywhere ask anything in another ten minutes were off  i lingered for a little looking over the great city its huddle of houses and the great fringe of the park all framed between the open windows of this dialdotted eyrie  when i descended the halls and corridors were as hushed as they had been noisy and my feet echoed down the broad tiled staircases on the third floor matthews gaitered and armed overtook me smiling  i thought you might want a guide said he weve five minutes yet and piloted me to the sunsplashed gloom of the ridingschool three companies were in close order on the tan they moved out at a whistle and as i followed in their rear i was overtaken by pigeon on a rough black mare  wait a bit he said till the horses are all out of stables and come with us d company is the only one mounted just now we do it to amuse the taxpayer he explained above the noise of horses on the tan  where are the guns i asked as the mare lipped my coatcollar  gone ahead long ago they come out of their own door at the back of barracks we dont haul guns through traffic more than we can help if belinda breathes down your neck smack her shell be quiet in the streets she loves lookin into the shopwindows  the mounted company clattered through vaulted concrete corridors in the wake of the main body and filed out into the crowded streets  when i looked at the townsfolk on the pavement or in the doubledecked trams i saw that the bulk of them saluted not grudgingly or of necessity but in a lighthearted even flippant fashion  those are line and militia men said pigeon that old chap in the tophat by the lamppost is an exguardee thats why hes saluting in slowtime no theres no regulation governing these things but weve all fallen into the way of it somehow steady mare  i dont know whether i care about this aggressive militarism i began when the company halted and belinda almost knocked me down looking forward i saw the badged cuff of a policeman upraised at a crossing his back towards us  horrid aggressive aint we said pigeon with a chuckle when we moved on again and overtook the main body here i caught the strains of the band which pigeon told me did not accompany the battalion on heef but lived in barracks and made much money by playing at parties in town  if we want anything more than drums and fifes on heef we sing said pigeon singin helps the wind  i rejoiced to the marrow of my bones thus to be borne along on billows of surging music among magnificent men in sunlight through a crowded town whose people i could feel regarded us with comradeship affectionand more  by jove i said at last watching the eyes about us these people are looking us over as if we were horses  why not they know the game  the eyes on the pavement in the trams the cabs at the upper windows swept our lines back and forth with a weighed intensity of regard which at first seemed altogether new to me till i recalled just such eyes a thousand of them at manoeuvres in the channel when one crowded battleship drew past its sister at biscuittoss range then i stared at the ground overborne by those considering eyes  suddenly the music changed to the wail of the dead march in saul and once morewe were crossing a large squarethe regiment halted  damn said pigeon glancing behind him at the mounted company i believe they save up their saturday corpses on purpose  what is it i asked  a dead volunteer we must play him through again i looked forward and saw the top of a hearse followed by two mourningcoaches boring directly up the halted regiment which opened out company by company to let it through  but theyve got the whole blessed square to funeralise in i exclaimed why dont they go round  not so pigeon replied in this city its the volunteers perquisite to be played through by any corps he happens to meet on his way to the cemetery and they make the most of it youll see  i heard the order rest on your arms run before the poor little procession as the men opened out the driver pulled the black flanders beasts into a more than funeral crawl and in the first mourningcoach i saw the tearful face of a fat woman his mother doubtless a handkerchief pressed to one eye but the other rolling vigilantly alight with proper pride last came a knot of uniformed menprivates i took it of the dead ones corps  said a man in the crowd beside us to the girl on his arm there jenny thats what ill get if i ave the luck to meet em when my time comes  you an your luck she snapped ow can you talk such silly nonsense  played through by the guard he repeated slowly the undertaker oo could guarantee that mark you for all his customerswell ed monopolise the trade is all i can say see the horses passagin sideways  she done it a purpose said the woman with a sniff  an i only hope youll follow her example just as long as you think ill keep too  we reclosed when the funeral had left us twenty paces behind a small boy stuck his head out of a carriage and watched us jealously  amazing amazing i murmured is it regulation  no towncustom it varies a little in different cities but the people value being played through more than most things i imagine duddell the big ipswich manufacturerhes a quakertried to bring in a bill to suppress it as unchristian pigeon laughed  and  it cost him his seat next election you see were all in the game  we reached the park without further adventure and found the four company guns with their spike teams and single drivers waiting for us many people were gathered here and we were halted so far as i could see that they might talk with the men in the ranks the officers broke into groups  why on earth didnt you come along with me said boy bayley at my side i was expecting you  well i had a delicacy about brigading myself with a colonel at the head of his regiment so i stayed with the rear company and the horses its all too wonderful for any words whats going to happen next  ive handed over to verschoyle who will amuse and edify the school children while i take you round our kindergarten dont kill any one vee are you goin to charge em  old verschoyle hitched his big shoulder and nodded precisely as he used to do at school he was a boy of few words grown into a kindly taciturn man  now bayley slid his arm through mine and led me across a riding road towards a stretch of rough common singularly out of place in a park perhaps threequarters of a mile long and half as wide on the encircling rails leaned an almost unbroken line of men and womenthe women outnumbering the men i saw the guard battalion move up the road flanking the common and disappear behind the trees  as far as the eye could range through the mellow english haze the ground inside the railings was dotted with boys in and out of uniform armed and unarmed i saw squads here halfcompanies there then three companies in an open space wheeling with stately steps a knot of drums and fifes near the railings unconcernedly slashing their way across popular airs and a batch of gamins labouring through some extended attack destined to be swept aside by a corps crossing the ground at the double they broke out of furze bushes ducked over hollows and bunkers held or fell away from hillocks and rough sandbanks till the eye wearied of their busy legs  bayley took me through the railings and gravely returned the salute of a freckled twelveyearold near by  whats your corps said the colonel of that imperial guard battalion to that child  eighth district board school fourth standard sir we arent out today then with a twinkle i go to first camp next year  what are those boys yonderthat squad at the double  jewboys sir jewish voluntary schools sir  and that full company extending behind the three elms to the southwest  private dayschools sir i think judging distance sir  can you come with us  certainly sir  heres the raw material at the beginning of the process said bayley to me  we strolled on towards the strains of a bicycle built for two breathed jerkily into a mouthorgan by a slim maid of fourteen some dozen infants with clenched fists and earnest legs were swinging through the extension movements which that tune calls for a stunted hawthorn overhung the little group and from a branch a dirty white handkerchief flapped in the breeze the girl blushed scowled and wiped the mouthorgan on her sleeve as we came up  were all waiting for our big bruvvers piped up one bold person in blue breechesseven if he was a day  it keeps em quieter sir the maiden lisped the others are with the regiments  yeth and theyve all lots of blank for you said the gentleman in blue breeches ferociously  oh artie ush the girl cried  but why have they lots of blank for us bayley asked blue breeches stood firm  causecause the guards goin to fight the schools this afternoon but my big bruvver says theyll be damwell surprised  artie the girl leaped towards him you know your ma said i was to smack  dont please dont said bayley pink with suppressed mirth it was all my fault i must tell old verschoyle this ive surprised his plan out of the mouths of babes and sucklings  what plan  old vee has taken the battalion up to the top of the common and he told me he meant to charge down through the kids but theyre on to him already hell be scuppered the guard will be scuppered  here blue breeches overcome by the reproof of his fellows began to weep  i didnt tell he roared my big bruvver he knew when he saw them go up the road  never mind never mind old man said bayley soothingly im not fighting today its all right  he rightened it yet further with sixpence and left that band loudly at feud over the spoil  oh vee vee the strategist he chuckled well pull vees leg tonight  our freckled friend of the barriers doubled up behind us  so you know that my battalion is charging down the ground bayley demanded  not for certain sir but were preparin for the worst he answered with a cheerful grin they allow the schools a little blank ammunition after weve passed the third standard and we nearly always bring it on to the ground of saturdays  the deuce you do why  on account of these amateur volunteer corps sir theyre always experimentin upon us sir comin over from their ground an developin attacks on our flanks oh its chronic ere of a saturday sometimes unless you flag yourself  i followed his eye and saw white flags fluttering before a drum and fife band and a knot of youths in sweaters gathered round the dummy breech of a fourinch gun which they were feeding at express rates  the attacks dont interfere with you if you flag yourself sir the boy explained thats a second camp team from the technical schools loading against time for a bet  we picked our way deviously through the busy groups apparently it was not etiquette to notice a guard officer and the youths at the twentyfive pounder were far too busy to look up i watched the cleanly finished hoist and shovehome of the fullweight shell from a safe distance when i became aware of a change among the scattered boys on the common who disappeared among the hillocks to an accompaniment of querulous whistles a boy or two on bicycles dashed from corps to corps and on their arrival each corps seemed to fade away  the youths at loading practice did not pause for the growing hush round them nor did the drum and fife band drop a single note bayley exploded afresh the schools are preparing for our attack by jove i wonder whos directin em do you know  the warrior of the eighth district looked up shrewdly  i saw mr cameron speaking to mr levitt just as the guard went up the road es our eadmaster mr cameron but mr levitt of the sixth district is actin as senior officer on the ground this saturday most likely mr levitt is commandin  how many corps are there here i asked  oh bits of lots of emthirty or forty praps sir but the whistles says theyve all got to rally on the board schools ark theres the whistle for the private schools theyve been called up the ground at the double  stop cried a bearded man with a watch and the crews dropped beside the breech wiping their brows and panting  hullo theres some attack on the schools said one well marden you owe me three halfcrowns ive beaten your record pay up  the boy beside us tapped his foot fretfully as he eyed his companions melting among the hillocks but the gunteam adjusted their bets without once looking up  the ground rose a little to a furzecrowned ridge in the centre so that i could not see the full length of it but i heard a faint bubble of blank in the distance  the saturday allowance murmured bayley wars begun but it wouldnt be etiquette for us to interfere what are you saying my child  nothin sir onlyonly i dont think the guard will be able to come through on so narrer a front sir theyll all be jammed up beind the ridge if weve got there in time its awful sticky for guns at the end of our ground sir  im inclined to think youre right moltke the guard is hung up distinctly so old vee will have to cut his way through what a pernicious amount of blank the kids seem to have  it was quite a respectable roar of battle that rolled among the hillocks for ten minutes always out of our sight then we heard the cease fire over the ridge  theyve sent for the umpires the board school boy squeaked dancing on one foot youve been hung up sir ii thought the sandpits ud stop you  said one of the jerseyed hobbledehoys at the gun slipping on his coat well thats enough for this afternoon im off and moved to the railings without even glancing towards the fray  i anticipate the worst said bayley with gravity after a few minutes hullo here comes my disgraced corps  the guard was pouring over the ridgea disorderly mobhorse foot and guns mixed while from every hollow of the ground about rose small boys cheering shrilly the outcry was taken up by the parents at the railings and spread to a complete circle of cheers handclappings and waved handkerchiefs  our eighth district private cast away restraint and openly capered we got em we got em he squealed  the greygreen flood paused a fraction of a minute and drew itself into shape coming to rest before bayley verschoyle saluted  vee vee said bayley give me back my legions well i hope youre proud of yourself  the little beasts were ready for us deuced well posted too verschoyle replied i wish youd seen that first attack on our flank rather impressive who warned em  i dont know i got my information from a baby in blue plush breeches did they do well  very decently indeed ive complimented their co and buttered the whole boiling he lowered his voice as a matter o fact i halted five good minutes to give em time to get into position  well now we can inspect our foreign service corps we shant need the men for an hour vee  very good sir coloursergeants cried verschoyle raising his voice and the cry ran from company to company whereupon the officers left their men people began to climb over the railings and the regiment dissolved among the spectators and the school corps of the city  no sense keeping men standing when you dont need em said bayley besides the schools learn more from our chaps in an afternoon than they can pick up in a months drill look at those boardschoolmaster captains buttonholing old purvis on the art of war  wonder what the evening papersll say about this said pigeon  youll know in half an hour burgard laughed what possessed you to take your ponies across the sandpits pij  pride silly pride said the canadian  we crossed the common to a very regulation paradeground overlooked by a statue of our queen here were carriages many and elegant filled with pretty women and the railings were lined with frockcoats and top hats this is distinctly social i suggested to kyd  raather our fs corps is nothing if not correct but bayleyll sweat em all the same  i saw six companies drawn up for inspection behind lines of long sausage shaped kitbags a band welcomed us with a life on the ocean wave  what cheek muttered verschoyle give em beans bayley  i intend to said the colonel grimly will each of you fellows take a company please and inspect em faithfully en état de partir is their little boast remember when youve finished you can give em a little pillowfighting  what does the single cannon on those mens sleeves mean i asked  that theyre big gunmen whove done time with the fleet bayley returned any fs corps that has over twenty per cent biggun men thinks itself entitled to play a life on the ocean wavewhen its out of hearing of the navy  what beautiful stuff they are whats their regimental average  it ought to be five eight height thirtyeight chest and twentyfour years age what is it bayley asked of a private  five nine and half sir thirtynine twentyfour and a half was the reply and he added insolently en  tat de partir evidently that fs corps was on its mettle ready for the worst  what about their musketry average i went on  not my pidgin said bayley but they wouldnt be in the corps a day if they couldnt shoot i know that much now im going to go through em for socks and slippers  the kitinspection exceeded anything i had ever dreamed i drifted from company to company while the guard officers oppressed them twenty per cent at least of the kits were shovelled out on the grass and gone through in detail  what have they got jumpers and ducks for i asked of harrison  for fleet work of course en  tat de partir with an f s corps means they are amphibious  who gives em their kitgovernment  there is a government allowance but no c o sticks to it its the same as paint and goldleaf in the navy it comes out of some ones pockets how much does your kit cost youthis to the private in front of us  about ten or fifteen quid every other year i suppose was the answer  very good pack your bagquick  the man knelt and with supremely deft hands returned all to the bag lashed and tied it and fell back  arms said harrison strip and show ammunition  the man divested himself of his rolled greatcoat and haversack with one wriggle as it seemed to me a twist of a screw removed the side plate of the rifle breech it was not a bolt action he handed it to harrison with one hand and with the other loosed his clipstudded belt  what baby cartridges i exclaimed no bigger than bulletted breech caps  theyre the regulation 256 said harrison no one has complained of em yet they expand a bit when they arrive empty your bottle please and show your rations  the man poured out his waterbottle and showed the twoinch emergency tin  harrison passed on to the next but i was fascinated by the way in which the man reestablished himself amid his straps and buckles asking no help from either side  how long does it take you to prepare for inspection i asked him  well i got ready this afternoon in twelve minutes he smiled i didnt see the stormcone till halfpast three i was at the club  werent a good many of you out of town  not this saturday we knew what was coming you see if we pull through the inspection we may move up one place on the roster for foreign service youd better stand back were going to pillowfight  the companies stooped to the stuffed kitbags doubled with them variously piled them in squares and mounds passed them from shoulder to shoulder like buckets at a fire and repeated the evolution  whats the idea i asked of verschoyle who arms folded behind him was controlling the display many women had descended from the carriages and were pressing in about us admiringly  for one thing its a fair test of wind and muscle and for another it saves time at the docks well suppose this first company to be drawn up on the dockhead and those five others still in the trooptrain how would you get their kit into the ship  fall em all in on the platform marchem to the gangways i answered and trust to heaven and a fatigue party to gather the baggage and drunks in later  yees and have half of it sent by the wrong trooper i know that game verschoyle drawled we dont play it any more look  he raised his voice and five companies glistening a little and breathing hard formed at right angles to the sixth each man embracing his sixty pound bag  pack away cried verschoyle and the great beanbag game i can compare it to nothing else began in five minutes every bag was passed along either arm of the t and forward down the sixth company who passed stacked and piled them in a great heap these were followed by the rifles belts greatcoats and knapsacks so that in another five minutes the regiment stood as it were stripped clean  of course on a trooper thered be a company below stacking the kit away said verschoyle but that wasnt so bad  bad i cried it was miraculous  circusworkall circuswork said pigeon it wont prevent em bein sick as dogs when the ship rolls the crowd round us applauded while the men looked meekly down their selfconscious noses  a little greywhiskered man trotted up to the boy  have we made good bayley he said are we en  tat de partir  thats what i shall report said bayley smiling  i thought my bit o french ud draw you said the little man rubbing his hands  who is he i whispered to pigeon  ramsaytheir co an old guard captain a keen little devil they say he spends six hundred a year on the show he used to be in the lincolns till he came into his property  take em home an make em drunk i heard bayley say i suppose youll have a dinner to celebrate but you may as well tell the officers of e company that i dont think much of them i shant report it but their men were all over the shop  well theyre young you see colonel ramsay began  youre quite right send em to me and ill talk to em youth is the time to learn  six hundred a year i repeated to pigeon that must be an awful tax on a man worse than in the old volunteering days  thats where you make your mistake said verschoyle in the old days a man had to spend his money to coax his men to drill because they werent the genuine article you know what i mean they made a favour of putting in drills didnt they and they were most of em the children we have to take over at second camp werent they well now that a c o is sure of his men now that he hasnt to waste himself in conciliating an bribin an beerin kids he doesnt care what he spends on his corps because every pound tells do you understand  i see what you mean vee having the male material guaranteed  and trained material at that pigeon put in eight years in the schools remember as well as  precisely a man rejoices in working them up thats as it should be i said  baylys saying the very same to those f s pups said verschoyle  the boy was behind us between two young f s officers a hand on the shoulder of each  yes thats all doocid interesting he growled paternally but you forget my sons now that your men are bound to serve youre trebly bound to put a polish on em youve let your company simply go to seed dont try and explain ive told all those lies myself in my time its only idleness i know come and lunch with me tomorrow and ill give you a wrinkle or two in barracks he turned to me  suppose we pick up vees defeated legion and go home youll dine with us tonight goodbye ramsay yes youre en état de partir right enough youd better get lady gertrude to talk to the armity if you want the corps sent foreign im no politician  we strolled away from the great white statue of the widow with sceptre orb and crown that looked toward the city and regained the common where the guard battalion walked with the female of its species and the children of all its relatives at sight of the officers the uniforms began to detach themselves and gather in companies a board school corps was moving off the ground headed by its drums and fifes which it assisted with song as we drew nearer we caught the words for they were launched with intention    oo is it mashes the country nurse     the guardsman   oo is it takes the lydys purse     the guardsman   calls for a drink and a mild cigar   batters a sovereign down on the bar   collars the change and says tata     the guardsman  why thats one of old jemmy fawnes songs i havent heard it in ages i began  little devils said pigeon speshul extra speshul sports edition a newsboy cried ere yare captain defeat o the guard  ill buy a copy said the boy as pigeon blushed wrathfully i must to see how the dove lost his mounted company he unfolded the flapping sheet and we crowded round it  complete rout of the guard he read too narrow a front thats one for you vee attack anticipated by mr levitt b a aha the schools stand fast  heres another version said kyd waving a tinted sheet to your tents o israel the hebrew schools stop the mounted troops pij were you scuppered by jewboys  umpires decide all four guns lost bayley went on by jove therell have to be an inquiry into this regrettable incident vee  ill never try to amuse the kids again said the baited verschoyle children and newspapers are low things and i was hit on the nose by a wad too they oughtnt to be allowed blank ammunition  so we leaned against the railings in the warm twilight haze while the battalion silently as a shadow formed up behind us ready to be taken over the heat the hum of the great city as it might have been the hum of a camped army the creaking of the belts and the wellknown faces bent above them brought back to me the memory of another evening years ago when verschoyle and i waited for news of guns missing in no sham fight  a regular sannas post isnt it i said at last dyou remember vee by the marketsquarethat night when the wagons went out  then it came upon me with no horror but a certain mild wonder that we had waited vee and i that night for the body of boy bayley and that vee himself had died of typhoid in the spring of 1902 the rustling of the papers continued but bayley shifting slightly revealed to me the three day old wound on his left side that had soaked the ground about him i saw pigeon fling up a helpless arm as to guard himself against a spatter of shrapnel and luttrell with a foolish tightlipped smile lurched over all in one jointless piece only old vees honest face held steady for awhile against the darkness that had swallowed up the battalion behind us then his jaw dropped and the face stiffened so that a fly made bold to explore the puffed and scornful nostril                                       i waked brushing a fly from my nose and saw the club waiter set out the evening papers on the table     they   the return of the children    neither the harps nor the crowns amused nor the cherubs dovewinged      races   holding hands forlornly the children wandered beneath the dome   plucking the radiant robes of the passers by and with pitiful faces   begging what princes and powers refusedah please will you let us      go home    over the jewelled floor nigh weeping ran to them mary the mother   kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses and drew them along      to the gateway   yea the alliron unbribable door which peter must guard and none other   straightway she took the keys from his keeping and opened and freed      them straightway    then to her son who had seen and smiled she said on the night that      i bore thee   what didst thou care for a love beyond mine or a heaven that was not my      arm   didst thou push from the nipple o child to hear the angels adore thee   when we two lay in the breath of the kine and he saidthou hast      done no harm    so through the void the children ran homeward merrily hand in hand   looking neither to left nor right where the breathless heavens stood      still   and the guards of the void resheathed their swords for they heard the      command   shall i that have suffered the children to come to me hold them against      their will   they one view called me to another one hill top to its fellow half across the county and since i could answer at no more trouble than the snapping forward of a lever i let the country flow under my wheels the orchid studded flats of the east gave way to the thyme ilex and grey grass of the downs these again to the rich cornland and figtrees of the lower coast where you carry the beat of the tide on your left hand for fifteen level miles and when at last i turned inland through a huddle of rounded hills and woods i had run myself clean out of my known marks beyond that precise hamlet which stands godmother to the capital of the united states i found hidden villages where bees the only things awake boomed in eightyfoot lindens that overhung grey norman churches miraculous brooks diving under stone bridges built for heavier traffic than would ever vex them again tithebarns larger than their churches and an old smithy that cried out aloud how it had once been a hall of the knights of the temple gipsies i found on a common where the gorse bracken and heath fought it out together up a mile of roman road and a little farther on i disturbed a red fox rolling dogfashion in the naked sunlight  as the wooded hills closed about me i stood up in the car to take the bearings of that great down whose ringed head is a landmark for fifty miles across the low countries i judged that the lie of the country would bring me across some westward running road that went to his feet but i did not allow for the confusing veils of the woods a quick turn plunged me first into a green cutting brimful of liquid sunshine next into a gloomy tunnel where last years dead leaves whispered and scuffled about my tyres the strong hazel stuff meeting overhead had not been cut for a couple of generations at least nor had any axe helped the mosscankered oak and beech to spring above them here the road changed frankly into a carpetted ride on whose brown velvet spent primroseclumps showed like jade and a few sickly whitestalked bluebells nodded together as the slope favoured i shut off the power and slid over the whirled leaves expecting every moment to meet a keeper but i only heard a jay far off arguing against the silence under the twilight of the trees  still the track descended i was on the point of reversing and working my way back on the second speed ere i ended in some swamp when i saw sunshine through the tangle ahead and lifted the brake  it was down again at once as the light beat across my face my forewheels took the turf of a great still lawn from which sprang horsemen ten feet high with levelled lances monstrous peacocks and sleek roundheaded maids of honourblue black and glisteningall of clipped yew across the lawnthe marshalled woods besieged it on three sidesstood an ancient house of lichened and weatherworn stone with mullioned windows and roofs of rosered tile it was flanked by semicircular walls also rosered that closed the lawn on the fourth side and at their feet a box hedge grew manhigh there were doves on the roof about the slim brick chimneys and i caught a glimpse of an octagonal dovehouse behind the screening wall  here then i stayed a horsemans green spear laid at my breast held by the exceeding beauty of that jewel in that setting  if i am not packed off for a trespasser or if this knight does not ride a wallop at me thought i shakespeare and queen elizabeth at least must come out of that halfopen garden door and ask me to tea  a child appeared at an upper window and i thought the little thing waved a friendly hand but it was to call a companion for presently another bright head showed then i heard a laugh among the yewpeacocks and turning to make sure till then i had been watching the house only i saw the silver of a fountain behind a hedge thrown up against the sun the doves on the roof cooed to the cooing water but between the two notes i caught the utterly happy chuckle of a child absorbed in some light mischief  the garden doorheavy oak sunk deep in the thickness of the wallopened further a woman in a big garden hat set her foot slowly on the time hollowed stone step and as slowly walked across the turf i was forming some apology when she lifted up her head and i saw that she was blind  i heard you she said isnt that a motor car  im afraid ive made a mistake in my road i should have turned off up abovei never dreamedi began  but im very glad fancy a motor car coming into the garden it will be such a treat she turned and made as though looking about her you you havent seen any one have youperhaps  no one to speak to but the children seemed interested at a distance  which  i saw a couple up at the window just now and i think i heard a little chap in the grounds  oh lucky you she cried and her face brightened i hear them of course but thats all youve seen them and heard them  yes i answered and if i know anything of children one of thems having a beautiful time by the fountain yonder escaped i should imagine  youre fond of children  i gave her one or two reasons why i did not altogether hate them  of course of course she said then you understand then you wont think it foolish if i ask you to take your car through the gardens once or twicequite slowly im sure theyd like to see it they see so little poor things one tries to make their life pleasant but she threw out her hands towards the woods were so out of the world here  that will be splendid i said but i cant cut up your grass  she faced to the right wait a minute she said were at the south gate arent we behind those peacocks theres a flagged path we call it the peacocks walk you cant see it from here they tell me but if you squeeze along by the edge of the wood you can turn at the first peacock and get on to the flags  it was sacrilege to wake that dreaming housefront with the clatter of machinery but i swung the car to clear the turf brushed along the edge of the wood and turned in on the broad stone path where the fountainbasin lay like one starsapphire  may i come too she cried no please dont help me theyll like it better if they see me  she felt her way lightly to the front of the car and with one foot on the step she called children oh children look and see whats going to happen  the voice would have drawn lost souls from the pit for the yearning that underlay its sweetness and i was not surprised to hear an answering shout behind the yews it must have been the child by the fountain but he fled at our approach leaving a little toy boat in the water i saw the glint of his blue blouse among the still horsemen  very disposedly we paraded the length of the walk and at her request backed again this time the child had got the better of his panic but stood far off and doubting  the little fellows watching us i said i wonder if hed like a ride  theyre very shy still very shy but oh lucky you to be able to see them lets listen  i stopped the machine at once and the humid stillness heavy with the scent of box cloaked us deep shears i could hear where some gardener was clipping a mumble of bees and broken voices that might have been the doves  oh unkind she said weariedly  perhaps theyre only shy of the motor the little maid at the window looks tremendously interested  yes she raised her head it was wrong of me to say that they are really fond of me its the only thing that makes life worth livingwhen theyre fond of you isnt it i darent think what the place would be without them by the way is it beautiful  i think it is the most beautiful place i have ever seen  so they all tell me i can feel it of course but that isnt quite the same thing  then have you never i began but stopped abashed  not since i can remember it happened when i was only a few months old they tell me and yet i must remember something else how could i dream about colours i see light in my dreams and colours but i never see them i only hear them just as i do when im awake  its difficult to see faces in dreams some people can but most of us havent the gift i went on looking up at the window where the child stood all but hidden  ive heard that too she said and they tell me that one never sees a dead persons face in a dream is that true  i believe it isnow i come to think of it  but how is it with yourselfyourself the blind eyes turned towards me  i have never seen the faces of my dead in any dream i answered  then it must be as bad as being blind  the sun had dipped behind the woods and the long shades were possessing the insolent horsemen one by one i saw the light die from off the top of a glossyleaved lance and all the brave hard green turn to soft black the house accepting another day at end as it had accepted an hundred thousand gone seemed to settle deeper into its rest among the shadows  have you ever wanted to she said after the silence  very much sometimes i replied the child had left the window as the shadows closed upon it  ah sove i but i dont suppose its allowed  where dyou live  quite the other side of the countysixty miles and more and i must be going back ive come without my big lamp  but its not dark yet i can feel it  im afraid it will be by the time i get home could you lend me someone to set me on my road at first ive utterly lost myself  ill send madden with you to the crossroads we are so out of the world i dont wonder you were lost ill guide you round to the front of the house but you will go slowly wont you till youre out of the grounds it isnt foolish do you think  i promise you ill go like this i said and let the car start herself down the flagged path  we skirted the left wing of the house whose elaborately cast lead guttering alone was worth a days journey passed under a great rosegrown gate in the red wall and so round to the high front of the house which in beauty and stateliness as much excelled the back as that all others i had seen  is it so very beautiful she said wistfully when she heard my raptures and you like the leadfigures too theres the old azalea garden behind they say that this place must have been made for children will you help me out please i should like to come with you as far as the crossroads but i mustnt leave them is that you madden i want you to show this gentleman the way to the crossroads he has lost his way buthe has seen them  a butler appeared noiselessly at the miracle of old oak that must be called the front door and slipped aside to put on his hat she stood looking at me with open blue eyes in which no sight lay and i saw for the first time that she was beautiful  remember she said quietly if you are fond of them you will come again and disappeared within the house  the butler in the car said nothing till we were nearly at the lodge gates where catching a glimpse of a blue blouse in a shrubbery i swerved amply lest the devil that leads little boys to play should drag me into child murder  excuse me he asked of a sudden but why did you do that sir  the child yonder  our young gentleman in blue  of course  he runs about a good deal did you see him by the fountain sir  oh yes several times do we turn here  yes sir and did you appen to see them upstairs too  at the upper window yes  was that before the mistress come out to speak to you sir  a little before that why dyou want to know  he paused a little only to make sure thatthat they had seen the car sir because with children running about though im sure youre driving particularly careful there might be an accident that was all sir here are the crossroads you cant miss your way from now on thank you sir but that isnt our custom not with  i beg your pardon i said and thrust away the british silver  oh its quite right with the rest of em as a rule goodbye sir  he retired into the armourplated conning tower of his caste and walked away evidently a butler solicitous for the honour of his house and interested probably through a maid in the nursery  once beyond the signposts at the crossroads i looked back but the crumpled hills interlaced so jealously that i could not see where the house had lain when i asked its name at a cottage along the road the fat woman who sold sweetmeats there gave me to understand that people with motor cars had small right to livemuch less to go about talking like carriage folk they were not a pleasantmannered community  when i retraced my route on the map that evening i was little wiser hawkins old farm appeared to be the survey title of the place and the old county gazetteer generally so ample did not allude to it the big house of those parts was hodnington hall georgian with early victorian embellishments as an atrocious steel engraving attested i carried my difficulty to a neighboura deeprooted tree of that soiland he gave me a name of a family which conveyed no meaning  a month or so lateri went again or it may have been that my car took the road of her own volition she overran the fruitless downs threaded every turn of the maze of lanes below the hills drew through the high walled woods impenetrable in their full leaf came out at the cross roads where the butler had left me and a little further on developed an internal trouble which forced me to turn her in on a grass waywaste that cut into a summersilent hazel wood so far as i could make sure by the sun and a sixinch ordnance map this should be the road flank of that wood which i had first explored from the heights above i made a mighty serious business of my repairs and a glittering shop of my repair kit spanners pump and the like which i spread out orderly upon a rug it was a trap to catch all childhood for on such a day i argued the children would not be far off when i paused in my work i listened but the wood was so full of the noises of summer though the birds had mated that i could not at first distinguish these from the tread of small cautious feet stealing across the dead leaves i rang my bell in an alluring manner but the feet fled and i repented for to a child a sudden noise is very real terror i must have been at work half an hour when i heard in the wood the voice of the blind woman crying children oh children where are you and the stillness made slow to close on the perfection of that cry she came towards me half feeling her way between the tree boles and though a child it seemed clung to her skirt it swerved into the leafage like a rabbit as she drew nearer  is that you she said from the other side of the county  yes its me from the other side of the county  then why didnt you come through the upper woods they were there just now  they were here a few minutes ago i expect they knew my car had broken down and came to see the fun  nothing serious i hope how do cars break down  in fifty different ways only mine has chosen the fifty first  she laughed merrily at the tiny joke cooed with delicious laughter and pushed her hat back  let me hear she said  wait a moment i cried and ill get you a cushion  she set her foot on the rug all covered with spare parts and stooped above it eagerly what delightful things the hands through which she saw glanced in the chequered sunlight a box hereanother box why youve arranged them like playing shop  i confess now that i put it out to attract them i dont need half those things really  how nice of you i heard your bell in the upper wood you say they were here before that  im sure of it why are they so shy that little fellow in blue who was with you just now ought to have got over his fright hes been watching me like a red indian  it must have been your bell she said i heard one of them go past me in trouble when i was coming down theyre shyso shy even with me she turned her face over her shoulder and cried again children oh children look and see  they must have gone off together on their own affairs  i suggested for there was a murmur behind us of lowered voices broken by the sudden squeaking giggles of childhood i returned to my tinkerings and she leaned forward her chin on her hand listening interestedly  how many are they i said at last the work was finished but i saw no reason to go  her forehead puckered a little in thought i dont quite know she said simply sometimes moresometimes less they come and stay with me because i love them you see  that must be very jolly i said replacing a drawer and as i spoke i heard the inanity of my answer  youyou arent laughing at me she cried ii havent any of my own i never married people laugh at me sometimes about them because because  because theyre savages i returned its nothing to fret for that sort laugh at everything that isnt in their own fat lives  i dont know how should i i only dont like being laughed at about them it hurts and when one cant see i dont want to seem silly her chin quivered like a childs as she spoke but we blindies have only one skin i think everything outside hits straight at our souls its different with you youve such good defences in your eyeslooking out before anyone can really pain you in your soul people forget that with us  i was silent reviewing that inexhaustible matterthe more than inherited since it is also carefully taught brutality of the christian peoples beside which the mere heathendom of the west coast nigger is clean and restrained it led me a long distance into myself  dont do that she said of a sudden putting her hands before her eyes  what  she made a gesture with her hand  that itsits all purple and black dont that colour hurts  but how in the world do you know about colours i exclaimed for here was a revelation indeed  colours as colours she asked  no those colours which you saw just now  you know as well as i do she laughed else you wouldnt have asked that question they arent in the world at all theyre in youwhen you went so angry  dyou mean a dull purplish patch like portwine mixed with ink i said  ive never seen ink or portwine but the colours arent mixed they are separateall separate  do you mean black streaks and jags across the purple  she nodded yesif they are like this and zigzagged her finger again but its more red than purplethat bad colour  and what are the colours at the top of thewhatever you see  slowly she leaned forward and traced on the rug the figure of the egg itself  i see them so she said pointing with a grass stem white green yellow red purple and when people are angry or bad black across the redas you were just now  who told you anything about itin the beginning i demanded  about the colours no one i used to ask what colours were when i was littlein tablecovers and curtains and carpets you seebecause some colours hurt me and some made me happy people told me and when i got older that was how i saw people again she traced the outline of the egg which it is given to very few of us to see  all by yourself i repeated  all by myself there wasnt anyone else i only found out afterwards that other people did not see the colours  she leaned against the treehole plaiting and unplaiting chanceplucked grass stems the children in the wood had drawn nearer i could see them with the tail of my eye frolicking like squirrels  now i am sure you will never laugh at me she went on after a long silence nor at them  goodness no i cried jolted out of my train of thought a man who laughs at a childunless the child is laughing toois a heathen  i didnt mean that of course youd never laugh at children but i thoughti used to thinkthat perhaps you might laugh about them so now i beg your pardon what are you going to laugh at  i had made no sound but she knew  at the notion of your begging my pardon if you had done your duty as a pillar of the state and a landed proprietress you ought to have summoned me for trespass when i barged through your woods the other day it was disgraceful of meinexcusable  she looked at me her head against the tree trunklong and steadfastly this woman who could see the naked soul  how curious she half whispered how very curious  why what have i done  you dont understand  and yet you understood about the colours dont you understand  she spoke with a passion that nothing had justified and i faced her bewilderedly as she rose the children had gathered themselves in a roundel behind a bramble bush one sleek head bent over something smaller and the set of the little shoulders told me that fingers were on lips they too had some childs tremendous secret i alone was hopelessly astray there in the broad sunlight  no i said and shook my head as though the dead eyes could note whatever it is i dont understand yet perhaps i shall laterif youll let me come again  you will come again she answered you will surely come again and walk in the wood  perhaps the children will know me well enough by that time to let me play with themas a favour you know what children are like  it isnt a matter of favour but of right she replied and while i wondered what she meant a dishevelled woman plunged round the bend of the road loosehaired purple almost lowing with agony as she ran it was my rude fat friend of the sweetmeat shop the blind woman heard and stepped forward what is it mrs madehurst she asked  the woman flung her apron over her head and literally grovelled in the dust crying that her grandchild was sick to death that the local doctor was away fishing that jenny the mother was at her wits end and so forth with repetitions and bellowings  wheres the next nearest doctor i asked between paroxysms  madden will tell you go round to the house and take him with you ill attend to this be quick she halfsupported the fat woman into the shade in two minutes i was blowing all the horns of jericho under the front of the house beautiful and madden in the pantry rose to the crisis like a butler and a man  a quarter of an hour at illegal speeds caught us a doctor five miles away within the halfhour we had decanted him much interested in motors at the door of the sweetmeat shop and drew up the road to await the verdict  useful things cars said madden all man and no butler if id had one when mine took sick she wouldnt have died  how was it i asked  croup mrs madden was away no one knew what to do i drove eight miles in a tax cart for the doctor she was choked when we came back this car d ha saved her shed have been close on ten now  im sorry i said i thought you were rather fond of children from what you told me going to the crossroads the other day  have you seen em again sirthis mornin  yes but theyre well broke to cars i couldnt get any of them within twenty yards of it  he looked at me carefully as a scout considers a strangernot as a menial should lift his eyes to his divinely appointed superior  i wonder why he said just above the breath that he drew  we waited on a light wind from the sea wandered up and down the long lines of the woods and the wayside grasses whitened already with summer dust rose and bowed in sallow waves  a woman wiping the suds off her arms came out of the cottage next the sweetmeat shop  ive ben listenin in de backyard she said cheerily he says arthurs unaccountable bad did ye hear him shruck just now unaccountable bad i reckon twill come jennys turn to walk in de wood nex week along mr madden  excuse me sir but your laprobe is slipping said madden deferentially the woman started dropped a curtsey and hurried away  what does she mean by walking in the wood i asked  it must be some saying they use hereabouts im from norfolk myself said madden theyre an independent lot in this county she took you for a chauffeur sir  i saw the doctor come out of the cottage followed by a draggletailed wench who clung to his arm as though he could make treaty for her with death dat sort she waileddeyre just as much to us dat has em as if dey was lawful born just as muchjust as much an god hed be just as pleased if you saved un doctor dont take it from me miss florence will tell ye de very same dont leave im doctor  i know i know said the man but hell be quiet for a while now well get the nurse and the medicine as fast as we can he signalled me to come forward with the car and i strove not to be privy to what followed but i saw the girls face blotched and frozen with grief and i felt the hand without a ring clutching at my knees when we moved away  the doctor was a man of some humour for i remember he claimed my car under the oath of Æsculapius and used it and me without mercy first we convoyed mrs madehurst and the blind woman to wait by the sick bed till the nurse should come next we invaded a neat county town for prescriptions the doctor said the trouble was cerebrospinal meningitis and when the county institute banked and flanked with scared market cattle reported itself out of nurses for the moment we literally flung ourselves loose upon the county we conferred with the owners of great housesmagnates at the ends of overarching avenues whose bigboned womenfolk strode away from their teatables to listen to the imperious doctor at last a whitehaired lady sitting under a cedar of lebanon and surrounded by a court of magnificent borzoisall hostile to motorsgave the doctor who received them as from a princess written orders which we bore many miles at top speed through a park to a french nunnery where we took over in exchange a pallidfaced and trembling sister she knelt at the bottom of the tonneau telling her beads without pause till by short cuts of the doctors invention we had her to the sweetmeat shop once more it was a long afternoon crowded with mad episodes that rose and dissolved like the dust of our wheels crosssections of remote and incomprehensible lives through which we raced at right angles and i went home in the dusk wearied out to dream of the clashing horns of cattle roundeyed nuns walking in a garden of graves pleasant teaparties beneath shaded trees the carbolicscented greypainted corridors of the county institute the steps of shy children in the wood and the hands that clung to my knees as the motor began to move                                i had intended to return in a day or two but it pleased fate to hold me from that side of the county on many pretexts till the elder and the wild rose had fruited there came at last a brilliant day swept clear from the southwest that brought the hills within hands reacha day of unstable airs and high filmy clouds through no merit of my own i was free and set the car for the third time on that known road as i reached the crest of the downs i felt the soft air change saw it glaze under the sun and looking down at the sea in that instant beheld the blue of the channel turn through polished silver and dulled steel to dingy pewter a laden collier hugging the coast steered outward for deeper water and across coppercoloured haze i saw sails rise one by one on the anchored fishingfleet in a deep dene behind me an eddy of sudden wind drummed through sheltered oaks and spun aloft the first day sample of autumn leaves when i reached the beach road the seafog fumed over the brickfields and the tide was telling all the groins of the gale beyond ushant in less than an hour summer england vanished in chill grey we were again the shut island of the north all the ships of the world bellowing at our perilous gates and between their outcries ran the piping of bewildered gulls my cap dripped moisture the folds of the rug held it in pools or sluiced it away in runnels and the saltrime stuck to my lips  inland the smell of autumn loaded the thickened fog among the trees and the drip became a continuous shower yet the late flowersmallow of the wayside scabious of the field and dahlia of the gardenshowed gay in the mist and beyond the seas breath there was little sign of decay in the leaf yet in the villages the house doors were all open and bare legged bareheaded children sat at ease on the damp doorsteps to shout pippip at the stranger  i made bold to call at the sweetmeat shop where mrs madehurst met me with a fat womans hospitable tears jennys child she said had died two days after the nun had come it was she felt best out of the way even though insurance offices for reasons which she did not pretend to follow would not willingly insure such stray lives not but what jenny didnt tend to arthur as though hed come all proper at de end of de first year like jenny herself thanks to miss florence the child had been buried with a pomp which in mrs madehursts opinion more than covered the small irregularity of its birth she described the coffin within and without the glass hearse and the evergreen lining of the grave  but hows the mother i asked  jenny oh shell get over it ive felt dat way with one or two o my own shell get over shes walkin in de wood now  in this weather  mrs madehurst looked at me with narrowed eyes across the counter  i dunno but it opens de eart like yes it opens de eart dats where losin and bearin comes so alike in de long run we do say  now the wisdom of the old wives is greater than that of all the fathers and this last oracle sent me thinking so extendedly as i went up the road that i nearly ran over a woman and a child at the wooded corner by the lodge gates of the house beautiful  awful weather i cried as i slowed dead for the turn  not so bad she answered placidly out of the fog mines used to un youll find yours indoors i reckon  indoors madden received me with professional courtesy and kind inquiries for the health of the motor which he would put under cover  i waited in a still nutbrown hall pleasant with late flowers and warmed with a delicious wood firea place of good influence and great peace men and women may sometimes after great effort achieve a creditable lie but the house which is their temple cannot say anything save the truth of those who have lived in it a childs cart and a doll lay on the blackandwhite floor where a rug had been kicked back i felt that the children had only just hurried awayto hide themselves most likein the many turns of the great adzed staircase that climbed statelily out of the hall or to crouch at gaze behind the lions and roses of the carven gallery above then i heard her voice above me singing as the blind sing from the soul     in the pleasant orchardcloses  and all my early summer came back at the call    in the pleasant orchardcloses   god bless all our gains say we   but may god bless all our losses   better suits with our degree  she dropped the marring fifth line and repeated    better suits with our degree  i saw her lean over the gallery her linked hands white as pearl against the oak  is that youfrom the other side of the county she called  yes mefrom the other side of the county i answered laughing  what a long time before you had to come here again she ran down the stairs one hand lightly touching the broad rail its two months and four days summers gone  i meant to come before but fate prevented  i knew it please do something to that fire they wont let me play with it but i can feel its behaving badly hit it  i looked on either side of the deep fireplace and found but a halfcharred hedgestake with which i punched a black log into flame  it never goes out day or night she said as though explaining in case any one conies in with cold toes you see  its even lovelier inside than it was out i murmured the red light poured itself along the agepolished dusky panels till the tudor roses and lions of the gallery took colour and motion an old eagletopped convex mirror gathered the picture into its mysterious heart distorting afresh the distorted shadows and curving the gallery lines into the curves of a ship the day was shutting down in half a gale as the fog turned to stringy scud through the uncurtained mullions of the broad window i could see valiant horsemen of the lawn rear and recover against the wind that taunted them with legions of dead leaves yes it must be beautiful she said would you like to go over it theres still light enough upstairs  i followed her up the unflinching wagonwide staircase to the gallery whence opened the thin fluted elizabethan doors  feel how they put the latch low down for the sake of the children she swung a light door inward  by the way where are they i asked i havent even heard them today  she did not answer at once then i can only hear them she replied softly this is one of their roomseverything ready you see  she pointed into a heavilytimbered room there were little low gate tables and childrens chairs a dolls house its hooked front half open faced a great dappled rockinghorse from whose padded saddle it was but a childs scramble to the broad windowseat overlooking the lawn a toy gun lay in a corner beside a gilt wooden cannon  surely theyve only just gone i whispered in the failing light a door creaked cautiously i heard the rustle of a frock and the patter of feet quick feet through a room beyond  i heard that she cried triumphantly did you children o children where are you  the voice filled the walls that held it lovingly to the last perfect note but there came no answering shout such as i had heard in the garden we hurried on from room to oakfloored room up a step here down three steps there among a maze of passages always mocked by our quarry one might as well have tried to work an unstopped warren with a single ferret there were boltholes innumerablerecesses in walls embrasures of deep slitten windows now darkened whence they could start up behind us and abandoned fireplaces six feet deep in the masonry as well as the tangle of communicating doors above all they had the twilight for their helper in our game i had caught one or two joyous chuckles of evasion and once or twice had seen the silhouette of a childs frock against some darkening window at the end of a passage but we returned emptyhanded to the gallery just as a middleaged woman was setting a lamp in its niche  no i havent seen her either this evening miss florence i heard her say but that turpin he says he wants to see you about his shed  oh mr turpin must want to see me very badly tell him to come to the hall mrs madden  i looked down into the hall whose only light was the dulled fire and deep in the shadow i saw them at last they must have slipped down while we were in the passages and now thought themselves perfectly hidden behind an old gilt leather screen by childs law my fruitless chase was as good as an introduction but since i had taken so much trouble i resolved to force them to come forward later by the simple trick which children detest of pretending not to notice them they lay close in a little huddle no more than shadows except when a quick flame betrayed an outline  and now well have some tea she said i believe i ought to have offered it you at first but one doesnt arrive at manners somehow when one lives alone and is consideredhmpeculiar then with very pretty scorn would you like a lamp to see to eat by the firelights much pleasanter i think we descended into that delicious gloom and madden brought tea  i took my chair in the direction of the screen ready to surprise or be surprised as the game should go and at her permission since a hearth is always sacred bent forward to play with the fire  where do you get these beautiful short faggots from i asked idly why they are tallies  of course she said as i cant read or write im driven back on the early english tally for my accounts give me one and ill tell you what it meant  i passed her an unburned hazeltally about a foot long and she ran her thumb down the nicks  this is the milkrecord for the home farm for the month of april last year in gallons said she i dont know what i should have done without tallies an old forester of mine taught me the system its out of date now for every one else but my tenants respect it one of thems coming now to see me oh it doesnt matter he has no business here out of office hours hes a greedy ignorant manvery greedy orhe wouldnt come here after dark  have you much land then  only a couple of hundred acres in hand thank goodness the other six hundred are nearly all let to folk who knew my folk before me but this turpin is quite a new manand a highway robber  but are you sure i shant be  certainly not you have the right he hasnt any children  ah the children i said and slid my low chair back till it nearly touched the screen that hid them i wonder whether theyll come out for me  there was a murmur of voicesmaddens and a deeper noteat the low dark side door and a gingerheaded canvasgaitered giant of the unmistakable tenant farmer type stumbled or was pushed in  come to the fire mr turpin she said  ifif you please miss illill be quite as well by the door he clung to the latch as he spoke like a frightened child of a sudden i realised that he was in the grip of some almost overpowering fear  well  about that new shed for the young stockthat was all these first autumn storms settin in  but ill come again miss his teeth did not chatter much more than the door latch  i think not she answered levelly the new shedmm what did my agent write you on the 15th  ifancied praps that if i came to see youmaman to man like miss but  his eyes rolled into every corner of the room wide with horror he half opened the door through which he had entered but i noticed it shut again from without and firmly  he wrote what i told him she went on you are overstocked already dunnetts farm never carried more than fifty bullockseven in mr wrights time and he used cake youve sixtyseven and you dont cake youve broken the lease in that respect youre dragging the heart out of the farm  imim getting some mineralssuperphosphatesnext week ive as good as ordered a truckload already ill go down to the station tomorrow about em then i can come and see you man to man like miss in the daylight that gentlemans not going away is he he almost shrieked  i had only slid the chair a little further back reaching behind me to tap on the leather of the screen but he jumped like a rat  no please attend to me mr turpin she turned in her chair and faced him with his back to the door it was an old and sordid little piece of scheming that she forced from himhis plea for the new cowshed at his landladys expense that he might with the covered manure pay his next years rent out of the valuation after as she made clear he had bled the enriched pastures to the bone i could not but admire the intensity of his greed when i saw him outfacing for its sake whatever terror it was that ran wet on his forehead  i ceased to tap the leatherwas indeed calculating the cost of the shedwhen i felt my relaxed hand taken and turned softly between the soft hands of a child so at last i had triumphed in a moment i would turn and acquaint myself with those quickfooted wanderers  the little brushing kiss fell in the centre of my palmas a gift on which the fingers were once expected to close as the all faithful half reproachful signal of a waiting child not used to neglect even when grownups were busiesta fragment of the mute code devised very long ago  then i knew and it was as though i had known from the first day when i looked across the lawn at the high window  i heard the door shut the woman turned to me in silence and i felt that she knew  what time passed after this i cannot say i was roused by the fall of a log and mechanically rose to put it back then i returned to my place in the chair very close to the screen  now you understand she whispered across the packed shadows  yes i understandnow thank you  ii only hear them she bowed her head in her hands i have no right you knowno other right i have neither borne nor lostneither borne nor lost  be very glad then said i for my soul was torn open within me  forgive me  she was still and i went back to my sorrow and my joy  it was because i loved them so she said at last brokenly that was why it was even from the firsteven before i knew that theythey were all i should ever have and i loved them so  she stretched out her arms to the shadows and the shadows within the shadow  they came because i loved thembecause i needed them ii must have made them come was that wrong think you  nono  ii grant you that the toys andand all that sort of thing were nonsense butbut i used to so hate empty rooms myself when i was little she pointed to the gallery and the passages all empty  and how could i ever bear the garden door shut suppose  dont for pitys sake dont i cried the twilight had brought a cold rain with gusty squalls that plucked at the leaded windows  and the same thing with keeping the fire in all night i dont think it so foolishdo you  i looked at the broad brick hearth saw through tears i believe that there was no unpassable iron on or near it and bowed my head  i did all that and lots of other thingsjust to make believe then they came i heard them but i didnt know that they were not mine by right till mrs madden told me  the butlers wife what  one of themi heardshe saw and knew hers not for me i didnt know at first perhaps i was jealous afterwards i began to understand that it was only because i loved them not because oh you must bear or lose she said piteously there is no other wayand yet they love me they must dont they  there was no sound in the room except the lapping voices of the fire but we two listened intently and she at least took comfort from what she heard she recovered herself and half rose i sat still in my chair by the screen  dont think me a wretch to whine about myself like this butbut im all in the dark you know and you can see  in truth i could see and my vision confirmed me in my resolve though that was like the very parting of spirit and flesh yet a little longer i would stay since it was the last time  you think it is wrong then she cried sharply though i had said nothing  not for you a thousand times no for you it is right i am grateful to you beyond words for me it would be wrong for me only  why she said but passed her hand before her face as she had done at our second meeting in the wood oh i see she went on simply as a child for you it would be wrong then with a little indrawn laugh and dyou remember i called you luckyonceat first you who must never come here again  she left me to sit a little longer by the screen and i heard

to coneycatch privily in the hedgerows for a clown with that same cruellustful hand and eye those nails and wedges that one hammer and lead and the very gerb of longstored lightnings loosed yesterday gainst some king    mrs bathurst the day that i chose to visit hms peridot in simons bay was the day that the admiral had chosen to send her up the coast she was just steaming out to sea as my train came in and since the rest of the fleet were either coaling or busy at the rifleranges a thousand feet up the hill i found myself stranded lunchless on the seafront with no hope of return to cape town before five pm at this crisis i had the luck to come across my friend inspector hooper cape government railways in command of an engine and a brakevan chalked for repair  if you get something to eat he said ill run you down to glengariff siding till the goods comes along its cooler there than here you see  i got food and drink from the greeks who sell all things at a price and the engine trotted us a couple of miles up the line to a bay of drifted sand and a plankplatform half buried in sand not a hundred yards from the edge of the surf moulded dunes whiter than any snow rolled far inland up a brown and purple valley of splintered rocks and dry scrub a crowd of malays hauled at a net beside two blue and green boats on the beach a picnic party danced and shouted barefoot where a tiny river trickled across the flat and a circle of dry hills whose feet were set in sands of silver locked us in against a sevencoloured sea at either horn of the bay the railway line cut just above high watermark ran round a shoulder of piled rocks and disappeared  you see theres always a breeze here said hooper opening the door as the engine left us in the siding on the sand and the strong southeaster buffeting under elsies peak dusted sand into our tickey beer presently he sat down to a file full of spiked documents he had returned from a long trip upcountry where he had been reporting on damaged rolling stock as far away as rhodesia the weight of the bland wind on my eyelids the song of it under the car roof and high up among the rocks the drift of fine grains chasing each other musically ashore the tramp of the surf the voices of the picnickers the rustle of hoopers file and the presence of the assured sun joined with the beer to cast me into magical slumber the hills of false bay were just dissolving into those of fairyland when i heard footsteps on the sand outside and the clink of our couplings  stop that snapped hooper without raising his head from his work its those dirty little malay boys you see theyre always playing with the trucks  dont be hard on em the railways a general refuge in africa i replied  tisupcountry at any rate that reminds me he felt in his waistcoat pocket ive got a curiosity for you from wankiesbeyond buluwayo its more of a souvenir perhaps than  the old hotels inhabited cried a voice white men from the language marines to the front come on pritch heres your belmont whaii  the last word dragged like a rope as mr pyecroft ran round to the open door and stood looking up into my face behind him an enormous sergeant of marines trailed a stalk of dried seaweed and dusted the sand nervously from his fingers  what are you doing here i asked i thought the hierophant was down the coast  we came in last tuesdayfrom tristan dacunhafor overhaul and we shall be in dockyard ands for two months with boilerseatings  come and sit down hooper put away the file  this is mr hooper of the railway i exclaimed as pyecroft turned to haul up the blackmoustached sergeant  this is sergeant pritchard of the agaric an old shipmate said he we were strollin on the beach the monster blushed and nodded he filled up one side of the van when he sat down  and this is my friend mr pyecroft i added to hooper already busy with the extra beer which my prophetic soul had bought from the greeks  moi aussi quoth pyecroft and drew out beneath his coat a labelled quart bottle  why its bass cried hooper  it was pritchard said pyecroft they cant resist him  thats not so said pritchard mildly  not verbatim peraps but the look in the eye came to the same thing  where was it i demanded  just on beyond hereat kalk bay she was slappin a rug in a back verandah pritch hadnt more than brought his batteries to bear before she stepped indoors an sent it flyin over the wall  pyecroft patted the warm bottle  it was all a mistake said pritchard i shouldnt wonder if she mistook me for maclean were about of a size  i had heard householders of muizenburg st jamess and kalk bay complain of the difficulty of keeping beer or good servants at the seaside and i began to see the reason none the less it was excellent bass and i too drank to the health of that largeminded maid  its the uniform that fetches em an they fetch it said pyecroft my simple navy blue is respectable but not fascinatin now pritch in is number one rig is always purr mary on the terraceex officio as you might say  she took me for maclean i tell you pritchard insisted whywhyto listen to him you wouldnt think that only yesterday  pritch said pyecroft be warned in time if we begin tellin what we know about each other well be turned out of the pub not to mention aggravated desertion on several occasions  never anything more than absence without leafi defy you to prove it said the sergeant hotly an if it comes to that how about vancouver in 87  how about it who pulled bow in the gig going ashore who told boy niven  surely you were court martialled for that i said the story of boy niven who lured seven or eight ablebodied seamen and marines into the woods of british columbia used to be a legend of the fleet  yes we were courtmartialled to rights said pritchard but we should have been tried for murder if boy niven adnt been unusually tough he told us he had an uncle ood give us land to farm e said he was born at the back o vancouver island and all the time the beggar was a balmy barnado orphan  but we believed him said pyecroft i didyou didpaterson didan oo was the marine that married the cocoanutwoman afterwardshim with the mouth  oh jones spitkid jones i avent thought of im in years said pritchard yes spitkid believed it an george anstey and moon we were very young an very curious  but lovin an trustful to a degree said pyecroft  remember when e told us to walk in single file for fear o bears remember pye when e opped about in that bog full o ferns an sniffed an said e could smell the smoke of is uncles farm an all the time it was a dirty little outlyin uninhabited island we walked round it in a day an come back to our boat lyin on the beach a whole day boy niven kept us walkin in circles lookin for is uncles farm he said his uncle was compelled by the law of the land to give us a farm  dont get hot pritch we believed said pyecroft  hed been readin books he only did it to get a run ashore an have himself talked of a day an a nighteight of usfollowin boy niven round an uninhabited island in the vancouver archipelago then the picket came for us an a nice pack o idiots we looked  what did you get for it hooper asked  heavy thunder with continuous lightning for two hours thereafter sleet squalls a confused sea and cold unfriendly weather till conclusion o cruise said pyecroft it was only what we expected but what we felt an i assure you mr hooper even a sailorman has a heart to break was bein told that we able seamen an promisin marines ad misled boy niven yes we poor backtothelanders was supposed to ave misled him he rounded on us o course an got off easy  excep for what we gave him in the steerinflat when we came out o cells eard anything of im lately pye  signal boatswain in the channel fleet i believemr ll niven is  an anstey died o fever in benin pritchard mused what come to moon spitkid we know about  moonmoon now where did i last oh yes when i was in the palladium i met quigley at buncrana station he told me moon ad run when the astrild sloop was cruising among the south seas three years back he always showed signs o bein a mormonastic beggar yes he slipped off quietly an they adnt time to chase im round the islands even if the navigatin officer ad been equal to the job  wasnt he said hooper  not so accordin to quigley the astrild spent half her commission rompin up the beach like a sheturtle an the other half hatching turtles eggs on the top o numerous reefs when she was docked at sydney her copper looked like aunt marias washing on the linean her midship frames was sprung the commander swore the dockyard ad done it haulin the pore thing on to the slips they do do strange things at sea mr hooper  ah im not a taxpayer said hooper and opened a fresh bottle the sergeant seemed to be one who had a difficulty in dropping subjects  how it all comes back dont it he said why moon must ave ad sixteen years service before he ran  it takes em at all ages look atyou know said pyecroft  who i asked  a service man within eighteen months of his pension is the party youre thinkin of said pritchard a warrant oose name begins with a v isnt it  but in a way o puttin it we cant say that he actually did desert pyecroft suggested  oh no said pritchard it was only permanent absence up country without leaf that was all  up country said hooper did they circulate his description  what for said pritchard most impolitely  because deserters are like columns in the war they dont move away from the line you see ive known a chap caught at salisbury that way tryin to get to nyassa they tell me but o course i dont know that they dont ask questions on the nyassa lake flotilla up there ive heard of a p and o quartermaster in full command of an armed launch there  do you think click ud ha gone up that way pritchard asked  theres no saying he was sent up to bloemfontein to take over some navy ammunition left in the fort we know he took it over and saw it into the trucks then there was no more clickthen or thereafter four months ago it transpired and thus the casus belli stands at present said pyecroft  what were his marks said hooper again  does the railway get a reward for returnin em then said pritchard  if i did dyou suppose id talk about it hooper retorted angrily  you seemed so very interested said pritchard with equal crispness  why was he called click i asked to tide over an uneasy little break in the conversation the two men were staring at each other very fixedly  because of an ammunition hoist carryin away said pyecroft and it carried away four of is teethon the lower port side wasnt it pritch the substitutes which he bought werent screwed home in a manner o sayin when he talked fast they used to lift a little on the bed plate ence click they called im a superior man which is what wed call a long blackaired genteely speakin alfbred beggar on the lower deck  four false teeth on the lower left jaw said hooper his hand in his waistcoat pocket what tattoo marks  look here began pritchard half rising im sure were very grateful to you as a gentleman for your orspitality but peraps we may ave made an error in  i looked at pyecroft for aid hooper was crimsoning rapidly  if the fat marine now occupying the focsle will kindly bring is status quo to an anchor yet once more we may be able to talk like gentlemen not to say friends said pyecroft he regards you mr hooper as a emissary of the law  i only wish to observe that when a gentleman exhibits such a peculiar or i should rather say such a bloomin curiosity in identification marks as our friend here  mr pritchard i interposed ill take all the responsibility for mr hooper  an youll apologise all round said pyecroft youre a rude little man pritch  but how was i he began wavering  i dont know an i dont care apologise  the giant looked round bewildered and took our little hands into his vast grip one by one i was wrong he said meekly as a sheep my suspicions was unfounded mr hooper i apologise  you did quite right to look out for your own end o the line said hooper id ha done the same with a gentleman i didnt know you see if you dont mind id like to hear a little more o your mr vickery its safe with me you see  why did vickery run i began but pyecrofts smile made me turn my question to who was she  she kep a little hotel at haurakinear auckland said pyecroft  by gawd roared pritchard slapping his hand on his leg not mrs bathurst  pyecroft nodded slowly and the sergeant called all the powers of darkness to witness his bewilderment  so far as i could get at it mrs b was the lady in question  but click was married cried pritchard  an ad a fifteen year old daughter es shown me her photograph settin that aside so to say ave you ever found these little things make much difference because i havent  good lord alive an watchin mrs bathurst then with another roar you can say what you please pye but you dont make me believe it was any of er fault she wasnt that  if i was going to say what i please id begin by callin you a silly ox an work up to the higher pressures at leisure im trying to say solely what transpired mrover for once youre right it wasnt her fault  you couldnt avent made me believe it if it ad been was the answer  such faith in a sergeant of marines interested me greatly never mind about that i cried tell me what she was like  she was a widow said pyecroft left so very young and never respliced she kep a little hotel for warrants and noncoms close to auckland an she always wore black silk and er neck  you ask what she was like pritchard broke in let me give you an instance i was at auckland first in 97 at the end o the marroquins commission an as id been promoted i went up with the others she used to look after us all an she never lost by itnot a penny pay me now shed say or settle later i know you wont let me suffer send the money from home if you like why gentlemen all i tell you ive seen that lady take her own gold watch an chain off her neck in the bar an pass it to a bosun ood come ashore without is ticker an ad to catch the last boat i dont know your name she said but when youve done with it youll find plenty that know me on the front send it back by one o them and it was worth thirty pounds if it was worth arf a crown the little gold watch pye with the blue monogram at the back but as i was sayin in those days she kep a beer that agreed with meslits it was called one way an another i must ave punished a good few bottles of it while we was in the baycomin ashore every night or so chaffin across the bar like once when we were alone mrs b i said when next i call i want you to remember that this is my particularjust as youre my particular shed let you go that far just as youre my particular i said oh thank you sergeant pritchard she says an put er hand up to the curl beind er ear remember that way she had pye  i think so said the sailor  yes thank you sergeant pritchard she says the least i can do is to mark it for you in case you change your mind theres no great demand for it in the fleet she says but to make sure ill put it at the back o the shelf an she snipped off a piece of her hair ribbon with that old dolphin cigar cutter on the barremember it pyean she tied a bow round what was leftjust four bottles that was 97no 96 in 98 i was in the resiliantchina stationfull commission in nineteen one mark you i was in the carthusian back in auckland bay again of course i went up to mrs bs with the rest of us to see how things were goin they were the same as ever remember the big tree on the pavement by the sidebar pye i never said anythin in special there was too many of us talkin to her but she saw me at once  that wasnt difficult i ventured  ah but wait i was comin up to the bar when ada she says to her niece get me sergeant pritchards particular and gentlemen all i tell you before i could shake ands with the lady there were those four bottles o slits with er air ribbon in a bow round each o their necks set down in front o me an as she drew the cork she looked at me under her eyebrows in that blindish way she had o lookin an sergeant pritchard she says i do ope you avent changed your mind about your particulars thats the kind o woman she wasafter five years  i dont see her yet somehow said hooper but with sympathy  sheshe never scrupled to feed a lame duck or set er foot on a scorpion at any time of er life pritchard added valiantly  that dont help me either my mothers like that for one  the giant heaved inside his uniform and rolled his eyes at the carroof said pyecroft suddenly  how many women have you been intimate with all over the world pritch  pritchard blushed plum colour to the short hairs of his seventeeninch neck  undreds said pyecroft sove i how many of em can you remember in your own mind settin aside the firstan peraps the lastand one more  few wonderful few now i tax myself said sergeant pritchard relievedly  an how many times might you ave been at aukland  onetwo he began why i cant make it more than three times in ten years but i can remember every time that i ever saw mrs b  so can ian ive only been to auckland twicehow she stood an what she was sayin an what she looked like thats the secret tisnt beauty so to speak nor good talk necessarily its just it some womenll stay in a mans memory if they once walked down a street but most of em you can live with a month on end an next commission youd be put to it to certify whether they talked in their sleep or not as one might say  ah said hooper thats more the idea ive known just two women of that nature  an it was no fault o theirs asked pritchard  none whatever i know that  an if a man gets struck with that kind o woman mr hooper pritchard went on  he goes crazyor just saves himself was the slow answer  youve hit it said the sergeant youve seen an known somethin in the course o your life mr hooper im lookin at you he set down his bottle  and how often had vickery seen her i asked  thats the dark an bloody mystery pyecroft answered id never come across him till i come out in the hierophant just now an there wasnt any one in the ship who knew much about him you see he was what you call a superior man e spoke to me once or twice about auckland and mrs b on the voyage out i called that to mind subsequently there must ave been a good deal between em to my way o thinkin mind you im only giving you my sum of it all because all i know is secondhand so to speak or rather i should say more than secondand  how said hooper peremptorily you must have seen it or heard it  yes said pyecroft i used to think seein and hearin was the only regulation aids to ascertainin facts but as we get older we get more accommodatin the cylinders work easier i suppose were you in cape town last december when phylliss circus came  noup country said hooper a little nettled at the change of venue  i ask because they had a new turn of a scientific nature called home and friends for a tickey  oh you mean the cinematographthe pictures of prizefights and steamers ive seen em up country  biograph or cinematograph was what i was alludin to london bridge with the omnibusesa troopship goin to the warmarines on parade at portsmouth an the plymouth express arrivin at paddinton  seen em all seen em all said hooper impatiently  we hierophants came in just before christmas week an leaf was easy  i think a man gets fed up with cape town quicker than anywhere else on the station why even durbans more like nature we was there for christmas pritchard put in  not bein a devotee of indian peeris as our doctor said to the pusser i cant exactly say phylliss was good enough after musketry practice at mozambique i couldnt get off the first two or three nights on account of what you might call an imbroglio with our torpedo lieutenant in the submerged flat where some pride of the west country had sugared up a gyroscope but i remember vickery went ashore with our carpenter rigdon old crocus we called him as a general rule crocus never left is ship unless an until he was oisted out with a winch but when e went e would return noddin like a lily gemmed with dew we smothered him down below that night but the things e said about vickery as a fittin playmate for a warrant officer of is cubic capacity before we got him quiet was what i should call pointed  ive been with crocusin the redoubtable said the sergeant hes a character if there is one  next night i went into cape town with dawson and pratt but just at the door of the circus i came across vickery oh he says youre the man im looking for come and sit next me this way to the shillin places i went astern at once protestin because tickey seats better suited my socalled finances come on says vickery im payin naturally i abandoned pratt and dawson in anticipation o drinks to match the seats no he says when this was intednot now not now as many as you please afterwards but i want you sober for the occasion i caught is face under a lamp just then an the appearance of it quite cured me of my thirsts dont mistake it didnt frighten me it made me anxious i cant tell you what it was like but that was the effect which it ad on me if you want to know it reminded me of those things in bottles in those herbalistic shops at plymouthpreserved in spirits of wine white an crumply thingsprevious to birth as you might say  you ave a beastial mind pye said the sergeant relighting his pipe  perhaps we were in the front row an home an friends came on early vickery touched me on the knee when the number went up if you see anything that strikes you he says drop me a hint then he went on clicking we saw london bridge an so forth an so on an it was most interestin id never seen it before you eard a little dynamo like buzzin but the pictures were the real thingalive an movin  ive seen em said hooper of course they are taken from the very thing itselfyou see  then the western mail came in to paddinton on the big magic lantern sheet first we saw the platform empty an the porters standin by then the engine come in head on an the women in the front row jumped she headed so straight then the doors opened and the passengers came out and the porters got the luggagejust like life onlyonly when any one came down too far towards us that was watchin they walked right out o the picture so to speak i was ighly interested i can tell you so were all of us i watched an old man with a rug ood dropped a book an was tryin to pick it up when quite slowly from beind two porterscarryin a little reticule an lookin from side to sidecomes out mrs bathurst there was no mistakin the walk in a hundred thousand she come forward right forwardshe looked out straight at us with that blindish look which pritch alluded to she walked on and on till she melted out of the picturelikelike a shadow jumpin over a candle an as she went i eard dawson in the ticky seats beind sing out christ theres mrs b  hooper swallowed his spittle and leaned forward intently  vickery touched me on the knee again he was clickin his four false teeth with his jaw down like an enteric at the last kick are you sure says he sure i says didnt you ear dawson give tongue why its the woman herself i was sure before he says but i brought you to make sure will you come again with me tomorrow  willingly i says its like meetin old friends  yes he says openin his watch very like it will be fourandtwenty hours less four minutes before i see her again come and have a drink he says it may amuse you but its no sort of earthly use to me he went out shaking his head an stumblin over peoples feet as if he was drunk already i anticipated a swift drink an a speedy return because i wanted to see the performin elephants instead o which vickery began to navigate the town at the rate o knots lookin in at a bar every three minutes approximate greenwich time im not a drinkin man though there are those presenthe cocked his unforgetable eye at mewho may have seen me more or less imbued with the fragrant spirit none the less when i drink i like to do it at anchor an not at an average speed of eighteen knots on the measured mile theres a tank as you might say at the back o that big hotel up the hillwhat do they call it  the molteno reservoir i suggested and hooper nodded  that was his limit o drift we walked there an we come down through the gardensthere was a southeaster blowinan we finished up by the docks then we bore up the road to salt river and wherever there was a pub vickery put in sweatin he didnt look at what he drunkhe didnt look at the change he walked an he drunk an he perspired in rivers i understood why old crocus ad come back in the condition e did because vickery an i ad two an a half hours o this gipsy manoeuvre an when we got back to the station there wasnt a dry atom on or in me  did he say anything pritchard asked  the sum total of is conversation from 745 pm till 1115 pm was lets have another thus the mornin an the evenin were the first day as scripture says to abbreviate a lengthy narrative i went into cape town for five consecutive nights with master vickery and in that time i must ave logged about fifty knots over the ground an taken in two gallon o all the worst spirits south the equator the evolution never varied two shilling seats for us two five minutes o the pictures an perhaps fortyfive seconds o mrs b walking down towards us with that blindish look in her eyes an the reticule in her hand then out walkand drink till train time  what did you think said hooper his hand fingering his waistcoat pocket  several things said pyecroft to tell you the truth i arent quite done thinkin about it yet mad the man was a dumb lunaticmust ave been for monthsyears praps i know somethin o maniacs as every man in the service must ive been shipmates with a mad skipperan a lunatic number one but never both together i thank eaven i could give you the names o three captains now oo ought to be in an asylum but you dont find me interferin with the mentally afflicted till they begin to lay about em with rammers an winchhandles only once i crept up a little into the wind towards master vickery i wonder what shes doin in england i says dont it seem to you shes lookin for somebody that was in the gardens again with the southeaster blowin as we were makin our desperate round shes lookin for me he says stoppin dead under a lamp an clickin when he wasnt drinkin in which case all is teeth clicked on the glass e was clickin is four false teeth like a marconi ticker yes lookin for me he said an he went on very softly an as you might say affectionately but he went on in future mr pyecroft i should take it kindly of you if youd confine your remarks to the drinks set before you otherwise he says with the best will in the world towards you i may find myself guilty of murder do you understand he says perfectly i says but would it at all soothe you to know that in such a case the chances o your being killed are precisely equivalent to the chances o me being outed why no he says im almost afraid that ud be a temptation  then i saidwe was right under the lamp by that arch at the end o the gardens where the trams came roundassumin murder was doneor attempted murderi put it to you that you would still be left so badly crippled as one might say that your subsequent capture by the policeto oom you would ave to explainwould be largely inevitable thats better e says passin is hands over his forehead thats much better because he says do you know as i am now pye im not so sure if i could explain anything much those were the only particular words i had with im in our walks as i remember  what walks said hooper oh my soul what walks  they were chronic said pyecroft gravely but i didnt anticipate any danger till the circus left then i anticipated that bein deprived of is stimulant he might react on me so to say with a hatchet consequently after the final performance an the ensuin wet walk i kep myself aloof from my superior officer on board in the execution of is duty as you might put it consequently i was interested when the sentry informs me while i was passin on my lawful occasions that click had asked to see the captain as a general rule warrant officers dont dissipate much of the owners time but click put in an hour and more beind that door my duties kep me within eyeshot of it vickery came out first an e actually nodded at me an smiled this knocked me out o the boat because havin seen is face for five consecutive nights i didnt anticipate any change there more than a condenser in hell so to speak the owner emerged later his face didnt read off at all so i fell back on his cox ood been eight years with him and knew him better than boat signals lamsonthat was the coxs namecrossed is bows once or twice at low speeds an dropped down to me visibly concerned hes shipped is courtmartial face says lamson some ones goin to be ung ive never seen that look but once before when they chucked the gunsights overboard in the fantastic throwin gunsights overboard mr hooper is the equivalent for mutiny in these degenerate days its done to attract the notice of the authorities an the western mornin newsgenerally by a stoker naturally word went round the lower deck an we had a private overaul of our little consciences but barrin a shirt which a second class stoker said ad walked into is bag from the marines flat by itself nothin vital transpired the owner went about flyin the signal for attend public execution so to say but there was no corpse at the yardarm e lunched on the beach an e returned with is regulation harbourroutine face about 3 p m thus lamson lost prestige for raising false alarms the only person oo might ave connected the epicycloidal gears correctly was one pyecroft when he was told that mr vickery would go up country that same evening to take over certain naval ammunition left after the war in bloemfontein fort no details was ordered to accompany master vickery he was told off first person singularas a unitby himself  the marine whistled penetratingly  thats what i thought said pyecroft i went ashore with him in the cutter an e asked me to walk through the station he was clickin audibly but otherwise seemed happyish  you might like to know he says stoppin just opposite the admirals front gate that phylliss circus will be performin at worcester tomorrow night so i shall see er yet once again youve been very patient with me he says  look here vickery i said this things come to be just as much as i can stand consume your own smoke i dont want to know any more  you he said what have you got to complain ofyouve only ad to watch im it he says but thats neither here nor there he says ive one thing to say before shakin ands remember e sayswe were just by the admirals gardengate thenremember that i am not a murderer because my lawful wife died in childbed six weeks after i came out that much at least i am clear of e says  then what have you done that signifies i said whats the rest of it  the rest e says is silence an he shook ands and went clickin into simons town station  did he stop to see mrs bathurst at worcester i asked  its not known he reported at bloemfontein saw the ammunition into the trucks and then e disappeared went outdeserted if you care to put it sowithin eighteen months of his pension an if what e said about is wife was true he was a free man as e then stood how do you read it off  poor devil said hooper to see her that way every night i wonder what it was  ive made my ead ache in that direction many a long night  but ill swear mrs b ad no and in it said the sergeant unshaken  no whatever the wrong or deceit was he did it im sure o that i ad to look at is face for five consecutive nights im not so fond o navigatin about cape town with a southeaster blowin these days i can hear those teeth click so to say  ah those teeth said hooper and his hand went to his waistcoat pocket once more permanent things false teeth are you read about em in all the murder trials  what dyou suppose the captain knewor did i asked  i never turned my searchlight that way pyecroft answered unblushingly  we all reflected together and drummed on empty beer bottles as the picnicparty sunburned wet and sandy passed our door singing the honeysuckle and the bee  pretty girl under that kapje said pyecroft  they never circulated his description said pritchard  i was askin you before these gentlemen came said hooper to me whether you knew wankieson the way to the zambesibeyond buluwayo  would he pass theretryin to get to that lake whats is name said pritchard  hooper shook his head and went on theres a curious bit o line there you see it runs through solid teak foresta sort o mahogany really seventytwo miles without a curve ive had a train derailed there twenty three times in forty miles i was up there a month ago relievin a sick inspector you see he told me to look out for a couple of tramps in the teak  two pyecroft said i dont envy that other man if  we get heaps of tramps up there since

i kept but he was a friend of you two gentlemen you see  mr hooper brought his hand away from his waistcoatpocketempty  pritchard covered his face with his hands for a moment like a child shutting out

now outside she cocked one ear towards the halfopened doorthere is an absurd convention that rats and cats are i wont go so far as to say natural enemies but opposed forces some such ruling may be crudely effectivei dont for a minute presume to set up my standards as finalamong the ditches but from the larger point of view that one gains by living at the heart of things it seems for a rule of life a little overstrained why because some of your associates have shall i say liberal views on the ultimate destination of a sack ofermiddlings dont they call them  something of that sort said the black rat a most sharp and sweet toothed judge of everything ground in the mill for the last three years  thanksmiddlings be it why as i was saying must i disarrange my fur and my digestion to chase you round the dusty arena whenever we happen to meet  as little reason said the black rat as there is for me who i trust am a person of ordinarily decent instincts to wait till you have gone on a round of calls and then to assassinate your very charming children  exactly it has its humorous side though the grey cat yawned the miller seems afflicted by it he shouted large and vague threats to my address last night at tea that he wasnt going to keep cats who caught no mice those were his words i remember the grammar sticking in my throat like a herringbone  and what did you do  what does one do when a barbarian utters one ceases to utter and removes i removedtowards his pantry it was a riposte he might appreciate  really those people grow absolutely insufferable said the black rat there is a local ruffian who answers to the name of manglesa builder who has taken possession of the outhouses on the far side of the wheel for the last fortnight he has constructed cubical horrors in red brick where those deliciously picturesque pigstyes used to stand have you noticed  there has been much misdirected activity of late among the humans they jabber inordinately i havent yet been able to arrive at their reason for existence the cat yawned  a couple of them came in here last week with wires and fixed them all about the walls wires protected by some abominable composition ending in iron brackets with glass bulbs utterly useless for any purpose and artistically absolutely hideous what do they mean  aaah i have known fourandtwenty leaders of revolt in faenza said the cat who kept good company with the boarders spending a summer at the mill farm it means nothing except that humans occasionally bring their dogs with them i object to dogs in all forms  shouldnt object to dogs said the wheel sleepily the abbot of wilton kept the best pack in the county he enclosed all the harryngton woods to sturt common aluric a freeman was dispossessed of his holding they tried the case at lewes but he got no change out of william de warrenne on the bench william de warrenne fined aluric eight and fourpence for treason and the abbot of wilton excommunicated him for blasphemy aluric was no sportsman then the abbots brother married  ive forgotten her name but she was a charmin little woman the lady philippa was her daughter that was after the barony was conferred she rode devilish straight to hounds they were a bit throatier than we breed now but a good pack one of the best the abbot kept em in splendid shape now who was the woman the abbot kept bookbook i shall have to go right back to domesday and work up the centuries modo per omnia reddit burgum tunctunctunc was it burgum or hundredum i shall remember in a minute theres no hurry he paused as he turned over silvered with showering drops  this wont do said the waters in the sluice keep moving  the wheel swung forward the waters roared on the buckets and dropped down to the darkness below  noisier than usual said the black rat it must have been raining up the valley  floods maybe said the wheel dreamily it isnt the proper season but they can come without warning i shall never forget the big onewhen the miller went to sleep and forgot to open the hatches more than two hundred years ago it was but i recall it distinctly most unsettling  we lifted that wheel off his bearings cried the waters we said take away that bauble and in the morning he was five mile down the valley hung up in a tree  vulgar said the cat but i am sure he never lost his dignity  we dont know he looked like the ace of diamonds when we had finished with him move on there keep on moving over get over  and why on this day more than any other said the wheel statelily i am not aware that my department requires the stimulus of external pressure to keep it up to its duties i trust i have the elementary instincts of a gentleman  maybe the waters answered together leaping down on the buckets we only know that you are very stiff on your bearings over get over  the wheel creaked and groaned there was certainly greater pressure upon him that he had ever felt and his revolutions had increased from six and threequarters to eight and a third per minute but the uproar between the narrow weedhung walls annoyed the grey cat  isnt it almost time she said plaintively that the person who is paid to understand these things shuts off those vehement drippings with that screwthing on the top of that boxthing  theyll be shut off at eight oclock as usual said rat then we can go to dinner  but we shant be shut off till ever so late said the waters gaily we shall keep it up all night  the ineradicable offensiveness of youth is partially compensated for by its eternal hopefulness said the cat our dam is not i am glad to say designed to furnish water for more than four hours at a time reserve is life  thank goodness said the black rat then they can return to their native ditches  ditches cried the waters ravens gill brook is no ditch it is almost navigable and we come from there away they slid over solid and compact till the wheel thudded under their weight  ravens gill brook said the rat i never heard of ravens gill  we are the waters of harpenden brookdown from under callton rise phew how the race stinks compared with the heather country another five foot of water flung itself against the wheel broke roared gurgled and was gone  indeed said the grey cat i am sorry to tell you that ravens gill brook is cut off from this valley by an absolutely impassable range of mountains and callton rise is more than nine miles away it belongs to another system entirely  ah yes said the rat grinning but we forget that for the young water always runs uphill  oh hopeless hopeless hopeless cried the waters descending open palmed upon the wheel there is nothing between here and ravens gill brook that a hundred yards of channelling and a few square feet of concrete could not remove and hasnt removed  and harpenden brook is north of ravens gill and runs into ravens gill at the foot of callton rise where ilex trees are and we come from there these were the glassy clear waters of the high chalk  and battens ponds that are fed by springs have been led through trotts wood taking the spare water from the old witches spring under churt haw and wewewe are their combined waters those were the waters from the upland bogs and moorsa portercoloured dusky and foam flecked flood  its all very interesting purred the cat to the sliding waters and i have no doubt that trotts woods and botts woods are tremendously important places but if you could manage to do your workwhose value i dont in the least disputea little more soberly i for one should be grateful  bookbookbookbookbookdomesday book the urged wheel was fairly clattering now in burgelstaltone a monk holds of earl godwin one hide and a half with eight villeins there is a churchand a monk i remember that monk blessed if he could rattle his rosary off any quicker than i am doing now  and wood for seven hogs i must be running twelve to the minute  almost as fast as steam damnable invention steam  surely its time we went to dinner or prayersor something cant keep up this pressure day in and day out and not feel it i dont mind for myself of course noblesse oblige you know im only thinking of the upper and the nether millstones they came out of the common rock they cant be expected to  dont worry on our account please said the millstones huskily so long as you supply the power well supply the weight and the bite  isnt it a trifle blasphemous though to work you in this way grunted the wheel i seem to remember something about the mills of god grinding slowly slowly was the word  but we are not the mills of god were only the upper and the nether millstones we have received no instructions to be anything else we are actuated by power transmitted through you  ah but let us be merciful as we are strong think of all the beautiful little plants that grow on my woodwork there are five varieties of rare moss within less than one square yardand all these delicate jewels of nature are being grievously knocked about by this excessive rush of the water  umph growled the millstones what with your religious scruples and your taste for botany wed hardly know you for the wheel that put the carters son under last autumn you never worried about him  he ought to have known better  so ought your jewels of nature tell em to grow where its safe  how a purely mercantile life debases and brutalises said the cat to the rat  they were such beautiful little plants too said the rat tenderly maidenstongue and hartshair fern trellising all over the wall just as they do on the sides of churches in the downs think what a joy the sight of them must be to our sturdy peasants pulling hay  golly said the millstones theres nothing like coming to the heart of things for information and they returned to the song that all english watermills have sung from time beyond telling    there was a jovial miller once   lived on the river dee   and this the burden of his song   for ever used to be  then as fresh grist poured in and dulled the note    i care for nobodyno not i   and nobody cares for me  even these stones have absorbed something of our atmosphere said the grey cat ninetenths of the trouble in this world comes from lack of detachment  one of your people died from forgetting that didnt she said the rat  one only the example has sufficed us for generations  ah but what happened to dont care the waters demanded  brutal riding to death of the casual analogy is another mark of provincialism the grey cat raised her tufted chin i am going to sleep with my social obligations i must snatch rest when i can but as our old friend here says noblesse oblige pity me three functions tonight in the village and a barn dance across the valley  theres no chance i suppose of your looking in on the loft about two some of our young people are going to amuse themselves with a new sacque dancebest white flour only said the black rat  i believe i am officially supposed not to countenance that sort of thing but youth is youth  by the way the humans set my milkbowl in the loft these days i hope your youngsters respect it  my dear lady said the black rat bowing you grieve me you hurt me inexpressibly after all these years too  a general crush is so mixedhighways and hedgesall that sort of thing and no one can answer for ones best friends i never try so long as mine are amusin and in full voice and can hold their own at a tile party im as catholic as these mixed waters in the dam here  we arent mixed we have mixed we are one now said the waters sulkily  still uttering said the cat never mind heres the miller coming to shut you off yees i have knownfouror five is itand twenty leaders of revolt in faenza a little more babble in the dam a little more noise in the sluice a little extra splashing on the wheel and then  they will find that nothing has occurred said the black rat the old things persist and survive and are recognisedour old friend here first of all by the way he turned toward the wheel i believe we have to congratulate you on your latest honour  profoundly well deservedeven if he had neveras he haslaboured strenuously through a long life for the amelioration of millkind said the cat who belonged to many tile and outhouse committees doubly deserved i may say for the silent and dignified rebuke his existence offers to the clattering fidgetyfooted demands ofersome people what form did the honour take  it was said the wheel bashfully a machinemoulded pinion  pinions oh how heavenly the black rat sighed i never see a bat without wishing for wings  not exactly that sort of pinion said the wheel but a really ornate circle of toothed iron wheels absurd of course but gratifying mr mangles and an associate herald invested me with it personallyon my left rimthe side that you cant see from the mill i hadnt meant to say anything about itor the new steel straps round my axlesbright red you knowto be worn on all occasionsbut without false modesty i assure you that the recognition cheered me not a little  how intensely gratifying said the black rat i must really steal an hour between lights some day and see what they are doing on your left side  by the way have you any light on this recent activity of mr mangles the grey cat asked he seems to be building small houses on the far side of the tailrace believe me i dont ask from any vulgar curiosity  it affects our order said the black rat simply but firmly  thank you said the wheel let me see if i can tabulate it properly nothing like system in accounts of all kinds book book book on the side of the wheel towards the hundred of burgelstaltone where till now was a stye of three hogs mangles a freeman with four villeins and two carts of two thousand bricks has a new small house of five yards and a half and one roof of iron and a floor of cement then now and afterwards beer in large tankards and felden a stranger with three villeins and one very great cart deposits on it one engine of iron and brass and a small iron mill of four feet and a broad strap of leather and mangles the builder with two villeins constructs the floor for the same and a floor of new brick with wires for the small mill there are there also chalices filled with iron and water in number fiftyseven the whole is valued at one hundred and seventyfour pounds im sorry i cant make myself clearer but you can see for yourself  amazingly lucid said the cat she was the more to be admired because the language of domesday book is not perhaps the clearest medium wherein to describe a small but complete electriclight installation deriving its power from a waterwheel by means of cogs and gearing  see for yourselfby all means see for yourself said the waters spluttering and choking with mirth  upon my word said the black rat furiously i may be at fault but i wholly fail to perceive where these offensive eavesdroppersercome in we were discussing a matter that solely affected our order  suddenly they heard as they had heard many times before the miller shutting off the water to the rattle and rumble of the labouring stones succeeded thick silence punctuated with little drops from the stayed wheel then some waterbird in the dam fluttered her wings as she slid to her nest and the plop of a waterrat sounded like the fall of a log in the water  it is all overit always is all over at just this time listen the miller is going to bedas usual nothing has occurred said the cat  something creaked in the house where the pigstyes had stood as metal engaged on metal with a clink and a burr  shall i turn her on cried the miller  ay said the voice from the dynamohouse  a human in mangles new house the rat squeaked  what of it said the grey cat even supposing mr mangles catsmeat coloured hovel ululated with humans cant you see for yourselfthat  there was a solid crash of released waters leaping upon the wheel more furiously than ever a grinding of cogs a hum like the hum of a hornet and then the unvisited darkness of the old mill was scattered by intolerable white light it threw up every cobweb every burl and knot in the beams and the floor till the shadows behind the flakes of rough plaster on the wall lay clearcut as shadows of mountains on the photographed moon  see see see hissed the waters in full flood yes see for yourselves nothing has occurred cant you see  the rat amazed had fallen from his foothold and lay halfstunned on the floor the cat following her instinct leaped nigh to the ceiling and with flattened ears and bared teeth backed in a corner ready to fight whatever terror might be loosed on her but nothing happened through the long aching minutes nothing whatever happened and her wirebrush tail returned slowly to its proper shape  whatever it is she said at last its overdone they can never keep it up you know  much you know said the waters over you go old man you can take the full head of us now those new steel axlestraps of yours can stand anything come along ravens gill harpenden callton rise battens ponds witches spring all together lets show these gentlemen how to work  butbuti thought it was a decoration whywhywhyit only means more work for me  exactly youre to supply about sixty eightcandle lights when required but they wont be all in use at once  ah i thought as much said the cat the reaction is bound to come  and said the waters you will do the ordinary work of the mill as well  impossible the old wheel quivered as it drove aluric never did it nor azor nor reinbert not even william de warrenne or the papal legate theres no precedent for it i tell you theres no precedent for working a wheel like this  wait a while were making one as fast as we can aluric and co are dead sos the papal legate youve no notion how dead they are but were herethe waters of five separate systems were just as interesting as domesday book would you like to hear about the landtenure in trotts wood its squatright chiefly the mocking waters leaped one over the other chuckling and chattering profanely  in that hundred jenkins a tinker with one dogunis canisholds by the grace of god and a habit he has of working hard unam hidama large potato patch charmin fellow jenkins friend of ours now who the dooce did jenkins keep  in the hundred of callton is one charcoalburner irreligiosissimus homoa bit of a ripbut a thorough sportsman ibi est ecclesia non multum not much of a church quia because episcopus the vicar irritated the nonconformists tunc et post et modo then and afterwards and nowuntil they built a cutstone congregational chapel with red brick facings that did not return itselfdefendebat se at four thousand pounds  charcoalburners vicars schismatics and red brick facings groaned the wheel but this is sheer blasphemy what waters have they let in upon me  floods from the gutters faugh this light is positively sickening said the cat rearranging her fur  we come down from the clouds or up from the springs exactly like all other waters everywhere is that whats surprising you sang the waters  of course not i know my work if you dont what i complain of is your lack of reverence and repose youve no instinct of deference towards your bettersyour heartless parody of the sacred volume the wheel meant domesday bookproves it  our betters said the waters most solemnly what is there in all this dammed race that hasnt come down from the clouds or  spare me that talk please the wheel persisted youd never understand its the toneyour tone that we object to  yes its your tone said the black rat picking himself up limb by limb  if you thought a trifle more about the work youre supposed to do and a trifle less about your precious feelings youd render a little more duty in return for the power vested in youwe mean wasted on you the waters replied  i have been some hundreds of years laboriously acquiring the knowledge which you see fit to challenge so lightheartedly the wheel jarred  challenge him challenge him clamoured the little waves riddling down through the tailrace as well now as later take him up  the main mass of the waters plunging on the wheel shocked that wellbolted structure almost into boxlids by saying very good tell us what you suppose yourself to be doing at the present moment  waiving the offensive form of your question i answer purely as a matter of courtesy that i am engaged in the trituration of farinaceous substances whose ultimate destination it would be a breach of the trust reposed in me to reveal  fiddle said the waters we knew it all along the first direct question shows his ignorance of his own job listen old thing thanks to us you are now actuating a machine of whose construction you know nothing that that machine may over wires of whose ramifications you are by your very position profoundly ignorant deliver a power which you can never realise to localities beyond the extreme limits of your mental horizon with the object of producing phenomena which in your wildest dreams if you ever dream you could never comprehend is that clear or would you like it all in words of four syllables  your assumptions are deliciously sweeping but may i point out that a decent andthe dear old abbot of wilton would have put it in his resonant monkish latin much better than i cana scholarly reserve does not necessarily connote blank vacuity of mind on all subjects  ah the dear old abbot of wilton said the rat sympathetically as one nursed in that bosom charmin fellowthorough scholar and gentleman such a pity  oh sacred fountains the waters were fairly boiling he goes out of his way to expose his ignorance by triple bucketfuls he creaks to high heaven that he is hopelessly behind the common order of things he invites the streams of five watersheds to witness his sususupernal incompetence and then he talks as though there were untold reserves of knowledge behind him that he is too modest to bring forward for a bland circular absolutely sincere impostor youre a miracle o wheel  i do not pretend to be anything more than an integral portion of an accepted and not altogether mushroom institution  quite so said the waters then go roundhard  to what end asked the wheel  till a big box of tanks in your house begins to fizz and fumegassing is the proper word  it would be said the cat sniffing  that will show that your accumulators are full when the accumulators are exhausted and the lights burn badly you will find us whacking you round and round again  the end of life as decreed by mangles and his creatures is to go whacking round and round for ever said the cat  in order the rat said that you may throw raw and unnecessary illumination upon all the unloveliness in the world unloveliness which we shallerhave always with us at the same time you will riotously neglect the socalled little but vital graces that make up life  yes life said the cat with its dim delicious halftones and veiled indeterminate distances its surprisals escapes encounters and dizzying leapsits fullthroated choruses in honour of the morning star and its melting reveries beneath the sunwarmed wall  oh you can go on the tiles pussalina just the same as usual said the laughing waters we shant interfere with you  on the tiles forsooth hissed the cat  well thats what it amounts to persisted the waters we see a good deal of the minor graces of life on our way down to our job  andbut i fear i speak to deaf earsdo they never impress you said the wheel  enormously said the waters we have already learned six refined synonyms for loafing  but here again i feel as though preaching in the wilderness it never occurs to you that there may exist some small difference between the wholly animalahrumination of bovine minds and the discerning well apportioned leisure of the finer type of intellect  oh yes the bovine mind goes to sleep under a hedge and makes no bones about it when its shouted at weve seen thatin hayingtimeall along the meadows the finer type is wide awake enough to fudge up excuses for shirking and mean enough to get stuffy when its excuses arent accepted turn over  but my good people no gentleman gets stuffy as you call it a certain proper pride to put it no higher forbids  nothing that he wants to do if he really wants to do it get along what are you giving us dyou suppose weve scoured half heaven in the clouds and half earth in the mists to be taken in at this time of the day by a boneidle old handquern of your type  it is not for me to bandy personalities with you i can only say that i simply decline to accept the situation  decline away it doesnt make any odds theyll probably put in a turbine if you decline too much  whats a turbine said the wheel quickly  a little thing you dont see that performs surprising revolutions but you wont decline youll hang on to your two nice redstrapped axles and your new machinemoulded pinions likealike a leech on a lily stem theres centuries of work in your old bones if youd only apply yourself to it and mechanically an overshot wheel with this head of water is about as efficient as a turbine  so in future i am to be considered mechanically i have been painted by at least five royal academicians  oh you can be painted by five hundred when you arent at work of course but while you are at work youll work you wont halfstop and think and talk about rare plants and dickybirds and farinaceous fiduciary interests youll continue to revolve and this new head of water will see that you do so continue  it is a matter on which it would be exceedingly illadvised to form a hasty or a premature conclusion i will give it my most careful consideration said the wheel  please do said the waters gravely hullo heres the miller again  the cat coiled herself in a picturesque attitude on the softest corner of a sack and the rat without haste yet certainly without rest slipped behind the sacking as though an appointment had just occurred to him  in the doorway with the young engineer stood the miller grinning amazedly  wellwellwell tis truely wonerful an what a power o dirt it come over me now looking at these lights that ive never rightly seen my own mill before she needs a lot bein done to her  ah i suppose one must make oneself moderately agreeable to the baser sort they have their uses this thing controls the dairy the cat pincing on her toes came forward and rubbed her head against the millers knee  ay you pretty puss he said stooping youre as big a cheat as the rest of em that catch no mice about me a wonerful smoothskinned roughtongued cheat you be ive more than half a mind  she does her work well said the engineer pointing to where the rats beady eyes showed behind the sacking cats and rats livin together see  too much they dotoo long theyve done im sick and tired of it go and take a swim and larn to find your own vittles honest when you come out pussy  my word said the waters as a sprawling cat landed all unannounced in the centre of the tailrace is that you mewsalina you seem to have been quarrelling with your best friend get over to the left its shallowest there up on that alderroot with all four paws goodnight  youll never get any they rats said the miller as the young engineer struck wrathfully with his stick at the sacking theyre not the common sort theyre the old black english sort  are they by jove i must catch one to stuff some day                                six months later in the chill of a january afternoon they were letting in the waters as usual  come along its both gears this evening said the wheel kicking joyously in the first rush of the icy stream theres a heavy load of grist just in from lambers wood eleven miles it came in an hour and a half in our new motorlorry and the millers rigged five new fivecandle lights in his cowstables im feeding em tonight theres a cow due to calve oh while i think of it whats the news from callton rise  the waters are finding their level as usualbut why do you ask said the deep outpouring waters  because mangles and felden and the miller are talking of increasing the plant here and running a sawmill by electricity i was wondering whether we  i beg your pardon said the waters chuckling what did you say  whether we of course had power enough for the job it will be a biggish contract theres all harpenden brook to be considered and battens ponds as well and witches fountain and the churts hawd system  weve power enough for anything in the world said the waters the only question is whether you could stand the strain if we came down on you full head  of course i can said the wheel mangles is going to turn me into a set of turbinesbeauties  oheri suppose its the frost that has made us a little thickheaded but to whom are we talking asked the amazed waters  to methe spirit of the mill of course  not to the old wheel then  i happen to be living in the old wheel just at present when the turbines are installed i shall go and live in them what earthly difference does it make  absolutely none said the waters in the earth or in the waters under the earth but we thought turbines didnt appeal to you  not like turbines me my dear fellows turbines are good for fifteen hundred revolutions a minuteand with our power we can drive em at full speed why theres nothing we couldnt grind or saw or illuminate or heat with a set of turbines thats to say if all the five watersheds are agreeable  oh weve been agreeable for ever so long  then why didnt you tell me  dont know suppose it slipped our memory  the waters were holding themselves in for fear of bursting with mirth  how careless of you you should keep abreast of the age my dear fellows we might have settled it long ago if youd only spoken yes four good turbines and a neat brick penstockeh this old wheels absurdly out of date  well said the cat who after a little proud seclusion had returned to her place impenitent as ever praised be pasht and the old gods that whatever may have happened i at least have preserved the spirit of the mill  she looked round as expecting her faithful ally the black rat but that very week the engineer had caught and stuffed him and had put him in a glass case he being a genuine old english black rat that breed the report says is rapidly diminishing before the incursions of the brown variety
