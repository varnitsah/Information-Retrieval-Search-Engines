    preface   the romantic poets rediscovered a pastoral and biblical dream that a child was the most innocent and the wisest of us all wordsworth hailed him as mighty prophet seer blest and in the next generation victorian novelists took that dream seriously enough to make children the heroes and heroines of their most searching fictions there had been no childrens literature to speak of before except for the oral and popular tradition including lullabies and mother goose some of which go back as far as tudor and even medieval times  childrens literature today is an immense and complex domain and leaving aside for the present the works composed by children themselves what remains varies tremendously in skill and delight as well as in subtlety and intention so i shall also set aside those minimal vocabularybuilding tales and verses whose small virtues are rarely more than therapeutic and direct myself only to that specialized but most important categorypoems written by a skilled and adult poet but addressed to an audience of children who are likely to be read to until they are skillful enough to read the same verses for themselves  the dangers for the poet in addressing so composite an audience are enormous cuteness coyness archness and condescension are only the most obvious ones some great writers of childrens verselewis carroll and edward learhave successfully hedged themselves against these dangers by insistent comedy and parody carrolls serious childrens verse is maudlin and embarrassing by this means they have contrived what the child will take as lovely unintimidating mysterious rational nonsense and what the adult will recognize as a travesty or burlesque of something very edgy indeed thus lears the dong with the luminous nose and carrolls jabberwocky are respectively bright and disguised versions of gothic terror and misery on the one hand and medieval knightly exploit on the other both rendered innocuous for the nursery and ridiculous for the adult the risks of seriousness have been successfully avoided  the poetry of walter de la mare sings boldly and beautifully without any of these hedges and condescensions his work has the honest candor of the border ballads and the fairy tales as well as unmitigated joys they are full of the dangers and horrors and sorrows that every child soon knows to be part of the world however vainly parents try to veil them a childs curiosity about the forbidden will insist on being satisfied and better by verse than otherwise this poetry is also musically astute and demanding it may surprise and alert the parental reader and it has its share of archaisms and poeticisms which contrary to adult surmise bemuse and fascinate children and it must be admitted that it is also relentlessly british but then so is much good childrens literature  as a poet he was also a gifted novelist and shortstory writer de la mare was praised by t s eliot the delicate invisible web you wove and by w h auden there are no good poems which are only for children his technical and linguistic skills are not as auden rightly points out a matter of indifference to children who are in the very business of learning language as well as other facts of life and who are particularly sensitive to verbal rhythms as iona and peter opie have splendidly demonstrated in the lore and language of schoolchildren  just as important this is a poetry of charms and spells witches and dwarfs ogres and fairies full of dangers omens riddles and triumphs in the ogre for example two sleeping children are about to be plucked by an enormous ogre from their home      into their dreams no shadow fell       of his disastrous thumb     groping discreet and gradual       across the quiet room  but he is stopped spellbound abashed and defeated by the mother of the children who is in another room and all unaware of the danger is singing a version of the coventry carol which in its original is addressed to the christ child as a lullaby to her newborn baby  i would guess that any child fortunate enough to grow up with these poems ringing in memorys ear might have a remarkable reservoir of music and excitement available to him that is not a small gift  anthony hecht   anthony hecht teaches in the english department of the university of rochester he is the author of several books of poetry of

   the gnomies       as i lay awake in the white moonlight     i heard a sweet singing in the wood           out of bed           sleepyhead           put your white foot now           here are we           neath the tree           singing round the root now      i looked out of window in the white moonlight     the trees were like snow in the wood           come away           child and play           light wi the gnomies           in a mound           green and round           thats where their home is           honey sweet           curds to eat           cream and frumènty           shells and beads           poppy seeds           you shall have plenty      but soon as i stooped in the dim moonlight     to put on my stocking and my shoe     the sweet sweet singing died sadly away     and the light of the morning peepd through     then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin     to sing of the buttercups and dew         bluebells       where the bluebells and the wind are     fairies in a ring i spied     and i heard a little linnet     singing near beside      where the primrose and the dew are     soon were sped the fairies all     only now the green turf freshens     and the linnets call         lovelocks       i watched the lady caroline     bind up her dark and beauteous hair     her face was rosy in the glass     and twixt the coils her hands would pass         white in the candleshine      her bottles on the table lay     stoppered yet sweet of violet     her image in the mirror stooped     to view those locks as lightly looped         as cherryboughs in may      the snowy night lay dim without     i heard the waits their sweet song sing     the window smouldered keen with frost     yet still she twisted sleeked and tossed         her beauteous hair about         o dear me       here are crocuses white gold grey       o dear me says marjorie may     flat as a platter the blackberry blows       o dear me says madeleine rose     the leaves are

sparrows     they carried in cages of wicker along     till a hawk from his eyrie     swooped down like an arrow     and smote on the cages and ended their song      i saw three witches     that sailed in a shallop     all turning their heads with a truculent smile     till a bank of green osiers     concealed their grim faces     though i heard them lamenting for many a mile      i saw three witches     asleep in a valley     their heads in a row like stones in a flood     till the moon creeping upward     looked white through the valley     and turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud

ere yet the dawn with firelight fills     the nightdew of the bramblecup     i heard the fairies in a ring     sing as they tripped a lilting round     soft as the moon on wavering wing     the starlight shook as if with sound     as if with echoing and the stars     prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams     while red with war the gusty mars     rained upon earth his ruddy beams     he shone alone adown the west     while i behind a hawthornbush     watched on the fairies flaxentressed     the fires of the morning flush     till as a mist their beauty died     their singing shrill and fainter grew     and daylight tremulous and wide     flooded the moorland through and through     till urdons copper weathercock     was reared in golden flame afar     and dim from moonlit dreams awoke     the towers and groves of arroar         reverie       when slim sophia mounts her horse        and paces down the avenue     it seems an inward melody          she paces to      each narrow hoof is lifted high       beneath the dark enclustring pines     a silver ray within his bit         and bridle shines      his eye burns deep his tail is arched       and streams upon the shadowy air     the daylight sleeks his jetty flanks         his mistress hair      her habit flows in darkness down       upon the stirrup rests her foot     her brow is lifted as if earth         she heeded not      tis silent in the avenue       the sombre pines are mute of song     the blue is dark there moves no breeze         the boughs among      when slim sophia mounts her horse       and paces down the avenue     it seems an inward melody         she paces to         the three beggars       twas autumn daybreak gold and wild       while past st anns grey tower they shuffled     three beggars spied a fairychild         in crimson mantle muffled      the daybreak lighted up her face       all pink and sharp and emeraldeyed     she looked on them a little space         and shrill as hautboy cried      o three tall footsore men of rags       which walking this gold morn i see     what will ye give me from your bags         for fairy kisses three      the first that was a reddish man       out of his bundle takes a crust     la by the tombstones of st ann         theres fee if fee ye must      the second that was a chesnut man       out of his bundle draws a bone     la by the belfry of st ann         and all my breakfast gone      the third that was a yellow man       out of his bundle picks a groat     la by the angel of st ann         and i must go without      that changeling lean and icylipped       touched crust and bone and groat and lo     beneath her finger tapertipped         the magic all ran through      instead of crust a peacock pie       instead

the lattice small     and spied two children which did lie       asleep against the wall      into their dreams no shadow fell       of his disastrous thumb     groping discreet and gradual       across the quiet room      but scarce his nail had scraped the cot       wherein these children lay     as if his malice were forgot       it suddenly did stay      for faintly in the inglenook

gloating evil side by side     terror and hate brood oer the place     he flings his withered hands on high     with a bitter breaking cry      leave me leave me leave me leave me         ye three wild fiends     if i lay me down in slumber       then i lay me down in wrath     if i stir not in sweet dreaming       then i wither in my path     if i hear sweet voices singing         tis a demons

forlorn o      ay as it were a bud did break     to loveliness for aëries sake       so she in beauty moving         rides at his hand         across his land       beloved as well as loving         as lucy went awalking       as lucy went awalking one wintry morning fine     there sate three crows upon a bough and three times three is nine     then o said lucy in the snow its very plain to see     a witch has been awalking in the fields in front of me      then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow     and plucked a bunch of eldertwigs that near a pool did grow     and by and by she comes to seven shadows in one place     all stretched by seven poplartrees against the suns bright face      she looks to left she looks to right and in the midst she sees     a little well of water clear and frozen neath the trees     then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels     and hears a magic belfry aringing with sweet bells      but when the belfry ceased to sound yet nothing could she see     save only frozen water in the shadow of the tree     but presently she lifted up her eyes along the snow     and sees a witch in brindled shawl afrisking to and fro      her shoes were buckled scarlet that capered to and fro     and all her rusty locks were wreathed with twisted mistletoe     but never a dint or mark or print in the whiteness for to see     though danced she high though danced she fast though danced she         lissomely      it seemed twas diamonds in the air or little flakes of frost     it seemed twas golden smoke around or sunbeams lightly tost     it seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose     nay lucy said it is the wind that through the branches flows      and as she peeps and as she peeps tis no more one but three     and eye of bat and downy wing of owl within the tree     and the bells of that sweet belfry apealing as before     and now it is not three she sees and now it is not four      o who are ye sweet lucy cries that in a dreadful ring     all muffled up in brindled shawls do caper frisk and spring     a witch and witches one and nine they straight to her reply     and looked upon her narrowly with green and needle eye      then lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherrytrees upgrow     and bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow     she smells all faint the almondboughs that blow so wild and fair     and doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air      clear flowrs she sees like tulip buds go floating by like birds     with wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words     and as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung     and clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung      o witches nine ye dreadful nine o witches seven and three     whence come these wondrous things that i this christmas morning see     but straight as in a clap when she of christmas says the word     here is the snow and there the sun but never bloom nor bird      nor warbling flame nor gloamingrope of amethyst there shows     nor bunches of green emeralds nor belfry well and rose     nor cloud of gold nor cherrytree nor witch in brindled shawl     but like a dream which vanishes so vanished were they all      when lucy sees and only sees three crows upon a bough     and earthly twigs and bushes hidden white in driven snow     then o said lucy three times three is ninei plainly see     some witch has been awalking in the fields in front of me         the englishman       i met a sailor in the woods       a silver ring wore he     his hair hung black his eyes shone blue       and thus he said to me      what country say of this round earth       what shore of what salt sea     be this my son i wander in       and looks so strange to me      says i o foreign sailorman       in england now you be     this is her wood and this her sky       and that her roaring sea      he lifts his voice yet louder       what smell be this says he     my nose on the sharp morning air       snuffs up so greedily      says i it is wild roses       do smell so winsomely     and winy briar too says i       that in these thickets be      and oh says he what leetle bird       is singing in yon high tree     so every shrill and longdrawn note       like bubbles breaks in me      says i it is the mavis       that perches in the tree     and sings so shrill and sings so sweet       when dawn comes up the sea      at which he fell amusing       and fixed his eye on me     as one alone twixt light and dark       a spirit thinks to see      england he whispers soft and harsh       england repeated he     and briar and rose and mavis       asinging in yon high tree      ye speak me true my leetle son       soso it came to me     adrifting landwards on a spar       and grey dawn on the sea      ay ay i could not be mistook       i knew them leafy trees     i knew that land so witcherie sweet       and that old noise of seas      though here ive sailed a score of years       and heard em dream or wake     lap small and hollow gainst my cheek       on sand and coral break      yet now my leetle son says i       adrifting on the wave     that land i see so safe and green       is england i believe      and that there wood is english wood       and this here cruel sea     the selfsame old blue ocean       years gone remembers me      asitting with my bread and butter       down ahind yon chitterin mill     and this same marinerethats me       is that same leetle will      that very same wee leetle will       eating his bread and butter there     alooking on the broad blue sea       betwixt his yaller hair      and here be i my son throwed up       like corpses from the sea     ships stars winds tempests pirates past       yet leetle will i be      he said no more that sailorman       but in a reverie     stared like the figure of a ship       with painted eyes to sea         the phantom       upstairs in the large closet child       this side the blueroom door     is an old bible bound in leather       standing upon the floor      go with this taper bring it me       carry it on your arm     it is the book on many a sea       hath stilled the waves alarm      late the hour dark the night       the house is solitary     feeble is a tapers light       to light poor ann to see      her eyes are yet with visions bright       of sylph and river flower and fay     now through a narrow corridor       she takes her lonely way      vast shadows on the heedless walls       gigantic loom stoop low     each little hasty footfall calls       hollowly to and fro      in the dim solitude her heart       remembers tearlessly     white winters when her mother was       her loving company      now in the dark clear glass she sees       a taper mocking hers     a phantom face of light blue eyes       reflecting phantom fears      around her loom the vacant rooms       wind the upward stairs     she climbs on into a loneliness       only her taper shares      her grandmother is deaf with age       a garden of moonless trees     would answer not though she should cry       in anguish on her knees      so that she scarcely heedsso fast       her pentup heart doth beat     when faint along the corridor       falleth the sound of feet      sounds lighter than silk slippers make       upon a ballroom floor when sweet

pale as the malmsey wine     their bowls were three and their beds were three       and their nightcaps white were nine      their beds were of the hollywood       their combs of the tortoiseshell     their mirrors clear as wintry flood       frozen dark and snell      so each would lie on his plumpy pillow       the moon for company     and hear the parrot scream to the billow       and the billow roar reply      sulphur parrots and parrots red       scarlet and flame and green     and fivefoot apes that jargonèd       in featherytufted treen      and oh or ever the dawning shed       on dreams

  and blew in their twisted shells      dark was the sea they gambolled in       and thick with silver fish     dark as green glass blown clear and thin       to be a monarchs dish      they sate to

 into their bowls of cream they dipped       whipt light and white as foam      alliolyle where the salt sea flows       taught three old apes to sing     and there to the moon like a fullblown rose       they capered in a ring      but down to the shore skipped lallerie       his parrot on his thumb     and the twain they scritched in mockery       while the dancers go and come      so alas in the evening rosy and still       lighthaired lallerie     bitterly quarrelled with alliolyle       by the yellowsanded sea      the rising moon swam sweet and large       before their furious eyes     and they rolled and rolled to the coral marge       where the surf for ever cries      too late too late comes muziomone       clear in the clear green sea     alliolyle lies not alone       but clasped

in three white beds       and nightcaps one and nine     on moonlit pillows lay three heads       bemused with dwarfish wine      a tomb of coral the dirge of bee       the grey apes guttural groan

flits the moth on filmy wings       into his solitary lair     shrill evensong the cricket sings       from some still shadow in her hair      in heat in snow in wind in flood       she sleeps in

a warrior       his brow is seamed with line and scar       his cheek is red and dark as wine     the fires as of a northern star       beneath his cap of sable shine      his right hand bared of leathern glove       hangs open like an iron gin     you stoop to see his pulses move       to hear the blood sweep out and in      he looks some king so solitary       in earnest thought he seems to stand     as if across a lonely sea       he gazed impatient of the land      out of the noisy centuries       the foolish and the fearful fade     yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes       time

 there went a thin voice piping airs       along the grey and crooked walks     a garden of thistledown and tares       bright leaves and giant stalks      the twilight rain shone at its gates       where longleaved grass in shadow grew     and black in silence to her mates       a voiceless raven flew      lichen and moss the lone stones greened       green paths led lightly to its door     keen from her lair the spider leaned       and dusk to darkness wore      amidst the sedge a whisper ran       the west shut down a heavy eye     and like last tapers few and wan       the watchstars kindled in the sky         the ravens tomb       build me my tomb the raven said     within the dark yewtree     so in the autumn yewberries     sad lamps may burn for me     summon the haunted beetle

whistling in tears my name     let the round dew a whisper make     welling on twig and thorn     and only the grey cock at night     call through his silver horn     and you dear sisters don your

the clear heavenly water he     sleeps on unwitting oft his little breast     heaving so tenderly      i carried you     my little ann long since on this same quest     and from the painted windows a pale hue     lit golden on your breast      and then you woke     chill as the holy water trickled down     and weeping cast the window a strange look     half smile half infant frown      i scarce

beseeching me     meekly and brave and her brown breast     throbbd hot and quick above her heart     and then she oped her dagger bill     twas not a chirp as sparrows pipe     at break of day twas not a trill     as falters through the quiet even     but one sharp solitary note     one desperate fierce and vivid cry     of valiant tears and hopeless joy     one passionate note of victory     off like a fool afraid i sneaked     smiling the smile the fool smiles best     at the mother bird in the secret hedge     patient upon her lonely nest         the child in the story goes to bed
