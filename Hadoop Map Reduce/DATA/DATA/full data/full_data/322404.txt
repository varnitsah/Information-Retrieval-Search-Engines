322404	captains all  by ww jacobs    captains all  illustration captains all  every sailorman grumbles about the sea said the nightwatchman thoughtfully  its human nature to grumble and i spose they keep on grumbling and sticking to it because there aint much else they can do theres not many shoregoing berths that a sailorman is fit for and those that they aresuch as a nightwatchmans for instancewants such a good character that theres few as are to equal it  sometimes they get things to do ashore  i knew one man that took up butchering and e did very well at it till the police took him up another man i knew gave up the sea to marry a washerwoman and they hadnt been married six months afore she died and back he ad to go to sea agin pore chap  a man who used to grumble awful about the sea was old sam smalla man ive spoke of to you before  to hear im go on about the sea arter he ad spent four or five months money in a fortnight was artbreaking he used to ask us wot was going to happen to im in his old age and when we pointed out that he wouldnt be likely to ave any old age if he wasnt more careful of imself he used to fly into a temper and call us everything e could lay his tongue to  one time when e was ashore with peter russet and ginger dick he seemed to ave got it on the brain  he started being careful of is money instead o spending it and three mornings running he bought a newspaper and read the advertisements to see whether there was any comfortable berth for a strong goodarted man wot didnt like work  he actually went arter one situation and if it hadnt ha been for seventynine other men he said he believed hed ha had a good chance of getting it  as it was all e got was a black eye for shoving another man and for a day or two he was so downarted that e was no company at all for the other two  for three or four days e went out by imself and then all of a sudden ginger dick and peter began to notice a great change in him  he seemed to ave got quite cheerful and appy  he answered em back pleasant when they spoke to im and one night he lay in is bed whistling comic songs until ginger and peter russet ad to get out o bed to him  when he bought a new necktie and a smart cap and washed imself twice in one day they fust began to ask each other wot was up and then they asked him  up ses sam nothing  hes in love ses peter russet  youre a liar ses sam without turning round  hell ave it bad at is age ses ginger  sam didnt say nothing but he kept fidgeting about as though ed got something on his mind  fust he looked out o the winder then he ummed a tune and at last looking at em very fierce he took a toothbrush wrapped in paper out of is pocket and began to clean is teeth  he is in love ses ginger as soon as he could speak  or else es gorn mad ses peter watching im  which is it sam  sam made believe that he couldnt answer im because o the toothbrush and arter hed finished he ad such a raging toothache that e sat in a corner holding is face and looking the pictur o misery  they couldnt get a word out of him till they asked im to go out with them and then he said e was going to bed  twenty minutes arterwards when ginger dick stepped back for is pipe he found he ad gorn  he tried the same game next night but the other two wouldnt ave it and they stayed in so long that at last e lost is temper and arter wondering wot gingers father and mother could ha been athinking about and saying that he believed peter russet ad been changed at birth for a seasick monkey he put on is cap and went out  both of em follered im sharp but when he led em to a missionhall and actually went inside they left im and went off on their own  they talked it over that night between themselves and next evening they went out fust and hid themselves round the corner  ten minutes arterwards old sam came out walking as though e was going to catch a train and smiling to think ow he ad shaken them off  at the corner of commercial road he stopped and bought imself a buttonhole for is coat and ginger was so surprised that e pinched peter russet to make sure that he wasnt dreaming  old sam walked straight on whistling and every now and then looking down at is buttonhole until byandby he turned down a street on the right and went into a little shop  ginger dick and peter waited for im at the corner but he was inside for so long that at last they got tired o waiting and crept up and peeped through the winder  it was a little tobacconists shop with newspapers and penny toys and suchlike but as far as ginger could see through two rows o pipes and the police news it was empty  they stood there with their noses pressed against the glass for some time wondering wot had appened to sam but byandby a little boy went in and then they began to ave an idea wot sams little game was  as the shopbell went the door of a little parlour at the back of the shop opened and a stout and uncommon goodlooking woman of about forty came out  her ead pushed the police news out o the way and her and came groping into the winder arter a toy  ginger ad a good look at er out o the corner of one eye while he pretended to be looking at a tobaccojar with the other  as the little boy came out im and peter russet went in  i want a pipe please he ses smiling at er a clay pipeone o your best  the woman handed im down a box to choose from and just then peter wot ad been staring in at the arfopen door at a boot wot wanted lacing up gave a big start and ses why  halloa  wots the matter ses the woman looking at im  id know that foot anywhere ses peter still staring at it and the words was hardly out of is mouth afore the foot ad moved itself away and tucked itself under its chair  why thats my dear old friend sam small aint it  do you know the captin ses the woman smiling at im  cap ses peter  cap  oh yes why hes the biggest friend ive got  ow strange ses the woman  weve been wanting to see im for some time ses ginger  he was kind enough to lend me arf a crown the other day and ive been wanting to pay im  captin small ses the woman pushing open the door heres some old friends o yours  old sam turned is face round and looked at em and if looks could ha killed as the saying is theyd ha been dead men there and then  oh yes he ses in a choking voice ow are you  pretty well thank you captin ses ginger grinning at im and ows yourself arter all this long time  he held out is hand and sam shook it and then shook ands with peter russet who was grinning so ard that he couldnt speak  these are two old friends o mine mrs finch ses old sam giving em a warning look captin dick and captin russet two o the oldest and best friends a man ever ad  captin dick as got arf a crown for you ses peter russet still grinning  there now ses ginger looking vexed if i aint been and forgot it ive ony got arf a sovereign  i can give you change sir ses mrs finch  praps youd like to sit down for five minutes  ginger thanked er and im and peter russet took a chair apiece in front o the fire and began asking old sam about is ealth and wot hed been doing since they saw im last  fancy your reckernizing his foot ses mrs finch coming in with the change  id know it anywhere ses peter who was watching ginger pretending to give sam small the arfdollar and sam pretending in a most lifelike manner to take it  ginger dick looked round the room  it was a comfortable little place with pictures on the walls and antimacassars on all the chairs and a row of pink vases on the mantelpiece  then e looked at mrs finch and thought wot a nicelooking woman she was  this is nicer than being aboard ship with a crew o nasty troublesome sailormen to look arter captin small he ses  its wonderful the way he manages em ses peter russet to mrs finch like a lion he is  a roaring lion ses ginger looking at sam  he dont know wot fear is  sam began to smile and mrs finch looked at im so pleased that peter russet who ad been looking at er and the room and thinking much the same way as ginger began to think that they was on the wrong tack  afore e got stout and old he ses shaking his ead there wasnt a smarter skipper afloat  we all ave our day ses ginger shaking his ead too  i dessay hes good for another year or two afloat yet ses peter russet considering  with care ses ginger  old sam was going to say something but e stopped himself just in time they will ave their joke he ses turning to mrs finch and trying to smile  i feel as young as ever i did  mrs finch said that anybody with arf an eye could see that and then she looked at a kettle that was singing on the ob  i spose you gentlemen wouldnt care for a cup o cocoa she ses turning to them  ginger dick and peter both said that they liked it better than anything else and arter she ad got out the cups and saucers and a tin o cocoa ginger held the kettle and poured the water in the cups while she stirred them and old sam sat looking on elpless  it does seem funny to see you drinking cocoa captin ses ginger as old sam took his cup  ho ses sam firing up and why if i might make so bold as to ask  cos ive generally seen you drinking something out of a bottle ses ginger  now look ere ses sam starting up and spilling some of the hot cocoa over is lap  a gingerbeer bottle ses peter russet making faces at ginger to keep quiet  yes o course thats wot i meant ses ginger  old sam wiped the cocoa off is knees without saying a word but his weskit kept going up and down till peter russet felt quite sorry for im  theres nothing like it he ses to mrs finch  it was by sticking to gingerbeer and milk and suchlike that captain small ad command of a ship afore e was twentyfive  lor ses mrs finch  she smiled at old sam till peter got uneasy agin and began to think praps ed been praising im too much  of course im speaking of long ago now he ses  years and years afore you was born maam ses ginger  old sam was going to say something but mrs finch looked so pleased that e thought better of it  some o the cocoa e was drinking went the wrong way and then ginger patted im on the back and told im to be careful not to bring on is brownchitis agin  wot with temper and being afraid to speak for fear they should let mrs finch know that e wasnt a captin he could ardly bear imself but he very near broke out when peter russet advised im to ave his weskit lined with red flannel  they all stayed on till closing time and by the time they left they ad made theirselves so pleasant that mrs finch said shed be pleased to see them any time they liked to look in  sam small waited till they ad turned the corner and then he broke out so alarming that they could ardly do anything with im  twice policemen spoke to im and advised im to go home afore they altered their minds and he ad to hold imself in and keep quiet while ginger and peter russet took is arms and said they were seeing him ome  he started the row agin when they got indoors and sat up in is bed smacking is lips over the things hed like to ave done to them if he could  and then arter saying ow hed like to see ginger boiled alive like a lobster he said he knew that e was a noblearted feller who wouldnt try and cut an old pal out and that it was a case of love at first sight on top of a tramcar  shes too young for you ses ginger and too goodlooking besides  its the nice little bisness hes fallen in love with ginger ses peter russet  ill toss you who as it  ginger who was siting on the foot o sams bed said no at fust but arter a time he pulled out arf a dollar and spun it in the air  that was the last e see of it although he ad sam out o bed and all the clothes stripped off of it twice  he spent over arf an hour on his ands and knees looking for it and sam said when he was tired of playing bears praps hed go to bed and get to sleep like a christian  they ad it all over agin next morning and at last as nobody would agree to keep quiet and let the others ave a fair chance they made up their minds to let the best man win  ginger dick bought a necktie that took all the colour out o sams and peter russet went in for a collar so big that e was lost in it  they all strolled into the widows shop separate that night  ginger dick ad smashed his pipe and wanted another peter russet wanted some tobacco and old sam small walked in smiling with a little silver brooch for er that he said e had picked up  it was a very nice brooch and mrs finch was so pleased with it that ginger and peter sat there as mad as they could be because they adnt thought of the same thing  captain small is very lucky at finding things ses ginger at last  hes got the name for it ses peter russet  its a handy abit ses ginger it saves spending money  who did you give that gold bracelet to you picked up the other night captin he ses turning to sam  gold bracelet ses sam  i didnt pick up no gold bracelet  wot are you talking about  all right captin no offence ses ginger holding up his and  i dreamt i saw one  on your mantelpiece i spose  praps i oughtnt to ha said anything about it  old sam looked as though hed like to eat im especially as he noticed mrs finch listening and pretending not to  oh that one he ses arter a bit o hard thinking  oh i found out who it belonged to  you wouldnt believe ow pleased they was at getting it back agin  ginger dick coughed and began to think as ow old sam was sharper than he ad given im credit for but afore he could think of anything else to say mrs finch looked at old sam and began to talk about is ship and to say ow much she should like to see over it  i wish i could take you ses sam looking at the other two out o the corner of his eye but my ships over at dunkirk in france  ive just run over to london for a week or two to look round  and mines there too ses peter russet speaking amost afore old sam ad finished side by side they lay in the harbour  oh dear ses mrs finch folding her ands and shaking her cad  i should like to go over a ship one arternoon  id quite made up my mind to it knowing three captins  she smiled and looked at ginger and sam and peter looked at im too wondering whether he was going to berth his ship at dunkirk alongside o theirs  ah i wish i

for me  she was a nice little ship though  i believe ive got er picture somewhere about me  he felt in is pocket and pulled out a little crumpledup photograph of a ship hed been fireman aboard of some years afore and showed it to er  thats me standing on the bridge he ses pointing out a little dot with the stem of is pipe  its your figger ses mrs finch straining her eyes  i should know it anywhere  youve got wonderful eyes maam ses old sam choking with is pipe  anybody can see that ses ginger  theyre the largest and the bluest ive ever seen  mrs finch told im not to talk nonsense but both sam and peter russet could see ow pleased she was  truth is truth ses ginger  im a plain man and i speak my mind  blue is my favrit colour ses old sam in a tender voice  true blue  peter russet began to feel out of it  i thought brown was he ses  ho ses sam turning on im and why  i ad my reasons ses peter nodding and shutting is mouth very firm  i thought brown was is favrit colour too ses ginger  i dont know why  its no use asking me because if you did i couldnt tell you  browns a very nice colour ses mrs finch wondering wot was the matter with old sam  blue ses ginger big blue eyestheyre the ones for me  other people may ave their blacks and their browns he ses looking at sam and peter russet but give me blue  they went on like that all the evening and every time the shopbell went and the widow ad to go out to serve a customer they said in wispers wot they thought of each other and once when she came back rather sudden ginger ad to explain to er that e was showing peter russet a scratch on his knuckle  ginger dick was the fust there next night and took er a little chiney teapot he ad picked up dirt cheap because it was cracked right acrost the middle but as he explained that he ad dropped it in hurrying to see er she was just as pleased  she stuck it up on the mantelpiece and the things she said about gingers kindness and generosity made peter russet spend good money that he wanted for imself on a painted flowerpot next evening  with three men all courting er at the same time mrs finch had er hands full but she took to it wonderful considering  she was so nice and kind to em all that even arter a weeks ard work none of em was really certain which she liked best  they took to going in at odd times o the day for tobacco and suchlike they used to go alone then but they all met and did the polite to each other there of an evening and then quarrelled all the way ome  then all of a sudden without any warning ginger dick and peter russet left off going there  the fust evening sam sat expecting them every minute and was so surprised that he couldnt take any advantage of it but on the second beginning by squeezing mrs finchs and at hapast seven he ad got best part of his arm round er waist by a quarter to ten  he didnt do more that night because she told him to beave imself and threatened to scream if he didnt leave off  he was arfway home afore e thought of the reason for ginger dick and peter russet giving up and then he went along smiling to imself to such an extent that people thought e was mad  he went off to sleep with the smile still on is lips and when peter and ginger came in soon arter closing time and e woke up and asked them where theyd been e was still smiling  i didnt ave the pleasure o seeing you at mrs finchs tonight he ses  no ses ginger very short  we got tired of it  so unealthy sitting in that stuffy little room every evening ses peter  old sam put his ead under the bedclothes and laughed till the bed shook and every now and then hed put his ead out and look at peter and ginger and laugh agin till he choked  i see ow it is he ses sitting up and wiping his eyes on the sheet well we cant all win  wot dye mean ses ginger very disagreeable  she wouldnt ave you sam thats wot i mean and i dont wonder at it  i wouldnt ave you if i was a gal  youre dreaming ses peter russet sneering at im  that flowerpot o yoursll come in

not quite but im going to ses sam and ill bet you even arfcrowns she ses yes  ginger wouldnt take im and no more would peter not even when he raised it to five shillings and the vain way old sam lay

sam  when i think of the evenings ive wasted over a fat old woman i feel  thatll do ses old sam very sharp that aint the way to speak of a lady even if she as said no  all right sam ses ginger  you go

civil to him  he went off amost direckly arter breakfast and they didnt see im agin till twelve oclock that night  he ad brought a bottle o whisky in with im and he was so appy that they see plain wot
