13808635	hunted down  by charles dickens    i   most of us see some romances in life  in my capacity as chief manager of a life assurance office i think i have within the last thirty years seen more romances than the generality of men however unpromising the opportunity may at first sight seem  as i have retired and live at my ease i possess the means that i used to want of considering what i have seen at leisure  my experiences have a more remarkable aspect so reviewed than they had when they were in progress  i have come home from the play now and can recall the scenes of the drama upon which the curtain has fallen free from the glare bewilderment and bustle of the theatre  let me recall one of these romances of the real world  there is nothing truer than physiognomy taken in connection with manner  the art of reading that book of which eternal wisdom obliges every human creature to present his or her own page with the individual character written on it is a difficult one perhaps and is little studied  it may require some natural aptitude and it must require for everything does some patience and some pains  that these are not usually given to it  that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of the face as the whole list of characteristics and neither seek nor know the refinements that are truest  that you for instance give a great deal of time and attention to the reading of music greek latin french italian hebrew if you please and do not qualify yourself to read the face of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to you  i assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable  perhaps a little selfsufficiency may be at the bottom of this facial expression requires no study from you you think it comes by nature to you to know enough about it and you are not to be taken in  i confess for my part that i have been taken in over and over again  i have been taken in by acquaintances and i have been taken in of course by friends far oftener by friends than by any other class of persons  how came i to be so deceived  had i quite misread their faces  no  believe me my first impression of those people founded on face and manner alone was invariably true  my mistake was in suffering them to come nearer to me and explain themselves away    ii   the partition which separated my own office from our general outer office in the city was of thick plateglass  i could see through it what passed in the outer office without hearing a word  i had it put up in place of a wall that had been there for years  ever since the house was built  it is no matter whether i did or did not make the change in order that i might derive my first impression of strangers who came to us on business from their faces alone without being influenced by anything they said enough to mention that i turned my glass partition to that account and that a life assurance office is at all times exposed to be practised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race  it was through my glass partition that i first saw the gentleman whose story i am going to tell  he had come in without my observing it and had put his hat and umbrella on the broad counter and was bending over it to take some papers from one of the clerks  he was about forty or so dark exceedingly well dressed in black  being in mourning  and the hand he extended with a polite air had a particularly wellfitting blackkid glove upon it  his hair which was elaborately brushed and oiled was parted straight up the middle and he presented this parting to the clerk exactly to my thinking as if he had said in so many words you must take me if you please my friend just as i show myself  come straight up here follow the gravel path keep off the grass i allow no trespassing  i conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment i thus saw him  he had asked for some of our printed forms and the clerk was giving them to him and explaining them  an obliged and agreeable smile was on his face and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look  i have known a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in the face  dont trust that conventional idea  dishonesty will stare honesty out of countenance any day in the week if there is anything to be got by it  i saw in the corner of his eyelash that he became aware of my looking at him  immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass partition as if he said to me with a sweet smile straight up here if you please  off the grass  in a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella and was gone  i beckoned the clerk into my room and asked who was that  he had the gentlemans card in his hand  mr julius slinkton middle temple  a barrister mr adams  i think not sir  i should have thought him a clergyman but for his having no reverend here said i  probably from his appearance mr adams replied he is reading for orders  i should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat and dainty linen altogether  what did he want mr adams  merely a form of proposal sir and form of reference  recommended here  did he say  yes he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours  he noticed you but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal acquaintance he would not trouble you  did he know my name  o yes sir  he said there is mr sampson i see  a wellspoken gentleman apparently  remarkably so sir  insinuating manners apparently  very much so indeed sir  hah said i  i want nothing at present mr adams  within a fortnight of that day i went to dine with a friend of mine a merchant a man of taste who buys pictures and books and the first man i saw among the company was mr julius slinkton there he was standing before the fire with good large eyes and an open expression of face but still i thought requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way he offered and by no other  i noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to mr sampson and my friend did so  mr slinkton was very happy to see me  not too happy there was no overdoing of the matter happy in a thoroughly wellbred perfectly unmeaning way  i thought you had met our host observed  no said mr slinkton  i did look in at mr sampsons office on your recommendation but i really did not feel justified in troubling mr sampson himself on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary clerk  i said i should have been glad to show him any attention on our friends introduction  i am sure of that said he and am much obliged  at another time perhaps i may be less delicate  only however if i have real business for i know mr sampson how precious business time is and what a vast number of impertinent people there are in the world  i acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow  you were thinking said i of effecting a policy on your life  o dear no  i am afraid i am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment of supposing me to be mr sampson  i merely inquired for a friend  but you know what friends are in such matters nothing may ever come of it  i have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries for friends knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the friends will never follow them up  people are so fickle so selfish so inconsiderate  dont you in your business find them so every day mr sampson  i was going to give a qualified answer but he turned his smooth white parting on me with its straight up here if you please and i answered yes  i hear mr sampson he resumed presently for our friend had a new cook and dinner was not so punctual as usual that your profession has recently suffered a great loss  in money said i  he laughed at my ready association of loss with money and replied no in talent and vigour  not at once following out his allusion i considered for a moment has it sustained a loss of that kind said i  i was not aware of it  understand me mr sampson  i dont imagine that you have retired  it is not so bad as that  but mr meltham    o to be sure said i  yes  mr meltham the young actuary of the inestimable  just so he returned in a consoling way  he is a great loss  he was at once the most profound the most original and the most energetic man i have ever known connected with life assurance  i spoke strongly for i had a high esteem and admiration for meltham and my gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he wanted to sneer at him  he recalled me to my guard by presenting that trim pathway up his head with its internal not on the grass if you please  the gravel  you knew him mr slinkton  only by reputation  to have known him as an acquaintance or as a friend is an honour i should have sought if he had remained in society though i might never have had the good fortune to attain it being a man of far inferior mark  he was scarcely above thirty i suppose  about thirty  ah he sighed in his former consoling way  what creatures we are  to break up mr sampson and become incapable of business at that time of life  any reason assigned for the melancholy fact  humph thought i as i looked at him  but i wont go up the track and i will go on the grass  what reason have you heard assigned mr slinkton i asked pointblank  most likely a false one  you know what rumour is mr sampson  i never repeat what i hear it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving the head of rumour  but when you ask me what reason i have heard assigned for mr melthams passing away from among men it is another thing  i am not gratifying idle gossip then  i was told mr sampson that mr meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his prospects because he was in fact broken hearted  a disappointed attachment i heard  though it hardly seems probable in the case of a man so distinguished and so attractive  attractions and distinctions are no armour against death said i  o she died  pray pardon me  i did not hear that  that indeed makes it very very sad  poor mr meltham  she died  ah dear me  lamentable lamentable  i still thought his pity was not quite genuine and i still suspected an unaccountable sneer under all this until he said as we were parted like the other knots of talkers by the announcement of dinner  mr sampson you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man whom i have never known  i am not so disinterested as you may suppose  i have suffered and recently too from death myself  i have lost one of two charming nieces who were my constant companions  she died young  barely threeandtwenty and even her remaining sister is far from strong  the world is a grave  he said this with deep feeling and i felt reproached for the coldness of my manner  coldness and distrust had been engendered in me i knew by my bad experiences they were not natural to me and i often thought how much i had lost in life losing trustfulness and how little i had gained gaining hard caution this state of mind being habitual to me i troubled myself more about this conversation than i might have troubled myself about a greater matter  i listened to his talk at dinner and observed how readily other men responded to it and with what a graceful instinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he talked with  as in talking with me he had easily started the subject i might be supposed to understand best and to be the most interested in so in talking with others he guided himself by the same rule  the company was of a varied character but he was not at fault that i could discover with any member of it  he knew just as much of each mans pursuit as made him agreeable to that man in reference to it and just as little as made it natural in him to seek modestly for information when the theme was broached  as he talked and talked  but really not too much for the rest of us seemed to force it upon him  i became quite angry with myself i took his face to pieces in my mind like a watch and examined it in detail  i could not say much against any of his features separately i could say even less against them when they were put together  then is it not monstrous i asked myself that because a man happens to part his hair straight up the middle of his head i should permit myself to suspect and even to detest him  i may stop to remark that this was no proof of my sense  an observer of men who finds himself steadily repelled by some apparently trifling thing in a stranger is right to give it great weight  it may be the clue to the whole mystery  a hair or two will show where a lion is hidden  a very little key will open a very heavy door  i took my part in the conversation with him after a time and we got on remarkably well  in the drawingroom i asked the host how long he had known mr slinkton  he answered not many months he had met him at the house of a celebrated painter then present who had known him well when he was travelling with his nieces in italy for their health  his plans in life being broken by the death of one of them he was reading with the intention of going back to college as a matter of form taking his degree and going into orders  i could not but argue with myself that here was the true explanation of his interest in poor meltham and that i had been almost brutal in my distrust on that simple head    iii   on the very next day but one i was sitting behind my glass partition as before when he came into the outer office as before  the moment i saw him again without hearing him i hated him worse than ever  it was only for a moment that i had this opportunity for he waved his tightfitting black glove the instant i looked at him and came straight in  mr sampson goodday  i presume you see upon your kind permission to intrude upon you  i dont keep my word in being justified by business for my business here  if i may so abuse the word  is of the slightest nature  i asked was it anything i could assist him in  i thank you no  i merely called to inquire outside whether my dilatory friend had been so false to himself as to be practical and sensible  but of course he has done nothing  i gave him your papers with my own hand and he was hot upon the intention but of course he has done nothing  apart from the general human disinclination to do anything that ought to be done i dare say there is a specially about assuring ones life  you find it like willmaking  people are so superstitious and take it for granted they will die soon afterwards  up here if you please straight up here mr sampson  neither to the right nor to the left  i almost fancied i could hear him breathe the words as he sat smiling at me with that intolerable parting exactly opposite the bridge of my nose  there is such a feeling sometimes no doubt i replied but i dont think it obtains to any great extent  well said he with a shrug and a smile i wish some good angel would influence my friend in the right direction  i rashly promised his mother and sister in norfolk to see it done and he promised them that he would do it  but i suppose he never will  he spoke for a minute or two on indifferent topics and went away  i had scarcely unlocked the drawers of my writingtable next morning when he reappeared  i noticed that he came straight to the door in the glass partition and did not pause a single moment outside  can you spare me two minutes my dear mr sampson  by all means  much obliged laying his hat and umbrella on the table i came early not to interrupt you  the fact is i am taken by surprise in reference to this proposal my friend has made  has he made one said i  yees he answered deliberately looking at me and then a bright idea seemed to strike him  or he only tells me he has  perhaps that may be a new way of evading the matter  by jupiter i never thought of that  mr adams was opening the mornings letters in the outer office what is the name mr slinkton i asked  beckwith  i looked out at the door and requested mr adams if there were a proposal in that name to bring it in  he had already laid it out of his hand on the counter  it was easily selected from the rest and he gave it me  alfred beckwith  proposal to effect a policy with us for two thousand pounds  dated yesterday  from the middle temple i see mr slinkton  yes  he lives on the same staircase with me his door is opposite  i never thought he would make me his reference though  it seems natural enough that he should  quite so mr sampson but i never thought of it  let me see he took the printed paper from his pocket  how am i to answer all these questions  according to the truth of course said i  o of course he answered looking up from the paper with a smile i meant they were so many  but you do right to be particular  it stands to reason that you must be particular  will you allow me to use your pen and ink  certainly  and your desk  certainly  he had been hovering about between his hat and his umbrella for a place to write on  he now sat down in my chair at my blotting paper and inkstand with the long walk up his head in accurate perspective before me as i stood with my back to the fire  before answering each question he ran over it aloud and discussed it  how long had he known mr alfred beckwith  that he had to calculate by years upon his fingers  what were his habits  no difficulty about them temperate in the last degree and took a little too much exercise if anything  all the answers were satisfactory  when he had written them all he looked them over and finally signed them in a very pretty hand  he supposed he had now done with the business  i told him he was not likely to be troubled any farther  should he leave the papers there if he pleased  much obliged  goodmorning  i had had one other visitor before him not at the office but at my own house  that visitor had come to my bedside when it was not yet daylight and had been seen by no one else but by my faithful confidential servant  a second reference paper for we required always two was sent down into norfolk and was duly received back by post  this likewise was satisfactorily answered in every respect  our forms were all complied with we accepted the proposal and the premium for one year was paid    iv   for six or seven months i saw no more of mr slinkton  he called once at my house but i was not at home and he once asked me to dine with him in the temple but i was engaged  his friends assurance was effected in march  late in september or early in october i was down at scarborough for a breath of seaair where i met him on the beach  it was a hot evening he came toward me with his hat in his hand and there was the walk i had felt so strongly disinclined to take in perfect order again exactly in front of the bridge of my nose  he was not alone but had a young lady on his arm  she was dressed in mourning and i looked at her with great interest  she had the appearance of being extremely delicate and her face was remarkably pale and melancholy but she was very pretty  he introduced her as his niece miss niner  are you strolling mr sampson  is it possible you can be idle  it was possible and i was strolling  shall we stroll together  with pleasure  the young lady walked between us and we walked on the cool sea sand in the direction of filey  there have been wheels here said mr slinkton  and now i look again the wheels of a handcarriage  margaret my love your shadow without doubt  miss niners shadow i repeated looking down at it on the sand  not that one mr slinkton returned laughing  margaret my dear tell mr sampson  indeed said the young lady turning to me there is nothing to tell  except that i constantly see the same invalid old gentleman at all times wherever i go  i have mentioned it to my uncle and he calls the gentleman my shadow  does he live in scarborough i asked  he is staying here  do you live in scarborough  no i am staying here  my uncle has placed me with a family here for my health  and your shadow said i smiling  my shadow she answered smiling too is  like myself  not very robust i fear for i lose my shadow sometimes as my shadow loses me at other times  we both seem liable to confinement to the house  i have not seen my shadow for days and days but it does oddly happen occasionally that wherever i go for many days together this gentleman goes  we have come together in the most unfrequented nooks on this shore  is this he said i pointing before us  the wheels had swept down to the waters edge and described a great loop on the sand in turning  bringing the loop back towards us and spinning it out as it came was a handcarriage drawn by a man  yes said miss niner this really is my shadow uncle  as the carriage approached us and we approached the carriage i saw within it an old man whose head was sunk on his breast and who was enveloped in a variety of wrappers  he was drawn by a very quiet but very keenlooking man with irongray hair who was slightly lame  they had passed us when the carriage stopped and the old gentleman within putting out his arm called to me by my name  i went back and was absent from mr slinkton and his niece for about five minutes  when i rejoined them mr slinkton was the first to speak  indeed he said to me in a raised voice before i came up with him  it is well you have not been longer or my niece might have died of curiosity to know who her shadow is mr sampson  an old east india director said i  an intimate friend of our friends at whose house i first had the pleasure of meeting you a certain major banks  you have heard of him  never  very rich miss niner but very old and very crippled  an amiable man sensible  much interested in you  he has just been expatiating on the affection that he has observed to exist between you and your uncle  mr slinkton was holding his hat again and he passed his hand up the straight walk as if he himself went up it serenely after me  mr sampson he said tenderly pressing his nieces arm in his our affection was always a strong one for we have had but few near ties  we have still fewer now  we have associations to bring us together that are not of this world margaret  dear uncle murmured the young lady and turned her face aside to hide her tears  my niece and i have such remembrances and regrets in common mr sampson he feelingly pursued that it would be strange indeed if the relations between us were cold or indifferent  if i remember a conversation we once had together you will understand the reference i make  cheer up dear margaret  dont droop dont droop  my margaret  i cannot bear to see you droop  the poor young lady was very much affected but controlled herself his feelings too were very acute  in a word he found himself under such great need of a restorative that he presently went away to take a bath of seawater leaving the young lady and me sitting by a point of rock and probably presuming  but that you will say was a pardonable indulgence in a luxury  that she would praise him with all her heart  she did poor thing  with all her confiding heart she praised him to me for his care of her dead sister and for his untiring devotion in her last illness  the sister had wasted away very slowly and wild and terrible fantasies had come over her toward the end but he had never been impatient with her or at a loss had always been gentle watchful and selfpossessed  the sister had known him as she had known him to be the best of men the kindest of men and yet a man of such admirable strength of character as to be a very tower for the support of their weak natures while their poor lives endured  i shall leave him mr sampson very soon said the young lady i know my life is drawing to an end and when i am gone i hope he will marry and be happy  i am sure he has lived single so long only for my sake and for my poor poor sisters  the little handcarriage had made another great loop on the damp sand and was coming back again gradually spinning out a slim figure of eight half a mile long  young lady said i looking around laying my hand upon her arm and speaking in a low voice time presses  you hear the gentle murmur of that sea  she looked at me with the utmost wonder and alarm saying yes  and you know what a voice is in it when the storm comes  yes  you see how quiet and peaceful it lies before us and you know what an awful sight of power without pity it might be this very night  yes  but if you had never heard or seen it or heard of it in its cruelty could you believe that it beats every inanimate thing in its way to pieces without mercy and destroys life without remorse  you terrify me sir by these questions  to save you young lady to save you  for gods sake collect your strength and collect your firmness  if you were here alone and hemmed in by the rising tide on the flow to fifty feet above your head you could not be in greater danger than the danger you are now to be saved from  the figure on the sand was spun out and straggled off into a crooked little jerk that ended at the cliff very near us  as i am before heaven and the judge of all mankind your friend and your dead sisters friend i solemnly entreat you miss niner without one moments loss of time to come to this gentleman with me  if the little carriage had been less near to us i doubt if i could have got her away but it was so near that we were there before she had recovered the hurry of being urged from the rock  i did not remain there with her two minutes  certainly within five i had the inexpressible satisfaction of seeing her  from the point we had sat on and to which i had returned  half supported and half carried up some rude steps notched in the cliff by the figure of an active man  with that figure beside her i knew she was safe anywhere  i sat alone on the rock awaiting mr slinktons return  the twilight was deepening and the shadows were heavy when he came round the point with his hat hanging at his buttonhole smoothing his wet hair with one of his hands and picking out the old path with the other and a pocketcomb  my niece not here mr sampson he said looking about  miss niner seemed to feel a chill in the air after the sun was down and has gone home  he looked surprised as though she were not accustomed to do anything without him even to originate so slight a proceeding  i persuaded miss niner i explained  ah said he  she is easily persuaded  for her good  thank you mr sampson she is better within doors  the bathingplace was farther than i thought to say the truth  miss niner is very delicate i observed  he shook his head and drew a deep sigh  very very very  you may recollect my saying so  the time that has since intervened has not strengthened her  the gloomy shadow that fell upon her sister so early in life seems in my anxious eyes to gather over her ever darker ever darker  dear margaret dear margaret  but we must hope  the handcarriage was spinning away before us at a most indecorous pace for an invalid vehicle and was making most irregular curves upon the sand  mr slinkton noticing it after he had put his handkerchief to his eyes said  if i may judge from appearances your friend will be upset mr sampson  it looks probable certainly said i  the servant must be drunk  the servants of old gentlemen will get drunk sometimes said i  the major draws very light mr sampson  the major does draw light said i  by this time the carriage much to my relief was lost in the darkness  we walked on for a little side by side over the sand in silence  after a short while he said in a voice still affected by the emotion that his nieces state of health had awakened in him  do you stay here long mr sampson  why no  i am going away tonight  so soon  but business always holds you in request  men like mr sampson are too important to others to be spared to their own need of relaxation and enjoyment  i dont know about that said i  however i am going back  to london  to london  i shall be there too soon after you  i knew that as well as he did  but i did not tell him so  any more than i told him what defensive weapon my right hand rested on in my pocket as i walked by his side  any more than i told him why i did not walk on the sea side of him with the night closing in  we left the beach and our ways diverged  we exchanged goodnight and had parted indeed when he said returning  mr sampson may i ask  poor meltham whom we spoke of  dead yet  not when i last heard of him but too broken a man to live long and hopelessly lost to his old calling  dear dear dear said he with great feeling  sad sad sad the world is a grave  and so went his way  it was not his fault if the world were not a grave but i did not call that observation after him any more than i had mentioned those other things just now enumerated  he went his way and i went mine with all expedition  this happened as i have said either at the end of september or beginning of october  the next time i saw him and the last time was late in november    v   i had a very particular engagement to breakfast in the temple  it was a bitter northeasterly morning and the sleet and slush lay inches deep in the streets  i could get no conveyance and was soon wet to the knees but i should have been true to that appointment though i had to wade to it up to my neck in the same impediments  the appointment took me to some chambers in the temple  they were at the top of a lonely corner house overlooking the river  the name mr alfred beckwith was painted on the outer door  on the door opposite on the same landing the name mr julius slinkton the doors of both sets of chambers stood open so that anything said aloud in one set could be heard in the other  i had never been in those chambers before  they were dismal close unwholesome and oppressive the furniture originally good and not yet old was faded and dirty  the rooms were in great disorder there was a strong prevailing smell of opium brandy and tobacco the grate and fireirons were splashed all over with unsightly blotches of rust and on a sofa by the fire in the room where breakfast had been prepared lay the host mr beckwith a man with all the appearances of the worst kind of drunkard very far advanced upon his shameful way to death  slinkton is not come yet said this creature staggering up when i went in ill call him  halloa  julius caesar  come and drink  as he hoarsely roared this out he beat the poker and tongs together in a mad way as if that were his usual manner of summoning his associate  the voice of mr slinkton was heard through the clatter from the opposite side of the staircase and he came in  he had not expected the pleasure of meeting me  i have seen several artful men brought to a stand but i never saw a man so aghast as he was when his eyes rested on mine  julius caesar cried beckwith staggering between us mist sampson  mist sampson julius caesar  julius mist sampson is the friend of my soul  julius keeps me plied with liquor morning noon and night  julius is a real benefactor julius threw the tea and coffee out of window when i used to have any  julius empties all the waterjugs of their contents and fills em with spirits julius winds me up and keeps me going  boil the brandy julius  there was a rusty and furred saucepan in the ashes  the ashes looked like the accumulation of weeks  and beckwith rolling and staggering between us as if he were going to plunge headlong into the fire got the saucepan out and tried to force it into slinktons hand  boil the brandy julius caesar  come  do your usual office boil the brandy  he became so fierce in his gesticulations with the saucepan that i expected to see him lay open slinktons head with it  i therefore put out my hand to check him  he reeled back to the sofa and sat there panting shaking and redeyed in his rags of dressinggown looking at us both  i noticed then that there was nothing to drink on the table but brandy and nothing to eat but salted herrings and a hot sickly highlypeppered stew  at all events mr sampson said slinkton offering me the smooth gravel path for the last time i thank you for interfering between me and this unfortunate mans violence  however you came here mr sampson or with whatever motive you came here at least i thank you for that  boil the brandy muttered beckwith  without gratifying his desire to know how i came there i said quietly how is your niece mr slinkton  he looked hard at me and i looked hard at him  i am sorry to say mr sampson that my niece has proved treacherous and ungrateful to her best friend  she left me without a word of notice or explanation  she was misled no doubt by some designing rascal  perhaps you may have heard of it  i did hear that she was misled by a designing rascal  in fact i have proof of it  are you sure of that said he  quite  boil the brandy muttered beckwith  company to breakfast julius caesar  do your usual office  provide the usual breakfast dinner tea and supper  boil the brandy  the eyes of slinkton looked from him to me and he said after a moments consideration  mr sampson you are a man of the world and so am i  i will be plain with you  o no you wont said i shaking my head  i tell you sir i will be plain with you  and i tell you you will not said i  i know all about you  you plain with any one  nonsense nonsense  i plainly tell you mr sampson he went on with a manner almost composed that i understand your object  you want to save your funds and escape from your liabilities these are old tricks of trade with you officegentlemen  but you will not do it sir you will not succeed  you have not an easy adversary to play against when you play against me  we shall have to inquire in due time when and how mr beckwith fell into his present habits  with that remark sir i put this poor creature and his incoherent wanderings of speech aside and wish you a good morning and a better case next time  while he was saying this beckwith had filled a halfpint glass with brandy  at this moment he threw the brandy at his face and threw the glass after it  slinkton put his hands up half blinded with the spirit and cut with the glass across the forehead  at the sound of the breakage a fourth person came into the room closed the door and stood at it he was a very quiet but very keenlooking man with irongray hair and slightly lame  slinkton pulled out his handkerchief assuaged the pain in his smarting eyes and dabbled the blood on his forehead  he was a long time about it and i saw that in the doing of it a tremendous change came over him occasioned by the change in beckwith  who ceased to pant and tremble sat upright and never took his eyes off him  i never in my life saw a face in which abhorrence and determination were so forcibly painted as in beckwiths then  look at me you villain said beckwith and see me as i really am  i took these rooms to make them a trap for you  i came into them as a drunkard to bait the trap for you  you fell into the trap and you will never leave it alive  on the morning when you last went to mr sampsons office i had seen him first  your plot has been known to both of us all along and you have been counter plotted all along  what  having been cajoled into putting that prize of two thousand pounds in your power i was to be done to death with brandy and brandy not proving quick enough with something quicker  have i never seen you when you thought my senses gone pouring from your little bottle into my glass  why you murderer and forger alone here with you in the dead of night as i have so often been i have had my hand upon the trigger of a pistol twenty times to blow your brains out  this sudden starting up of the thing that he had supposed to be his imbecile victim into a determined man with a settled resolution to hunt him down and be the death of him mercilessly expressed from head to foot was in the first shock too much for him  without any figure of speech he staggered under it  but there is no greater mistake than to suppose that a man who is a calculating criminal is in any phase of his guilt otherwise than true to himself and perfectly consistent with his whole character  such a man commits murder and murder is the natural culmination of his course such a man has to outface murder and will do it with hardihood and effrontery  it is a sort of fashion to express surprise that any notorious criminal having such crime upon his conscience can so brave it out  do you think that if he had it on his conscience at all or had a conscience to have it upon he would ever have committed the crime  perfectly consistent with himself as i believe all such monsters to be this slinkton recovered himself and showed a defiance that was sufficiently cold and quiet  he was white he was haggard he was changed but only as a sharper who had played for a great stake and had been outwitted and had lost the game  listen to me you villain said beckwith and let every word you hear me say be a stab in your wicked heart  when i took these rooms to throw myself in your way and lead you on to the scheme that i knew my appearance and supposed character and habits would suggest to such a devil how did i know that  because you were no stranger to me  i knew you well  and i knew you to be the cruel wretch who for so much money had killed one innocent girl while she trusted him implicitly and who was by inches killing another  slinkton took out a snuffbox took a pinch of snuff and laughed  but see here said beckwith never looking away never raising his voice never relaxing his face never unclenching his hand see what a dull wolf you have been after all  the infatuated drunkard who never drank a fiftieth part of the liquor you plied him with but poured it away here there everywhere  almost before your eyes who bought over the fellow you set to watch him and to ply him by outbidding you in his bribe before he had been at his work three days  with whom you have observed no caution yet who was so bent on ridding the earth of you as a wild beast that he would have defeated you if you had been ever so prudent  that drunkard whom you have many a time left on the floor of this room and who has even let you go out of it alive and undeceived when you have turned him over with your foot  has almost as often on the same night within an hour within a few minutes watched you awake had his hand at your pillow when you were asleep turned over your papers taken samples from your bottles and packets of powder changed their contents rifled every secret of your life  he had had another pinch of snuff in his hand but had gradually let it drop from between his fingers to the floor where he now smoothed it out with his foot looking down at it the while  that drunkard said beckwith who had free access to your rooms at all times that he might drink the strong drinks that you left in his way and be the sooner ended holding no more terms with you than he would hold with a tiger has had his masterkey for all your locks his test for all your poisons his clue to your cipher writing  he can tell you as well as you can tell him how long it took to complete that deed what doses there were what intervals what signs of gradual decay upon mind and body what distempered fancies were produced what observable changes what physical pain he can tell you as well as you can tell him that all this was recorded day by day as a lesson of experience for future service he can tell you better than you can tell him where that journal is at this moment  slinkton stopped the action of his foot and looked at beckwith  no said the latter as if answering a question from him  not in the drawer of the writingdesk that opens with a spring it is not there and it never will be there again  then you are a thief said slinkton  without any change whatever in the inflexible purpose which it was quite terrific even to me to contemplate and from the power of which i had always felt convinced it was impossible for this wretch to escape beckwith returned  and i am your nieces shadow too  with an imprecation slinkton put his hand to his head tore out some hair and flung it to the ground  it was the end of the smooth walk he destroyed it in the action and it will soon be seen that his use for it was past  beckwith went on whenever you left here i left here  although i understood that you found it necessary to pause in the completion of that purpose to avert suspicion still i watched you close with the poor confiding girl  when i had the diary and could read it word by word  it was only about the night before your last visit to scarborough  you remember the night you slept with a small flat vial tied to your wrist  i sent to mr sampson who was kept out of view  this is mr sampsons trusty servant standing by the door  we three saved your niece among us  slinkton looked at us all took an uncertain step or two from the place where he had stood returned to it and glanced about him in a very curious way  as one of the meaner reptiles might looking for a hole to hide in  i noticed at the same time that a singular change took place in the figure of the man  as if it collapsed within his clothes and they consequently became illshapen and illfitting  you shall know said beckwith for i hope the knowledge will be bitter and terrible to you why you have been pursued by one man and why when the whole interest that mr sampson represents would have expended any money in hunting you down you have been tracked to death at a single individuals charge  i hear you have had the name of meltham on your lips sometimes  i saw in addition to those other changes a sudden stoppage come upon his breathing  when you sent the sweet girl whom you murdered you know with what artfully madeout surroundings and probabilities you sent her to melthams office before taking her abroad to originate the transaction that doomed her to the grave it fell to melthams lot to see her and to speak with her  it did not fall to his lot to save her though i know he would freely give his own life to have done it  he admired her  i would say he loved her deeply if i thought it possible that you could understand the word  when she was sacrificed he was thoroughly assured of your guilt  having lost her he had but one object left in life and that was to avenge her and destroy you  i saw the villains nostrils rise and fall convulsively but i saw no moving at his mouth  that man meltham beckwith steadily pursued was as absolutely certain that you could never elude him in this world if he devoted himself to your destruction with his utmost fidelity and earnestness and if he divided the sacred duty with no other duty in life as he was certain that in achieving it he would be a poor instrument in the hands of providence and would do well before heaven in striking you out from among living men  i am that man and i thank god that i have done my work  if slinkton had been running for his life from swiftfooted savages a dozen miles he could not have shown more emphatic signs of being oppressed at heart and labouring for breath than he showed now when he looked at the pursuer who had so relentlessly hunted him down  you never saw me under my right name before you see me under my right name now  you shall see me once again in the body when you are tried for your life  you shall see me once again in the spirit when the cord is round your neck and the crowd are crying against you  when meltham had spoken these last words the miscreant suddenly turned away his face and seemed to strike his mouth with his open hand  at the same instant the room was filled with a new and powerful odour and almost at the same instant he broke into a crooked run leap start  i have no name for the spasm  and fell with a dull weight that shook the heavy old doors and windows in their frames  that was the fitting end of him  when we saw that he was dead we drew away from the room and meltham giving me his hand said with a weary air  i have no more work on earth my friend  but i shall see her again elsewhere  it was in vain that i tried to rally him  he might have saved her he said he had not saved her and he reproached himself he had lost her and he was brokenhearted  the purpose that sustained me is over sampson and there is nothing now to hold me to life  i am not fit for life i am weak and spiritless i have no hope and no object my day is done  in truth i could hardly have believed that the broken man who then spoke to me was the man who had so strongly and so differently impressed me when his purpose was before him  i used such entreaties with him as i could but he still said and always said in a patient undemonstrative way  nothing could avail him  he was brokenhearted  he died early in the next spring  he was buried by the side of the poor young lady for whom he had cherished those tender and unhappy regrets and he left all he had to her sister  she lived to be a happy wife and mother she married my sisters son who succeeded poor meltham she is living now and her children ride about the garden on my walkingstick when i go to see her
