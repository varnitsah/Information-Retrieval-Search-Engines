90804769	the cruise of the dazzler  by  jack london   1902     foreword   tempting boys to be what they should begiving them in wholesome form what they wantthat is the purpose and power of scouting to help parents and leaders of youth secure books boys like best that are also best for boys the boy scouts of america organized every boys library the books included formerly sold at prices ranging from 150 to 200 but by special arrangement with the several publishers interested are now sold in the every boys library edition at 100 per volume  the books of every boys library were selected by the library commission of the boy scouts of america consisting of george f bowerman librarian public library of the district of columbia harrison w craver director engineering societies library new york city claude g leland superintendent bureau of libraries board of education new york city edward f stevens librarian pratt institute free library brooklyn ny and franklin k mathiews chief scout librarian only such books were chosen by the commission as proved to be by a nation wide canvas most in demand by the boys themselves their popularity is further attested by the fact that in the every boys library edition more than a million and a quarter copies of these books have already been sold  we know so well are reminded so often of the worth of the good book and great that too often we fail to observe or understand the influence for good of a boys recreational reading such books may influence him for good or ill as profoundly as his play activities of which they are a vital part the needful thing is to find stories in which the heroes have the characteristics boys so much admireunquenchable courage immense resourcefulness absolute fidelity conspicuous greatness we believe the books of every boys library measurably well meet this challenge  boy scouts of america  james e west  chief scout executive     contents       i  brother and sister      ii  the draconian reforms

chapter i  brother and sister   they ran across the shining sand the pacific thundering its long surge at their backs and when they gained the roadway leaped upon bicycles and dived at faster pace into the green avenues of the park there were three of them three boys in as many brightcolored sweaters and they scorched along the cyclepath as dangerously near the speedlimit as is the custom of boys in brightcolored sweaters to go they may have exceeded the speedlimit a mounted park policeman thought so but was not sure and contented himself with cautioning them as they flashed by they acknowledged the warning promptly and on the next turn of the path as promptly forgot it which is also a custom of boys in brightcolored sweaters  shooting out through the entrance to golden gate park they turned into san francisco and took the long sweep of the descending hills at a rate that caused pedestrians to turn and watch them anxiously through the city streets the bright sweaters flew turning and twisting to escape climbing the steeper hills and when the steep hills were unavoidable doing stunts to see which would first gain the top  the boy who more often hit up the pace led the scorching and instituted the stunts was called joe by his companions it was follow the leader and he led the merriest and boldest in the bunch but as they pedaled into the western addition among the large and comfortable residences his laughter became less loud and frequent and he unconsciously lagged in the rear at laguna and vallejo streets his companions turned off to the right  so long fred he called as he turned his wheel to the left so long charley  see you tonight they called back  noi cant come he answered  aw come on they begged  no ive got to digso long  as he went on alone his face grew grave and a vague worry came into his eyes he began resolutely to whistle but this dwindled away till it was a thin and very subdued little sound which ceased altogether as he rode up the driveway to a large twostoried house  oh joe  he hesitated before the door to the library bessie was there he knew studiously working up her lessons she must be nearly through with them too for she was always done before dinner and dinner could not be many minutes away as for his lessons they were as yet untouched the thought made him angry it was bad enough to have ones sisterand two years younger at thatin the same grade but to have her continually head and shoulders above him in scholarship was a most intolerable thing not that he was dull no one knew better than himself that he was not dull but somehowhe did not quite know howhis mind was on other things and he was usually unprepared  joeplease come here there was the slightest possible plaintive note in her voice this time  well he said thrusting aside the porti√®re with an impetuous movement  he said it gruffly but he was half sorry for it the next instant when he saw a slender little girl regarding him with wistful eyes across the big readingtable heaped with books she was curled up with pencil and pad in an easychair of such generous dimensions that it made her seem more delicate and fragile than she really was  what is it sis he asked more gently crossing over to her side  she took his hand in hers and pressed it against her cheek and as he stood beside her came closer to him with a nestling movement  what is the matter joe dear she asked softly wont you tell me  he remained silent it struck him as ridiculous to confess his troubles to a little sister even if her reports were higher than his and the little sister struck him as ridiculous to demand his troubles of him what a soft cheek she has he thought as she pressed her face gently against his hand if he could but tear himself awayit was all so foolish only he might hurt her feelings and in his experience girls feelings were very easily hurt  she opened his fingers and kissed the palm of his hand it was like a roseleaf falling it was also her way of asking her question over again  nothing s the matter he said decisively and then quite inconsistently he blurted out father  his worry was now in her eyes but father is so good and kind joe she began why dont you try to please him he does nt ask much of you and it s all for your own good it s not as though you were a fool like some boys if you would only study a little bit  that s it lecturing he exploded tearing his hand roughly away even you are beginning to lecture me now i suppose the cook and the stableboy will be at it next  he shoved his hands into his pockets and looked forward into a melancholy and desolate future filled with interminable lectures and lecturers innumerable  was that what you wanted me for he demanded turning to go  she caught at his hand again no it wasnt only you looked so worried that i thoughti her voice broke and she began again freshly what i wanted to tell you was that were planning a trip across the bay to oakland next saturday for a tramp in the hills  who s going  myrtle hayes  what that little softy he interrupted  i dont think she is a softy bessie answered with spirit she s one of the sweetest girls i know  which is nt saying much considering the girls you know but go on who are the others  pearl sayther and her sister alice and jessie hilborn and sadie french and edna crothers that s all the girls  joe sniffed disdainfully who are the fellows then  maurice and felix clement dick schofield burt layton and  that s enough milkandwater chaps all of them  ii wanted to ask you and fred and charley she said in a quavering voice that s what i called you in forto ask you to come  and what are you going to do he asked  walk gather wild flowersthe poppies are all out noweat luncheon at some nice place andand  come home he finished for her  bessie nodded her head joe put his hands in his pockets again and walked up and down  a sissy outfit that s what it is he said abruptly and a sissy program none of it in mine please  she tightened her trembling lips and struggled on bravely what would you rather do she asked  i d sooner take fred and charley and go off somewhere and do somethingwell anything  he paused and looked at her she was waiting patiently for him to proceed he was aware of his inability to express in words what he felt and wanted and all his trouble and general dissatisfaction rose up and gripped hold of him  oh you cant understand he burst out you cant understand you re a girl you like to be prim and neat and to be good in deportment and ahead in your studies you dont care for danger and adventure and such things and you dont care for boys who are rough and have life and go in them and all that you like good little boys in white collars with clothes always clean and hair always combed who like to stay in at recess and be petted by the teacher and told how theyre always up in their studies nice little boys who never get into scrapeswho are too busy walking around and picking flowers and eating lunches with girls to get into scrapes oh i know the kindafraid of their own shadows and no more spunk in them than in so many sheep that s what they aresheep well i m not a sheep and there s no more to be said and i dont want to go on your picnic and what s more i m not going  the tears welled up in bessies brown eyes and her lips were trembling this angered him unreasonably what were girls good for anywayalways blubbering and interfering and carrying on there was no sense in them  a fellow cant say anything without making you cry he began trying to appease her why i did nt mean anything sis i did nt sure i  he paused helplessly and looked down at her she was sobbing and at the same time shaking with the effort to control her sobs while big tears were rolling down her cheeks  oh youyou girls he cried and strode wrathfully out of the room     chapter ii  the draconian reforms   a few minutes later and still wrathful joe went in to dinner he ate silently though his father and mother and bessie kept up a genial flow of conversation there she was he communed savagely with his plate crying one minute and the next all smiles and laughter now that was nt his way if he had anything sufficiently important to cry about rest assured he would nt get over it for days girls were hypocrites that was all there was to it they did nt feel one hundredth part of all that they said when they cried it stood to reason that they did nt it must be that they just carried on because they enjoyed it it made them feel good to make other people miserable especially boys that was why they were always interfering  thus reflecting sagely he kept his eyes on his plate and did justice to the fare for one cannot scorch from the cliff house to the western addition via the park without being guilty of a healthy appetite  now and then his father directed a glance at him in a certain mildly anxious way joe did not see these glances but bessie saw them every one mr bronson was a middleaged man well developed and of heavy build though not fat his was a rugged face squarejawed and sternfeatured though his eyes were kindly and there were lines about the mouth that betokened laughter rather than severity a close examination was not required to discover the resemblance between him and joe the same broad forehead and strong jaw characterized them both and the eyes taking into consideration the difference of age were as like as peas from one pod  how are you getting on joe mr bronson asked finally dinner was over and they were about to leave the table  oh i dont know joe answered carelessly and then added we have examinations tomorrow ill know then  whither bound his mother questioned as he turned to leave the room she was a slender willowy woman whose brown eyes bessies were and likewise her tender ways  to my room joe answered to work he supplemented  she rumpled his hair affectionately and bent and kissed him mr bronson smiled approval at him as he went out and he hurried up the stairs resolved to dig hard and pass the examinations of the coming day  entering his room he locked the door and sat down at a desk most comfortably arranged for a boys study he ran his eye over his textbooks the history examination came the first thing in the morning so he would begin on that he opened the book where a page was turned down and began to read    shortly after the draconian reforms a war   broke out between athens and megara respecting   the island of salamis to which both cities   laid claim  that was easy but what were the draconian reforms he must look them up he felt quite studious as he ran over the back pages till he chanced to raise his eyes above the top of the book and saw on a chair a baseball mask and a catchers glove they should nt have lost that game last saturday he thought and they would nt have either if it had nt been for fred he wished fred would nt fumble so he could hold a hundred difficult balls in succession but when a critical point came he d let go of even a dewdrop he d have to send him out in the field and bring in jones to first base only jones was so excitable he could hold any kind of a ball no matter how critical the play was but there was no telling what he would do with the ball after he got it  joe came to himself with a start a pretty way of studying history he buried his head in his book and began    shortly after the draconian reforms  he read the sentence through three times and then recollected that he had not looked up the draconian reforms  a knock came at the door he turned the pages over with a noisy flutter but made no answer  the knock was repeated and bessies joe dear came to his ears  what do you want he demanded but before she could answer he hurried on no admittance i m busy  i came to see if i could help you she pleaded i m all done and i thought  of course you re all done he shouted you always are  he held his head in both his hands to keep his eyes on the book but the baseball mask bothered him the more he attempted to keep his mind on the history the more in his minds eye he saw the mask resting on the chair and all the games in which it had played its part  this would never do he deliberately placed the book face downward on the desk and walked over to the chair with a swift sweep he sent both mask and glove hurtling under the bed and so violently that he heard the mask rebound from the wall    shortly after the draconian reforms a war   broke out between athens and megara  the mask had rolled back from the wall he wondered if it had rolled back far enough for him to see it no he would nt look what did it matter if it had rolled out that was nt history he wondered  he peered over the top of the book and there was the mask peeping out at him from under the edge of the bed this was not to be borne there was no use attempting to study while that mask was around he went over and fished it out crossed the room to the closet and tossed it inside then locked the door that was settled thank goodness now he could do some work  he sat down again    shortly after the draconian reforms a war   broke out between athens and megara respecting   the island of salamis to which both cities   laid claim  which was all very well if he had only found out what the draconian reforms were a soft glow pervaded the room and he suddenly became aware of it what could cause it he looked out of the window the setting sun was slanting its long rays against lowhanging masses of summer clouds turning them to warm scarlet and rosy red and it was from them that the red light mellow and glowing was flung earthward  his gaze dropped from the clouds to the bay beneath the seabreeze was dying down with the day and off fort point a fishingboat was creeping into port before the last light breeze a little beyond a tug was sending up a twisted pillar of smoke as it towed a threemasted schooner to sea his eyes wandered over toward the marin county shore the line where land and water met was already in darkness and long shadows were creeping up the hills toward mount tamalpais which was sharply silhouetted against the western sky  oh if he joe bronson were only on that fishingboat and sailing in with a deepsea catch or if he were on that schooner heading out into the sunset into the world that was life that was living doing something and being something in the world and instead here he was pent up in a close room racking his brains about people dead and gone thousands of years before he was born  he jerked himself away from the window as though held there by some physical force and resolutely carried his chair and history into the farthest corner of the room where he sat down with his back to the window  an instant later so it seemed to him he found himself again staring out of the window and dreaming how he had got there he did not know his last recollection was the finding of a subheading on a page on the righthand side of the book which read the laws and constitution of draco and then evidently like walking in ones sleep he had come to the window how long had he been there he wondered the fishingboat which he had seen off fort point was now crawling into meiggss wharf this denoted nearly an hours lapse of time the sun had long since set a solemn grayness was brooding over the water and the first faint stars were beginning to twinkle over the crest of mount tamalpais  he turned with a sigh to go back into his corner when a long whistle shrill and piercing came to his ears that was fred he sighed again the whistle repeated itself then another whistle joined it that was charley they were waiting on the cornerlucky fellows  well they would nt see him this night both whistles arose in duet he writhed in his chair and groaned no they would nt see him this night he reiterated at the same time rising to his feet it was certainly impossible for him to join them when he had not yet learned about the draconian reforms the same force which had held him to the window now seemed drawing him across the room to the desk it made him put the history on top of his schoolbooks and he had the door unlocked and was halfway into the hall before he realized it he started to return but the thought came to him that he could go out for a little while and then come back and do his work  a very little while he promised himself as he went downstairs he went down faster and faster till at the bottom he was going three steps at a time he popped his cap on his head and went out of the side entrance in a rush and ere he reached the corner the reforms of draco were as far away in the past as draco himself while the examinations on the morrow were equally far away in the future     chapter iii  brick sorreltop and reddy   what s up joe asked as he joined fred and charley  kites charley answered come on we re tired out waiting for you  the three set off down the street to the brow of the hill where they looked down upon union street far below and almost under their feet this they called the pit and it was well named themselves they called the hilldwellers and a descent into the pit by the hilldwellers was looked upon by them as a great adventure  scientific kiteflying was one of the keenest pleasures of these three particular hilldwellers and six or eight kites strung out on a mile of twine and soaring into the clouds was an ordinary achievement for them they were compelled to replenish their kitesupply often for whenever an accident occurred and the string broke or a ducking kite dragged down the rest or the wind suddenly died out their kites fell into the pit from which place they were unrecoverable the reason for this was the young people of the pit were a piratical and robber race with peculiar ideas of ownership and property rights  on a day following an accident to a kite of one of the hilldwellers the selfsame kite could be seen riding the air attached to a string which led down into the pit to the lairs of the pit people so it came about that the pit people who were a poor folk and unable to afford scientific kiteflying developed great proficiency in the art when their neighbors the hilldwellers took it up  there was also an old sailorman who profited by this recreation of the hilldwellers for he was learned in sails and aircurrents and being deft of hand and cunning he fashioned the bestflying kites that could be obtained he lived in a rattletrap shanty close to the water where he could still watch with dim eyes the ebb and flow of the tide and the ships pass out and in and where he could revive old memories of the days when he too went down to the sea in ships  to reach his shanty from the hill one had to pass through the pit and thither the three boys were bound they had often gone for kites in the daytime but this was their first trip after dark and they felt it to be as it indeed was a hazardous adventure  in simple words the pit was merely the cramped and narrow quarters of the poor where many nationalities crowded together in cosmopolitan confusion and lived as best they could amid much dirt and squalor it was still early evening when the boys passed through on their way to the sailormans shanty and no mishap befell them though some of the pit boys stared at them savagely and hurled a taunting remark after them now and then  the sailorman made kites which were not only splendid fliers but which folded up and were very convenient to carry each of the boys bought a few and with them wrapped in compact bundles and under their arms started back on the return journey  keep a sharp lookout for the bys the kitemaker cautioned them they re like to be cruisin round after dark  we re not afraid charley assured him and we know how to take care of ourselves  used to the broad and quiet streets of the hill the boys were shocked and stunned by the life that teemed in the closepacked quarter it seemed some thick and monstrous growth of vegetation and that they were wading through it they shrank closely together in the tangle of narrow streets as though for protection conscious of the strangeness of it all and how unrelated they were to it  children and babies sprawled on the sidewalk and under their feet bareheaded and unkempt women gossiped in the doorways or passed back and forth with scant marketings in their arms there was a general odor of decaying fruit and fish a smell of staleness and putridity big hulking men slouched by and ragged little girls walked gingerly through the confusion with foaming buckets of beer in their hands there was a clatter and garble of foreign tongues and brogues shrill cries quarrels and wrangles and the pit pulsed with a great and steady murmur like the hum of the human hive that it was  phew i ll be glad when we re out of it fred said  he spoke in a whisper and joe and charley nodded grimly that they agreed with him they were not inclined to speech and they walked as rapidly as the crowd permitted with much the same feelings as those of travelers in a dangerous and hostile jungle  and danger and hostility stalked in the pit the inhabitants seemed to resent the presence of these strangers from the hill dirty little urchins abused them as they passed snarling with assumed bravery and prepared to run away at the first sign of attack and still other little urchins formed a noisy parade at the heels of the boys and grew bolder with increasing numbers  dont mind them joe cautioned take no notice but keep right on we ll soon be out of it  no we re in for it said fred in an undertone look there  on the corner they were approaching four or five boys of about their own age were standing the light from a streetlamp fell upon them and disclosed one with vivid red hair it could be no other than brick simpson the redoubtable leader of a redoubtable gang twice within their memory he had led his gang up the hill and spread panic and terror among the hilldwelling young folk who fled wildly to their homes while their fathers and mothers hurriedly telephoned for the police  at sight of the group on the corner the rabble at the heels of the three boys melted away on the instant with like manifestations of fear this but increased the anxiety of the boys though they held boldly on their way  the redhaired boy detached himself from the group and stepped before them blocking their path they essayed to go around him but he stretched out his arm  wot yer doin here he snarled why dont yer stay where yer blong  we re just going home fred said mildly  brick looked at joe wot yer got under yer arm he demanded  joe contained himself and took no heed of him come on he said to fred and charley at the same time starting to brush past the gangleader  but with a quick blow brick simpson struck him in the face and with equal quickness snatched the bundle of kites from under his arm  joe uttered an inarticulate cry of rage and all caution flung to the winds sprang at his assailant  this was evidently a surprise to the gangleader who expected least of all to be attacked in his own territory he retreated backward still clutching the kites and divided between desire to fight and desire to retain his capture  the latter desire dominated him and he turned and fled swiftly down the narrow sidestreet into a labyrinth of streets and alleys joe knew that he was plunging into the wilderness of the enemys country but his sense of both property and pride had been offended and he took up the pursuit hotfooted  fred and charley followed after though he outdistanced them and behind came the three other members of the gang emitting a whistling call while they ran which was evidently intended for the assembling of the rest of the band as the chase proceeded these whistles were answered from many different directions and soon a score of dark figures were tagging at the heels of fred and charley who in turn were straining every muscle to keep the swifterfooted joe in sight  brick simpson darted into a vacant lot aiming for a slip as such things are called which are prearranged passages through fences and over sheds and houses and around dark holes and corners where the unfamiliar pursuer must go more carefully and where the chances are many that he will soon lose the track  but joe caught brick before he could attain his end and together they rolled over and over in the dirt locked in each others arms by the time fred and charley and the gang had come up they were on their feet facing each other  wot d ye want eh the redheaded gangleader was saying in a bullying tone wot d ye want that s wot i wanter know  i want my kites joe answered  brick simpsons eyes sparkled at the intelligence kites were something he stood in need of himself  then you ve got to fight fer em he announced  why should i fight for them joe demanded indignantly they re mine which went to show how ignorant he was of the ideas of ownership and property rights which obtained among the people of the pit  a chorus of jeers and catcalls went up from the gang which clustered behind its leader like a pack of wolves  why should i fight for them joe reiterated  cos i say so simpson replied an wot i say goes understand  but joe did not understand he refused to understand that brick simpsons word was law in san francisco or any part of san francisco his love of honesty and right dealing was offended and all his fighting blood was up  you give those kites to me right here and now he threatened reaching out his hand for them  but simpson jerked them away d ye know who i am he demanded i m brick simpson an i dont low no one to talk to me in that tone of voice  better leave him alone charley whispered in joes ear what are a few kites leave him alone and let s get out of this  they re my kites joe said slowly in a dogged manner they re my kites and i m going to have them  you cant fight the crowd fred interfered and if you do get the best of him they ll all pile on you  the gang observing this whispered colloquy and mistaking it for hesitancy on the part of joe set up its wolflike howling again  afraid afraid the young roughs jeered and taunted he s too hightoned he is mebbe he ll spoil his nice clean shirt and then what ll mama say  shut up their leader snapped authoritatively and the noise obediently died away  will you give me those kites joe demanded advancing determinedly  will you fight for em was simpsons counterdemand  yes joe answered  fight fight the gang began to howl again  and it s me that ll see fair play said a mans heavy voice  all eyes were instantly turned upon the man who had approached unseen and made this announcement by the electric light shining brightly on them from the corner they made him out to be a big muscular fellow clad in a workingmans garments his feet were incased in heavy brogans a narrow strap of black leather held his overalls about his waist and a black and greasy cap was on his head his face was grimed with coaldust and a coarse blue shirt open at the neck revealed a wide throat and massive chest  an who re you simpson snarled angry at the interruption  none of yer business the newcomer retorted tartly but if it ll do you any good i m a fireman on the china steamers and as i said i m goin to see fair play that s my business your business is to give fair play so pitch in and dont be all night about it  the three boys were as pleased by the appearance of the fireman as simpson and his followers were displeased they conferred together for several minutes when simpson deposited the bundle of kites in the arms of one of his gang and stepped forward  come on then he said at the same time pulling off his coat  joe handed his to fred and sprang toward brick they put up their fists and faced each other almost instantly simpson drove in a fierce blow and ducked cleverly away and out of reach of the blow which joe returned joe felt a sudden respect for the abilities of his antagonist but the only effect upon him was to arouse all the doggedness of his nature and make him utterly determined to win  awed by the presence of the fireman simpsons followers confined themselves to cheering brick and jeering joe the two boys circled round and round attacking feinting and guarding and now one and then the other getting in a telling blow their positions were in marked contrast joe stood erect planted solidly on his feet with legs wide apart and head up on the other hand simpson crouched till his head was nearly lost between his shoulders and all the while he was in constant motion leaping and springing and manoeuvering in the execution of a score or more of tricks quite new and strange to joe  at the end of a quarter of an hour both were very tired though joe was much fresher tobacco ill food and unhealthy living were telling on the gangleader who was panting and sobbing for breath though at first and because of superior skill he had severely punished joe he was now weak and his blows were without force growing desperate he adopted what might be called not an unfair but a mean method of attack he would manoeuver leap in and strike swiftly and then ducking forward fall to the ground at joes feet joe could not strike him while he was down and so would step back until he could get on his feet again when the thing would be repeated  but joe grew tired of this and prepared for him timing his blow with simpsons attack he delivered it just as simpson was ducking forward to fall simpson fell but he fell over on one side whither he had been driven by the impact of joes fist upon his head he rolled over and got halfway to his feet where he remained crying and gasping his followers called upon him to get up and he tried once or twice but was too exhausted and stunned  i give in he said i m licked  the gang had become silent and depressed at its leaders defeat  joe stepped forward  i ll trouble you for those kites he said to the boy who was holding them  oh i dunno said another member of the gang shoving in between joe and his property his hair was also a vivid red you ve got to lick me before you kin have em  i dont see that joe said bluntly i ve fought and i ve won and there s nothing more to it  oh yes there is said the other i m sorreltop simpson brick s my brother see  and so in this fashion joe learned another custom of the pit people of which he had been ignorant  all right he said his fighting blood more fully aroused than ever by the unjustness of the proceeding come on  sorreltop simpson a year younger than his brother proved to be a most unfair fighter and the goodnatured fireman was compelled to interfere several times before the second of the simpson clan lay on the ground and acknowledged defeat  this time joe reached for his kites without the slightest doubt that he was to get them but still another lad stepped in between him and his property the telltale hair vividly red sprouted likewise on this lads head and joe knew him at once for what he was another member of the simpson clan he was a younger edition of his brothers somewhat less heavily built with a face covered with a vast quantity of freckles which showed plainly under the electric light  you dont git them there kites till you git me he challenged in a piping little voice i m reddy simpson an you aint licked the fambly till you ve licked me  the gang cheered admiringly and reddy stripped a tattered jacket preparatory for the fray  git ready he said to joe  joes knuckles were torn his nose was bleeding his lip was cut and swollen while his shirt had been ripped down from throat to waist further he was tired and breathing hard  how many more are there of you simpsons he asked i ve got to get home and if your family s much larger this thing is liable to keep on all night  i m the last an the best reddy replied you gits me an you gits the kites sure  all right joe sighed come on  while the youngest of the clan lacked the strength and skill of his elders he made up for it by a wildcat manner of fighting that taxed joe severely time and again it seemed to him that he must give in to the little whirlwind but each time he pulled himself together and went doggedly on for he felt that he was fighting for principle as his forefathers had fought for principle also it seemed to him that the honor of the hill was at stake and that he as its representative could do nothing less than his very best  so he held on and managed to endure his opponents swift and continuous rushes till that young and less experienced person at last wore himself out with his own exertions and from the ground confessed that for the first time in its history the simpson fambly was beat     chapter iv  the biter bitten   but life in the pit at best was a precarious affair as the three hilldwellers were quickly to learn before joe could even possess himself of his kites his astonished eyes were greeted with the spectacle of all his enemies the fireman included taking to their heels in wild flight as the little girls and urchins had melted away before the simpson gang so was melting away the simpson gang before some new and correspondingly aweinspiring group of predatory creatures  joe heard terrified cries of fish gang fish gang from those who fled and he would have fled himself from this new danger only he was breathless from his last encounter and knew the impossibility of escaping whatever threatened fred and charley felt mighty longings to run away from a danger great enough to frighten the redoubtable simpson gang and the valorous fireman but they could not desert their comrade  dark forms broke into the vacant lot some surrounding the boys and others dashing after the fugitives that the laggards were overtaken was evidenced by the cries of distress that went up and when later the pursuers returned they brought with them the luckless and snarling brick still clinging fast to the bundle of kites  joe looked curiously at this latest band of marauders they were young men of from seventeen and eighteen to twentythree and four years of age and bore the unmistakable stamp of the hoodlum class there were vicious faces among themfaces so vicious as to make joes flesh creep as he looked at them a couple grasped him tightly by the arms and fred and charley were similarly held captive  look here you said one who spoke with the authority of leader we ve got to inquire into this wot s ben goin on here wot re you up to redhead wot you ben doin  aint ben doin nothin simpson whined  looks like it the leader turned up bricks face to the electric light who s been paintin you up like that he demanded  brick pointed at joe who was forthwith dragged to the front  wot was you scrappin about  kitesmy kites joe spoke up boldly that fellow tried to take them away from me he s got them under his arm now  oh he has has he look here you brick we dont put up with stealin in this territory see you never rightly owned nothin come fork over the kites last call  the leader tightened his grasp threateningly and simpson weeping tears of rage surrendered the plunder  wot yer got under yer arm the leader demanded abruptly of fred at the same time jerking out the bundle more kites eh reglar kitefactory gone and got itself lost he remarked finally when he had appropriated charleys bundle now wot i wants to know is wot we re goin to do to you tree chaps he continued in a judicial tone  what for joe demanded hotly for being robbed of our kites  not at all not at all the leader responded politely but for luggin kites round these quarters an causin all this unseemly disturbance it s disgraceful that s wot it isdisgraceful  at this juncture when the hilldwellers were the center of attraction brick suddenly wormed out of his jacket squirmed away from his captors and dashed across the lot to the slip for which he had been originally headed when overtaken by joe two or three of the gang shot over the fence after him in noisy pursuit there was much barking and howling of backyard dogs and clattering of shoes over sheds and boxes then there came a splashing of water as though a barrel of it had been precipitated to the ground several minutes later the pursuers returned very sheepish and very wet from the deluge presented them by the wily brick whose voice high up in the air from some friendly housetop could be heard defiantly jeering them  this event apparently disconcerted the leader of the gang and just as he turned to joe and fred and charley a long and peculiar whistle came to their ears from the streetthe warning signal evidently of a scout posted to keep a lookout the next moment the scout himself came flying back to the main body which was already beginning to retreat  cops he panted  joe looked and he saw two helmeted policemen approaching with bright stars shining on their breasts  let s get out of this he whispered to fred and charley  the gang had already taken to flight and they blocked the boys retreat in one quarter and in another they saw the policemen advancing so they took to their heels in the direction of brick simpsons slip the policemen hot after them and yelling bravely for them to halt  but young feet are nimble and young feet when frightened become something more than nimble and the boys were first over the fence and plunging wildly through a maze of back yards they soon found that the policemen were discreet evidently they had had experiences in slips and they were satisfied to give over the chase at the first fence  no streetlamps shed their light here and the boys blundered along through the blackness with their hearts in their mouths in one yard filled with mountains of crates and fruitboxes they were lost for a quarter of an hour feel and quest about as they would they encountered nothing but endless heaps of boxes from this wilderness they finally emerged by way of a shed roof only to fall into another yard cumbered with countless empty chickencoops  farther on they came upon the contrivance which had soaked brick simpsons pursuers with water it was a cunning arrangement where the slip led through a fence with a board missing a long slat was so arranged that the ignorant wayfarer could not fail to strike against it this slat was the spring of the trap a light touch upon it was sufficient to disconnect a heavy stone from a barrel perched overhead and nicely balanced the disconnecting of the stone permitted the barrel to turn over and spill its contents on the one beneath who touched the slat  the boys examined the arrangement with keen appreciation luckily for them the barrel was overturned or they too would have received a ducking for joe who was in advance had blundered against the slat  i wonder if this is simpsons back yard he queried softly  it must be fred concluded or else the back yard of some member of his gang  charley put his hands warningly on both their arms  hist what s that he whispered  they crouched down on the ground not far away was the sound of some one moving about then they heard a noise of falling water as from a faucet into a bucket this was followed by steps boldly approaching they crouched lower breathless with apprehension  a dark form passed by within arms reach and mounted on a box to the fence it was brick himself resetting the trap they heard him arrange the slat and stone then right the barrel and empty into it a couple of buckets of water as he came down from the box to go after more water joe sprang upon him tripped him up and held him to the ground  dont make any noise he said i want you to listen to me  oh it s you is it simpson replied with such obvious relief in his voice as to make them feel relieved also wot d ye want here  we want to get out of here joe said and the shortest way s the best there s three of us and you re only one  that s all right that s all right the gangleader interrupted i d just as soon show you the way out as not i aint got nothin gainst you come on an follow me an dont step to the side an i ll have you out in no time  several minutes later they dropped from the top of a high fence into a dark alley  follow this to the street simpson directed turn to the right two blocks turn to the right again for three an yer on union tralaloo  they said goodby and as they started down the alley received the following advice  nex time you bring kites along you d best leave em to home     chapter v  home again   following brick simpsons directions they came into union street and without further mishap gained the hill from the brow they looked down into the pit whence arose that steady indefinable hum which comes from crowded human places  i ll never go down there again not as long as i live fred said with a great deal of savagery in his voice i wonder what became of the fireman  we re lucky to get back with whole skins joe cheered them philosophically  i guess we left our share and you more than yours laughed charley  yes joe answered and i ve got more trouble to face when i get home good night fellows  as he expected the door on the side porch was locked and he went around to the diningroom and entered like a burglar through a window as he crossed the wide hall walking softly toward the stairs his father came out of the library the surprise was mutual and each halted aghast  joe felt a hysterical desire to laugh for he thought that he knew precisely how he looked in reality he looked far worse than he imagined what mr bronson saw was a boy with hat and coat covered with dirt his whole face smeared with the stains of conflict and in particular a badly swollen nose a bruised eyebrow a cut and swollen lip a scratched cheek knuckles still bleeding and a shirt torn open from throat to waist  what does this mean sir mr bronson finally managed to articulate  joe stood speechless how could he tell in one brief sentence all the whole nights happeningsfor all that must be included in the explanation of what his luckless disarray meant  have you lost your tongue mr bronson demanded with an appearance of impatience  i vei ve  yes yes his father encouraged  i vewell i ve been down in the pit joe succeeded in blurting out  i must confess that you look like itvery much like it indeed mr bronson spoke severely but if ever by great effort he conquered a smile that was the time i presume he went on that you do not refer to the abidingplace of sinners but rather to some definite locality in san francisco am i right  joe swept his arm in a descending gesture toward union street and said down there sir  and who gave it that name  i did joe answered as though confessing to a specified crime  it s most appropriate i m sure and denotes imagination it could nt really be bettered you must do well at school sir with your english  this did not increase joes happiness for english was the only study of which he did not have to feel ashamed  and while he stood thus a silent picture of misery and disgrace mr bronson looked upon him through the eyes of his own boyhood with an understanding which joe could not have believed possible  however what you need just now is not a discourse but a bath and courtplaster and witchhazel and coldwater bandages mr bronson said so to bed with you you ll need all the sleep you can get and you ll feel stiff and sore tomorrow morning i promise you  the clock struck one as joe pulled the bedclothes around him and the next he knew he was being worried by a soft insistent rapping which seemed to continue through several centuries until at last unable to endure it longer he opened his eyes and sat up  the day was streaming in through the windowbright and sunshiny day he stretched his arms to yawn but a shooting pain darted through all the muscles and his arms came down more rapidly than they had gone up he looked at them with a bewildered stare till suddenly the events of the night rushed in upon him and he groaned  the rapping still persisted and he cried yes i hear what time is it  eight oclock bessies voice came to him through the door eight oclock and you ll have to hurry if you dont want to be late for school  goodness he sprang out of bed precipitately groaned with the pain from all his stiff muscles and collapsed slowly and carefully on a chair why did nt you call me sooner he growled  father said to let you sleep  joe groaned again in another fashion then his historybook caught his eye and he groaned yet again and in still another fashion  all right he called go on i ll be down in a jiffy  he did come down in fairly brief order but if bessie had watched him descend the stairs she would have been astounded at the remarkable caution he observed and at the twinges of pain that every now and then contorted his face as it was when she came upon him in the diningroom she uttered a frightened cry and ran over to him  what s the matter joe she asked tremulously what has happened  nothing he grunted putting sugar on his porridge  but surely she began  please dont bother me he interrupted i m late and i want to eat my breakfast  and just then mrs bronson caught bessies eye and that young lady still mystified made haste to withdraw herself  joe was thankful to his mother for that and thankful that she refrained from remarking upon his appearance father had told her that was one thing sure he could trust her not to worry him it was never her way  and meditating in this way he hurried through with his solitary breakfast vaguely conscious in an uncomfortable way that his mother was fluttering anxiously about him tender as she always was he noticed that she kissed him with unusual tenderness as he started out with his books swinging at the end of a strap and he also noticed as he turned the corner that she was still looking after him through the window  but of more vital importance than that to him was his stiffness and soreness as he walked along each step was an effort and a torment severely as the reflected sunlight from the cement sidewalk hurt his bruised eye and severely as his various wounds pained him still more severely did he suffer from his muscles and joints he had never imagined such stiffness each individual muscle in his whole body protested when called upon to move his fingers were badly swollen and it was agony to clasp and unclasp them while his arms were sore from wrist to elbow this he said to himself was caused by the many blows which he had warded off from his face and body he wondered if brick simpson was in similar plight and the thought of their mutual misery made him feel a certain kinship for that redoubtable young ruffian  when he entered the schoolyard he quickly became aware that he was the center of attraction for all eyes the boys crowded around in an awestricken way and even his classmates and those with whom he was well acquainted looked at him with a certain respect he had never seen before     chapter vi  examination day   it was plain that fred and charley had spread the news of their descent into the pit and of their battle with the simpson clan and the fishes he heard the nineoclock bell with feelings of relief and passed into the school a mark for admiring glances from all the boys the girls too looked at him in a timid and fearful wayas they might have looked at daniel when he came out of the lions den joe thought or at david after his battle with goliath it made him uncomfortable and painfully selfconscious this heroworshiping and he wished heartily that they would look in some other direction for a change  soon they did look in another direction while big sheets of foolscap were being distributed to every desk miss wilson the teacher an austerelooking young woman who went through the world as though it were a refrigerator and who even on the warmest days in the classroom was to be found with a shawl or cape about her shoulders arose and on the blackboard where all could see wrote the roman numeral i every eye and there were fifty pairs of them hung with expectancy upon her hand and in the pause that followed the room was quiet as the grave  underneath the roman numeral i she wrote a what were the laws of draco b why did an athenian orator say that they were written not in ink but in blood  fortynine heads bent down and fortynine pens scratched lustily across as many sheets of foolscap joes head alone remained up and he regarded the blackboard with so blank a stare that miss wilson glancing over her shoulder after having written ii stopped to look at him then she wrote  a how did the war between athens and megara respecting the island of salamis bring about the reforms of solon b in what way did they differ from the laws of draco  she turned to look at joe again he was staring as blankly as ever  what is the matter joe she asked have you no paper  yes i have thank you he answered and began moodily to sharpen a leadpencil  he made a fine point to it then he made a very fine point then and with infinite patience he proceeded to make it very much finer several of his classmates raised their heads inquiringly at the noise but he did not notice he was too absorbed in his pencilsharpening and in thinking thoughts far away from both pencilsharpening and greek history  of course you all understand that the examination papers are to be written with ink  miss wilson addressed the class in general but her eyes rested on joe  just as it was about as fine as it could possibly be the point broke and joe began over again  i am afraid joe that you annoy the class miss wilson said in final desperation  he put the pencil down closed the knife with a snap and returned to his blank staring at the blackboard what did he know about draco or solon or the rest of the greeks it was a flunk and that was all there was to it no need for him to look at the rest of the questions and even if he did know the answers to two or three there was no use in writing them down it would not prevent the flunk besides his arm hurt him too much to write it hurt his eyes to look at the blackboard and his eyes hurt even when they were closed and it seemed positively to hurt him to think  so the fortynine pens scratched on in a race after miss wilson who was covering the blackboard with question after question and he listened to the scratching and watched the questions growing under her chalk and was very miserable indeed his head seemed whirling around it ached inside and was sore outside and he did not seem to have any control of it at all  he was beset with memories of the pit like scenes from some monstrous nightmare and try as he would he could not dispel them he would fix his mind and eyes on miss wilsons face who was now sitting at her desk and even as he looked at her the face of brick simpson impudent and pugnacious would arise before him it was of no use he felt sick and sore and tired and worthless there was nothing to be done but flunk and when after an age of waiting the papers were collected his went in a blank save for his name the name of the examination and the date which were written across the top  after a brief interval more papers were given out and the examination in arithmetic began he did not trouble himself to look at the questions ordinarily he might have pulled through such an examination but in his present state of mind and body he knew it was impossible he contented himself with burying his face in his hands and hoping for the noon hour once lifting his eyes to the clock he caught bessie looking anxiously at him across the room from the girls side this but added to his discomfort why was she bothering him no need for her to trouble she was bound to pass then why could nt she leave him alone so he gave her a particularly glowering look and buried his face in his hands again nor did he lift it till the twelveoclock gong rang when he handed in a second blank paper and passed out with the boys  fred and charley and he usually ate lunch in a corner of the yard which they had arrogated to themselves but this day by some remarkable coincidence a score of other boys had elected to eat their lunches on the same spot joe surveyed them with disgust in his present condition he did not feel inclined to receive heroworship his head ached too much and he was troubled over his failure in the examinations and there were more to come in the afternoon  he was angry with fred and charley they were chattering like magpies over the adventures of the night in which however they did not fail to give him chief credit and they conducted themselves in quite a patronizing fashion toward their awed and admiring schoolmates but every attempt to make joe talk was a failure he grunted and gave short answers and said yes and no to questions asked with the intention of drawing him out  he was longing to get away somewhere by himself to throw himself down some place on the green grass and forget his aches and pains and troubles he got up to go and find such a place and found half a dozen of his following tagging after him he wanted to turn around and scream at them to leave him alone but his pride restrained him a great wave of disgust and despair swept over him and then an idea flashed through his mind since he was sure to flunk in his examinations why endure the afternoons torture which could not but be worse than the mornings and on the impulse of the moment he made up his mind  he walked straight on to the schoolyard gate and passed out here his worshipers halted in wonderment but he kept on to the corner and out of sight for some time he wandered along aimlessly till he came to the tracks of a cable road a downtown car happening to stop to let off passengers he stepped aboard and ensconced himself in an outside corner seat the next thing he was aware of the car was swinging around on its turntable and he was hastily scrambling off the big ferry building stood before him seeing and hearing nothing he had been carried through the heart of the business section of san francisco  he glanced up at the tower clock on top of the ferry building it was ten minutes after onetime enough to catch the quarterpastone boat that decided him and without the least idea in the world as to where he was going he paid ten cents for a ticket passed through the gate and was soon speeding across the bay to the pretty city of oakland  in the same aimless and unwitting fashion he found himself an hour later sitting on the stringpiece of the oakland city wharf and leaning his aching head against a friendly timber from where he sat he could look down upon the decks of a number of small sailingcraft quite a crowd of curious idlers had collected to look at them and joe found himself growing interested  there were four boats and from where he sat he could make out their names the one directly beneath him had the name ghost painted in large green letters on its stern the other three which lay beyond were called respectively la caprice the oyster queen and the flying dutchman  each of these boats had cabins built amidships with short stovepipes projecting through the roofs and from the pipe of the ghost smoke was ascending the cabin doors were open and the roofslide pulled back so that joe could look inside and observe the inmate a young fellow of nineteen or twenty who was engaged just then in cooking he was clad in long seaboots which reached the hips blue overalls and dark woolen shirt the sleeves rolled back to the elbows disclosed sturdy sunbronzed arms and when the young fellow looked up his face proved to be equally bronzed and tanned  the aroma of coffee arose to joes nose and from a light iron pot came the unmistakable smell of beans nearly done the cook placed a fryingpan on the stove wiped it around with a piece of suet when it had heated and tossed in a thick chunk of beefsteak while he worked he talked with a companion on deck who was busily engaged in filling a bucket overside and flinging the salt water over heaps of oysters that lay on the deck this completed he covered the oysters with wet sacks and went into the cabin where a place was set for him on a tiny table and where the cook served the dinner and joined him in eating it  all the romance of joes nature stirred at the sight that was life they were living and gaining their living out in the free open under the sun and sky with the sea rocking beneath them and the wind blowing on them or the rain falling on them as the chance might be each day and every day he sat in a room pent up with fifty more of his kind racking his brains and cramming dry husks of knowledge while they were doing all this living glad and careless and happy rowing boats and sailing and cooking their own food and certainly meeting with adventures such as one only dreams of in the crowded schoolroom  joe sighed he felt that he was made for this sort of life and not for the life of a scholar as a scholar he was undeniably a failure he had flunked in his examinations while at that very moment he knew bessie was going triumphantly home her last examination over and done and with credit oh it was not to be borne his father was wrong in sending him to school that might be well enough for boys who were inclined to study but it was manifest that he was not so inclined there were more careers in life than that of the schools men had gone down to the sea in the lowest capacity and risen in greatness and owned great fleets and done great deeds and left their names on the pages of time and why not he joe bronson  he closed his eyes and felt immensely sorry for himself and when he opened his eyes again he found that he had been asleep and that the sun was sinking fast  it was after dark when he arrived home and he went straight to his room and to bed without meeting any one he sank down between the cool sheets with a sigh of satisfaction at the thought that come what would he need no longer worry about his history then another and unwelcome thought obtruded itself and he knew that the next school term would come and that six months thereafter another examination in the same history awaited him     chapter vii  father and son   on the following morning after breakfast joe was summoned to the library by his father and he went in almost with a feeling of gladness that the suspense of waiting was over mr bronson was standing by the window a great chattering of sparrows outside seemed to have attracted his attention joe joined him in looking out and saw a fledgeling sparrow on the grass tumbling ridiculously about in its efforts to stand on its feeble baby legs it had fallen from the nest in the rosebush that climbed over the window and the two parent sparrows were wild with anxiety over its plight  it s a way young birds have mr bronson remarked turning to joe with a serious smile and i dare say you are on the verge of a somewhat similar predicament my boy he went on i am afraid things have reached a crisis joe i have watched it coming on for a year nowyour poor scholarship your carelessness and inattention your constant desire to be out of the house and away in search of adventures of one sort or another  he paused as though expecting a reply but joe remained silent  i have given you plenty of liberty i believe in liberty the finest souls grow in such soil so i have not hedged you in with endless rules and irksome restrictions i have asked little of you and you have come and gone pretty much as you pleased in a way i have put you on your honor made you largely your own master trusting to your sense of right to restrain you from going wrong and at least to keep you up in your studies and you have failed me what do you want me to do set you certain bounds and timelimits keep a watch over you compel you by main strength to go through your books  i have here a note mr bronson said after another pause in which he picked up an envelop from the table and drew forth a written sheet  joe recognized the stiff and uncompromising scrawl of miss wilson and his heart sank  his father began to read    listlessness and carelessness have characterized   his terms work so that when the examinations   came he was wholly unprepared in neither history   nor arithmetic did he attempt to answer a question   passing in his papers perfectly blank these   examinations took place in the morning in the   afternoon he did not take the trouble even to   appear for the remainder  mr bronson ceased reading and looked up  where were you in the afternoon he asked  i went across on the ferry to oakland joe answered not caring to offer his aching head and body in extenuation  that is what is called playing hooky is it not  yes sir joe answered  the night before the examinations instead of studying you saw fit to wander away and involve yourself in a disgraceful fight with hoodlums i did not say anything at the time in my heart i think i might almost have forgiven you that if you had done well in your schoolwork  joe had nothing to say he knew that there was his side to the story but he felt that his father did not understand and that there was little use of telling him  the trouble with you joe is carelessness and lack of concentration what you need is what i have not given you and that is rigid discipline i have been debating for some time upon the advisability of sending you to some military school where your tasks will be set for you and what you do every moment in the twentyfour hours will be determined for you  oh father you dont understand you cant understand joe broke forth at last i try to studyi honestly try to study but somehowi dont know howi cant study perhaps i am a failure perhaps i am not made for study i want to go out into the world i want to see lifeto live i dont want any military academy i d sooner go to seaanywhere where i can do something and be something  mr bronson looked at him kindly it is only through study that you can hope to do something and be something in the world he said  joe threw up his hand with a gesture of despair  i know how you feel about it mr bronson went on but you are only a boy very much like that young sparrow we were watching if at home you have not sufficient control over yourself to study then away from home out in the world which you think is calling to you you will likewise not have sufficient control over yourself to do the work of that world  but i am willing joe i am willing after you have finished high school and before you go into the university to let you out into the world for a time  let me go now joe asked impulsively  no it is too early you have nt your wings yet you are too unformed and your ideals and standards are not yet thoroughly fixed  but i shall not be able to study joe threatened i know i shall not be able to study  mr bronson consulted his watch and arose to go i have not made up my mind yet he said i do not know what i shall dowhether i shall give you another trial at the public school or send you to a military academy  he stopped a moment at the door and looked back but remember this joe he said i am not angry with you i am more grieved and hurt think it over and tell me this evening what you intend to do  his father passed out and joe heard the front door close after him he leaned back in the big easychair and closed his eyes a military school he feared such an institution as the animal fears a trap no he would certainly never go to such a place and as for public schoolhe sighed deeply at the thought of it he was given till evening to make up his mind as to what he intended to do well he knew what he would do and he did not have to wait till evening to find it out  he got up with a determined look on his face put on his hat and went out the front door he would show his father that he could do his share of the worlds work he thought as he walked alonghe would show him  by the time he reached the school he had his whole plan worked out definitely nothing remained but to put it through it was the noon hour and he passed in to his room and packed up his books unnoticed coming out through the yard he encountered fred and charley  what s up charley asked  nothing joe grunted  what are you doing there  taking my books home of course what did you suppose i was doing  come come fred interposed dont be so mysterious i dont see why you cant tell us what has happened  you ll find out soon enough joe said significantlymore significantly than he had intended  and for fear that he might say more he turned his back on his astonished chums and hurried away he went straight home and to his room where he busied himself at once with putting everything in order his clothes he hung carefully away changing the suit he had on for an older one from his bureau he selected a couple of changes of underclothing a couple of cotton shirts and half a dozen pairs of socks to these he added as many handkerchiefs a comb and a toothbrush  when he had bound the bundle in stout wrappingpaper he contemplated it with satisfaction then he went over to his desk and took from a small inner compartment his savings for some months which amounted to several dollars this sum he had been keeping for the fourth of july but he thrust it into his pocket with hardly a regret then he pulled a writingpad over to him sat down and wrote    dont look for me i am a failure and i am   going away to sea dont worry about me i   am all right and able to take care of myself   i shall come back some day and then you will   all be proud of me goodby papa and mama   and bessie                                         joe  this he left lying on his desk where it could easily be seen he tucked the bundle under his arm and with a last farewell look at the room stole out     part ii     chapter viii  frisco kid and the new boy   frisco kid was discontenteddiscontented and disgusted this would have seemed impossible to the boys who fished from the dock above and envied him greatly true they wore cleaner and better clothes and were blessed with fathers and mothers but his was the free floating life of the bay the domain of moving adventure and the companionship of mentheirs the rigid discipline and dreary sameness of home life they did not dream that frisco kid ever looked up at them from the cockpit of the dazzler and in turn envied them just those things which sometimes were the most distasteful to them and from which they suffered to repletion just as the romance of adventure sang its siren song in their ears and whispered vague messages of strange lands and lusty deeds so the delicious mysteries of home enticed frisco kids roving fancies and his brightest daydreams were of the things he knew notbrothers sisters a fathers counsel a mothers kiss  he frowned got up from where he had been sunning himself on top of the dazzlers cabin and kicked off his heavy rubber boots then he stretched himself on the narrow sidedeck and dangled his feet in the cool salt water  now that s freedom thought the boys who watched him besides those long seaboots reaching to the hips and buckled to the leather strap about the waist held a strange and wonderful fascination for them they did not know that frisco kid did not possess such things as shoesthat the boots were an old pair of pete le maires and were three sizes too large for him nor could they guess how uncomfortable they were to wear on a hot summer day  the cause of frisco kids discontent was those very boys who sat on the stringpiece and admired him but his disgust was the result of quite another event the dazzler was short one in its crew and he had to do more work than was justly his share he did not mind the cooking nor the washing down of the decks and the pumping but when it came to the paintscrubbing and dishwashing he rebelled he felt that he had earned the right to be exempt from such scullion work that was all the green boys were fit for while he could make or take in sail lift anchor steer and make landings  stan from uner pete le maire or french pete captain of the dazzler and lord and master of frisco kid threw a bundle into the cockpit and came aboard by the starboard rigging  come queeck he shouted to the boy who owned the bundle and who now hesitated on the dock it was a good fifteen feet to the deck of the sloop and he could not reach the steel stay by which he must descend  now one two three the frenchman counted goodnaturedly after the manner of captains when their crews are shorthanded  the boy swung his body into space and gripped the rigging a moment later he struck the deck his hands tingling warmly from the friction  kid dis is ze new sailor i make your acquaintance french pete smirked and bowed and stood aside mistaire sho bronson he added as an afterthought  the two boys regarded each other silently for a moment they were evidently about the same age though the stranger looked the heartier and stronger of the two frisco kid put out his hand and they shook  so you re thinking of tackling the water eh he said  joe bronson nodded and glanced curiously about him before answering yes i think the bay life will suit me for a while and then when i ve got used to it i m going to sea in the forecastle  in the what  in the forecastlethe place where the sailors live he explained flushing and feeling doubtful of his pronunciation  oh the focsle know anything about going to sea  yesno that is except what i ve read  frisco kid whistled turned on his heel in a lordly manner and went into the cabin  going to sea he chuckled to himself as he built the fire and set about cooking supper in the forecastle too and thinks he ll like it  in the meanwhile french pete was showing the newcomer about the sloop as though he were a guest such affability and charm did he display that frisco kid popping his head up through the scuttle to call them to supper nearly choked in his effort to suppress a grin  joe bronson enjoyed that supper the food was rough but good and the smack of the salt air and the seafittings around him gave zest to his appetite the cabin was clean and snug and though not large the accommodations surprised him every bit of space was utilized the table swung to the centerboardcase on hinges so that when not in use it actually occupied no room at all on either side and partly under the deck were two bunks the blankets were rolled back and the boys sat on the wellscrubbed bunk boards while they ate a swinging sealamp of brightly polished brass gave them light which in the daytime could be obtained through the four deadeyes or small round panes of heavy glass which were fitted into the walls of the cabin on one side of the door was the stove and woodbox on the other the cupboard the front end of the cabin was ornamented with a couple of rifles and a shotgun while exposed by the rolledback blankets of french petes bunk was a cartridgelined belt carrying a brace of revolvers  it all seemed like a dream to joe countless times he had imagined scenes somewhat similar to this but here he was right in the midst of it and already it seemed as though he had known his two companions for years french pete was smiling genially at him across the board it really was a villainous countenance but to joe it seemed only weatherbeaten frisco kid was describing to him between mouthfuls the last soueaster the dazzler had weathered and joe experienced an increasing awe for this boy who had lived so long upon the water and knew so much about it  the captain however drank a glass of wine and topped it off with a second and a third and then a vicious flush lighting his swarthy face stretched out on top of his blankets where he soon was snoring loudly  better turn in and get a couple of hours sleep frisco kid said kindly pointing joes bunk out to him we ll most likely be up the rest of the night  joe obeyed but he could not fall asleep so readily as the others he lay with his eyes wide open watching the hands of the alarmclock that hung in the cabin and thinking how quickly event had followed event in the last twelve hours only that very morning he had been a schoolboy and now he was a sailor shipped on the dazzler and bound he knew not whither his fifteen years increased to twenty at the thought of it and he felt every inch a mana sailorman at that he wished charley and fred could see him now well they would hear of it soon enough he could see them talking it over and the other boys crowding around who oh joe bronson he s gone to sea used to chum with us  joe pictured the scene proudly then he softened at the thought of his mother worrying but hardened again at the recollection of his father not that his father was not good and kind but he did not understand boys joe thought that was where the trouble lay only that morning he had said that the world was nt a playground and that the boys who thought it was were liable to make sore mistakes and be glad to get home again well he knew that there was plenty of hard work and rough experience in the world but he also thought boys had some rights he d show him he could take care of himself and anyway he could write home after he got settled down to his new life     chapter ix  aboard the dazzler   a skiff grazed the side of the dazzler softly and interrupted joes reveries he wondered why he had not heard the sound of the oars in the rowlocks then two men jumped over the cockpitrail and came into the cabin  bli me if ere they aint snoozin said the first of the newcomers deftly rolling frisco kid out of his blankets with one hand and reaching for the winebottle with the other  french pete put his head up on the other side of the centerboard his eyes heavy with sleep and made them welcome  oo s this asked the cockney as he was called smacking his lips over the wine and rolling joe out upon the floor passenger  no no french pete made haste to answer ze new sailorman vaire good boy  good boy or not he s got to keep his tongue atween his teeth growled the second newcomer who had not yet spoken glaring fiercely at joe  i say queried the other man ow does e whack up on the loot i ope as me and bill ave a square deal  ze dazzler she take one sharewhat you callone third den we split ze rest in five shares five men five shares vaire good  french pete insisted in excited gibberish that the dazzler had the right to have three men in its crew and appealed to frisco kid to bear him out but the latter left them to fight it over by themselves and proceeded to make hot coffee  it was all greek to joe except he knew that he was in some way the cause of the quarrel in the end french pete had his way and the newcomers gave in after much grumbling after they had drunk their coffee all hands went on deck  just stay in the cockpit and keep out of their way frisco kid whispered to joe i ll teach you about the ropes and everything when we aint in a hurry  joes heart went out to him in sudden gratitude for the strange feeling came to him that of those on board to frisco kid and to frisco kid only could he look for help in time of need already a dislike for french pete was growing up within him why he could not say he just simply felt it  a creaking of blocks forard and the huge mainsail loomed above him in the night bill cast off the bowline the cockney followed suit with the stern frisco kid gave her the jib as french pete jammed up the tiller and the dazzler caught the breeze heeling over for midchannel joe heard talk of not putting up the sidelights and of keeping a sharp lookout though all he could comprehend was that some law of navigation was being violated  the waterfront lights of oakland began to slip past soon the stretches of docks and the shadowy ships began to be broken by dim sweeps of marshland and joe knew that they were heading out for san francisco bay the wind was blowing from the north in mild squalls and the dazzler cut noiselessly through the landlocked water  where are we going joe asked the cockney in an endeavor to be friendly and at the same time satisfy his curiosity  oh my pardner ere bill we re goin to take a cargo from is factory that worthy airily replied  joe thought he was rather a funnylooking individual to own a factory but conscious that even stranger things might be found in this new world he was entering he said nothing he had already exposed himself to frisco kid in the matter of his pronunciation of focsle and he had no desire further to advertise his ignorance  a little after that he was sent in to blow out the cabin lamp the dazzler tacked about and began to work in toward the north shore everybody kept silent save for occasional whispered questions and answers which passed between bill and the captain finally the sloop was run into the wind and the jib and mainsail lowered cautiously  short hawse french pete whispered to frisco kid who went forard and dropped the anchor paying out the slightest quantity of slack  the dazzlers skiff was brought alongside as was also the small boat in which the two strangers had come aboard  see that that cub dont make a fuss bill commanded in an undertone as he joined his partner in his own boat  can you row frisco kid asked as they got into the other boat  joe nodded his head  then take these oars and dont make a racket  frisco kid took the second pair while french pete steered joe noticed that the oars were muffled with sennit and that even the rowlock sockets were protected with leather it was impossible to make a noise except by a misstroke and joe had learned to row on lake merrit well enough to avoid that they followed in the wake of the first boat and glancing aside he saw they were running along the length of a pier which jutted out from the land a couple of ships with ridinglanterns burning brightly were moored to it but they kept just beyond the edge of the light he stopped rowing at the whispered command of frisco kid then the boats grounded like ghosts on a tiny beach and they clambered out  joe followed the men who picked their way carefully up a twentyfoot bank at the top he found himself on a narrow railway track which ran between huge piles of rusty scrapiron these piles separated by tracks extended in every direction he could not tell how far though in the distance he could see the vague outlines of some great factorylike building the men began to carry loads of the iron down to the beach and french pete gripping him by the arm and again warning him not to make any noise told him to do likewise at the beach they turned their burdens over to frisco kid who loaded them first in the one skiff and then in the other as the boats settled under the weight he kept pushing them farther and farther out in order that they should keep clear of the bottom  joe worked away steadily though he could not help marveling at the queerness of the whole business why should there be such a mystery about it and why such care taken to maintain silence he had just begun to ask himself these questions and a horrible suspicion was forming itself in his mind when he heard the hoot of an owl from the direction of the beach wondering at an owl being in so unlikely a place he stooped to gather a fresh load of iron but suddenly a man sprang out of the gloom flashing a dark lantern full upon him blinded by the light he staggered back then a revolver in the mans hand went off like the roar of a cannon all joe realized was that he was being shot at while his legs manifested an overwhelming desire to get away even if he had so wished he could not very well have stayed to explain to the excited man with the smoking revolver so he took to his heels for the beach colliding with another man with a dark lantern who came running around the end of one of the piles of iron this second man quickly regained his feet and peppered away at joe as he flew down the bank  he dashed out into the water for the boat french pete at the bowoars and frisco kid at the stroke had the skiffs nose pointed seaward and were calmly awaiting his arrival they had their oars ready for the start but they held them quietly at rest for all that both men on the bank had begun to fire at them the other skiff lay closer inshore partially aground bill was trying to shove it off and was calling on the cockney to lend a hand but that gentleman had lost his head completely and came floundering through the water hard after joe no sooner had joe climbed in over the stern than he followed him this extra weight on the stern of the heavily loaded craft nearly swamped them as it was a dangerous quantity of water was shipped in the meantime the men on the bank had reloaded their pistols and opened fire again this time with better aim the alarm had spread voices and cries could be heard from the ships on the pier along which men were running in the distance a police whistle was being frantically blown  get out frisco kid shouted you aint agoing to sink us if i know it go and help your pardner  but the cockneys teeth were chattering with fright and he was too unnerved to move or speak  trow ze crazy man out french pete ordered from the bow at this moment a bullet shattered an oar in his hand and he coolly proceeded to ship a spare one  give us a hand joe frisco kid commanded  joe understood and together they seized the terrorstricken creature and flung him overboard two or three bullets splashed about him as he came to the surface just in time to be picked up by bill who had at last succeeded in getting clear  now french pete called and a few strokes into the darkness quickly took them out of the zone of fire  so much water had been shipped that the light skiff was in danger of sinking at any moment while the other two rowed and by the frenchmans orders joe began to throw out the iron this saved them for the time being but just as they swept alongside the dazzler the skiff lurched shoved a side under and turned turtle sending the remainder of the iron to bottom joe and frisco kid came up side by side and together they clambered aboard with the skiffs painter in tow french pete had already arrived and now helped them out  by the time they had canted the water out of the swamped boat bill and his partner appeared on the scene all hands worked rapidly and almost before joe could realize the mainsail and jib had been hoisted the anchor broken out and the dazzler was leaping down the channel off a bleak piece of marshland bill and the cockney said goodby and cast loose in their skiff french pete in the cabin bewailed their bad luck in various languages and sought consolation in the winebottle     chapter x  with the bay pirates   the wind freshened as they got clear of the land and soon the dazzler was heeling it with her lee deck buried and the water churning by halfway up the cockpitrail sidelights had been hung out frisco kid was steering and by his side sat joe pondering over the events of the night  he could no longer blind himself to the facts his mind was in a whirl of apprehension if he had done wrong he reasoned he had done it through ignorance and he did not feel shame for the past so much as he did fear for the future his companions were thieves and robbersthe bay pirates of whose wild deeds he had heard vague tales and here he was right in the midst of them already possessing information which could send them to states prison this very fact he knew would force them to keep a sharp watch upon him and so lessen his chances of escape but escape he would at the very first opportunity  at this point his thoughts were interrupted by a sharp squall which hurled the dazzler over till the sea rushed inboard frisco kid luffed quickly at the same time slacking off the mainsheet then singlehandedfor french pete remained belowand with joe looking idly on he proceeded to reef down  the squall which had so nearly capsized the dazzler was of short duration but it marked the rising of the wind and soon puff after puff was shrieking down upon them out of the north the mainsail was spilling the wind and slapping and thrashing about till it seemed it would tear itself to pieces the sloop was rolling wildly in the quick sea which had come up everything was in confusion but even joes untrained eye showed him that it was an orderly confusion he could see that frisco kid knew just what to do and just how to do it as he watched him he learned a lesson the lack of which has made failures of the lives of many menthe value of knowledge of ones own capacities frisco kid knew what he was able to do and because of this he had confidence in himself he was cool and selfpossessed working hurriedly but not carelessly there was no bungling every reefpoint was drawn down to stay other accidents might occur but the next squall or the next forty squalls would not carry one of those reefknots away  he called joe forard to help stretch the mainsail by means of swinging on the peak and throathalyards to lay out on the long bowsprit and put a single reef in the jib was a slight task compared with what had been already accomplished so a few moments later they were again in the cockpit under the other lads directions joe flattened down the jibsheet and going into the cabin let down a foot or so of centerboard the excitement of the struggle had chased all unpleasant thoughts from his mind patterning after the other boy he had retained his coolness he had executed his orders without fumbling and at the same time without undue slowness together they had exerted their puny strength in the face of violent nature and together they had outwitted her  he came back to where his companion stood at the tiller steering and he felt proud of him and of himself and when he read the unspoken praise in frisco kids eyes he blushed like a girl at her first compliment but the next instant the thought flashed across him that this boy was a thief a common thief and he instinctively recoiled his whole life had been sheltered from the harsher things of the world his reading which had been of the best had laid a premium upon honesty and uprightness and he had learned to look with abhorrence upon the criminal classes so he drew a little away from frisco kid and remained silent but frisco kid devoting all his energies to the handling of the sloop had no time in which to remark this sudden change of feeling on the part of his companion  but there was one thing joe found in himself that surprised him while the thought of frisco kid being a thief was repulsive to him frisco kid himself was not instead of feeling an honest desire to shun him he felt drawn toward him he could not help liking him though he knew not why had he been a little older he would have understood that it was the lads good qualities which appealed to himhis coolness and selfreliance his manliness and bravery and a certain kindliness and sympathy in his nature as it was he thought it his own natural badness which prevented him from disliking frisco kid but while he felt shame at his own weakness he could not smother the warm regard which he felt growing up for this particular bay pirate  take in two or three feet on the skiffs painter commanded frisco kid who had an eye for everything  the skiff was towing with too long a painter and was behaving very badly every once in a while it would hold back till the towrope tautened then come leaping ahead and sheering and dropping slack till it threatened to shove its nose under the huge whitecaps which roared so hungrily on every hand joe climbed over the cockpitrail to the slippery afterdeck and made his way to the bitt to which the skiff was fastened  be careful frisco kid warned as a heavy puff struck the dazzler and careened her dangerously over on her side keep one turn round the bitt and heave in on it when the painter slacks  it was ticklish work for a greenhorn joe threw off all the turns save the last which he held with one hand while with the other he attempted to bring in on the painter but at that instant it tightened with a tremendous jerk the boat sheering sharply into the crest of a heavy sea the rope slipped from his hands and began to fly out over the stern he clutched it frantically and was dragged after it over the sloping deck  let her go let her go frisco kid shouted  joe let go just as he was on the verge of going overboard and the skiff dropped rapidly astern he glanced in a shamefaced way at his companion expecting to be sharply reprimanded for his awkwardness but frisco kid smiled goodnaturedly  that s all right he said no bones broke and nobody overboard better to lose a boat than a man any day that s what i say besides i should nt have sent you out there and there s no harm done we can pick it up all right go in and drop some more centerboarda couple of feetand then come out and do what i tell you but dont be in a hurry take it easy and sure  joe dropped the centerboard and returned to be stationed at the jibsheet  hard alee frisco kid cried throwing the tiller down and following it with his body cast off that s right now lend a hand on the mainsheet  together hand over hand they came in on the reefed mainsail joe began to warm up with the work the dazzler turned on her heel like a racehorse and swept into the wind her canvas snarling and her sheets slatting like hail  draw down the jibsheet  joe obeyed and the headsail filling forced her off on the other tack this manoeuver had turned french petes bunk from the lee to the weather side and rolled him out on the cabin floor where he lay in a drunken stupor  frisco kid with his back against the tiller and holding the sloop off that it might cover their previous course looked at him with an expression of disgust and muttered the dog we could well go to the bottom for all he d care or do  twice they tacked trying to go over the same ground and then joe discovered the skiff bobbing to windward in the starlit darkness  plenty of time frisco kid cautioned shooting the dazzler into the wind toward it and gradually losing headway now  joe leaned over the side grasped the trailing painter and made it fast to the bitt then they tacked ship again and started on their way joe still felt ashamed for the trouble he had caused but frisco kid quickly put him at ease  oh that s nothing he said everybody does that when they re beginning now some men forget all about the trouble they had in learning and get mad when a greeny makes a mistake i never do why i remember  and then he told joe of many of the mishaps which fell to him when as a little lad he first went on the water and of some of the severe punishments for the same which were measured out to him he had passed the running end of a lanyard over the tillerneck and as they talked they sat side by side and close against each other in the shelter of the cockpit  what place is that joe asked as they flew by a lighthouse blinking from a rocky headland  goat island they ve got a naval training station for boys over on the other side and a torpedomagazine there s jolly good fishing toorockcod we ll pass to the lee of it and make across and anchor in the shelter of angel island there s a quarantine station there then when french pete gets sober we ll know where he wants to go you can turn in now and get some sleep i can manage all right  joe shook his head there had been too much excitement for him to feel in the least like sleeping he could not bear to think of it with the dazzler leaping and surging along and shattering the seas into clouds of spray on her weather bow his clothes had half dried already and he preferred to stay on deck and enjoy it  the lights of oakland had dwindled till they made only a hazy flare against the sky but to the south the san francisco lights topping hills and sinking into valleys stretched miles upon miles starting from the great ferry building and passing on to telegraph hill joe was soon able to locate the principal places of the city somewhere over in that maze of light and shadow was the home of his father and perhaps even now they were thinking and worrying about him and over there bessie was sleeping cozily to wake up in the morning and wonder why her brother joe did not come down to breakfast joe shivered it was almost morning then slowly his head dropped over on frisco kids shoulder and he was fast asleep     chapter xi  captain and crew   come wake up we re going into anchor  joe roused with a start bewildered at the unusual scene for sleep had banished his troubles for the time being and he knew not where he was then he remembered the wind had dropped with the night beyond the heavy aftersea was still rolling but the dazzler was creeping up in the shelter of a rocky island the sky was clear and the air had the snap and vigor of early morning about it the rippling water was laughing in the rays of the sun just shouldering above the eastern skyline to the south lay alcatraz island and from its guncrowned heights a flourish of trumpets saluted the day in the west the golden gate yawned between the pacific ocean and san francisco bay a fullrigged ship with her lightest canvas even to the skysails set was coming slowly in on the floodtide  it was a pretty sight joe rubbed the sleep from his eyes and drank in the glory of it till frisco kid told him to go forard and make ready for dropping the anchor  overhaul about fifty fathoms of chain he ordered and then stand by he eased the sloop gently into the wind at the same time casting off the jibsheet let go the jibhalyards and come in on the downhaul  joe had seen the manoeuver performed the previous night and so was able to carry it out with fair success  now over with the mudhook watch out for turns lively now  the chain flew out with startling rapidity and brought the dazzler to rest frisco kid went forard to help and together they lowered the mainsail furled it in shipshape manner and made all fast with the gaskets and put the crutches under the mainboom  here s a bucket said frisco kid as he passed him the article in question wash down the decks and dont be afraid of the water nor of the dirt either here s a broom give it what for and have everything shining when you get that done bail out the skiff she opened her seams a little last night i m going below to cook breakfast  the water was soon slushing merrily over the deck while the smoke pouring from the cabin stove carried a promise of good things to come time and again joe lifted his head from his task to take in the scene it was one to appeal to any healthy boy and he was no exception the romance of it stirred him strangely and his happiness would have been complete could he have escaped remembering who and what his companions were the thought of this and of french pete in his bleary sleep below marred the beauty of the day he had been unused to such things and was shocked at the harsh reality of life but instead of hurting him as it might a lad of weaker nature it had the opposite effect it strengthened his desire to be clean and strong and to not be ashamed of himself in his own eyes he glanced about him and sighed why could not men be honest and true it seemed too bad that he must go away and leave all this but the events of the night were strong upon him and he knew that in order to be true to himself he must escape  at this juncture he was called to breakfast he discovered that frisco kid was as good a cook as he was a sailor and made haste to do justice to the fare there were mush and condensed milk beefsteak and fried potatoes and all topped off with good french bread butter and coffee french pete did not join them though frisco kid attempted a couple of times to rouse him he mumbled and grunted half opened his bleared eyes then fell to snoring again  cant tell when he s going to get those spells frisco kid explained when joe having finished washing dishes came on deck sometimes he wont get that way for a month and others he wont be decent for a week at a stretch sometimes he s goodnatured and sometimes he s dangerous so the best thing to do is to let him alone and keep out of his way and dont cross him for if you do there s liable to be trouble  come on let s take a swim he added abruptly changing the subject to one more agreeable can you swim  joe nodded  what s that place he asked as he poised before diving pointing toward a sheltered beach on the island where there were several buildings and a large number of tents  quarantine station lots of smallpox coming in now on the china steamers and they make them go there till the doctors say they re safe to land i tell you they re strict about it too why  splash had frisco kid finished his sentence just then instead of diving overboard much trouble might have been saved to joe but he did not finish it and joe dived after him  i ll tell you what frisco kid suggested half an hour later while they clung to the bobstay preparatory to climbing out let s catch a mess of fish for dinner and then turn in and make up for the sleep we lost last night what d you say  they made a race to clamber aboard but joe was shoved over the side again when he finally did arrive the other lad had brought to light a pair of heavily leaded largehooked lines and a mackerelkeg of salt sardines  bait he said just shove a whole one on they re not a bit particlar swallow the bait hook and all and gothat s their caper the fellow that does nt catch the first fish has to clean em  both sinkers started on their long descent together and seventy feet of line whizzed out before they came to rest but at the instant his sinker touched the bottom joe felt the struggling jerks of a hooked fish as he began to haul in he glanced at frisco kid and saw that he too had evidently captured a finny prize the race between them was exciting hand over hand the wet lines flashed inboard but frisco kid was more expert and his fish tumbled into the cockpit first joes followed an instant latera threepound rockcod he was wild with joy it was magnificentthe largest fish he had ever landed or ever seen landed over went the lines again and up they came with two mates of the ones already captured it was sport royal joe would certainly have continued till he had fished the bay empty had not frisco kid persuaded him to stop  we ve got enough for three meals now he said so there s no use in having them spoil besides the more you catch the more you clean and you d better start in right away i m going to bed     chapter xii  joe tries to take french leave   joe did not mind in fact he was glad he had not caught the first fish for it helped out a little plan which had come to him while swimming he threw the last cleaned fish into a bucket of water and glanced about him the quarantine station was a bare halfmile away and he could make out a soldier pacing up and down at sentry duty on the beach going into the cabin he listened to the heavy breathing of the sleepers he had to pass so close to frisco kid to get his bundle of clothes that he decided not to take it returning outside he carefully pulled the skiff alongside got aboard with a pair of oars and cast off  at first he rowed very gently in the direction of the station fearing the chance of noise if he made undue haste but gradually he increased the strength of his strokes till he had settled down to the regular stride when he had covered half the distance he glanced about escape was sure now for he knew even if he were discovered that it would be impossible for the dazzler to get under way and head him off before he made the land and the protection of that man who wore the uniform of uncle sams soldiers  the report of a gun came to him from the shore but his back was in that direction and he did not bother to turn around a second report followed and a bullet cut the water within a couple of feet of his oarblade this time he did turn around the soldier on the beach was leveling his rifle at him for a third shot  joe was in a predicament and a very tantalizing one at that a few minutes of hard rowing would bring him to the beach and to safety but on that beach for some unaccountable reason stood a united states soldier who persisted in firing at him when joe saw the gun aimed at him for the third time he backed water hastily as a result the skiff came to a standstill and the soldier lowering his rifle regarded him intently  i want to come ashore important joe shouted out to him  the man in uniform shook his head  but it s important i tell you wont you let me come ashore  he took a hurried look in the direction of the dazzler the shots had evidently awakened french pete for the mainsail had been hoisted and as he looked he saw the anchor broken out and the jib flung to the breeze  cant land here the soldier shouted back smallpox  but i must he cried choking down a halfsob and preparing to row  then i ll shoot you was the cheering response and the rifle came to shoulder again  joe thought rapidly the island was large perhaps there were no soldiers farther on and if he only once got ashore he did not care how quickly they captured him he might catch the smallpox but even that was better than going back to the bay pirates he whirled the skiff half about to the right and threw all his strength against the oars the cove was quite wide and the nearest point which he must go around a good distance away had he been more of a sailor he would have gone in the other direction for the opposite point and thus had the wind on his pursuers as it was the dazzler had a beam wind in which to overtake him  it was nip and tuck for a while the breeze was light and not very steady so sometimes he gained and sometimes they once it freshened till the sloop was within a hundred yards of him and then it dropped suddenly flat the dazzlers big mainsail flapping idly from side to side  ah you steal ze skiff eh french pete howled at him running into the cabin for his rifle i fix you you come back queeck or i kill you but he knew the soldier was watching them from the shore and did not dare to fire even over the lads head  joe did not think of this for he who had never been shot at in all his previous life had been under fire twice in the last twentyfour hours once more or less could nt amount to much so he pulled steadily away while french pete raved like a wild man threatening him with all manner of punishments once he laid hands upon him again to complicate matters frisco kid waxed mutinous  just you shoot him and i ll see you hung for itsee if i dont he threatened you d better let him go he s a good boy and all right and not raised for the dirty life you and i are leading  you too eh the frenchman shrieked beside himself with rage den i fix you you rat  he made a rush for the boy but frisco kid led him a lively chase from cockpit to bowsprit and back again a sharp capful of wind arriving just then french pete abandoned the one chase for the other springing to the tiller and slacking away on the mainsheetfor the wind favoredhe headed the sloop down upon joe the latter made one tremendous spurt then gave up in despair and hauled in his oars french pete let go the mainsheet lost steerageway as he rounded up alongside the motionless skiff and dragged joe out  keep mum frisco kid whispered to him while the irate frenchman was busy fastening the painter dont talk back let him say all he wants to and keep quiet it ll be better for you  but joes anglosaxon blood was up and he did not heed  look here mr french pete or whatever your name is he commenced i give you to understand that i want to quit and that i m going to quit so you d better put me ashore at once if you dont i ll put you in prison or my name s not joe bronson  frisco kid waited the outcome fearfully french pete was aghast he was being defied aboard his own vesseland by a boy never had such a thing been heard of he knew he was committing an unlawful act in detaining him but at the same time he was afraid to let him go with the information he had gathered concerning the sloop and its occupation the boy had spoken the unpleasant truth when he said he could send him to prison the only thing for him to do was to bully him  you will eh his shrill voice rose wrathfully den you come too you row ze boat lasta nightanswer me dat you steal ze ironanswer me dat you run awayanswer me dat and den you say you put me in jail bah  but i did nt know joe protested  ha ha dat is funny you tell dat to ze judge mebbe him laugh eh  i say i did nt he reiterated manfully i did nt know i d shipped along with a lot of thieves  frisco kid winced at this epithet and had joe been looking at him he would have seen a red flush mount to his face  and now that i do know he continued i wish to be put ashore i dont know anything about the law but i do know something of right and wrong and i m willing to take my chance with any judge for whatever wrong i have donewith all the judges in the united states for that matter and that s more than you can say mr pete  you say dat eh vaire good but you are one big tief  i m notdont you dare call me that again joes face was pale and he was tremblingbut not with fear  tief the frenchman taunted back  you lie  joe had not been a boy among boys for nothing he knew the penalty which attached itself to the words he had just spoken and he expected to receive it so he was not overmuch surprised when he picked himself up from the floor of the cockpit an instant later his head still ringing from a stiff blow between the eyes  say dat one time more french pete bullied his fist raised and prepared to strike  tears of anger stood in joes eyes but he was calm and in deadly earnest when you say i am a thief pete you lie you can kill me but still i will say you lie  no you dont frisco kid had darted in like a cat preventing a second blow and shoving the frenchman back across the cockpit  you leave the boy alone he continued suddenly unshipping and arming himself with the heavy iron tiller and standing between them this thing s gone just about as far as it s going to go you big fool cant you see the stuff the boy s made of he speaks true he s right and he knows it and you could kill him and he would nt give in there s my hand on it joe he turned and extended his hand to joe who returned the grip you ve got spunk and you re not afraid to show it  french petes mouth twisted itself in a sickly smile but the evil gleam in his eyes gave it the lie he shrugged his shoulders and said ah so he does not deesire dat i call him pet names ha ha it is only ze sailorman play let uswhat you callforgive and forget eh vaire good forgive and forget  he reached out his hand but joe refused to take it frisco kid nodded approval while french pete still shrugging his shoulders and smiling passed into the cabin  slack off ze mainsheet he called out and run down for hunters point for one time i will cook ze dinner and den you will say dat it is ze vaire good dinner ah french pete is ze great cook  that s the way he always doesgets real good and cooks when he wants to make up frisco kid hazarded slipping the tiller into the rudderhead and obeying the order but even then you cant trust him  joe nodded his head but did not speak he was in no mood for conversation he was still trembling from the excitement of the last few moments while deep down he questioned himself on how he had behaved and found nothing to be ashamed of     chapter xiii  befriending each other   the afternoon seabreeze had sprung up and was now rioting in from the pacific angel island was fast dropping astern and the waterfront of san francisco showing up as the dazzler plowed along before it soon they were in the midst of the shipping passing in and out among the vessels which had come from the ends of the earth later they crossed the fairway where the ferry steamers crowded with passengers passed to and fro between san francisco and oakland one came so close that the passengers crowded to the side to see the gallant little sloop and the two boys in the cockpit joe gazed enviously at the row of downturned faces they were all going to their homes while hehe was going he knew not whither at the will of french pete he was half tempted to cry out for help but the foolishness of such an act struck him and he held his tongue turning his head his eyes wandered along the smoky heights of the city and he fell to musing on the strange way of men and ships on the sea  frisco kid watched him from the corner of his eye following his thoughts as accurately as though he spoke them aloud  got a home over there somewheres he queried suddenly waving his hand in the direction of the city  joe started so correctly had his thought been guessed yes he said simply  tell us about it  joe rapidly described his home though forced to go into greater detail because of the curious questions of his companion frisco kid was interested in everything especially in mrs bronson and bessie of the latter he could not seem to tire and poured forth question after question concerning her so peculiar and artless were some of them that joe could hardly forbear to smile  now tell me about yours he said when he at last had finished  frisco kid seemed suddenly to harden and his face took on a stern look which the other had never seen there before he swung his foot idly to and fro and lifted a dull eye aloft to the mainpeak blocks with which by the way there was nothing the matter  go ahead the other encouraged  i have nt no home  the four words left his mouth as though they had been forcibly ejected and his lips came together after them almost with a snap  joe saw he had touched a tender spot and strove to ease the way out of it again then the home you did have he did not dream that there were lads in the world who never had known homes or that he had only succeeded in probing deeper  never had none  oh his interest was aroused and he now threw solicitude to the winds any sisters  nope  mother  i was so young when she died that i dont remember her  father  i never saw much of him he went to seaanyhow he disappeared  oh joe did not know what to say and an oppressive silence broken only by the churn of the dazzlers forefoot fell upon them  just then pete came out to relieve at the tiller while they went in to eat both lads hailed his advent with feelings of relief and the awkwardness vanished over the dinner which was all their skipper had claimed it to be afterward frisco kid relieved pete and while he was eating joe washed up the dishes and put the cabin shipshape then they all gathered in the stern where the captain strove to increase the general cordiality by entertaining them with descriptions of life among the pearldivers of the south seas  in this fashion the afternoon wore away they had long since left san francisco behind rounded hunters point and were now skirting the san mateo shore joe caught a glimpse once of a party of cyclists rounding a cliff on the san bruno road and remembered the time when he had gone over the same ground on his own wheel it was only a month or two before but it seemed an age to him now so much had there been to come between  by the time supper had been eaten and the things cleared away they were well down the bay off the marshes behind which redwood city clustered the wind had gone down with the sun and the dazzler was making but little headway when they sighted a sloop bearing down upon them on the dying wind frisco kid instantly named it as the reindeer to which french pete after a deep scrutiny agreed he seemed very much pleased at the meeting  red nelson runs her frisco kid informed joe and he s a terror and no mistake i m always afraid of him when he comes near they ve got something big down here and they re always after french pete to tackle it with them he knows more about it whatever it is  joe nodded and looked at the approaching craft curiously though somewhat larger it was built on about the same lines as the dazzler which meant above everything else that it was built for speed the mainsail was so large that it was more like that of a racingyacht and it carried the points for no less than three reefs in case of rough weather aloft and on deck everything was in placenothing was untidy or useless from runninggear to standing rigging everything bore evidence of thorough order and smart seamanship  the reindeer came up slowly in the gathering twilight and went to anchor a biscuittoss away french pete followed suit with the dazzler and then went in the skiff to pay them a visit the two lads stretched themselves out on top the cabin and awaited his return  do you like the life joe broke silence  the other turned on his elbow welli do and then again i dont the fresh air and the salt water and all that and the freedomthat s all right but i dont like thethe he paused a moment as though his tongue had failed in its duty and then blurted out the stealing  then why dont you quit it joe liked the lad more than he dared confess to himself and he felt a sudden missionary zeal come upon him  i will just as soon as i can turn my hand to something else  but why not now  now is the accepted time was ringing in joes ears and if the other wished to leave it seemed a pity that he did not and at once  where can i go what can i do there s nobody in all the world to lend me a hand just as there never has been i tried it once and learned my lesson too well to do it again in a hurry  well when i get out of this i m going home guess my father was right after all and i dont see maybewhat s the matter with you going with me he said this last without thinking impulsively and frisco kid knew it  you dont know what you re talking about he answered fancy me going off with you what d your father say andand the rest how would he think of me and what d he do  joe felt sick at heart he realized that in the spirit of the moment he had given an invitation which on sober thought he knew would be impossible to carry out he tried to imagine his father receiving in his own house a stranger like frisco kidno that was not to be thought of then forgetting his own plight he fell to racking his brains for some other method by which frisco kid could get away from his present surroundings  he might turn me over to the police the other went on and send me to a refuge i d die first before i d let that happen to me and besides joe i m not of your kind and you know it why i d be like a fish out of water what with all the things i did nt know nope i guess i ll have to wait a little before i strike out but there s only one thing for you to do and that s to go straight home first chance i get i ll land you and then i ll deal with french pete  no you dont joe interrupted hotly when i leave i m not going to leave you in trouble on my account so dont you try anything like that i ll get away never fear and if i can figure it out i want you to come along too come along anyway and figure it out afterward what d you say  frisco kid shook his head and gazing up at the starlit heavens wandered off into dreams of the life he would like to lead but from which he seemed inexorably shut out the seriousness of life was striking deeper than ever into joes heart and he lay silent thinking hard a mumble of heavy voices came to them from the reindeer and from the land the solemn notes of a church bell floated across the water while the summer night wrapped them slowly in its warm darkness     chapter xiv  among the oysterbeds   time and the world slipped away and both boys were aroused by the harsh voice of french pete from the sleep into which they had fallen  get under way he was bawling here you sho cast off ze gaskets queeck lively you kid ze jib  joe was clumsy in the darkness not knowing the names of things and the places where they were to be found but he made fair progress and when he had tossed the gaskets into the cockpit was ordered forward to help hoist the mainsail after that the anchor was hove in and the jib set then they coiled down the halyards and put everything in order before they returned aft  vaire good vaire good the frenchman praised as joe dropped in over the rail splendeed you make ze good sailorman i know for sure  frisco kid lifted the cover of one of the cockpit lockers and glanced questioningly at french pete  for sure that mariner replied put up ze sidelights  frisco kid took the red and green lanterns into the cabin to light them and then went forward with joe to hang them in the rigging  they re not goin to tackle it frisco kid said in an undertone  what joe asked  that big thing i was tellin you was down here somewhere it s so big i guess that french pete s most afraid to go in for it red nelson d go in quicker n a wink but he dont know enough about it cant go in you see till pete gives the word  where are we going now joe questioned  dont know oysterbeds most likely from the way we re heading  it was an uneventful trip a breeze sprang up out of the night behind them and held steady for an hour or more then it dropped and became aimless and erratic puffing gently first from one quarter and then another french pete remained at the tiller while occasionally joe or frisco kid took in or slacked off a sheet  joe sat and marveled that the frenchman should know where he was going to joe it seemed that they were lost in the impenetrable darkness which shrouded them a high fog had rolled in from the pacific and though they were beneath it came between them and the stars depriving them of the little light from that source  but french pete seemed to know instinctively the direction he should go and once in reply to a query from joe bragged of his ability to go by the feel of things  i feel ze tide ze wind ze speed he explained even do i feel ze land dat i tell you for sure how i do not know only do i know dat i feel ze land just like my arm grow long miles and miles long and i put my hand upon ze land and feel it and know dat it is there  joe looked incredulously at frisco kid  that s right he affirmed after you ve been on the water a good while you come to feel the land and if your nose is any account you can usually smell it  an hour or so later joe surmised from the frenchmans actions that they were approaching their destination he seemed on the alert and was constantly peering into the darkness ahead as though he expected to see something at any moment joe looked very hard but saw only the darkness  try ze stick kid french pete ordered i tink it is about ze time  frisco kid unlashed a long and slender pole from the top of the cabin and standing on the narrow deck amidships plunged one end of it into the water and drove it straight down  about fifteen feet he said  what ze bottom  mud was the answer  wait one while den we try some more  five minutes afterward the pole was plunged overside again  two fathoms joe answeredshells  french pete rubbed his hands with satisfaction vaire good vaire well he said i hit ze ground every time you cant foola ze old man i tell you dat for sure  frisco kid continued operating the pole and announcing the results to the mystification of joe who could not comprehend their intimate knowledge of the bottom of the bay  ten feetshells frisco kid went on in a monotonous voice leven feetshells fourteen feetsoft sixteen feetmud no bottom  ah ze channel said french pete at this  for a few minutes it was no bottom and then suddenly came frisco kids cry eight feethard  dat ll do french pete commanded run forard you sho an let go ze jib you kid get all ready ze hook  joe found the jibhalyard and cast it off the pin and as the canvas fluttered down came in hand over hand on the downhaul  let er go came the command and the anchor dropped into the water carrying but little chain after it  frisco kid threw over plenty of slack and made fast then they furled the sails made things tidy and went below and to bed  it was six oclock when joe awoke and went out into the cockpit to look about wind and sea had sprung up and the dazzler was rolling and tossing and now and again fetching up on her anchorchain with a savage jerk he was forced to hold on to the boom overhead to steady himself it was a gray and leaden day with no signs of the rising sun while the sky was obscured by great masses of flying clouds  joe sought for the land a mile and a half away it laya long low stretch of sandy beach with a heavy surf thundering upon it behind appeared desolate marshlands while far beyond towered the contra costa hills  changing the direction of his gaze joe was startled by the sight of a small sloop rolling and plunging at her anchor not a hundred yards away she was nearly to windward and as she swung off slightly he read her name on the stern the flying dutchman one of the boats he had seen lying at the city wharf in oakland a little to the left of her he discovered the ghost and beyond were half a dozen other sloops at anchor  what i tell you  joe looked quickly over his shoulder french pete had come out of the cabin and was triumphantly regarding the spectacle  what i tell you cant foola ze old man dat s what i hit it in ze dark just so well as in ze sunshine i knowi know  is she goin to howl frisco kid asked from the cabin where he was starting the fire  the frenchman gravely studied sea and sky for a couple of minutes  mebbe blow overmebbe blow up was his doubtful verdict get breakfast queeck and we try ze dredging  smoke was rising from the cabins of the different sloops denoting that they were all bent on getting the first meal of the day so far as the dazzler was concerned it was a simple matter and soon they were putting a single reef in the mainsail and getting ready to weigh anchor  joe was curious these were undoubtedly the oysterbeds but how under the sun in that wild sea were they to get oysters he was quickly to learn the way lifting a section of the cockpit flooring french pete brought out two triangular frames of steel at the apex of one of these triangles in a ring for the purpose he made fast a piece of stout rope from this the sides inch rods diverged at almost right angles and extended down for a distance of four feet or more where they were connected by the third side of the triangle which was the bottom of the dredge this was a flat plate of steel over a yard in length to which was bolted a row of long sharp teeth likewise of steel attached to the toothed plate and to the sides of the frame was a net of very coarse fishingtwine which joe correctly surmised was there to catch the oysters raked loose by the teeth from the bottom of the bay  a rope being made fast to each of the dredges they were dropped overboard from either side of the dazzler when they had reached the bottom and were dragging with the proper length of line out they checked her speed quite noticeably joe touched one of the lines with his hands and could feel plainly the shock and jar and grind as it tore over the bottom  all in french pete shouted  the boys laid hold of the line and hove in the dredge the net was full of mud and slime and small oysters with here and there a large one this mess they dumped on the deck and picked over while the dredge was dragging again the large oysters they threw into the cockpit and shoveled the rubbish overboard there was no rest for by this time the other dredge required emptying and when this was done and the oysters sorted both dredges had to be hauled aboard so that french pete could put the dazzler about on the other tack  the rest of the fleet was under way and dredging back in similar fashion sometimes the different sloops came quite close to them and they hailed them and exchanged snatches of conversation and rough jokes but in the main it was hard work and at the end of an hour joes back was aching from the unaccustomed strain and his fingers were cut and bleeding from his clumsy handling of the sharpedged oysters  dat s right french pete said approvingly you learn queeck vaire soon you know how  joe grinned ruefully and wished it was dinnertime now and then when a light dredge was hauled the boys managed to catch breath and say a couple of words  that s asparagus island frisco kid said indicating the shore at least that s what the fishermen and scowsailors call it the people who live there call it bay farm island he pointed more to the right and over there is san leandro you cant see it but it s there  ever been there joe asked  frisco kid nodded his head and signed to him to help heave in the starboard dredge  these are what they call the deserted beds he said again nobody owns them so the oyster pirates come down and make a bluff at working them  why a bluff  cause they re pirates that s why and because there s more money in raiding the private beds  he made a sweeping gesture toward the east and southeast the private beds are over yonder and if it dont storm the whole fleet ll be raidin em tonight  and if it does storm joe asked  why we wont raid them and french pete ll be mad that s all he always hates being put out by the weather but it dont look like lettin up and this is the worst possible shore in a souwester pete may try to hang on but it s best to get out before she howls  at first it did seem as though the weather were growing better the stiff southwest wind dropped perceptibly and by noon when they went to anchor for dinner the sun was breaking fitfully through the clouds  that s all right frisco kid said prophetically but i aint been on the bay for nothing she s just gettin ready to let us have it good an hard  i tink you re right kid french pete agreed but ze dazzler hang on all ze same lasta time she run away an fine night come dis time she run not away eh vaire good     chapter xv  good sailors in a wild anchorage   all afternoon the dazzler pitched and rolled at her anchorage and as evening drew on the wind deceitfully eased down this and the example set by french pete encouraged the rest of the oysterboats to attempt to ride out the night but they looked carefully to their moorings and put out spare anchors  french pete ordered the two boys into the skiff and at the imminent risk of swamping they carried out a second anchor at nearly right angles to the first one and dropped it over french pete then ran out a great quantity of chain and rope so that the dazzler dropped back a hundred feet or more where she rode more easily  it was a wild stretch of water which joe looked upon from the shelter of the cockpit the oysterbeds were out in the open bay utterly unprotected and the wind sweeping the water for a clean twelve miles kicked up so tremendous a sea that at every moment it seemed as though the wallowing sloops would roll their masts overside just before twilight a patch of sail sprang up to windward and grew and grew until it resolved itself into the huge mainsail of the reindeer  ze beeg fool french pete cried running out of the cabin to see sometimeah sometime i tell youhe crack on like dat an he go pouf just like dat poufan no more nelson no more reindeer no more nothing  joe looked inquiringly at frisco kid  that s right he answered nelson ought to have at least one reef in two d be better but there he goes every inch spread as though some fiend was after im he drives too hard he s too reckless when there aint the smallest need for it i ve sailed with him and i know his ways  like some huge bird of the air the reindeer lifted and soared down on them on the foaming crest of a wave  dont mind frisco kid warned he s only tryin to see how close he can come to us without hittin us  joe nodded and stared with wide eyes at the thrilling sight the reindeer leaped up in the air pointing her nose to the sky till they could see her whole churning forefoot then she plunged downward till her forard deck was flush with the foam and with a dizzying rush she drove past them her mainboom missing the dazzlers rigging by scarcely a foot  nelson at the wheel waved his hand to them as he hurtled past and laughed joyously in french petes face who was angered by the dangerous trick  when to leeward the splendid craft rounded to the wind rolling once till her brown bottom showed to the centerboard and they thought she was over then righting and dashing ahead again like a thing possessed she passed abreast of them on the starboard side they saw the jib run down with a rush and an anchor go overboard as she shot into the wind and as she fell off and back and off and back with a spilling mainsail they saw a second anchor go overboard wide apart from the first then the mainsail came down on the run and was furled and fastened by the time she had tightened to her double hawsers  ah ah never was there such a man  the frenchmans eyes were glistening with admiration for such perfect seamanship and frisco kids were likewise moist  just like a yacht he said as he went back into the cabin just like a yacht only better  as night came on the wind began to rise again and by eleven oclock had reached the stage which frisco kid described as howlin there was little sleep on the dazzler he alone closed his eyes french pete was up and down every few minutes twice when he went on deck he paid out more chain and rope joe lay in his blankets and listened the while vainly courting sleep he was not frightened but he was untrained in the art of sleeping in the midst of such turmoil and uproar and violent commotion nor had he imagined a boat could play as wild antics as did the dazzler and still survive often she wallowed over on her beam till he thought she would surely capsize at other times she leaped and plunged in the air and fell upon the seas with thunderous crashes as though her bottom were shattered to fragments again she would fetch up taut on her hawsers so suddenly and so fiercely as to reel from the shock and to groan and protest through every timber  frisco kid awoke once and smiled at him saying  this is what they call hangin on but just you wait till daylight comes and watch us clawin off if some of the sloops dont go ashore i m not me that s all  and thereat he rolled over on his side and was off to sleep joe envied him about three in the morning he heard french pete crawl up forard and rummage around in the eyes of the boat joe looked on curiously and by the dim light of the wildly swinging sealamp saw him drag out two spare coils of line these he took up on deck and joe knew he was bending them on to the hawsers to make them still longer  at halfpast four french pete had the fire going and at five he called the boys for coffee this over they crept into the cockpit to gaze on the terrible scene the dawn was breaking bleak and gray over a wild waste of tumbling water they could faintly see the beachline of asparagus island but they could distinctly hear the thunder of the surf upon it and as the day grew stronger they made out that they had dragged fully half a mile during the night  the rest of the fleet had likewise dragged the reindeer was almost abreast of them la caprice lay a few hundred yards away and to leeward straggling between them and shore were five more of the struggling oysterboats  two missing frisco kid announced putting the glasses to his eyes and searching the beach  and there s one he cried and after studying it carefully he added the go ask her she ll be in pieces in no time i hope they got ashore  french pete looked through the glasses and then joe he could clearly see the unfortunate sloop lifting and pounding in the surf and on the beach he spied the men who made up her crew  where s ze ghost french pete queried  frisco kid looked for her in vain along the beach but when he turned the glass seaward he quickly discovered her riding safely in the growing light half a mile or more to windward  i ll bet she did nt drag a hundred feet all night he said must ve struck good holdingground  mud was french petes verdict just one vaire small patch of mud right there if she get trough it she s a sureenough goner i tell you dat her anchors vaire light only good for mud i tell ze boys get more heavy anchors but dey laugh some day be sorry for sure  one of the sloops to leeward raised a patch of sail and began the terrible struggle out of the jaws of destruction and death they watched her for a space rolling and plunging fearfully and making very little headway  french pete put a stop to their gazing come on he shouted put two reef in ze mainsail we get out queeck  while occupied with this a shout aroused them looking up they saw the ghost dead ahead and right on top of them and dragging down upon them at a furious rate  french pete scrambled forward like a cat at the same time drawing his knife with one stroke of which he severed the rope that held them to the spare anchor this threw the whole weight of the dazzler on the chainanchor in consequence she swung off to the left and just in time for the next instant drifting stern foremost the ghost passed over the spot she had vacated  why she s got four anchors out joe exclaimed at sight of four taut ropes entering the water almost horizontally from her bow  two of em s dredges frisco kid grinned and there goes the stove  as he spoke two young fellows appeared on deck and dropped the cookingstove overside with a line attached  phew frisco kid cried look at nelson he s got one reef in and you can just bet that s a sign she s howlin  the reindeer came foaming toward them breasting the storm like some magnificent seaanimal red nelson waved to them as he passed astern and fifteen minutes later when they were breaking out the one anchor that remained to them he passed well to windward on the other tack  french pete followed her admiringly though he said ominously some day pouf he go just like dat i tell you sure  a moment later the dazzlers reefed jib was flung out and she was straining and struggling in the thick of the fight it was slow work and hard and dangerous clawing off that lee shore and joe found himself marveling often that so small a craft could possibly endure a minute in such elemental fury but little by little she worked off the shore and out of the groundswell into the deeper waters of the bay where the mainsheet was slacked away a bit and she ran for shelter behind the rock wall of the alameda mole a few miles away here they found the reindeer calmly at anchor and here during the next several hours straggled in the remainder of the fleet with the exception of the ghost which had evidently gone ashore to keep the go ask her company  by afternoon the wind had dropped away with surprising suddenness and the weather had turned almost summerlike  it does nt look right frisco kid said in the evening after french pete had rowed over in the skiff to visit nelson  what does nt look right joe asked  why the weather it went down too sudden it did nt have a chance to blow itself out and it aint going to quit till does blow itself out it s likely to puff up and howl at any moment if i know anything about it  where will we go from here joe asked back to the oysterbeds  frisco kid shook his head i cant say what french pete ll do he s been fooled on the iron and fooled on the oysters and he s that disgusted he s liable to do most anything desperate i would nt be surprised to see him go off with nelson towards redwood city where that big thing is that i was tellin you about it s somewhere over there  well i wont have anything to do with it joe announced decisively  of course not frisco kid answered and with nelson and his two men an french pete i dont think there ll be any need for you anyway     chapter xvi  frisco kids dittybox   after the conversation died away the two lads lay upon the cabin for perhaps an hour then without saying a word frisco kid went below and struck a light joe could hear him fumbling about and a little later heard his own name called softly on going into the cabin he saw frisco kid sitting on the edge of the bunk a sailors dittybox on his knees and in his hand a carefully folded page from a magazine  does she look like this he asked smoothing it out and turning it that the other might see  it was a halfpage illustration of two girls and a boy grouped evidently in an oldfashioned roomy attic and holding a council of some sort the girl who was talking faced the onlooker while the backs of the other two were turned  who joe queried glancing in perplexity from the picture to frisco kids face  youryour sisterbessie  the word seemed reluctant in coming to his lips and he expressed himself with a certain shy reverence as though it were something unspeakably sacred  joe was nonplussed for the moment he could see no bearing between the two in point and anyway girls were rather silly creatures to waste ones time over he s actually blushing he thought regarding the soft glow on the others cheeks he felt an irresistible desire to laugh and tried to smother it down  no no dont frisco kid cried snatching the paper away and putting it back in the dittybox with shaking fingers then he added more slowly i thoughtii kind o thought you would understand andand  his lips trembled and his eyes glistened with unwonted moistness as he turned hastily away  the next instant joe was by his side on the bunk his arm around him prompted by some instinctive monitor he had done it before he thought a week before he could not have imagined himself in such an absurd situationhis arm around a boy but now it seemed the most natural thing in the world he did not comprehend but he knew whatever it was that it was of deep importance to his companion  go ahead and tell us he urged i ll understand  no you wont you cant  yes sure go ahead  frisco kid choked and shook his head i dont think i could anyway it s more the things i feel and i dont know how to put them in words joes hand patted his shoulder reassuringly and he went on well it s this way you see i dont know much about the land and people and things and i never had any brothers or sisters or playmates all the time i did nt know it but i was lonelysort of missed them down in here somewheres he placed a hand over his breast did you ever feel downright hungry well that s just the way i used to feel only a different kind of hunger and me not knowing what it was but one day oh a long time back i got ahold of a magazine and saw a picturethat picture with the two girls and the boy talking together i thought it must be fine to be like them and i got to thinking about the things they said and did till it came to me all of a sudden like and i knew it was just loneliness was the matter with me  but more than anything else i got to wondering about the girl who looks out of the picture right at you i was thinking about her all the time and by and by she became real to me you see it was making believe and i knew it all the time and then again i did nt whenever i d think of the men and the work and the hard life i d know it was makebelieve but when i d think of her it was nt i dont know i cant explain it  joe remembered all his own adventures which he had imagined on land and sea and nodded he at least understood that much  of course it was all foolishness but to have a girl like that for a comrade or friend seemed more like heaven to me than anything else i knew of as i said it was a long while back and i was only a little kidthat was when red nelson gave me my name and i ve never been anything but frisco kid ever since but the girl in the picture i was always getting that picture out to look at her and before long if i was nt squarewhy i felt ashamed to look at her afterwards when i was older i came to look at it in another way i thought suppose kid some day you were to meet a girl like that what would she think of you could she like you could she be even the least bit of a friend to you and then i d make up my mind to be better to try and do something with myself so that she or any of her kind of people would not be ashamed to know me  that s why i learned to read that s why i ran away nicky perrata a greek boy taught me my letters and it was nt till after i learned to read that i found out there was anything really wrong in baypirating i d been used to it ever since i could remember and almost all the people i knew made their living that way but when i did find out i ran away thinking to quit it for good i ll tell you about it sometime and how i m back at it again  of course she seemed a real girl when i was a youngster and even now she sometimes seems that way i ve thought so much about her but while i m talking to you it all clears up and she comes to me in this light she stands just for a plain idea a better cleaner life than this and one i d like to live and if i could live it why i d come to know that kind of girls and their kind of peopleyour kind that s what i mean so i was wondering about your sister and you and that s whyi dont know i guess i was just wondering but i suppose you know lots of girls like that dont you  joe nodded his head  then tell me about themsomething anything he added as he noted the fleeting expression of doubt in the others eyes  oh that s easy joe began valiantly to a certain extent he did understand the lads hunger and it seemed a simple enough task to at least partially satisfy him to begin with they re likehemwhy they re likegirls just girls he broke off with a miserable sense of failure  frisco kid waited patiently his face a study in expectancy  joe struggled valiantly to marshal his forces to his mind in quick succession came the girls with whom he had gone to schoolthe sisters of the boys he knew and those who were his sisters friends slim girls and plump girls tall girls and short girls blueeyed and browneyed curlyhaired blackhaired goldenhaired in short a procession of girls of all sorts and descriptions but to save himself he could say nothing about them anyway he d never been a sissy and why should he be expected to know anything about them all girls are alike he concluded desperately they re just the same as the ones you know kidsure they are  but i dont know any  joe whistled and never did  yes one carlotta gispardi but she could nt speak english and i could nt speak dago and she died i dont care though i never knew any i seem to know as much about them as you do  and i guess i know more about adventures all over the world than you do joe retorted  both boys laughed but a moment later joe fell into deep thought it had come upon him quite swiftly that he had not been duly grateful for the good things of life he did possess already home father and mother had assumed a greater significance to him but he now found himself placing a higher personal value upon his sister and his chums and friends he had never appreciated them properly he thought but henceforthwell there would be a different tale to tell  the voice of french pete hailing them put a finish to the conversation for they both ran on deck     chapter xvii  frisco kid tells his story   get up ze mainsail and break out ze hook the frenchman shouted and den tail on to ze reindeer no sidelights  come cast off those gasketslively frisco kid ordered now lay on to the peakhalyardsthere that ropecast it off the pin and dont hoist ahead of me there make fast we ll stretch it afterwards run aft and come in on the mainsheet shove the helm up  under the sudden driving power of the mainsail the dazzler strained and tugged at her anchor like an impatient horse till the muddy iron left the bottom with a rush and she was free  let go the sheet come forard again and lend a hand on the chain stand by to give her the jib frisco kid the boy who mooned over girls in pictorial magazines had vanished and frisco kid the sailor strong and dominant was on deck he ran aft and tacked about as the jib rattled aloft in the hands of joe who quickly joined him just then the reindeer like a monstrous bat passed to leeward of them in the gloom  ah dose boys dey take alla night they heard french pete exclaim and then the gruff voice of red nelson who said never you mind frenchy i taught the kid his sailorizing and i aint never been ashamed of him yet  the reindeer was the faster boat but by spilling the wind from her sails they managed so that the boys could keep them in sight the breeze came steadily in from the west with a promise of early increase the stars were being blotted out by masses of driving clouds which indicated a greater velocity in the upper strata frisco kid surveyed the sky  going to have it good and stiff before morning he said just as i told you  several hours later both boats stood in for the san mateo shore and dropped anchor not more than a cableslength away a little wharf ran out the bare end of which was perceptible to them though they could discern a small yacht lying moored to a buoy a short distance away  according to their custom everything was put in readiness for hasty departure the anchors could be tripped and the sails flung out on a moments notice both skiffs came over noiselessly from the reindeer red nelson had given one of his two men to french pete so that each skiff was doubly manned they were not a very prepossessing group of menat least joe did not think sofor their faces bore a savage seriousness which almost made him shiver the captain of the dazzler buckled on his pistolbelt and placed a rifle and a stout doubleblock tackle in the boat then he poured out wine all around and standing in the darkness of the little cabin they pledged success to the expedition red nelson was also armed while his men wore at their hips the customary sailors sheathknife they were very slow and careful to avoid noise in getting into the boats french pete pausing long enough to warn the boys to remain quietly aboard and not try any tricks  now d be your chance joe if they had nt taken the skiff frisco kid whispered when the boats had vanished into the loom of the land  what s the matter with the dazzler was the unexpected answer we could up sail and away before you could say jack robinson  frisco kid hesitated the spirit of comradeship was strong in the lad and deserting a companion in a pinch could not but be repulsive to him  i dont think it d be exactly square to leave them in the lurch ashore he said of course he went on hurriedly i know the whole thing s wrong but you remember that first night when you came running through the water for the skiff and those fellows on the bank busy popping away we did nt leave you in the lurch did we  joe assented reluctantly and then a new thought flashed across his mind but they re piratesand thievesand criminals they re breaking the law and you and i are not willing to be lawbreakers besides they ll not be left there s the reindeer there s nothing to prevent them from getting away on her and they ll never catch us in the dark  come on then though he had agreed frisco kid did not quite like it for it still seemed to savor of desertion  they crawled forward and began to hoist the mainsail the anchor they could slip if necessary and save the time of pulling it up but at the first rattle of the halyards on the sheaves a warning hist came to them through the darkness followed by a loudly whispered drop that  glancing in the direction from which these sounds proceeded they made out a white face peering at them from over the rail of the other sloop  aw it s only the reindeers boy frisco kid said come on  again they were interrupted at the first rattling of the blocks  i say you fellers you d better let go them halyards pretty quick i m atellin you or i ll give you what for  this threat being dramatically capped by the click of a cocking pistol frisco kid obeyed and went grumblingly back to the cockpit oh there s plenty more chances to come he whispered consolingly to joe french pete was cute was nt he he thought you might be trying to make a break and put a guard on us  nothing came from the shore to indicate how the pirates were faring not a dog barked not a light flared yet the air seemed quivering with an alarm about to burst forth the night had taken on a strained feeling of intensity as though it held in store all kinds of terrible things the boys felt this keenly as they huddled against each other in the cockpit and waited  you were going to tell me about your running away joe ventured finally and why you came back again  frisco kid took up the tale at once speaking in a muffled undertone close to the others ear  you see when i made up my mind to quit the life there was nt a soul to lend me a hand but i knew that the only thing for me to do was to get ashore and find some kind of work so i could study then i figured there d be more chance in the country than in the city so i gave red nelson the slipi was on the reindeer then one night on the alameda oysterbeds i got ashore and headed back from the bay as fast as i could sprint nelson did nt catch me but they were all portuguese farmers thereabouts and none of them had work for me besides it was in the wrong time of the yearwinter that shows how much i knew about the land  i d saved up a couple of dollars and i kept traveling back deeper and deeper into the country looking for work and buying bread and cheese and such things from the storekeepers i tell you it was cold nights sleeping out without blankets and i was always glad when morning came but worse than that was the way everybody looked on me they were all suspicious and not a bit afraid to show it and sometimes they d set their dogs on me and tell me to get along seemed as though there was nt any place for me on the land then my money gave out and just about the time i was good and hungry i got captured  captured what for  nothing living i suppose i crawled into a haystack to sleep one night because it was warmer and along comes a village constable and arrests me for being a tramp at first they thought i was a runaway and telegraphed my description all over i told them i did nt have any people but they would nt believe me for a long while and then when nobody claimed me the judge sent me to a boys refuge in san francisco  he stopped and peered intently in the direction of the shore the darkness and the silence in which the men had been swallowed up was profound nothing was stirring save the rising wind  i thought i d die in that refuge it was just like being in jail we were locked up and guarded like prisoners even then if i could have liked the other boys it might have been all right but they were mostly streetboys of the worst kindlying and sneaking and cowardly without one spark of manhood or one idea of square dealing and fair play there was only one thing i did like and that was the books oh i did lots of reading i tell you but that could nt make up for the rest i wanted the freedom and the sunlight and the salt water and what had i done to be kept in prison and herded with such a gang instead of doing wrong i had tried to do right to make myself better and that s what i got for it i was nt old enough you see to reason anything out  sometimes i d see the sunshine dancing on the water and showing white on the sails and the reindeer cutting through it just as you please and i d get that sick i would know hardly what i did and then the boys would come against me with some of their meannesses and i d start in to lick the whole kit of them then the men in charge would lock me up and punish me well i could nt stand it any longer i watched my chance and ran for it seemed as though there was nt any place on the land for me so i picked up with french pete and went back on the bay that s about all there is to it though i m going to try it again when i get a little olderold enough to get a square deal for myself  you re going to go back on the land with me joe said authoritatively laying a hand on his shoulder that s what you re going to do as for  bang a revolvershot rang out from the shore bang bang more guns were speaking sharply and hurriedly a mans voice rose wildly on the air and died away somebody began to cry for help both boys were on their feet on the instant hoisting the mainsail and getting everything ready to run the reindeer boy was doing likewise a man roused from his sleep on the yacht thrust an excited head through the skylight but withdrew it hastily at sight of the two stranger sloops the intensity of waiting was broken the time for action come     chapter xviii  a new responsibility for joe   heaving in on the anchorchain till it was up and down frisco kid and joe ceased from their exertions everything was in readiness to give the dazzler the jib and go they strained their eyes in the direction of the shore the clamor had died away but here and there lights were beginning to flash the creaking of a block and tackle came to their ears and they heard red nelsons voice singing out lower away and cast off  french pete forgot to oil it frisco kid commented referring to the tackle  takin their time about it aint they the boy on the reindeer called over to them sitting down on the cabin and mopping his face after the exertion of hoisting the mainsail singlehanded  guess they re all right frisco kid rejoined all ready  yesall right here  say you the man on the yacht cried through the skylight not venturing to show his head you d better go away  and you d better stay below and keep quiet was the response we ll take care of ourselves you do the same  if i was only out of this i d show you he threatened  lucky for you you re not responded the boy on the reindeer and thereat the man kept quiet  here they come said frisco kid suddenly to joe  the two skiffs shot out of the darkness and came alongside some kind of an altercation was going on as french petes voice attested  no no he cried put it on ze dazzler ze reindeer she sail too fasta and run away oh so queeck and never more i see it put it on ze dazzler eh wot you say  all right then red nelson agreed we ll whack up afterwards but say hurry up out with you lads and heave her up my arm s broke  the men tumbled out ropes were cast inboard and all hands with the exception of joe tailed on the shouting of men the sound of oars and the rattling and slapping of blocks and sails told that the men on shore were getting under way for the pursuit  now red nelson commanded all together dont let her come back or you ll smash the skiff there she takes it a long pull and a strong pull once again and yet again get a turn there somebody and take a spell  though the task was but half accomplished they were exhausted by the strenuous effort and hailed the rest eagerly joe glanced over the side to discover what the heavy object might be and saw the vague outlines of a small officesafe  now all together red nelson began again take her on the run and dont let her stop yo ho heave ho once again and another over with her  straining and gasping with tense muscles and heaving chests they brought the cumbersome weight over the side rolled it on top of the rail and lowered it into the cockpit on the run the cabin doors were thrown apart and it was moved along end for end till it lay on the cabin floor snug against the end of the centerboardcase red nelson had followed it aboard to superintend his left arm hung helpless at his side and from the fingertips blood dripped with monotonous regularity he did not seem to mind it however nor even the mutterings of the human storm he had raised ashore and which to judge by the sounds was even then threatening to break upon them  lay your course for the golden gate he said to french pete as he turned to go i ll try to stand by you but if you get lost in the dark i ll meet you outside off the farralones in the morning he sprang into the skiff after the men and with a wave of his uninjured arm cried heartily and then it s for mexico my ladsmexico and summer weather  just as the dazzler freed from her anchor paid off under the jib and filled away a dark sail loomed under their stern barely missing the skiff in tow the cockpit of the stranger was crowded with men who raised their voices angrily at sight of the pirates joe had half a mind to run forward and cut the halyards so that the dazzler might be captured as he had told french pete the day before he had done nothing to be ashamed of and was not afraid to go before a court of justice but the thought of frisco kid restrained him he wanted to take him ashore with him but in so doing he did not wish to take him to jail so he too began to experience a keen interest in the escape of the dazzler  the pursuing sloop rounded up hurriedly to come about after them and in the darkness fouled the yacht which lay at anchor the man aboard of her thinking that at last his time had come gave one wild yell ran on deck and leaped overboard in the confusion of the collision and while they were endeavoring to save him french pete and the boys slipped away into the night  the reindeer had already disappeared and by the time joe and frisco kid had the runninggear coiled down and everything in shape they were standing out in open water the wind was freshening constantly and the dazzler heeled a lively clip through the comparatively smooth stretch before an hour had passed the lights of hunters point were well on her starboard beam frisco kid went below to make coffee but joe remained on deck watching the lights of south san francisco grow and speculating on their destination mexico they were going to sea in such a frail craft impossible at least it seemed so to him for his conceptions of ocean travel were limited to steamers and fullrigged ships he was beginning to feel half sorry that he had not cut the halyards and longed to ask french pete a thousand questions but just as the first was on his lips that worthy ordered him to go below and get some coffee and then to turn in he was followed shortly afterward by frisco kid french pete remaining at his lonely task of beating down the bay and out to sea twice he heard the waves buffeted back from some flying forefoot and once he saw a sail to leeward on the opposite tack which luffed sharply and came about at sight of him but the darkness favored and he heard no more of itperhaps because he worked into the wind closer by a point and held on his way with a shaking afterleech  shortly after dawn the two boys were called and came sleepily on deck the day had broken cold and gray while the wind had attained half a gale joe noted with astonishment the white tents of the quarantine station on angel island san francisco lay a smoky blur on the southern horizon while the night still lingering on the western edge of the world slowly withdrew before their eyes french pete was just finishing a long reach into the raccoon straits and at the same time studiously regarding a plunging sloopyacht half a mile astern  dey tink to catch ze dazzler eh bah and he brought the craft in question about laying a course straight for the golden gate  the pursuing yacht followed suit joe watched her a few moments she held an apparently parallel course to them and forged ahead much faster  why at this rate they ll have us in no time he cried  french pete laughed you tink so bah dey outfoot we outpoint dey are scared of ze wind we wipe ze eye of ze wind ah you wait you see  they re traveling ahead faster frisco kid explained but we re sailing closer to the wind in the end we ll beat them even if they have the nerve to cross the barwhich i dont think they have look see  ahead could be seen the great ocean surges flinging themselves skyward and bursting into roaring caps of smother in the midst of it now rolling her dripping bottom clear now sousing her deckload of lumber far above the guards a coasting steamschooner was lumbering drunkenly into port it was magnificentthis battle between man and the elements whatever timidity he had entertained fled away and joes nostrils began to dilate and his eyes to flash at the nearness of the impending struggle  french pete called for his oilskins and souwester and joe also was equipped with a spare suit then he and frisco kid were sent below to lash and cleat the safe in place in the midst of this task joe glanced at the firmname giltlettered on the face of it and read bronson  tate why that was his father and his fathers partner that was their safe their money frisco kid nailing the last cleat on the floor of the cabin looked up and followed his fascinated gaze  that s rough is nt it he whispered your father  joe nodded he could see it all now they had run into san andreas where his father worked the big quarries and most probably the safe contained the wages of the thousand men or more whom he employed dont say anything he cautioned  frisco kid agreed knowingly french pete cant read anyway he muttered and the chances are that red nelson wont know what your name is but just the same it s pretty rough they ll break it open and divide up as soon as they can so i dont see what you re going to do about it  wait and see joe had made up his mind that he would do his best to stand by his fathers property at the worst it could only be lost and that would surely be the case were he not along while being along he at least had a fighting chance to save it or to be in position to recover it responsibilities were showering upon him thick and fast but a few days back he had had but himself to consider then in some subtle way he had felt a certain accountability for frisco kids future welfare and after that and still more subtly he had become aware of duties which he owed to his position to his sister to his chums and friends and now by a most unexpected chain of circumstances came the pressing need of service for his fathers sake it was a call upon his deepest strength and he responded bravely while the future might be doubtful he had no doubt of himself and this very state of mind this selfconfidence by a generous alchemy gave him added resolution nor did he fail to be vaguely aware of it and to grasp dimly at the truth that confidence breeds confidencestrength strength     chapter xix  the boys plan an escape   now she takes it french pete cried  both lads ran into the cockpit they were on the edge of the breaking bar a huge fortyfooter reared a foamcrested head far above them stealing their wind for the moment and threatening to crush the tiny craft like an eggshell joe held his breath it was the supreme moment french pete luffed straight into it and the dazzler mounted the steep slope with a rush poised a moment on the giddy summit and fell into the yawning valley beyond keeping off in the intervals to fill the mainsail and luffing into the combers they worked their way across the dangerous stretch once they caught the tailend of a whitecap and were wellnigh smothered in the froth but otherwise the sloop bobbed and ducked with the happy facility of a cork  to joe it seemed as though he had been lifted out of himselfout of the world ah this was life this was action surely it could not be the old commonplace world he had lived in so long the sailors grouped on the streaming deckload of the steamer waved their souwesters and on the bridge even the captain was expressing his admiration for the plucky craft  ah you see you see french pete pointed astern  the sloopyacht had been afraid to venture it and was skirting back and forth on the inner edge of the bar the chase was over a pilotboat running for shelter from the coming storm flew by them like a frightened bird passing the steamer as though the latter were standing still  half an hour later the dazzler sped beyond the last smoking sea and was sliding up and down on the long pacific swell the wind had increased its velocity and necessitated a reefing down of jib and mainsail then they laid off again full and free on the starboard tack for the farralones thirty miles away by the time breakfast was cooked and eaten they picked up the reindeer which was hove to and working offshore to the south and west the wheel was lashed down and there was not a soul on deck  french pete complained bitterly against such recklessness dat is ze one fault of red nelson he no care he is afraid of noting some day he will die oh so vaire queeck i know he will  three times they circled about the reindeer running under her weather quarter and shouting in chorus before they brought anybody on deck sail was then made at once and together the two cockleshells plunged away into the vastness of the pacific this was necessary as frisco kid informed joe in order to have an offing before the whole fury of the storm broke upon them otherwise they would be driven on the lee shore of the california coast grub and water he said could be obtained by running into the land when fine weather came he congratulated joe upon the fact that he was not seasick which circumstance likewise brought praise from french pete and put him in better humor with his mutinous young sailor  i ll tell you what we ll do frisco kid whispered while cooking dinner tonight we ll drag french pete down  drag french pete down  yes and tie him up good and snug as soon as it gets dark then put out the lights and make a run for land get to port anyway anywhere just so long as we shake loose from red nelson  yes joe deliberated that would be all rightif i could do it alone but as for asking you to help mewhy that would be treason to french pete  that s what i m coming to i ll help you if you promise me a few things french pete took me aboard when i ran away from the refuge when i was starving and had no place to go and i just cant repay him for that by sending him to jail t would nt be square your father would nt have you break your word would he  no of course not joe knew how sacredly his father held his word of honor  then you must promise and your father must see it carried out not to press any charge against french pete  all right and now what about yourself you cant very well expect to go away with him again on the dazzler  oh dont bother about me there s nobody to miss me i m strong enough and know enough about it to ship to sea as ordinary seaman i ll go away somewhere over on the other side of the world and begin all over again  then we ll have to call it off that s all  call what off  tying french pete up and running for it  no sir that s decided upon  now listen here i ll not have a thing to do with it i ll go on to mexico first if you dont make me one promise  and what s the promise  just this you place yourself in my hands from the moment we get ashore and trust to me you dont know anything about the land anywayyou said so and i ll fix it with my fatheri know i canso that you can get to know people of the right sort and study and get an education and be something else than a bay pirate or a sailor that s what you d like is nt it  though he said nothing frisco kid showed how well he liked it by the expression of his face  and it ll be no more than your due either joe continued you will have stood by me and you ll have recovered my fathers money he ll owe it to you  but i dont do things that way i dont think much of a man who does a favor just to be paid for it  now you keep quiet how much do you think it would cost my father for detectives and all that to recover that safe give me your promise that s all and when i ve got things arranged if you dont like them you can back out come on that s fair  they shook hands on the bargain and proceeded to map out their line of action for the night                                       but the storm yelling down out of the northwest had something entirely different in store for the dazzler and her crew by the time dinner was over they were forced to put double reefs in mainsail and jib and still the gale had not reached its height the sea also had been kicked up till it was a continuous succession of watermountains frightful and withal grand to look upon from the low deck of the sloop it was only when the sloops were tossed upon the crests of the waves at the same time that they caught sight of each other occasional fragments of seas swashed into the cockpit or dashed aft over the cabin and joe was stationed at the small pump to keep the well dry  at three oclock watching his chance french pete motioned to the reindeer that he was going to heave to and get out a seaanchor this latter was of the nature of a large shallow canvas bag with the mouth held open by triangularly lashed spars to this the towingropes were attached on the kite principle so that the greatest resisting surface was presented to the water the sloop drifting so much faster would thus be held bow on to both wind and seathe safest possible position in a storm red nelson waved his hand in response that he understood and to go ahead  french pete went forward to launch the seaanchor himself leaving it to frisco kid to put the helm down at the proper moment and run into the wind the frenchman poised on the slippery foredeck waiting an opportunity but at that moment the dazzler lifted into an unusually large sea and as she cleared the summit caught a heavy snort of the gale at the very instant she was righting herself to an even keel thus there was not the slightest yield to this sudden pressure on her sails and mastgear  there was a quick snap followed by a crash the steel weatherrigging carried away at the lanyards and mast jib mainsail blocks stays seaanchor french peteeverythingwent over the side almost by a miracle the captain clutched at the bobstay and managed to get one hand up and over the bowsprit the boys ran forward to drag him into safety and red nelson observing the disaster put up his helm and ran down to the rescue     chapter xx  perilous hours   french pete was uninjured from the fall overboard with the dazzlers mast but the seaanchor which had gone with him had not escaped so easily the gaff of the mainsail had been driven through it and it refused to work the wreckage thumping alongside held the sloop in a quartering slant to the seasnot so dangerous a position as it might be nor so safe either goodby olda dazzler never no more you wipe ze eye of ze wind never no more you kick your heels at ze crack gentlemenyachts  so the captain lamented standing in the cockpit and surveying the ruin with wet eyes even joe who bore him great dislike felt sorry for him at this moment a heavier blast of the wind caught the jagged crest of a wave and hurled it upon the helpless craft  cant we save her joe spluttered  frisco kid shook his head  nor the safe  impossible he answered could nt lay another boat alongside for a united states mint as it is it ll keep us guessing to save ourselves  another sea swept over them and the skiff which had long since been swamped dashed itself to pieces against the stern then the reindeer towered above them on a mountain of water joe caught himself half shrinking back for it seemed she would fall down squarely on top of them but the next instant she dropped into the gaping trough and they were looking down upon her far below it was a striking pictureone joe was destined never to forget the reindeer was wallowing in the snowwhite smother her rails flush with the sea the water scudding across her deck in foaming cataracts the air was filled with flying spray which made the scene appear hazy and unreal one of the men was clinging to the perilous afterdeck and striving to cast off the waterlogged skiff the boy leaning far over the cockpitrail and holding on for dear life was passing him a knife the second man stood at the wheel putting it up with flying hands and forcing the sloop to pay off beside him his injured arm in a sling was red nelson his souwester gone and his fair hair plastered in wet windblown ringlets about his face his whole attitude breathed indomitability courage strength it seemed almost as though the divine were blazing forth from him joe looked upon him in sudden awe and realizing the enormous possibilities of the man felt sorrow for the way in which they had been wasted a thief and a robber in that flashing moment joe caught a glimpse of human truth grasped at the mystery of success and failure life threw back its curtains that he might read it and understand of such stuff as red nelson were heroes made but they possessed wherein he lackedthe power of choice the careful poise of mind the sober control of soul in short the very things his father had so often preached to him about  these were the thoughts which came to joe in the flight of a second then the reindeer swept skyward and hurtled across their bow to leeward on the breast of a mighty billow  ze wild man ze wild man french pete shrieked watching her in amazement he tinks he can jibe he will die we will all die he must come about oh ze fool ze fool  but time was precious and red nelson ventured the chance at the right moment he jibed the mainsail over and hauled back on the wind  here she comes make ready to jump for it frisco kid cried to joe  the reindeer dashed by their stern heeling over till the cabin windows were buried and so close that it appeared she must run them down but a freak of the waters lurched the two crafts apart red nelson seeing that the manoeuver had miscarried instantly instituted another throwing the helm hard up the reindeer whirled on her heel thus swinging her overhanging mainboom closer to the dazzler french pete was the nearest and the opportunity could last no longer than a second like a cat he sprang catching the footrope with both hands then the reindeer forged ahead dipping him into the sea at every plunge but he clung on working inboard every time he emerged till he dropped into the cockpit as red nelson squared off to run down to leeward and repeat the manoeuver  your turn next frisco kid said  no yours joe replied  but i know more about the water frisco kid insisted  and i can swim as well as you the other retorted  it would have been hard to forecast the outcome of this dispute but as it was the swift rush of events made any settlement needless the reindeer had jibed over and was plowing back at breakneck speed careening at such an angle that it seemed she must surely capsize it was a gallant sight just then the storm burst in all its fury the shouting wind flattening the ragged crests till they boiled the reindeer dipped from view behind an immense wave the wave rolled on but the next moment where the sloop had been the boys noted with startled eyes only the angry waters doubting they looked a second time there was no reindeer they were alone on the torn crest of the ocean  god have mercy on their souls frisco kid said solemnly  joe was too horrified at the suddenness of the catastrophe to utter a sound  sailed her clean under and with the ballast she carried went straight to bottom frisco kid gasped then turning to their own pressing need he said now we ve got to look out for ourselves the back of the storm broke in that puff but the sea ll kick up worse yet as the wind eases down lend a hand and hang on with the other we ve got to get her headon  together knives in hand they crawled forward to where the pounding wreckage hampered the boat sorely frisco kid took the lead in the ticklish work but joe obeyed orders like a veteran every minute or two the bow was swept by the sea and they were pounded and buffeted about like a pair of shuttlecocks first the main portion of the wreckage was securely fastened to the forward bitts then breathless and gasping more often under the water than out they cut and hacked at the tangle of halyards sheets stays and tackles the cockpit was taking water rapidly and it was a race between swamping and completing the task at last however everything stood clear save the lee rigging frisco kid slashed the lanyards the storm did the rest the dazzler drifted swiftly to leeward of the wreckage till the strain on the line fast to the forward bitts jerked her bow into place and she ducked dead into the eye of the wind and sea  pausing only for a cheer at the success of their undertaking the two lads raced aft where the cockpit was half full and the dunnage of the cabin all afloat with a couple of buckets procured from the stern lockers they proceeded to fling the water overboard it was heartbreaking work for many a barrelful was flung back upon them again but they persevered and when night fell the dazzler bobbing merrily at her seaanchor could boast that her pumps sucked once more as frisco kid had said the backbone of the storm was broken though the wind had veered to the west where it still blew stiffly  if she holds frisco kid said referring to the breeze we ll drift to the california coast sometime tomorrow nothing to do now but wait  they said little oppressed by the loss of their comrades and overcome with exhaustion preferring to huddle against each other for the sake of warmth and companionship it was a miserable night and they shivered constantly from the cold nothing dry was to be obtained aboard food blankets everything being soaked with the salt water sometimes they dozed but these intervals were short and harassing for it seemed each took turn in waking with such sudden starts as to rouse the other  at last day broke and they looked about wind and sea had dropped considerably and there was no question as to the safety of the dazzler the coast was nearer than they had expected its cliffs showing dark and forbidding in the gray of dawn but with the rising of the sun they could see the yellow beaches flanked by the white surf and beyondit seemed too good to be truethe clustering houses and smoking chimneys of a town  santa cruz frisco kid cried and no chance of being wrecked in the surf  then the safe is safe joe queried  safe i should say so it aint much of a sheltered harbor for large vessels but with this breeze we ll run right up the mouth of the san lorenzo river then there s a little lake like and a boathouse water smooth as glass and hardly over your head you see i was down here once before with red nelson come on we ll be in in time for breakfast  bringing to light some spare coils of rope from the lockers he put a clovehitch on the standing part of the seaanchor hawser and carried the new runningline aft making it fast to the stern bitts then he cast off from the forward bitts the dazzler swung off into the trough completed the evolution and pointed her nose toward shore a couple of spare oars from below and as many watersoaked blankets sufficed to make a jurymast and sail when this was in place joe cast loose from the wreckage which was now towing astern while frisco kid took the tiller     chapter xxi  joe and his father   how s that cried frisco kid as he finished making the dazzler fast fore and aft and sat down on the stringpiece of the tiny wharf what ll we do next captain  joe looked up in quick surprise whyiwhat s the matter  well aint you captain now have nt we reached land i m crew from now on aint i what s your orders  joe caught the spirit of it pipe all hands for breakfastthat iswait a minute  diving below he possessed himself of the money he had stowed away in his bundle when he came aboard then he locked the cabin door and they went uptown in search of a restaurant over the breakfast joe planned the next move and when they had done communicated it to frisco kid  in response to his inquiry the cashier told him when the morning train started for san francisco he glanced at the clock  just time to catch it he said to frisco kid keep the cabin doors locked and dont let anybody come aboard here s money eat at the restaurants dry your blankets and sleep in the cockpit i ll be back tomorrow and dont let anybody into that cabin goodby  with a hasty handgrip he sped down the street to the depot the conductor looked at him with surprise when he punched his ticket and well he might for it was not the custom of his passengers to travel in seaboots and souwesters but joe did not mind he did not even notice he had bought a paper and was absorbed in its contents before long his eyes caught an interesting paragraph    supposed to have been lost    the tug sea queen chartered by bronson  tate   has returned from a fruitless cruise outside the   heads no news of value could be obtained   concerning the pirates who so daringly carried   off their safe at san andreas last tuesday night   the lighthousekeeper at the farralones mentions   having sighted the two sloops wednesday morning   clawing offshore in the teeth of the gale it is   supposed by shipping men that they perished in   the storm with their illgotten treasure rumor   has it that in addition to the ten thousand   dollars in gold the safe contained papers of   great importance  when joe had read this he felt a great relief it was evident no one had been killed at san andreas the night of the robbery else there would have been some comment on it in the paper nor if they had had any clue to his own whereabouts would they have omitted such a striking bit of information  at the depot in san francisco the curious onlookers were surprised to see a boy clad conspicuously in seaboots and souwester hail a cab and dash away but joe was in a hurry he knew his fathers hours and was fearful lest he should not catch him before he went to lunch  the officeboy scowled at him when he pushed open the door and asked to see mr bronson nor could the head clerk when summoned by this disreputable intruder recognize him  dont you know me mr willis  mr willis looked a second time why it s joe bronson of all things under the sun where did you drop from go right in your father s in there  mr bronson stopped dictating to his stenographer and looked up hello where have you been he said  to sea joe answered demurely not sure of just what kind of a reception he was to get and fingering his souwester nervously  short trip eh how did you make out  oh soso he had caught the twinkle in his fathers eye and knew that it was all clear sailing not so baderthat is considering  considering  well not exactly that rather it might have been worse while it could nt have been better  that s interesting sit down then turning to the stenographer you may go mr brown andhumi wont need you any more today  it was all joe could do to keep from crying so kindly and naturally had his father received him making him feel at once as if not the slightest thing uncommon had occurred it seemed as if he had just returned from a vacation or mangrown had come back from some business trip  now go ahead joe you were speaking to me a moment ago in conundrums and you have aroused my curiosity to a most uncomfortable degree  whereupon joe sat down and told what had happenedall that had happenedfrom monday night to that very moment each little incident he relatedevery detailnot forgetting his conversations with frisco kid nor his plans concerning him his face flushed and he was carried away with the excitement of the narrative while mr bronson was almost as eager urging him on whenever he slackened his pace but otherwise remaining silent  so you see joe concluded it could nt possibly have turned out any better  ah well mr bronson deliberated judiciously it may be so and then again it may not  i dont see it joe felt sharp disappointment at his fathers qualified approval it seemed to him that the return of the safe merited something stronger  that mr bronson fully comprehended the way joe felt about it was clearly in evidence for he went on as to the matter of the safe all hail to you joe credit and plenty of it is your due mr tate and myself have already spent five hundred dollars in attempting to recover it so important was it that we have also offered five thousand dollars reward and but this morning were considering the advisability of increasing the amount but my sonmr bronson stood up resting a hand affectionately on his boys shoulderthere are certain things in this world which are of still greater importance than gold or papers which represent what gold may buy how about yourself that s the point will you sell the best possibilities of your life right now for a million dollars  joe shook his head  as i said that s the point a human life the money of the world cannot buy nor can it redeem one which is misspent nor can it make full and complete and beautiful a life which is dwarfed and warped and ugly how about yourself what is to be the effect of all these strange adventures on your lifeyour life joe are you going to pick yourself up tomorrow and try it over again or the next day or the day after do you understand why joe do you think for one moment that i would place against the best value of my sons life the paltry value of a safe and can i say until time has told me whether this trip of yours could not possibly have been better such an experience is as potent for evil as for good one dollar is exactly like anotherthere are many in the world but no joe is like my joe nor can there be any others in the world to take his place dont you see joe dont you understand  mr bronsons voice broke slightly and the next instant joe was sobbing as though his heart would break he had never understood this father of his before and he knew now the pain he must have caused him to say nothing of his mother and sister but the four stirring days he had lived had given him a clearer view of the world and humanity and he had always possessed the power of putting his thoughts into speech so he spoke of these things and the lessons he had learnedthe conclusions he had drawn from his conversations with frisco kid from his intercourse with french pete from the graphic picture he retained of the reindeer and red nelson as they wallowed in the trough beneath him and mr bronson listened and in turn understood  but what of frisco kid father joe asked when he had finished  hum there seems to be a great deal of promise in the boy from what you say of him mr bronson hid the twinkle in his eye this time and i must confess he seems perfectly capable of shifting for himself  sir joe could not believe his ears  let us see then he is at present entitled to the half of five thousand dollars the other half of which belongs to you it was you two who preserved the safe from the bottom of the pacific and if you only had waited a little longer mr tate and myself would have increased the reward  oh joe caught a glimmering of the light part of that is easily arranged i simply refuse to take my half as to the otherthat is nt exactly what frisco kid desires he wants friendsandandthough you did nt say so they are far higher than money nor can money buy them he wants friends and a chance for an education not twentyfive hundred dollars  dont you think it would be better for him to choose for himself  ah no that s all arranged  arranged  yes sir he s captain on sea and i m captain on land so he s under my charge now  then you have the power of attorney for him in the present negotiations good i ll make you a proposition the twentyfive hundred dollars shall be held in trust by me on his demand at any time we ll settle about yours afterward then he shall be put on probation for say a yearin our office you can either coach him in his studies for i am confident now that you will be up in yours hereafter or he can attend nightschool and after that if he comes through his period of probation with flying colors i ll give him the same opportunities for an education that you possess it all depends on himself and now mr attorney what have you to say to my offer in the interests of your client  that i close with it at once  father and son shook hands  and what are you going to do now joe  send a telegram to frisco kid first and then hurry home  then wait a minute till i call up san andreas and tell mr tate the good news and then i ll go with you  mr willis mr bronson said as they left the outer office the san andreas safe is recovered and we ll all take a holiday kindly tell the clerks that they are free for the rest of the day and i say he called back as they entered the elevator dont forget the officeboy
