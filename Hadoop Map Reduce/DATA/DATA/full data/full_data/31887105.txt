31887105	tales of the argonauts   by bret harte     contents   the rose of tuolumne  a passage in the life of mr john oakhurst  wan lee the pagan  how old man plunkett went home  the fool of five forks  baby sylvester  an episode of fiddletown  a jersey centenarian     the rose of tuolumne   chapter i   it was nearly two oclock in the morning the lights were out in robinsons hall where there had been dancing and revelry and the moon riding high painted the black windows with silver the cavalcade that an hour ago had shocked the sedate pines with song and laughter were all dispersed one enamoured swain had ridden east another west another north another south and the object of their adoration left within her bower at chemisal ridge was calmly going to bed  i regret that i am not able to indicate the exact stage of that process two chairs were already filled with delicate inwrappings and white confusion and the young lady herself halfhidden in the silky threads of her yellow hair had at one time borne a faint resemblance to a partlyhusked ear of indian corn but she was now clothed in that one long formless garment that makes all women equal and the round shoulders and neat waist that an hour ago had been so fatal to the peace of mind of four forks had utterly disappeared the face above it was very pretty the foot below albeit shapely was not small the flowers as a general thing dont raise their heads much to look after me she had said with superb frankness to one of her lovers  the expression of the rose tonight was contentedly placid she walked slowly to the window and making the smallest possible peephole through the curtain looked out the motionless figure of a horseman still lingered on the road with an excess of devotion that only a coquette or a woman very much in love could tolerate the rose at that moment was neither and after a reasonable pause turned away saying quite audibly that it was too ridiculous for any thing as she came back to her dressingtable it was noticeable that she walked steadily and erect without that slight affectation of lameness common to people with whom bare feet are only an episode indeed it was only four years ago that without shoes or stockings a longlimbed colty girl in a waistless calico gown she had leaped from the tailboard of her fathers emigrantwagon when it first drew up at chemisal ridge certain wild habits of the rose had outlived transplanting and cultivation  a knock at the door surprised her in another moment she had leaped into bed and with darklyfrowning eyes from its secure recesses demanded whos there  an apologetic murmur on the other side of the door was the response  why fatheris that you  there were further murmurs affirmative deprecatory and persistent  wait said the rose she got up unlocked the door leaped nimbly into bed again and said come  the door opened timidly the broad stooping shoulders and grizzled head of a man past the middle age appeared after a moments hesitation a pair of large diffident feet shod with canvas slippers concluded to follow when the apparition was complete it closed the door softly and stood therea very shy ghost indeedwith apparently more than the usual spiritual indisposition to begin a conversation the rose resented this impatiently though i fear not altogether intelligibly  do father i declare  you was abed jinny said mr mcclosky slowly glancing with a singular mixture of masculine awe and paternal pride upon the two chairs and their contentsyou was abed and ondressed  i was  surely said mr mcclosky seating himself on the extreme edge of the bed and painfully tucking his feet away under itsurely after a pause he rubbed a short thick stumpy beard that bore a general resemblance to a badlyworn blackingbrush with the palm of his hand and went on you had a good time jinny  yes father  they was all there  yes rance and york and ryder and jack  and jack mr mcclosky endeavored to throw an expression of arch inquiry into his small tremulous eyes but meeting the unabashed widelyopened lid of his daughter he winked rapidly and blushed to the roots of his hair  yes jack was there said jenny without change of color or the least selfconsciousness in her great gray eyes and he came home with me she paused a moment locking her two hands under her head and assuming a more comfortable position on the pillow he asked me that same question again father and i said yes its to besoon were going to live at four forks in his own house and next winter were going to sacramento i suppose its all right father eh she emphasized the question with a slight kick through the bedclothes as the parental mcclosky had fallen into an abstract revery  yes surely said mr mcclosky recovering himself with some confusion after a pause he looked down at the bedclothes and patting them tenderly continued you couldnt have done better jinny they isnt a girl in tuolumne ez could strike it ez rich as you heveven if they got the chance he paused again and then said jinny  yes father  youse in bed and ondressed  yes  you couldnt said mr mcclosky glancing hopelessly at the two chairs and slowly rubbing his chinyou couldnt dress yourself again could yer  why father  kinder get yourself into them things again he added hastily not all of em you know but some of em not if i helped yousorter stood by and lent a hand now and then with a strap or a buckle or a necktie or a shoestring he continued still looking at the chairs and evidently trying to boldly familiarize himself with their contents  are you crazy father demanded jenny suddenly sitting up with a portentous switch of her yellow mane mr mcclosky rubbed one side of his beard which already had the appearance of having been quite worn away by that process and faintly dodged the question  jinny he said tenderly stroking the bedclothes as he spoke this yers whats the matter thar is a stranger down stairsa stranger to you lovey but a man ez ive knowed a long time hes been here about an hour and hell be here ontil fower oclock when the upstage passes now i wants ye jinny dear to get up and come down stairs and kinder help me pass the time with him its no use jinny he went on gently raising his hand to deprecate any interruption its no use he wont go to bed he wont play keerds whiskey dont take no effect on him ever since i knowed him he was the most onsatisfactory critter to hev round  what do you have him round for then interrupted miss jinny sharply  mr mccloskys eyes fell ef he hednt kem out of his way tonight to do me a good turn i wouldnt ask ye jinny i wouldnt so help me but i thought ez i couldnt do any thing with him you might come down and sorter fetch him jinny as you did the others  miss jenny shrugged her pretty shoulders  is he old or young  hes young enough jinny but he knows a power of things  what does he do  not much i reckon hes got money in the mill at four forks he travels round a good deal ive heard jinny that hes a poetwrites them rhymes you know mr mcclosky here appealed submissively but directly to his daughter he remembered that she had frequently been in receipt of printed elegaic couplets known as mottoes containing enclosures equally saccharine  miss jenny slightly curled her pretty lip she had that fine contempt for the illusions of fancy which belongs to the perfectly healthy young animal  not continued mr mcclosky rubbing his head reflectively not ez id advise ye jinny to say any thing to him about poetry it aint twenty minutes ago ez i did i set the whiskey afore him in the parlor i wound up the musicbox and set it goin then i sez to him sociablelike and free jest consider yourself in your own house and repeat what you allow to be your finest production and he raged that man jinny jest raged thars no end of the names he called me you see jinny continued mr mcclosky apologetically hes known me a long time  but his daughter had already dismissed the question with her usual directness ill be down in a few moments father she said after a pause but dont say any thing to him about itdont say i was abed  mr mccloskys face beamed you was allers a good girl jinny he said dropping on one knee the better to imprint a respectful kiss on her forehead but jenny caught him by the wrists and for a moment held him captive father said she trying to fix his shy eyes with the clear steady glance of her own all the girls that were there tonight had some one with them mame robinson had her aunt lucy rance had her mother kate pierson had her sisterall except me had some other woman father dear her lip trembled just a little i wish mother hadnt died when i was so small i wish there was some other woman in the family besides me i aint lonely with you father dear but if there was only some one you know when the time comes for john and me  her voice here suddenly gave out but not her brave eyes that were still fixed earnestly upon his face mr mcclosky apparently tracing out a pattern on the bedquilt essayed words of comfort  thar aint one of them gals ez youve named jinny ez could do what youve done with a whole noahs ark of relations at their backs thar aint one ez wouldnt sacrifice her nearest relation to make the strike that you hev ez to mothers maybe my dear youre doin better without one he rose suddenly and walked toward the door when he reached it he turned and in his old deprecating manner said dont be long jinny smiled and vanished from the head downward his canvas slippers asserting themselves resolutely to the last  when mr mcclosky reached his parlor again his troublesome guest was not there the decanter stood on the table untouched three or four books lay upon the floor a number of photographic views of the sierras were scattered over the sofa two sofapillows a newspaper and a mexican blanket lay on the carpet as if the late occupant of the room had tried to read in a recumbent position a french window opening upon a veranda which never before in the history of the house had been unfastened now betrayed by its waving lace curtain the way that the fugitive had escaped mr mcclosky heaved a sigh of despair he looked at the gorgeous carpet purchased in sacramento at a fabulous price at the crimson satin and rosewood furniture unparalleled in the history of tuolumne at the massivelyframed pictures on the walls and looked beyond it through the open window to the reckless man who fleeing these sybaritic allurements was smoking a cigar upon the moonlit road this room which had so often awed the youth of tuolumne into filial respect was evidently a failure it remained to be seen if the rose herself had lost her fragrance i reckon jinny will fetch him yet said mr mcclosky with parental faith  he stepped from the window upon the veranda but he had scarcely done this before his figure was detected by the stranger who at once crossed the road when within a few feet of mcclosky he stopped you persistent old plantigrade he said in a low voice audible only to the person addressed and a face full of affected anxiety why dont you go to bed didnt i tell you to go and leave me here alone in the name of all thats idiotic and imbecile why do you continue to shuffle about here or are you trying to drive me crazy with your presence as you have with that wretched musicbox that ive just dropped under yonder tree its an hour and a half yet before the stage passes do you think do you imagine for a single moment that i can tolerate you until then eh why dont you speak are you asleep you dont mean to say that you have the audacity to add somnambulism to your other weaknesses youre not low enough to repeat yourself under any such weak pretext as that eh  a fit of nervous coughing ended this extraordinary exordium and half sitting half leaning against the veranda mr mccloskys guest turned his face and part of a slight elegant figure toward his host the lower portion of this upturned face wore an habitual expression of fastidious discontent with an occasional line of physical suffering but the brow above was frank and critical and a pair of dark mirthful eyes sat in playful judgment over the supersensitive mouth and its suggestion  i allowed to go to bed ridgeway said mr mcclosky meekly but my girl jinnys jist got back from a little tear up at robinsons and aint inclined to turn in yet you know what girls is so i thought we three would jist have a social chat together to pass away the time  you mendacious old hypocrite she got back an hour ago said ridgeway as that savagelooking escort of hers who has been haunting the house ever since can testify my belief is that like an enterprising idiot as you are youve dragged that girl out of her bed that we might mutually bore each other  mr mcclosky was too much stunned by this evidence of ridgeways apparently superhuman penetration to reply after enjoying his hosts confusion for a moment with his eyes ridgeways mouth asked grimly  and who is this girl anyway  nancys  your wifes  yes but look yar ridgeway said mcclosky laying one hand imploringly on ridgeways sleeve not a word about her to jinny she thinks her mothers deaddied in missouri eh  ridgeway nearly rolled from the veranda in an excess of rage good god do you mean to say that you have been concealing from her a fact that any day any moment may come to her ears that youve been letting her grow up in ignorance of something that by this time she might have outgrown and forgotten that you have been like a besotted old ass all these years slowly forging a thunderbolt that any one may crush her with thatbut here ridgeways cough took possession of his voice and even put a moisture into his dark eyes as he looked at mccloskys aimless hand feebly employed upon his beard  but said mcclosky look how shes done shes held her head as high as any of em shes to be married in a month to the richest man in the county and he added cunningly jack ashe aint the kind o man to sit by and hear any thing said of his wife or her relations you bet but hushthats her foot on the stairs shes cummin  she came i dont think the french window ever held a finer view than when she put aside the curtains and stepped out she had dressed herself simply and hurriedly but with a womans knowledge of her best points so that you got the long curves of her shapely limbs the shorter curves of her round waist and shoulders the long sweep of her yellow braids the light of her gray eyes and even the delicate rose of her complexion without knowing how it was delivered to you  the introduction by mr mcclosky was brief when ridgeway had got over the fact that it was two oclock in the morning and that the cheek of this tuolumne goddess nearest him was as dewy and fresh as an infants that she looked like marguerite without probably ever having heard of goethes heroine he talked i dare say very sensibly when miss jennywho from her childhood had been brought up among the sons of anak and who was accustomed to have the supremacy of our noble sex presented to her as a physical factfound herself in the presence of a new and strange power in the slight and elegant figure beside her she was at first frightened and cold but finding that this power against which the weapons of her own physical charms were of no avail was a kindly one albeit general she fell to worshipping it after the fashion of woman and casting before it the fetishes and other idols of her youth she even confessed to it so that in half an hour ridgeway was in possession of all the facts connected with her life and a great many i fear of her fanciesexcept one when mr mcclosky found the young people thus amicably disposed he calmly went to sleep  it was a pleasant time to each to miss jenny it had the charm of novelty and she abandoned herself to it for that reason much more freely and innocently than her companion who knew something more of the inevitable logic of the position i do not think however he had any intention of lovemaking i do not think he was at all conscious of being in the attitude i am quite positive he would have shrunk from the suggestion of disloyalty to the one woman whom he admitted to himself he loved but like most poets he was much more true to an idea than a fact and having a very lofty conception of womanhood with a very sanguine nature he saw in each new face the possibilities of a realization of his ideal it was perhaps an unfortunate thing for the women particularly as he brought to each trial a surprising freshness which was very deceptive and quite distinct from the blase familiarity of the man of gallantry it was this perennial virginity of the affections that most endeared him to the best women who were prone to exercise toward him a chivalrous protectionas of one likely to go astray unless looked afterand indulged in the dangerous combination of sentiment with the highest maternal instincts it was this quality which caused jenny to recognize in him a certain boyishness that required her womanly care and even induced her to offer to accompany him to the crossroads when the time for his departure arrived with her superior knowledge of woodcraft and the locality she would have kept him from being lost i wot not but that she would have protected him from bears or wolves but chiefly i think from the feline fascinations of mame robinson and lucy rance who might be lying in wait for this tender young poet nor did she cease to be thankful that providence had so to speak delivered him as a trust into her hands  it was a lovely night the moon swung low and languished softly on the snowy ridge beyond there were quaint odors in the still air and a strange incense from the woods perfumed their young blood and seemed to swoon in their pulses small wonder that they lingered on the white road that their feet climbed unwillingly the little hill where they were to part and that when they at last reached it even the saving grace of speech seemed to have forsaken them  for there they stood alone there was no sound nor motion in earth or woods or heaven they might have been the one man and woman for whom this goodly earth that lay at their feet rimmed with the deepest azure was created and seeing this they turned toward each other with a sudden instinct and their hands met and then their lips in one long kiss  and then out of the mysterious distance came the sound of voices and the sharp clatter of hoofs and wheels and jenny slid awaya white moonbeamfrom the hill for a moment she glimmered through the trees and then reaching the house passed her sleeping father on the veranda and darting into her bedroom locked the door threw open the window and falling on her knees beside it leaned her hot cheeks upon her hands and listened in a few moments she was rewarded by the sharp clatter of hoofs on the stony road but it was only a horseman whose dark figure was swiftly lost in the shadows of the lower road at another time she might have recognized the man but her eyes and ears were now all intent on something else it came presently with dancing lights a musical rattle of harness a cadence of hoofbeats that set her heart to beating in unisonand was gone a sudden sense of loneliness came over her and tears gathered in her sweet eyes  she arose and looked around her there was the little bed the dressingtable the roses that she had worn last night still fresh and blooming in the little vase every thing was there but every thing looked strange the roses should have been withered for the party seemed so long ago she could hardly remember when she had worn this dress that lay upon the chair so she came back to the window and sank down beside it with her cheek a trifle paler leaning on her hand and her long braids reaching to the floor the stars paled slowly like her cheek yet with eyes that saw not she still looked from her window for the coming dawn  it came with violet deepening into purple with purple flushing into rose with rose shining into silver and glowing into gold the straggling line of black picketfence below that had faded away with the stars came back with the sun what was that object moving by the fence jenny raised her head and looked intently it was a man endeavoring to climb the pickets and falling backward with each attempt suddenly she started to her feet as if the rosy flushes of the dawn had crimsoned her from forehead to shoulders then she stood white as the wall with her hands clasped upon her bosom then with a single bound she reached the door and with flying braids and fluttering skirt sprang down the stairs and out to the garden walk when within a few feet of the fence she uttered a cry the first she had giventhe cry of a mother over her stricken babe of a tigress over her mangled cub and in another moment she had leaped the fence and knelt beside ridgeway with his fainting head upon her breast  my boy my poor poor boy who has done this  who indeed his clothes were covered with dust his waistcoat was torn open and his handkerchief wet with the blood it could not stanch fell from a cruel stab beneath his shoulder  ridgeway my poor boy tell me what has happened  ridgeway slowly opened his heavy blueveined lids and gazed upon her presently a gleam of mischief came into his dark eyes a smile stole over his lips as he whispered slowly  itwasyour kissdid it jenny dear i had forgottenhow highpriced the article was here never mind jennyhe feebly raised her hand to his white lipsit wasworth it and fainted away  jenny started to her feet and looked wildly around her then with a sudden resolution she stooped over the insensible man and with one strong effort lifted him in her arms as if he had been a child when her father a moment later rubbed his eyes and awoke from his sleep upon the veranda it was to see a goddess erect and triumphant striding toward the house with the helpless body of a man lying across that breast where man had never lain beforea goddess at whose imperious mandate he arose and cast open the doors before her and then when she had laid her unconscious burden on the sofa the goddess fled and a woman helpless and trembling stood before hima woman that cried out that she had killed him that she was wicked wicked and that even saying so staggered and fell beside her late burden and all that mr mcclosky could do was to feebly rub his beard and say to himself vaguely and incoherently that jinny had fetched him   chapter ii   before noon the next day it was generally believed throughout four forks that ridgeway dent had been attacked and wounded at chemisal ridge by a highwayman who fled on the approach of the wingdam coach it is to be presumed that this statement met with ridgeways approval as he did not contradict it nor supplement it with any details his wound was severe but not dangerous after the first excitement had subsided there was i think a prevailing impression common to the provincial mind that his misfortune was the result of the defective moral quality of his being a stranger and was in a vague sort of a way a warning to others and a lesson to him did you hear how that san francisco feller was took down the other night was the average tone of introductory remark indeed there was a general suggestion that ridgeways presence was one that no selfrespecting highminded highwayman honorably conservative of the best interests of tuolumne county could for a moment tolerate  except for the few words spoken on that eventful morning ridgeway was reticent of the past when jenny strove to gather some details of the affray that might offer a clew to his unknown assailant a subtle twinkle in his brown eyes was the only response when mr mcclosky attempted the same process the young gentleman threw abusive epithets and eventually slippers teaspoons and other lighter articles within the reach of an invalid at the head of his questioner i think hes coming round jinny said mr mcclosky he laid for me this morning with a candlestick  it was about this time that miss jenny having sworn her father to secrecy regarding the manner in which ridgeway had been carried into the house conceived the idea of addressing the young man as mr dent and of apologizing for intruding whenever she entered the room in the discharge of her household duties it was about this time that she became more rigidly conscientious to those duties and less general in her attentions it was at this time that the quality of the invalids diet improved and that she consulted him less frequently about it it was about this time that she began to see more company that the house was greatly frequented by her former admirers with whom she rode walked and danced it was at about this time also and when ridgeway was able to be brought out on the veranda in a chair that with great archness of manner she introduced to him miss lucy ashe the sister of her betrothed a flashing brunette and terrible heartbreaker of four forks and in the midst of this gayety she concluded that she would spend a week with the robinsons to whom she owed a visit she enjoyed herself greatly there so much indeed that she became quite holloweyed the result as she explained to her father of a too frequent indulgence in festivity you see father i wont have many chances after john and i are married you know how queer he is and i must make the most of my time and she laughed an odd little laugh which had lately become habitual to her and how is mr dent getting on her father replied that he was getting on very well indeedso well in fact that he was able to leave for san francisco two days ago he wanted to be remembered to you jinnyremembered kindlyyes they is the very words he used said mr mcclosky looking down and consulting one of his large shoes for corroboration miss jenny was glad to hear that he was so much better miss jenny could not imagine any thing that pleased her more than to know that he was so strong as to be able to rejoin his friends again who must love him so much and be so anxious about him her father thought she would be pleased and now that he was gone there was really no necessity for her to hurry back miss jenny in a high metallic voice did not know that she had expressed any desire to stay still if her presence had become distasteful at home if her own father was desirous of getting rid of her if when she was so soon to leave his roof forever he still begrudged her those few days remaining ifmy god jinny so help me said mr mcclosky clutching despairingly at his beard i didnt go for to say any thing of the kind i thought that younever mind father interrupted jenny magnanimously you misunderstood me of course you did you couldnt help ityoure a man mr mcclosky sorely crushed would have vaguely protested but his daughter having relieved herself after the manner of her sex with a mental personal application of an abstract statement forgave him with a kiss  nevertheless for two or three days after her return mr mcclosky followed his daughter about the house with yearning eyes and occasionally with timid diffident feet sometimes he came upon her suddenly at her household tasks with an excuse so palpably false and a careless manner so outrageously studied that she was fain to be embarrassed for him later he took to rambling about the house at night and was often seen noiselessly passing and repassing through the hall after she had retired on one occasion he was surprised first by sleep and then by the earlyrising jenny as he lay on the rug outside her chamberdoor you treat me like a child father said jenny i thought jinny said the father apologeticallyi thought i heard sounds as if you was takin on inside and listenin i fell asleepyou dear old simpleminded baby said jenny looking past her fathers eyes and lifting his grizzled locks one by one with meditative fingers what should i be takin on for look how much taller i am than you she said suddenly lifting herself up to the extreme of her superb figure then rubbing his head rapidly with both hands as if she were anointing his hair with some rare unguent she patted him on the back and returned to her room the result of this and one or two other equally sympathetic interviews was to produce a change in mr mccloskys manner which was if possible still more discomposing he grew unjustifiably hilarious cracked jokes with the servants and repeated to jenny humorous stories with the attitude of facetiousness carefully preserved throughout the entire narration and the point utterly ignored and forgotten certain incidents reminded him of funny things which invariably turned out to have not the slightest relevancy or application he occasionally brought home with him practical humorists with a sanguine hope of setting them going like the musicbox for his daughters edification he essayed the singing of melodies with great freedom of style and singular limitation of note he sang come haste to the wedding ye lasses and maidens of which he knew a single line and that incorrectly as being peculiarly apt and appropriate yet away from the house and his daughters presence he was silent and distraught his absence of mind was particularly noted by his workmen at the empire quartz mill ef the old man dont look out and wake up said his foreman hell hev them feet of his yet under the stamps when he aint givin his mind to em they is altogether too promiskuss  a few nights later miss jenny recognized her fathers hand in a timid tap at the door she opened it and he stood before her with a valise in his hand equipped as for a journey i takes the stage tonight jinny dear from four forks to frisco maybe i may drop in on jack afore i go ill be back in a week goodby  goodby he still held her hand presently he drew her back into the room closing the door carefully and glancing around there was a look of profound cunning in his eye as he said slowly  bear up and keep dark jinny dear and trust to the old man various men has various ways thar is ways as is common and ways as is uncommon ways as is easy and ways as is oneasy bear up and keep dark with this delphic utterance he put his finger to his lips and vanished  it was ten oclock when he reached four forks a few minutes later he stood on the threshold of that dwelling described by the four forks sentinel as the palatial residence of john ashe and known to the local satirist as the ashbox hevin to lay by two hours john he said to his prospective soninlaw as he took his hand at the door a few words of social converse not on business but strictly private seems to be about as natral a thing as a man can do this introduction evidently the result of some study and plainly committed to memory seemed so satisfactory to mr mcclosky that he repeated it again after john ashe had led him into his private office where depositing his valise in the middle of the floor and sitting down before it he began carefully to avoid the eye of his host john ashe a tall dark handsome kentuckian with whom even the trifles of life were evidently full of serious import waited with a kind of chivalrous respect the further speech of his guest being utterly devoid of any sense of the ridiculous he always accepted mr mcclosky as a grave fact singular only from his own want of experience of the class  ores is running light now said mr mcclosky with easy indifference  john ashe returned that he had noticed the same fact in the receipts of the mill at four forks  mr mcclosky rubbed his beard and looked at his valise as if for sympathy and suggestion  you dont reckon on having any trouble with any of them chaps as you cut out with jinny  john ashe rather haughtily had never thought of that i saw rance hanging round your house the other night when i took your daughter home but he gave me a wide berth he added carelessly  surely said mr mcclosky with a peculiar winking of the eye after a pause he took a fresh departure from his valise  a few words john ez between man and man ez between my daughters father and her husband who expects to be is about the thing i take it as is fair and square i kem here to say them theyre about jinny my gal  ashes grave face brightened to mr mccloskys evident discomposure  maybe i should have said about her mother but the same bein a stranger to you i says naterally jinny  ashe nodded courteously mr mcclosky with his eyes on his valise went on  it is sixteen year ago as i married mrs mcclosky in the state of missouri she let on at the time to be a widdera widder with one child when i say let on i mean to imply that i subsekently found out that she was not a widder nor a wife and the father of the child was so to speak onbeknowst thet child was jinnymy gal  with his eyes on his valise and quietly ignoring the whollycrimsoned face and swiftlydarkening brow of his host he continued  many little things sorter tended to make our home in missouri onpleasant a disposition to smash furniture and heave knives around an inclination to howl when drunk and that frequent a habitooal use of vulgar language and a tendency to cuss the casooal visitorseemed to pint added mr mcclosky with submissive hesitation thatshewasso to speakquite onsuited to the marriage relation in its holiest aspeck  damnation why didntburst out john ashe erect and furious  at the end of two year continued mr mcclosky still intent on the valise i allowed id get a diworce et about thet time however providence sends a circus into thet town and a feller ez rode three horses to onct hevin allez a taste for athletic sports she left town with this feller leavin me and jinny behind i sent word to her thet if she would give jinny to me wed call it quits and she did  tell me gasped ashe did you ask your daughter to keep this from me or did she do it of her own accord  she doesnt know it said mr mcclosky she thinks im her father and that her mothers dead  then sir this is your  i dont know said mr mcclosky slowly ez ive asked any one to marry my jinny i dont know ez ive persood that ez a biziness or even taken it up as a healthful recreation  john ashe paced the room furiously mr mccloskys eyes left the valise and followed him curiously where is this woman demanded ashe suddenly mccloskys eyes sought the valise again  she went to kansas from kansas she went into texas from texas she eventooally came to californy being here ive purvided her with money when her business was slack through a friend  john ashe groaned shes gettin rather old and shaky for hosses and now does the tightrope business and flying trapeze never hevin seen her perform continued mr mcclosky with conscientious caution i cant say how she gets on on the bills she looks well thar is a poster said mr mcclosky glancing at ashe and opening his valisethar is a poster givin her performance at marysville next month mr mcclosky slowly unfolded a large yellowandblue printed poster profusely illustrated she calls herself mamselle j miglawski the great russian trapeziste  john ashe tore it from his hand of course he said suddenly facing mr mcclosky you dont expect me to go on with this  mr mcclosky took up the poster carefully refolded it and returned it to his valise when you break off with jinny he said quietly i dont want any thing said bout this she doesnt know it shes a woman and i reckon youre a white man  but what am i to say how am i to go back of my word  write her a note say something hez come to your knowledge dont say what that makes you break it off you neednt be afeard jinnyll ever ask you what  john ashe hesitated he felt he had been cruelly wronged no gentleman no ashe could go on further in this affair it was preposterous to think of it but somehow he felt at the moment very unlike a gentleman or an ashe and was quite sure he should break down under jennys steady eyes but thenhe could write to her  so ores is about as light here as on the ridge well i reckon theyll come up before the rains goodnight mr mcclosky took the hand that his host mechanically extended shook it gravely and was gone   when mr mcclosky a week later stepped again upon his own veranda he saw through the french window the figure of a man in his parlor under his hospitable roof the sight was not unusual but for an instant a subtle sense of disappointment thrilled him when he saw it was not the face of ashe turned toward him he was relieved but when he saw the tawny beard and quick passionate eyes of henry rance he felt a new sense of apprehension so that he fell to rubbing his beard almost upon his very threshold  jenny ran into the hall and seized her father with a little cry of joy father said jenny in a hurried whisper dont mind him indicating rance with a toss of her yellow braids hes going soon and i think father ive done him wrong but its all over with john and me now read that note and see how hes insulted me her lip quivered but she went on its ridgeway that he means father and i believe it was his hand struck ridgeway down or that he knows who did but hush now not a word  she gave him a feverish kiss and glided back into the parlor leaving mr mcclosky perplexed and irresolute with the note in his hand he glanced at it hurriedly and saw that it was couched in almost the very words he had suggested but a sudden apprehensive recollection came over him he listened and with an exclamation of dismay he seized his hat and ran out of the house but too late at the same moment a quick nervous footstep was heard upon the veranda the french window flew open and with a light laugh of greeting ridgeway stepped into the room  jennys finer ear first caught the step jennys swifter feelings had sounded the depths of hope of joy of despair before he entered the room jennys pale face was the only one that met his selfpossessed and selfreliant when he stood before them an angry flush suffused even the pink roots of rances beard as he rose to his feet an ominous fire sprang into ridgeways eyes and a spasm of hate and scorn passed over the lower part of his face and left the mouth and jaw immobile and rigid  yet he was the first to speak i owe you an apology he said to jenny with a suave scorn that brought the indignant blood back to her cheek for this intrusion but i ask no pardon for withdrawing from the only spot where that man dare confront me with safety  with an exclamation of rage rance sprang toward him but as quickly jenny stood between them erect and menacing there must be no quarrel here she said to rance while i protect your right as my guest dont oblige me to remind you of mine as your hostess she turned with a halfdeprecatory air to ridgeway but he was gone so was her father only rance remained with a look of illconcealed triumph on his face  without looking at him she passed toward the door when she reached it she turned you asked me a question an hour ago come to me in the garden at nine oclock tonight and i will answer you but promise me first to keep away from mr dent give me your word not to seek himto avoid him if he seeks you do you promise it is well  he would have taken her hand but she waved him away in another moment he heard the swift rustle of her dress in the hall the sound of her feet upon the stair the sharp closing of her bedroom door and all was quiet  and even thus quietly the day wore away and the night rose slowly from the valley and overshadowed the mountains with purple wings that fanned the still air into a breeze until the moon followed it and lulled every thing to rest as with the layingon of white and benedictory hands it was a lovely night but henry rance waiting impatiently beneath a sycamore at the foot of the garden saw no beauty in earth or air or sky a thousand suspicions common to a jealous nature a vague superstition of the spot filled his mind with distrust and doubt if this should be a trick to keep my hands off that insolent pup he muttered but even as the thought passed his tongue a white figure slid from the shrubbery near the house glided along the line of picketfence and then stopped midway motionless in the moonlight  it was she but he scarcely recognized her in the white drapery that covered her head and shoulders and breast he approached her with a hurried whisper let us withdraw from the moonlight everybody can see us here  we have nothing to say that cannot be said in the moonlight henry rance she replied coldly receding from his proffered hand she trembled for a moment as if with a chill and then suddenly turned upon him hold up your head and let me look at you ive known only what men are let me see what a traitor looks like  he recoiled more from her wild face than her words he saw from the first that her hollow cheeks and hollow eyes were blazing with fever he was no coward but he would have fled  you are ill jenny he said you had best return to the house another time  stop she cried hoarsely move from this spot and ill call for help attempt to leave me now and ill proclaim you the assassin that you are  it was a fair fight he said doggedly  was it a fair fight to creep behind an unarmed and unsuspecting man was it a fair fight to try to throw suspicion on some one else was it a fair fight to deceive me liar and coward that you are  he made a stealthy step toward her with evil eyes and a wickeder hand that crept within his breast she saw the motion but it only stung her to newer fury  strike she said with blazing eyes throwing her hands open before him strike are you afraid of the woman who dares you or do you keep your knife for the backs of unsuspecting men strike i tell you no look then with a sudden movement she tore from her head and shoulders the thick lace shawl that had concealed her figure and stood before him look she cried passionately pointing to the bosom and shoulders of her white dress darkly streaked with faded stains and ominous discolorationlook this is the dress i wore that morning when i found him lying hereherebleeding from your cowardly knife look do you see this is his bloodmy darling boys bloodone drop of which dead and faded as it is is more precious to me than the whole living pulse of any other man look i come to you tonight christened with his blood and dare you to strikedare you to strike him again through me and mingle my blood with his strike i implore you strike if you have any pity on me for gods sake strike if you are a man look here lay his head on my shoulder here i held him to my breast where neverso help me my godanother manah  she reeled against the fence and something that had flashed in rances hand dropped at her feet for another flash and report rolled him over in the dust and across his writhing body two men strode and caught her ere she fell  she has only fainted said mr mcclosky jinny dear my girl speak to me  what is this on her dress said ridgeway kneeling beside her and lifting his set and colorless face at the sound of his voice the color came faintly back to her cheek she opened her eyes and smiled  its only your blood dear boy she said but look a little deeper and youll find my own  she put up her two yearning hands and drew his face and lips down to her own when ridgeway raised his head again her eyes were closed but her mouth still smiled as with the memory of a kiss  they bore her to the house still breathing but unconscious that night the road was filled with clattering horsemen and the summoned skill of the countryside for leagues away gathered at her couch the wound they said was not essentially dangerous but they had grave fears of the shock to a system that already seemed suffering from some strange and unaccountable nervous exhaustion the best medical skill of tuolumne happened to be young and observing and waited patiently an opportunity to account for it he was presently rewarded  for toward morning she rallied and looked feebly around then she beckoned her father toward her and whispered where is he  they took him away jinny dear in a cart he wont trouble you agin he stopped for miss jenny had raised herself on her elbow and was levelling her black brows at him but two kicks from the young surgeon and a significant motion towards the door sent mr mcclosky away muttering how should i know that he meant ridgeway he said apologetically as he went and returned with the young gentleman the surgeon who was still holding her pulse smiled and thought thatwith a little careand attentionthe stimulantsmight bediminishedandhemight leavethe patient for some hours with perfect safety he would give further directions to mr mccloskydown stairs  it was with great archness of manner that half an hour later mr mcclosky entered the room with a preparatory cough and it was with some disappointment that he found ridgeway standing quietly by the window and his daughter apparently fallen into a light doze he was still more concerned when after ridgeway had retired noticing a pleasant smile playing about her lips he said softly  you was thinking of some one jinny  yes father the gray eyes met his steadilyof poor john ashe  her recovery was swift nature that had seemed to stand jealously aloof from her in her mental anguish was kind to the physical hurt of her favorite child the superb physique which had been her charm and her trial now stood her in good stead the healing balsam of the pine the balm of resinous gums and the rare medicaments of sierran altitudes touched her as it might have touched the wounded doe so that in two weeks she was able to walk about and when at the end of the month ridgeway returned from a flying visit to san francisco and jumped from the wingdam coach at four oclock in the morning the rose of tuolumne with the dewy petals of either cheek fresh as when first unfolded to his kiss confronted him on the road  with a common instinct their young feet both climbed the little hill now sacred to their thought when they reached its summit they were both i think a little disappointed there is a fragrance in the unfolding of a passion that escapes the perfect flower jenny thought the night was not as beautiful ridgeway that the long ride had blunted his perceptions but they had the frankness to confess it to each other with the rare delight of such a confession and the comparison of details which they thought each had forgotten and with this and an occasional pitying reference to the blank period when they had not known each other hand in hand they reached the house  mr mcclosky was awaiting them impatiently upon the veranda when miss jenny had slipped up stairs to replace a collar that stood somewhat suspiciously awry mr mcclosky drew ridgeway solemnly aside he held a large theatre poster in one hand and an open newspaper in the other  i allus said he remarked slowly with the air of merely renewing a suspended conversationi allus said that riding three horses to onct wasnt exactly in her line it would seem that it aint from remarks in this yer paper it would appear that she tried it on at marysville last week and broke her neck     a passage in the life of mr john oakhurst   he always thought it must have been fate certainly nothing could have been more inconsistent with his habits than to have been in the plaza at seven oclock of that midsummer morning the sight of his colorless face in sacramento was rare at that season and indeed at any season anywhere publicly before two oclock in the afternoon looking back upon it in afteryears in the light of a chanceful life he determined with the characteristic philosophy of his profession that it must have been fate  yet it is my duty as a strict chronicler of facts to state that mr oakhursts presence there that morning was due to a very simple cause at exactly halfpast six the bank being then a winner to the amount of twenty thousand dollars he had risen from the farotable relinquished his seat to an accomplished assistant and withdrawn quietly without attracting a glance from the silent anxious faces bowed over the table but when he entered his luxurious sleepingroom across the passageway he was a little shocked at finding the sun streaming through an inadvertently opened window something in the rare beauty of the morning perhaps something in the novelty of the idea struck him as he was about to close the blinds and he hesitated then taking his hat from the table he stepped down a private staircase into the street  the people who were abroad at that early hour were of a class quite unknown to mr oakhurst there were milkmen and hucksters delivering their wares small tradespeople opening their shops housemaids sweeping doorsteps and occasionally a child these mr oakhurst regarded with a certain cold curiosity perhaps quite free from the cynical disfavor with which he generally looked upon the more pretentious of his race whom he was in the habit of meeting indeed i think he was not altogether displeased with the admiring glances which these humble women threw after his handsome face and figure conspicuous even in a country of finelooking men while it is very probable that this wicked vagabond in the pride of his social isolation would have been coldly indifferent to the advances of a fine lady a little girl who ran admiringly by his side in a ragged dress had the power to call a faint flush into his colorless cheek he dismissed her at last but not until she had found outwhat sooner or later her largehearted and discriminating sex inevitably didthat he was exceedingly free and openhanded with his money and alsowhat perhaps none other of her sex ever didthat the bold black eyes of this fine gentleman were in reality of a brownish and even tender gray  there was a small garden before a white cottage in a sidestreet that attracted mr oakhursts attention it was filled with roses heliotrope and verbenaflowers familiar enough to him in the expensive and more portable form of bouquets but as it seemed to him then never before so notably lovely perhaps it was because the dew was yet fresh upon them perhaps it was because they were unplucked but mr oakhurst admired themnot as a possible future tribute to the fascinating and accomplished miss ethelinda then performing at the varieties for mr oakhursts especial benefit as she had often assured him nor yet as a douceur to the inthralling miss montmorrissy with whom mr oakhurst expected to sup that evening but simply for himself and mayhap for the flowers sake howbeit he passed on and so out into the open plaza where finding a bench under a cottonwoodtree he first dusted the seat with his handkerchief and then sat down  it was a fine morning the air was so still and calm that a sigh from the sycamores seemed like the deepdrawn breath of the just awakening tree and the faint rustle of its boughs as the outstretching of cramped and reviving limbs far away the sierras stood out against a sky so remote as to be of no positive colorso remote that even the sun despaired of ever reaching it and so expended its strength recklessly on the whole landscape until it fairly glittered in a white and vivid contrast with a very rare impulse mr oakhurst took off his hat and half reclined on the bench with his face to the sky certain birds who had taken a critical attitude on a spray above him apparently began an animated discussion regarding his possible malevolent intentions one or two emboldened by the silence hopped on the ground at his feet until the sound of wheels on the gravelwalk frightened them away  looking up he saw a man coming slowly toward him wheeling a nondescript vehicle in which a woman was partly sitting partly reclining without knowing why mr oakhurst instantly conceived that the carriage was the invention and workmanship of the man partly from its oddity partly from the strong mechanical hand that grasped it and partly from a certain pride and visible consciousness in the manner in which the man handled it then mr oakhurst saw something more the mans face was familiar with that regal faculty of not forgetting a face that had ever given him professional audience he instantly classified it under the following mental formula at frisco polka saloon lost his weeks wages i reckonseventy dollarson red never came again there was however no trace of this in the calm eyes and unmoved face that he turned upon the stranger who on the contrary blushed looked embarrassed hesitated and then stopped with an involuntary motion that brought the carriage and its fair occupant face to face with mr oakhurst  i should hardly do justice to the position she will occupy in this veracious chronicle by describing the lady now if indeed i am able to do it at all certainly the popular estimate was conflicting the late col starbottleto whose large experience of a charming sex i have before been indebted for many valuable suggestionshad i regret to say depreciated her fascinations a yellowfaced cripple by dash a sick woman with mahogany eyes one of your blanked spiritual creatureswith no flesh on her bones on the other hand however she enjoyed later much complimentary disparagement from her own sex miss celestina howard second leader in the ballet at the varieties had with great alliterative directness in afteryears denominated her as an aquiline asp mlle brimborion remembered that she had always warned mr jack that this woman would empoison him but mr oakhurst whose impressions are perhaps the most important only saw a pale thin deepeyed woman raised above the level of her companion by the refinement of long suffering and isolation and a certain shy virginity of manner there was a suggestion of physical purity in the folds of her freshlooking robe and a certain picturesque tastefulness in the details that without knowing why made him think that the robe was her invention and handiwork even as the carriage she occupied was evidently the work of her companion her own hand a trifle too thin but wellshaped subtlefingered and gentlewomanly rested on the side of the carriage the counterpart of the strong mechanical grasp of her companions  there was some obstruction to the progress of the vehicle and mr oakhurst stepped forward to assist while the wheel was being lifted over the curbstone it was necessary that she should hold his arm and for a moment her thin hand rested there light and cold as a snowflake and then as it seemed to him like a snowflake melted away then there was a pause and then conversation the lady joining occasionally and shyly  it appeared that they were man and wife that for the past two years she had been a great invalid and had lost the use of her lower limbs from rheumatism that until lately she had been confined to her bed until her husbandwho was a mastercarpenterhad bethought himself to make her this carriage he took her out regularly for an airing before going to work because it was his only time andthey attracted less attention they had tried many doctors but without avail they had been advised to go to the sulphur springs but it was expensive mr decker the husband had once saved eighty dollars for that purpose but while in san francisco had his pocket pickedmr decker was so senseless the intelligent reader need not be told that it is the lady who is speaking they had never been able to make up the sum again and they had given up the idea it was a dreadful thing to have ones pocket picked did he not think so  her husbands face was crimson but mr oakhursts countenance was quite calm and unmoved as he gravely agreed with her and walked by her side until they passed the little garden that he had admired here mr oakhurst commanded a halt and going to the door astounded the proprietor by a preposterously extravagant offer for a choice of the flowers presently he returned to the carriage with his arms full of roses heliotrope and verbena and cast them in the lap of the invalid while she was bending over them with childish delight mr oakhurst took the opportunity of drawing her husband aside  perhaps he said in a low voice and a manner quite free from any personal annoyanceperhaps its just as well that you lied to her as you did you can say now that the pickpocket was arrested the other day and you got your money back mr oakhurst quietly slipped four twentydollar goldpieces into the broad hand of the bewildered mr decker say thator any thing you likebut the truth promise me you wont say that  the man promised mr oakhurst quietly returned to the front of the little carriage the sick woman was still eagerly occupied with the flowers and as she raised her eyes to his her faded cheek seemed to have caught some color from the roses and her eyes some of their dewy freshness but at that instant mr oakhurst lifted his hat and before she could thank him was gone  i grieve to say that mr decker shamelessly broke his promise that night in the very goodness of his heart and uxorious selfabnegation he like all devoted husbands not only offered himself but his friend and benefactor as a sacrifice on the familyaltar it is only fair however to add that he spoke with great fervor of the generosity of mr oakhurst and dwelt with an enthusiasm quite common with his class on the mysterious fame and prodigal vices of the gambler  and now elsie dear say that youll forgive me said mr decker dropping on one knee beside his wifes couch i did it for the best it was for you dearey that i put that money on them cards that night in frisco i thought to win a heapenough to take you away and enough left to get you a new dress  mrs decker smiled and pressed her husbands hand i do forgive you joe dear she said still smiling with eyes abstractedly fixed on the ceiling and you ought to be whipped for deceiving me so you bad boy and making me make such a speech there say no more about it if youll be very good hereafter and will just now hand me that cluster of roses ill forgive you she took the branch in her angers lifted the roses to her face and presently said behind their leaves  joe  what is it lovey  do you think that this mrwhat do you call himjack oakhurst would have given that money back to you if i hadnt made that speech  yes  if he hadnt seen me at all  mr decker looked up his wife had managed in some way to cover up her whole face with the roses except her eyes which were dangerously bright  no it was you elsieit was all along of seeing you that made him do it  a poor sick woman like me  a sweet little lovely pooty elsiejoes own little wifey how could he help it  mrs decker fondly cast one arm around her husbands neck still keeping the roses to her face with the other from behind them she began to murmur gently and idiotically dear ole square joey elsies oney booful big bear but really i do not see that my duty as a chronicler of facts compels me to continue this little ladys speech any further and out of respect to the unmarried reader i stop  nevertheless the next morning mrs decker betrayed some slight and apparently uncalled for irritability on reaching the plaza and presently desired her husband to wheel her back home moreover she was very much astonished at meeting mr oakhurst just as they were returning and even doubted if it were he and questioned her husband as to his identity with the stranger of yesterday as he approached her manner to mr oakhurst also was quite in contrast with her husbands frank welcome mr oakhurst instantly detected it her husband has told her all and she dislikes me he said to himself with that fatal appreciation of the halftruths of a womans motives that causes the wisest masculine critic to stumble he lingered only long enough to take the business address of the husband and then lifting his hat gravely without looking at the lady went his way it struck the honest mastercarpenter as one of the charming anomalies of his wifes character that although the meeting was evidently very much constrained and unpleasant instantly afterward his wifes spirits began to rise you was hard on him a leetle hard wasnt you elsie said mr decker deprecatingly im afraid he may think ive broke my promiseah indeed said the lady indifferently mr decker instantly stepped round to the front of the vehicle you look like an a 1 firstclass lady riding down broadway in her own carriage elsie said he i never seed you lookin so peart and sassy before  a few days later the proprietor of the san isabel sulphur springs received the following note in mr oakhursts wellknown dainty hand   dear steveive been thinking over your proposition to buy nicholss quarterinterest and have concluded to go in but i dont see how the thing will pay until you have more accommodation down there and for the best classi mean my customers what we want is an extension to the main building and two or three cottages put up i send down a builder to take hold of the job at once he takes his sick wife with him and you are to look after them as you would for one of us  i may run down there myself after the races just to look after things but i shant set up any game this season  yours always  john oakhurst   it was only the last sentence of this letter that provoked criticism i can understand said mr hamlin a professional brother to whom mr oakhursts letter was showni can understand why jack goes in heavy and builds for its a sure spec and is bound to be a mighty soft thing in time if he comes here regularly but why in blank he dont set up a bank this season and take the chance of getting some of the money back that he puts into circulation in building is what gets me i wonder now he mused deeply what is his little game  the season had been a prosperous one to mr oakhurst and proportionally disastrous to several members of the legislature judges colonels and others who had enjoyed but briefly the pleasure of mr oakhursts midnight society and yet sacramento had become very dull to him he had lately formed a habit of early morning walks so unusual and startling to his friends both male and female as to occasion the intensest curiosity two or three of the latter set spies upon his track but the inquisition resulted only in the discovery that mr oakhurst walked to the plaza sat down upon one particular bench for a few moments and then returned without seeing anybody and the theory that there was a woman in the case was abandoned a few superstitious gentlemen of his own profession believed that he did it for luck some others more practical declared that he went out to study points  after the races at marysville mr oakhurst went to san francisco from that place he returned to marysville but a few days after was seen at san jose santa cruz and oakland those who met him declared that his manner was restless and feverish and quite unlike his ordinary calmness and phlegm col starbottle pointed out the fact that at san francisco at the club jack had declined to deal hand shaky sir depend upon it dont stimulate enoughblank him  from san jose he started to go to oregon by land with a rather expensive outfit of horses and camp equipage but on reaching stockton he suddenly diverged and four hours later found him with a single horse entering the canyon of the san isabel warm sulphur springs  it was a pretty triangular valley lying at the foot of three sloping mountains dark with pines and fantastic with madrono and manzanita nestling against the mountainside the straggling buildings and long piazza of the hotel glittered through the leaves and here and there shone a white toylike cottage mr oakhurst was not an admirer of nature but he felt something of the same novel satisfaction in the view that he experienced in his first morning walk in sacramento and now carriages began to pass him on the road filled with gaylydressed women and the cold california outlines of the landscape began to take upon themselves somewhat of a human warmth and color and then the long hotel piazza came in view efflorescent with the fulltoiletted fair mr oakhurst a good rider after the california fashion did not check his speed as he approached his destination but charged the hotel at a gallop threw his horse on his haunches within a foot of the piazza and then quietly emerged from the cloud of dust that veiled his dismounting  whatever feverish excitement might have raged within all his habitual calm returned as he stepped upon the piazza with the instinct of long habit he turned and faced the battery of eyes with the same cold indifference with which he had for years encountered the halfhidden sneers of men and the halffrightened admiration of women only one person stepped forward to welcome him oddly enough it was dick hamilton perhaps the only one present who by birth education and position might have satisfied the most fastidious social critic happily for mr oakhursts reputation he was also a very rich banker and social leader do you know who that is you spoke to asked young parker with an alarmed expression yes replied hamilton with characteristic effrontery the man you lost a thousand dollars to last week i only know him socially but isnt he a gambler queried the youngest miss smith he is replied hamilton but i wish my dear young lady that we all played as open and honest a game as our friend yonder and were as willing as he is to abide by its fortunes  but mr oakhurst was happily out of hearing of this colloquy and was even then lounging listlessly yet watchfully along the upper hall suddenly he heard a light footstep behind him and then his name called in a familiar voice that drew the blood quickly to his heart he turned and she stood before him  but how transformed if i have hesitated to describe the holloweyed cripple the quaintlydressed artisans wife a few pages ago what shall i do with this graceful shapely elegantlyattired gentlewoman into whom she has been merged within these two months in good faith she was very pretty you and i my dear madam would have been quick to see that those charming dimples were misplaced for true beauty and too fixed in their quality for honest mirthfulness that the delicate lines around these aquiline nostrils were cruel and selfish that the sweet virginal surprise of these lovely eyes were as apt to be opened on her plate as upon the gallant speeches of her dinner partner that her sympathetic color came and went more with her own spirits than yours but you and i are not in love with her dear madam and mr oakhurst is and even in the folds of her parisian gown i am afraid this poor fellow saw the same subtle strokes of purity that he had seen in her homespun robe and then there was the delightful revelation that she could walk and that she had dear little feet of her own in the tiniest slippers of her french shoemaker with such preposterous blue bows and chappells own stamprue de something or other parison the narrow sole  he ran toward her with a heightened color and outstretched hands but she whipped her own behind her glanced rapidly up and down the long hall and stood looking at him with a halfaudacious halfmischievous admiration in utter contrast to her old reserve  ive a great mind not to shake hands with you at all you passed me just now on the piazza without speaking and i ran after you as i suppose many another poor woman has done  mr oakhurst stammered that she was so changed  the more reason why you should know me who changed me you you have recreated me you found a helpless crippled sick povertystricken woman with one dress to her back and that her own make and you gave her life health strength and fortune you did and you know it sir how do you like your work she caught the sideseams of her gown in either hand and dropped him a playful courtesy then with a sudden relenting gesture she gave him both her hands  outrageous as this speech was and unfeminine as i trust every fair reader will deem it i fear it pleased mr oakhurst not but that he was accustomed to a certain frank female admiration but then it was of the coulisse and not of the cloister with which he always persisted in associating mrs decker to be addressed in this way by an invalid puritan a sick saint with the austerity of suffering still clothing her a woman who had a bible on the dressingtable who went to church three times a day and was devoted to her husband completely bowled him over he still held her hands as she went on  why didnt you come before what were you doing in marysville in san jose in oakland you see i have followed you i saw you as you came down the canyon and knew you at once i saw your letter to joseph and knew you were coming why didnt you write to me you will some timegoodevening mr hamilton  she had withdrawn her hands but not until hamilton ascending the staircase was nearly abreast of them he raised his hat to her with wellbred composure nodded familiarly to oakhurst and passed on when he had gone mrs decker lifted her eyes to mr oakhurst some day i shall ask a great favor of you  mr oakhurst begged that it should be now  no not until you know me better then some day i shall want you tokill that man  she laughed such a pleasant little ringing laugh such a display of dimplesalbeit a little fixed in the corners of her mouthsuch an innocent light in her brown eyes and such a lovely color in her cheeks that mr oakhurst who seldom laughed was fain to laugh too it was as if a lamb had proposed to a fox a foray into a neighboring sheepfold  a few evenings after this mrs decker arose from a charmed circle of her admirers on the hotel piazza excused herself for a few moments laughingly declined an escort and ran over to her little cottageone of her husbands creationacross the road perhaps from the sudden and unwonted exercise in her still convalescent state she breathed hurriedly and feverishly as she entered her boudoir and once or twice placed her hand upon her breast she was startled on turning up the light to find her husband lying on the sofa  you look hot and excited elsie love said mr decker you aint took worse are you  mrs deckers face had paled but now flushed again no she said only a little pain here as she again placed her hand upon her corsage  can i do any thing for you said mr decker rising with affectionate concern  run over to the hotel and get me some brandy quick  mr decker ran mrs decker closed and bolted the door and then putting her hand to her bosom drew out the pain it was folded foursquare and was i grieve to say in mr oakhursts handwriting  she devoured it with burning eyes and cheeks until there came a step upon the porch then she hurriedly replaced it in her bosom and unbolted the door her husband entered she raised the spirits to her lips and declared herself better  are you going over there again tonight asked mr decker submissively  no said mrs decker with her eyes fixed dreamily on the floor  i wouldnt if i was you said mr decker with a sigh of relief after a pause he took a seat on the sofa and drawing his wife to his side said do you know what i was thinking of when you came in elsie mrs decker ran her fingers through his stiff black hair and couldnt imagine  i was thinking of old times elsie i was thinking of the days when i built that kerridge for you elsiewhen i used to take you out to ride and was both hoss and driver we was poor then and you was sick elsie but we was happy weve got money now and a house and youre quite another woman i may say dear that youre a new woman and thats where the trouble comes in i could build you a kerridge elsie i could build you a house elsiebut there i stopped i couldnt build up you youre strong and pretty elsie and fresh and new but somehow elsie you aint no work of mine  he paused with one hand laid gently on his forehead and the other pressed upon her bosom as if to feel certain of the presence of her pain she said sweetly and soothingly  but it was your work dear  mr decker shook his head sorrowfully no elsie not mine i had the chance to do it once and i let it go its done nowbut not by me  mrs decker raised her surprised innocent eyes to his he kissed her tenderly and then went on in a more cheerful voice  that aint all i was thinking of elsie i was thinking that maybe you give too much of your company to that mr hamilton not that theres any wrong in it to you or him but it might make people talk youre the only one here elsie said the mastercarpenter looking fondly at his wife who isnt talked about whose work aint inspected or condemned  mrs decker was glad he had spoken about it she had thought so too but she could not well be uncivil to mr hamilton who was a fine gentleman without making a powerful enemy and hes always treated me as if i was a born lady in his own circle added the little woman with a certain pride that made her husband fondly smile but i have thought of a plan he will not stay here if i should go away if for instance i went to san francisco to visit ma for a few days he would be gone before i should return  mr decker was delighted by all means he said go tomorrow jack oakhurst is going down and ill put you in his charge  mrs decker did not think it was prudent mr oakhurst is our friend joseph but you know his reputation in fact she did not know that she ought to go now knowing that he was going the same day but with a kiss mr decker overcame her scruples she yielded gracefully few women in fact knew how to give up a point as charmingly as she  she staid a week in san francisco when she returned she was a trifle thinner and paler than she had been this she explained as the result of perhaps too active exercise and excitement i was out of doors nearly all the time as ma will tell you she said to her husband and always alone i am getting quite independent now she added gayly i dont want any escort i believe joey dear i could get along even without you im so brave  but her visit apparently had not been productive of her impelling design mr hamilton had not gone but had remained and called upon them that very evening ive thought of a plan joey dear said mrs decker when he had departed poor mr oakhurst has a miserable room at the hotel suppose you ask him when he returns from san francisco to stop with us he can have our spareroom i dont think she added archly that mr hamilton will call often her husband laughed intimated that she was a little coquette pinched her cheek and complied the queer thing about a woman he said afterward confidentially to mr oakhurst is that without having any plan of her own shell take anybodys and build a house on it entirely different to suit herself and dern my skin if youll be able to say whether or not you didnt give the scale and measurements yourself thats what gets me  the next week mr oakhurst was installed in the deckers cottage the business relations of her husband and himself were known to all and her own reputation was above suspicion indeed few women were more popular she was domestic she was prudent she was pious in a country of great feminine freedom and latitude she never rode or walked with anybody but her husband in an epoch of slang and ambiguous expression she was always precise and formal in her speech in the midst of a fashion of ostentatious decoration she never wore a diamond nor a single valuable jewel she never permitted an indecorum in public she never countenanced the familiarities of california society she declaimed against the prevailing tone of infidelity and scepticism in religion few people who were present will ever forget the dignified yet stately manner with which she rebuked mr hamilton in the public parlor for entering upon the discussion of a work on materialism lately published and some among them also will not forget the expression of amused surprise on mr hamiltons face that gradually changed to sardonic gravity as he courteously waived his point certainly not mr oakhurst who from that moment began to be uneasily impatient of his friend and evenif such a term could be applied to any moral quality in mr oakhurstto fear him  for during this time mr oakhurst had begun to show symptoms of a change in his usual habits he was seldom if ever seen in his old haunts in a barroom or with his old associates pink and white notes in distracted handwriting accumulated on the dressingtable in his rooms at sacramento it was given out in san francisco that he had some organic disease of the heart for which his physician had prescribed perfect rest he read more he took long walks he sold his fast horses he went to church  i have a very vivid recollection of his first appearance there he did not accompany the deckers nor did he go into their pew but came in as the service commenced and took a seat quietly in one of the backpews by some mysterious instinct his presence became presently known to the congregation some of whom so far forgot themselves in their curiosity as to face around and apparently address their responses to him before the service was over it was pretty well understood that miserable sinners meant mr oakhurst nor did this mysterious influence fail to affect the officiating clergyman who introduced an allusion to mr oakhursts calling and habits in a sermon on the architecture of solomons temple and in a manner so pointed and yet labored as to cause the youngest of us to flame with indignation happily however it was lost upon jack i do not think he even heard it his handsome colorless face albeit a trifle worn and thoughtful was inscrutable only once during the singing of a hymn at a certain note in the contraltos voice there crept into his dark eyes a look of wistful tenderness so yearning and yet so hopeless that those who were watching him felt their own glisten yet i retain a very vivid remembrance of his standing up to receive the benediction with the suggestion in his manner and tightlybuttoned coat of taking the fire of his adversary at ten paces after church he disappeared as quietly as he had entered and fortunately escaped hearing the comments on his rash act his appearance was generally considered as an impertinence attributable only to some wanton fancy or possibly a bet one or two thought that the sexton was exceedingly remiss in not turning him out after discovering who he was and a prominent pewholder remarked that if he couldnt take his wife and daughters to that church without exposing them to such an influence he would try to find some church where he could another traced mr oakhursts presence to certain broad church radical tendencies which he regretted to say he had lately noted in their pastor deacon sawyer whose delicatelyorganized sickly wife had already borne him eleven children and died in an ambitious attempt to complete the dozen avowed that the presence of a person of mr oakhursts various and indiscriminate gallantries was an insult to the memory of the deceased that as a man he could not brook  it was about this time that mr oakhurst contrasting himself with a conventional world in which he had hitherto rarely mingled became aware that there was something in his face figure and carriage quite unlike other mensomething that if it did not betray his former career at least showed an individuality and originality that was suspicious in this belief he shaved off his long silken mustache and religiously brushed out his clustering curls every morning he even went so far as to affect a negligence of dress and hid his small slim arched feet in the largest and heaviest walkingshoes there is a story told that he went to his tailor in sacramento and asked him to make him a suit of clothes like everybody else the tailor familiar with mr oakhursts fastidiousness did not know what he meant i mean said mr oakhurst savagely something respectablesomething that doesnt exactly fit me you know but however mr oakhurst might hide his shapely limbs in homespun and homemade garments there was something in his carriage something in the pose of his beautiful head something in the strong and fine manliness of his presence something in the perfect and utter discipline and control of his muscles something in the high repose of his naturea repose not so much a matter of intellectual ruling as of his very naturethat go where he would and with whom he was always a notable man in ten thousand perhaps this was never so clearly intimated to mr oakhurst as when emboldened by mr hamiltons advice and assistance and his own predilections he became a san francisco broker even before objection was made to his presence in the boardthe objection i remember was urged very eloquently by watt sanders who was supposed to be the inventor of the freezingout system of disposing of poor stockholders and who also enjoyed the reputation of having been the impelling cause of briggs of tuolumnes ruin and suicideeven before this formal protest of respectability against lawlessness the aquiline suggestions of mr oakhursts mien and countenance not only prematurely fluttered the pigeons but absolutely occasioned much uneasiness among the fishhawks who circled below him with their booty dash me but hes as likely to go after us as anybody said joe fielding   it wanted but a few days before the close of the brief summer season at san isabel warm springs already there had been some migration of the more fashionable and there was an uncomfortable suggestion of dregs and lees in the social life that remained mr oakhurst was moody it was hinted that even the secure reputation of mrs decker could no longer protect her from the gossip which his presence excited it is but fair to her to say that during the last few weeks of this trying ordeal she looked like a sweet pale martyr and conducted herself toward her traducers with the gentle forgiving manner of one who relied not upon the idle homage of the crowd but upon the security of a principle that was dearer than popular favor they talk about myself and mr oakhurst my dear she said to a friend but heaven and my husband can best answer their calumny it never shall be said that my husband ever turned his back upon a friend in the moment of his adversity because the position was changedbecause his friend was poor and he was rich this was the first intimation to the public that jack had lost money although it was known generally that the deckers had lately bought some valuable property in san francisco  a few evenings after this an incident occurred which seemed to unpleasantly discord with the general social harmony that had always existed at san isabel it was at dinner and mr oakhurst and mr hamilton who sat together at a separate table were observed to rise in some agitation when they reached the hall by a common instinct they stepped into a little breakfastroom which was vacant and closed the door then mr hamilton turned with a halfamused halfserious smile toward his friend and said  if we are to quarrel jack oakhurstyou and iin the name of all that is ridiculous dont let it be about a  i do not know what was the epithet intended it was either unspoken or lost for at that very instant mr oakhurst raised a wineglass and dashed its contents into hamiltons face  as they faced each other the men seemed to have changed natures mr oakhurst was trembling with excitement and the wineglass that he returned to the table shivered between his fingers mr hamilton stood there grayish white erect and dripping after a pause he said coldly  so be it but remember our quarrel commences here if i fall by your hand you shall not use it to clear her character if you fall by mine you shall not be called a martyr i am sorry it has come to this but amen the sooner now the better  he turned proudly dropped his lids over cold steelblue eyes as if sheathing a rapier bowed and passed coldly out  they met twelve hours later in a little hollow two miles from the hotel on the stockton road as mr oakhurst received his pistol from col starbottles hands he said to him in a low voice whatever turns up or down i shall not return to the hotel you will find some directions in my room go therebut his voice suddenly faltered and he turned his glistening eyes away to his seconds intense astonishment ive been out a dozen times with jack oakhurst said col starbottle afterward and i never saw him anyways cut before blank me if i didnt think he was losing his sand till he walked to position  the two reports were almost simultaneous mr oakhursts right arm dropped suddenly to his side and his pistol would have fallen from his paralyzed fingers but the discipline of trained nerve and muscle prevailed and he kept his grasp until he had shifted it to the other hand without changing his position then there was a silence that seemed interminable a gathering of two or three dark figures where a smokecurl still lazily floated and then the hurried husky panting voice of col starbottle in his ear hes hit hardthrough the lungs you must run for it  jack turned his dark questioning eyes upon his second but did not seem to listenrather seemed to hear some other voice remoter in the distance he hesitated and then made a step forward in the direction of the distant group then he paused again as the figures separated and the surgeon came hastily toward him  he would like to speak with you a moment said the man you have little time to lose i know but he added in a lower voice it is my duty to tell you he has still less  a look of despair so hopeless in its intensity swept over mr oakhursts usually impassive face that the surgeon started you are hit he said glancing at jacks helpless arm  nothinga mere scratch said jack hastily then he added with a bitter laugh im not in luck today but come well see what he wants  his long feverish stride outstripped the surgeons and in another moment he stood where the dying man laylike most dying menthe one calm composed central figure of an anxious group mr oakhursts face was less calm as he dropped on one knee beside him and took his hand i want to speak with this gentleman alone said hamilton with something of his old imperious manner as he turned to those about him when they drew back he looked up in oakhursts face  ive something to tell you jack  his own face was white but not so white as that which mr oakhurst bent over hima face so ghastly with haunting doubts and a hopeless presentiment of coming evila face so piteous in its infinite weariness and envy of death that the dying man was touched even in the languor of dissolution with a pang of compassion and the cynical smile faded from his lips  forgive me jack he whispered more feebly for what i have to say i dont say it in anger but only because it must be said i could not do my duty to you i could not die contented until you knew it all its a miserable business at best all around but it cant be helped now only i ought to have fallen by deckers pistol and not yours  a flush like fire came into jacks cheek and he would have risen but hamilton held him fast  listen in my pocket you will find two letters take themthere you will know the handwriting but promise you will not read them until you are in a place of safety promise me  jack did not speak but held the letters between his fingers as if they had been burning coals  promise me said hamilton faintly  why asked oakhurst dropping his friends hand coldly  because said the dying man with a bitter smilebecausewhen you have read themyouwillgo backto captureand death  they were his last words he pressed jacks hand faintly then his grasp relaxed and he fell back a corpse  it was nearly ten oclock at night and mrs decker reclined languidly upon the sofa with a novel in her hand while her husband discussed the politics of the country in the barroom of the hotel it was a warm night and the french window looking out upon a little balcony was partly open suddenly she heard a foot upon the balcony and she raised her eyes from the book with a slight start the next moment the window was hurriedly thrust wide and a man entered  mrs decker rose to her feet with a little cry of alarm  for heavens sake jack are you mad he has only gone for a little whilehe may return at any moment come an hour later tomorrow any time when i can get rid of himbut go now dear at once  mr oakhurst walked toward the door bolted it and then faced her without a word his face was haggard his coatsleeve hung loosely over an arm that was bandaged and bloody  nevertheless her voice did not falter as she turned again toward him what has happened jack why are you here  he opened his coat and threw two letters in her lap  to return your lovers letters to kill youand then myself he said in a voice so low as to be almost inaudible  among the many virtues of this admirable woman was invincible courage she did not faint she did not cry out she sat quietly down again folded her hands in her lap and said calmly  and why should you not  had she recoiled had she shown any fear or contrition had she essayed an explanation or apology mr oakhurst would have looked upon it as an evidence of guilt but there is no quality that courage recognizes so quickly as courage there is no condition that desperation bows before but desperation and mr oakhursts power of analysis was not so keen as to prevent him from confounding her courage with a moral quality even in his fury he could not help admiring this dauntless invalid  why should you not she repeated with a smile you gave me life health and happiness jack you gave me your love why should you not take what you have given go on i am ready  she held out her hands with that same infinite grace of yielding with which she had taken his own on the first day of their meeting at the hotel jack raised his head looked at her for one wild moment dropped upon his knees beside her and raised the folds of her dress to his feverish lips but she was too clever not to instantly see her victory she was too much of a woman with all her cleverness to refrain from pressing that victory home at the same moment as with the impulse of an outraged and wounded woman she rose and with an imperious gesture pointed to the window mr oakhurst rose in his turn cast one glance upon her and without another word passed out of her presence forever  when he had gone she closed the window and bolted it and going to the chimneypiece placed the letters one by one in the flame of the candle until they were consumed i would not have the reader think that during this painful operation she was unmoved her hand trembled andnot being a brutefor some minutes perhaps longer she felt very badly and the corners of her sensitive mouth were depressed when her husband arrived it was with a genuine joy that she ran to him and nestled against his broad breast with a feeling of security that thrilled the honest fellow to the core  but ive heard dreadful news tonight elsie said mr decker after a few endearments were exchanged  dont tell me any thing dreadful dear im not well tonight she pleaded sweetly  but its about mr oakhurst and hamilton  please mr decker could not resist the petitionary grace of those white hands and that sensitive mouth and took her to his arms suddenly he said whats that  he was pointing to the bosom of her white dress where mr oakhurst had touched her there was a spot of blood  it was nothing she had slightly cut her hand in closing the window it shut so hard if mr decker had remembered to close and bolt the shutter before he went out he might have saved her this there was such a genuine irritability and force in this remark that mr decker was quite overcome by remorse but mrs decker forgave him with that graciousness which i have before pointed out in these pages and with the halo of that forgiveness and marital confidence still lingering above the pair with the readers permission we will leave them and return to mr oakhurst  but not for two weeks at the end of that time he walked into his rooms in sacramento and in his old manner took his seat at the farotable  hows your arm jack asked an incautious player  there was a smile followed the question which however ceased as jack looked up quietly at the speaker  it bothers my dealing a little but i can shoot as well with my left  the game was continued in that decorous silence which usually distinguished the table at which mr john oakhurst presided     wan lee the pagan   as i opened hop sings letter there fluttered to the ground a square strip of yellow paper covered with hieroglyphics which at first glance i innocently took to be the label from a pack of chinese firecrackers but the same envelope also contained a smaller strip of ricepaper with two chinese characters traced in india ink that i at once knew to be hop sings visitingcard the whole as afterwards literally translated ran as follows   to the stranger the gates of my house are not closed the ricejar is on the left and the sweetmeats on the right as you enter  two sayings of the master  hospitality is the virtue of the son and the wisdom of the ancestor  the superior man is light hearted after the cropgathering he makes a festival  when the stranger is in your melonpatch observe him not too closely inattention is often the highest form of civility  happiness peace and prosperity  hop sing   admirable certainly as was this morality and proverbial wisdom and although this last axiom was very characteristic of my friend hop sing who was that most sombre of all humorists a chinese philosopher i must confess that even after a very free translation i was at a loss to make any immediate application of the message luckily i discovered a third enclosure in the shape of a little note in english and hop sings own commercial hand it ran thus   the pleasure of your company is requested at no  sacramento street on friday evening at eight oclock a cup of tea at ninesharp  hop sing   this explained all it meant a visit to hop sings warehouse the opening and exhibition of some rare chinese novelties and curios a chat in the back office a cup of tea of a perfection unknown beyond these sacred precincts cigars and a visit to the chinese theatre or temple this was in fact the favorite programme of hop sing when he exercised his functions of hospitality as the chief factor or superintendent of the ning foo company  at eight oclock on friday evening i entered the warehouse of hop sing there was that deliciously commingled mysterious foreign odor that i had so often noticed there was the old array of uncouthlooking objects the long procession of jars and crockery the same singular blending of the grotesque and the mathematically neat and exact the same endless suggestions of frivolity and fragility the same want of harmony in colors that were each in themselves beautiful and rare kites in the shape of enormous dragons and gigantic butterflies kites so ingeniously arranged as to utter at intervals when facing the wind the cry of a hawk kites so large as to be beyond any boys power of restraintso large that you understood why kiteflying in china was an amusement for adults gods of china and bronze so gratuitously ugly as to be beyond any human interest or sympathy from their very impossibility jars of sweetmeats covered all over with moral sentiments from confucius hats that looked like baskets and baskets that looked like hats silks so light that i hesitate to record the incredible number of square yards that you might pass through the ring on your little fingerthese and a great many other indescribable objects were all familiar to me i pushed my way through the dimlylighted warehouse until i reached the back office or parlor where i found hop sing waiting to receive me  before i describe him i want the average reader to discharge from his mind any idea of a chinaman that he may have gathered from the pantomime he did not wear beautifully scalloped drawers fringed with little bells i never met a chinaman who did he did not habitually carry his forefinger extended before him at right angles with his body nor did i ever hear him utter the mysterious sentence ching a ring a ring chaw nor dance under any provocation he was on the whole a rather grave decorous handsome gentleman his complexion which extended all over his head except where his long pigtail grew was like a very nice piece of glazed brown papermuslin his eyes were black and bright and his eyelids set at an angle of fifteen degrees his nose straight and delicately formed his mouth small and his teeth white and clean he wore a dark blue silk blouse and in the streets on cold days a short jacket of astrachan fur he wore also a pair of drawers of blue brocade gathered tightly over his calves and ankles offering a general sort of suggestion that he had forgotten his trousers that morning but that so gentlemanly were his manners his friends had forborne to mention the fact to him his manner was urbane although quite serious he spoke french and english fluently in brief i doubt if you could have found the equal of this pagan shopkeeper among the christian traders of san francisco  there were a few others presenta judge of the federal court an editor a high government official and a prominent merchant after we had drunk our tea and tasted a few sweetmeats from a mysterious jar that looked as if it might contain a preserved mouse among its other nondescript treasures hop sing arose and gravely beckoning us to follow him began to descend to the basement when we got there we were amazed at finding it brilliantly lighted and that a number of chairs were arranged in a halfcircle on the asphalt pavement when he had courteously seated us he said  i have invited you to witness a performance which i can at least promise you no other foreigners but yourselves have ever seen wang the courtjuggler arrived here yesterday morning he has never given a performance outside of the palace before i have asked him to entertain my friends this evening he requires no theatre stage accessories or any confederatenothing more than you see here will you be pleased to examine the ground yourselves gentlemen  of course we examined the premises it was the ordinary basement or cellar of the san francisco storehouse cemented to keep out the damp we poked our sticks into the pavement and rapped on the walls to satisfy our polite hostbut for no other purpose we were quite content to be the victims of any clever deception for myself i knew i was ready to be deluded to any extent and if i had been offered an explanation of what followed i should have probably declined it  although i am satisfied that wangs general performance was the first of that kind ever given on american soil it has probably since become so familiar to many of my readers that i shall not bore them with it here he began by setting to flight with the aid of his fan the usual number of butterflies made before our eyes of little bits of tissuepaper and kept them in the air during the remainder of the performance i have a vivid recollection of the judge trying to catch one that had lit on his knee and of its evading him with the pertinacity of a living insect and even at this time wang still plying his fan was taking chickens out of hats making oranges disappear pulling endless yards of silk from his sleeve apparently filling the whole area of the basement with goods that appeared mysteriously from the ground from his own sleeves from nowhere he swallowed knives to the ruin of his digestion for years to come he dislocated every limb of his body he reclined in the air apparently upon nothing but his crowning performance which i have never yet seen repeated was the most weird mysterious and astounding it is my apology for this long introduction my sole excuse for writing this article and the genesis of this veracious history  he cleared the ground of its encumbering articles for a space of about fifteen feet square and then invited us all to walk forward and again examine it we did so gravely there was nothing but the cemented pavement below to be seen or felt he then asked for the loan of a handkerchief and as i chanced to be nearest him i offered mine he took it and spread it open upon the floor over this he spread a large square of silk and over this again a large shawl nearly covering the space he had cleared he then took a position at one of the points of this rectangle and began a monotonous chant rocking his body to and fro in time with the somewhat lugubrious air  we sat still and waited above the chant we could hear the striking of the city clocks and the occasional rattle of a cart in the street overhead the absolute watchfulness and expectation the dim mysterious halflight of the cellar falling in a grewsome way upon the misshapen bulk of a chinese deity in the back ground a faint smell of opiumsmoke mingling with spice and the dreadful uncertainty of what we were really waiting for sent an uncomfortable thrill down our backs and made us look at each other with a forced and unnatural smile this feeling was heightened when hop sing slowly rose and without a word pointed with his finger to the centre of the shawl  there was something beneath the shawl surelyand something that was not there before at first a mere suggestion in relief a faint outline but growing more and more distinct and visible every moment the chant still continued the perspiration began to roll from the singers face gradually the hidden object took upon itself a shape and bulk that raised the shawl in its centre some five or six inches it was now unmistakably the outline of a small but perfect human figure with extended arms and legs one or two of us turned pale there was a feeling of general uneasiness until the editor broke the silence by a gibe that poor as it was was received with spontaneous enthusiasm then the chant suddenly ceased wang arose and with a quick dexterous movement stripped both shawl and silk away and discovered sleeping peacefully upon my handkerchief a tiny chinese baby  the applause and uproar which followed this revelation ought to have satisfied wang even if his audience was a small one it was loud enough to awaken the babya pretty little boy about a year old looking like a cupid cut out of sandalwood he was whisked away almost as mysteriously as he appeared when hop sing returned my handkerchief to me with a bow i asked if the juggler was the father of the baby no sabe said the imperturbable hop sing taking refuge in that spanish form of noncommittalism so common in california  but does he have a new baby for every performance i asked perhaps who knowsbut what will become of this onewhatever you choose gentlemen replied hop sing with a courteous inclination it was born here you are its godfathers  there were two characteristic peculiarities of any californian assemblage in 1856it was quick to take a hint and generous to the point of prodigality in its response to any charitable appeal no matter how sordid or avaricious the individual he could not resist the infection of sympathy i doubled the points of my handkerchief into a bag dropped a coin into it and without a word passed it to the judge he quietly added a twentydollar goldpiece and passed it to the next when it was returned to me it contained over a hundred dollars i knotted the money in the handkerchief and gave it to hop sing  for the baby from its godfathers  but what name said the judge there was a running fire of erebus nox plutus terra cotta antaeus c finally the question was referred to our host  why not keep his own name he said quietlywan lee and he did  and thus was wan lee on the night of friday the 5th of march 1856 born into this veracious chronicle   the last form of the northern star for the 19th of july 1865the only daily paper published in klamath countyhad just gone to press and at three am i was putting aside my proofs and manuscripts preparatory to going home when i discovered a letter lying under some sheets of paper which i must have overlooked the envelope was considerably soiled it had no postmark but i had no difficulty in recognizing the hand of my friend hop sing i opened it hurriedly and read as follows   my dear siri do not know whether the bearer will suit you but unless the office of devil in your newspaper is a purely technical one i think he has all the qualities required he is very quick active and intelligent understands english better than he speaks it and makes up for any defect by his habits of observation and imitation you have only to show him how to do a thing once and he will repeat it whether it is an offence or a virtue but you certainly know him already you are one of his godfathers for is he not wan lee the reputed son of wang the conjurer to whose performances i had the honor to introduce you but perhaps you have forgotten it  i shall send him with a gang of coolies to stockton thence by express to your town if you can use him there you will do me a favor and probably save his life which is at present in great peril from the hands of the younger members of your christian and highlycivilized race who attend the enlightened schools in san francisco  he has acquired some singular habits and customs from his experience of wangs profession which he followed for some yearsuntil he became too large to go in a hat or be produced from his fathers sleeve the money you left with me has been expended on his education he has gone through the triliteral classics but i think without much benefit he knows but little of confucius and absolutely nothing of mencius owing to the negligence of his father he associated perhaps too much with american children  i should have answered your letter before by post but i thought that wan lee himself would be a better messenger for this  yours respectfully  hop sing   and this was the longdelayed answer to my letter to hop sing but where was the bearer how was the letter delivered i summoned hastily the foreman printers and officeboy but without eliciting any thing no one had seen the letter delivered nor knew any thing of the bearer a few days later i had a visit from my laundryman ah ri  you wantee debbil all lightee me catchee him  he returned in a few moments with a brightlooking chinese boy about ten years old with whose appearance and general intelligence i was so greatly impressed that i engaged him on the spot when the business was concluded i asked his name  wan lee said the boy  what are you the boy sent out by hop sing what the devil do you mean by not coming here before and how did you deliver that letter  wan lee looked at me and laughed me pitchee in top side window  i did not understand he looked for a moment perplexed and then snatching the letter out of my hand ran down the stairs after a moments pause to my great astonishment the letter came flying in the window circled twice around the room and then dropped gently like a bird upon my table before i had got over my surprise wan lee reappeared smiled looked at the letter and then at me said so john and then remained gravely silent i said nothing further but it was understood that this was his first official act  his next performance i grieve to say was not attended with equal success one of our regular papercarriers fell sick and at a pinch wan lee was ordered to fill his place to prevent mistakes he was shown over the route the previous evening and supplied at about daylight with the usual number of subscribers copies he returned after an hour in good spirits and without the papers he had delivered them all he said  unfortunately for wan lee at about eight oclock indignant subscribers began to arrive at the office they had received their copies but how in the form of hardpressed cannonballs delivered by a single shot and a mere tour de force through the glass of bedroomwindows they had received them full in the face like a base ball if they happened to be up and stirring they had received them in quartersheets tucked in at separate windows they had found them in the chimney pinned against the door shot through atticwindows delivered in long slips through convenient keyholes stuffed into ventilators and occupying the same can with the mornings milk one subscriber who waited for some time at the officedoor to have a personal interview with wan lee then comfortably locked in my bedroom told me with tears of rage in his eyes that he had been awakened at five oclock by a most hideous yelling below his windows that on rising in great agitation he was startled by the sudden appearance of the northern star rolled hard and bent into the form of a boomerang or eastindian club that sailed into the window described a number of fiendish circles in the room knocked over the light slapped the babys face took him the subscriber in the jaw and then returned out of the window and dropped helplessly in the area during the rest of the day wads and strips of soiled paper purporting to be copies of the northern star of that mornings issue were brought indignantly to the office an admirable editorial on the resources of humboldt county which i had constructed the evening before and which i had reason to believe might have changed the whole balance of trade during the ensuing year and left san francisco bankrupt at her wharves was in this way lost to the public  it was deemed advisable for the next three weeks to keep wan lee closely confined to the printingoffice and the purely mechanical part of the business here he developed a surprising quickness and adaptability winning even the favor and good will of the printers and foreman who at first looked upon his introduction into the secrets of their trade as fraught with the gravest political significance he learned to set type readily and neatly his wonderful skill in manipulation aiding him in the mere mechanical act and his ignorance of the language confining him simply to the mechanical effort confirming the printers axiom that the printer who considers or follows the ideas of his copy makes a poor compositor he would set up deliberately long diatribes against himself composed by his fellowprinters and hung on his hook as copy and even such short sentences as wan lee is the devils own imp wan lee is a mongolian rascal and bring the proof to me with happiness beaming from every tooth and satisfaction shining in his huckleberry eyes  it was not long however before he learned to retaliate on his mischievous persecutors i remember one instance in which his reprisal came very near involving me in a serious misunderstanding our foremans name was webster and wan lee presently learned to know and recognize the individual and combined letters of his name it was during a political campaign and the eloquent and fiery col starbottle of siskyou had delivered an effective speech which was reported especially for the northern star in a very sublime peroration col starbottle had said in the language of the godlike webster i repeatand here followed the quotation which i have forgotten now it chanced that wan lee looking over the galley after it had been revised saw the name of his chief persecutor and of course imagined the quotation his after the form was locked up wan lee took advantage of websters absence to remove the quotation and substitute a thin piece of lead of the same size as the type engraved with chinese characters making a sentence which i had reason to believe was an utter and abject confession of the incapacity and offensiveness of the webster family generally and exceedingly eulogistic of wan lee himself personally  the next mornings paper contained col starbottles speech in full in which it appeared that the godlike webster had on one occasion uttered his thoughts in excellent but perfectly enigmatical chinese the rage of col starbottle knew no bounds i have a vivid recollection of that admirable man walking into my office and demanding a retraction of the statement  but my dear sir i asked are you willing to deny over your own signature that webster ever uttered such a sentence dare you deny that with mr websters wellknown attainments a knowledge of chinese might not have been among the number are you willing to submit a translation suitable to the capacity of our readers and deny upon your honor as a gentleman that the late mr webster ever uttered such a sentiment if you are sir i am willing to publish your denial  the colonel was not and left highly indignant  webster the foreman took it more coolly happily he was unaware that for two days after chinamen from the laundries from the gulches from the kitchens looked in the front officedoor with faces beaming with sardonic delight that three hundred extra copies of the star were ordered for the washhouses on the river he only knew that during the day wan lee occasionally went off into convulsive spasms and that he was obliged to kick him into consciousness again a week after the occurrence i called wan lee into my office  wan i said gravely i should like you to give me for my own personal satisfaction a translation of that chinese sentence which my gifted countryman the late godlike webster uttered upon a public occasion wan lee looked at me intently and then the slightest possible twinkle crept into his black eyes then he replied with equal gravity  mishtel webstel he say china boy makee me belly much foolee china boy makee me heap sick which i have reason to think was true  but i fear i am giving but one side and not the best of wan lees character as he imparted it to me his had been a hard life he had known scarcely any childhood he had no recollection of a father or mother the conjurer wang had brought him up he had spent the first seven years of his life in appearing from baskets in dropping out of hats in climbing ladders in putting his little limbs out of joint in posturing he had lived in an atmosphere of trickery and deception he had learned to look upon mankind as dupes of their senses in fine if he had thought at all he would have been a sceptic if he had been a little older he would have been a cynic if he had been older still he would have been a philosopher as it was he was a little imp a goodnatured imp it was tooan imp whose moral nature had never been awakenedan imp up for a holiday and willing to try virtue as a diversion i dont know that he had any spiritual nature he was very superstitious he carried about with him a hideous little porcelain god which he was in the habit of alternately reviling and propitiating he was too intelligent for the commoner chinese vices of stealing or gratuitous lying whatever discipline he practised was taught by his intellect  i am inclined to think that his feelings were not altogether unimpressible although it was almost impossible to extract an expression from him and i conscientiously believe he became attached to those that were good to him what he might have become under more favorable conditions than the bondsman of an overworked underpaid literary man i dont know i only know that the scant irregular impulsive kindnesses that i showed him were gratefully received he was very loyal and patient two qualities rare in the average american servant he was like malvolio sad and civil with me only once and then under great provocation do i remember of his exhibiting any impatience it was my habit after leaving the office at night to take him with me to my rooms as the bearer of any supplemental or happy afterthought in the editorial way that might occur to me before the paper went to press one night i had been scribbling away past the usual hour of dismissing wan lee and had become quite oblivious of his presence in a chair near my door when suddenly i became aware of a voice saying in plaintive accents something that sounded like chy lee  i faced around sternly  what did you say  me say chy lee  well i said impatiently  you sabe how do john  yes  you sabe so long john  yes  well chy lee allee same  i understood him quite plainly it appeared that chy lee was a form of goodnight and that wan lee was anxious to go home but an instinct of mischief which i fear i possessed in common with him impelled me to act as if oblivious of the hint i muttered something about not understanding him and again bent over my work in a few minutes i heard his wooden shoes pattering pathetically over the floor i looked up he was standing near the door  you no sabe chy lee  no i said sternly  you sabe muchee big foolee allee same  and with this audacity upon his lips he fled the next morning however he was as meek and patient as before and i did not recall his offence as a probable peaceoffering he blacked all my bootsa duty never required of himincluding a pair of buff deerskin slippers and an immense pair of horsemans jackboots on which he indulged his remorse for two hours  i have spoken of his honesty as being a quality of his intellect rather than his principle but i recall about this time two exceptions to the rule i was anxious to get some fresh eggs as a change to the heavy diet of a miningtown and knowing that wan lees countrymen were great poultryraisers i applied to him he furnished me with them regularly every morning but refused to take any pay saying that the man did not sell thema remarkable instance of selfabnegation as eggs were then worth half a dollar apiece one morning my neighbor forster dropped in upon me at breakfast and took occasion to bewail his own ill fortune as his hens had lately stopped laying or wandered off in the bush wan lee who was present during our colloquy preserved his characteristic sad taciturnity when my neighbor had gone he turned to me with a slight chuckle flostels henswan lees hens allee same his other offence was more serious and ambitious it was a season of great irregularities in the mails and wan lee had heard me deplore the delay in the delivery of my letters and newspapers on arriving at my office one day i was amazed to find my table covered with letters evidently just from the postoffice but unfortunately not one addressed to me i turned to wan lee who was surveying them with a calm satisfaction and demanded an explanation to my horror he pointed to an empty mailbag in the corner and said postman he say no lettee john no lettee john postman plentee lie postman no good me catchee lettee last night allee same luckily it was still early the mails had not been distributed i had a hurried interview with the postmaster and wan lees bold attempt at robbing the united states mail was finally condoned by the purchase of a new mailbag and the whole affair thus kept a secret  if my liking for my little pagan page had not been sufficient my duty to hop sing was enough to cause me to take wan lee with me when i returned to san francisco after my two years experience with the northern star i do not think he contemplated the change with pleasure i attributed his feelings to a nervous dread of crowded public streets when he had to go across town for me on an errand he always made a circuit of the outskirts to his dislike for the discipline of the chinese and english school to which i proposed to send him to his fondness for the free vagrant life of the mines to sheer wilfulness that it might have been a superstitious premonition did not occur to me until long after  nevertheless it really seemed as if the opportunity i had long looked for and confidently expected had comethe opportunity of placing wan lee under gently restraining influences of subjecting him to a life and experience that would draw out of him what good my superficial care and illregulated kindness could not reach wan lee was placed at the school of a chinese missionaryan intelligent and kindhearted clergyman who had shown great interest in the boy and who better than all had a wonderful faith in him a home was found for him in the family of a widow who had a bright and interesting daughter about two years younger than wan lee it was this bright cheery innocent and artless child that touched and reached a depth in the boys nature that hitherto had been unsuspected that awakened a moral susceptibility which had lain for years insensible alike to the teachings of society or the ethics of the theologian  these few brief monthsbright with a promise that we never saw fulfilledmust have been happy ones to wan lee he worshipped his little friend with something of the same superstition but without any of the caprice that he bestowed upon his porcelain pagan god it was his delight to walk behind her to school carrying her booksa service always fraught with danger to him from the little hands of his caucasian christian brothers he made her the most marvellous toys he would cut out of carrots and turnips the most astonishing roses and tulips he made lifelike chickens out of melonseeds he constructed fans and kites and was singularly proficient in the making of dolls paper dresses on the other hand she played and sang to him taught him a thousand little prettinesses and refinements only known to girls gave him a yellow ribbon for his pigtail as best suiting his complexion read to him showed him wherein he was original and valuable took him to sunday school with her against the precedents of the school and smallwomanlike triumphed i wish i could add here that she effected his conversion and made him give up his porcelain idol but i am telling a true story and this little girl was quite content to fill him with her own christian goodness without letting him know that he was changed so they got along very well togetherthis little christian girl with her shining cross hanging around her plump white little neck and this dark little pagan with his hideous porcelain god hidden away in his blouse  there were two days of that eventful year which will long be remembered in san franciscotwo days when a mob of her citizens set upon and killed unarmed defenceless foreigners because they were foreigners and of another race religion and color and worked for what wages they could get there were some public men so timid that seeing this they thought that the end of the world had come there were some eminent statesmen whose names i am ashamed to write here who began to think that the passage in the constitution which guarantees civil and religious liberty to every citizen or foreigner was a mistake but there were also some men who were not so easily frightened and in twentyfour hours we had things so arranged that the timid men could wring their hands in safety and the eminent statesmen utter their doubts without hurting any body or any thing and in the midst of this i got a note from hop sing asking me to come to him immediately  i found his warehouse closed and strongly guarded by the police against any possible attack of the rioters hop sing admitted me through a barred grating with his usual imperturbable calm but as it seemed to me with more than his usual seriousness without a word he took my hand and led me to the rear of the room and thence down stairs into the basement it was dimly lighted but there was something lying on the floor covered by a shawl as i approached he drew the shawl away with a sudden gesture and revealed wan lee the pagan lying there dead  dead my reverend friends deadstoned to death in the streets of san francisco in the year of grace 1869 by a mob of halfgrown boys and christian schoolchildren  as i put my hand reverently upon his breast i felt something crumbling beneath his blouse i looked inquiringly at hop sing he put his hand between the folds of silk and drew out something with the first bitter smile i had ever seen on the face of that pagan gentleman  it was wan lees porcelain god crushed by a stone from the hands of those christian iconoclasts     how old man plunkett went home   i think we all loved him even after he mismanaged the affairs of the amity ditch company we commiserated him although most of us were stockholders and lost heavily i remember that the blacksmith went so far as to say that them chaps as put that responsibility on the old man oughter be lynched but the blacksmith was not a stockholder and the expression was looked upon as the excusable extravagance of a large sympathizing nature that when combined with a powerful frame was unworthy of notice at least that was the way they put it yet i think there was a general feeling of regret that this misfortune would interfere with the old mans longcherished plan of going home  indeed for the last ten years he had been going home he was going home after a sixmonths sojourn at monte flat he was going home after the first rains he was going home when the rains were over he was going home when he had cut the timber on buckeye hill when there was pasture on dows flat when he struck paydirt on eureka hill when the amity company paid its first dividend when the election was over when he had received an answer from his wife and so the years rolled by the spring rains came and went the woods of buckeye hill were level with the ground the pasture on dows flat grew sear and dry eureka hill yielded its paydirt and swamped its owner the first dividends of the amity company were made from the assessments of stockholders there were new county officers at monte flat his wifes answer had changed into a persistent question and still old man plunkett remained  it is only fair to say that he had made several distinct essays toward going five years before he had bidden goodby to monte hill with much effusion and handshaking but he never got any farther than the next town here he was induced to trade the sorrel colt he was riding for a bay marea transaction that at once opened to his lively fancy a vista of vast and successful future speculation a few days after abner dean of angels received a letter from him stating that he was going to visalia to buy horses i am satisfied wrote plunkett with that elevated rhetoric for which his correspondence was remarkablei am satisfied that we are at last developing the real resources of california the world will yet look to dows flat as the great stockraising centre in view of the interests involved i have deferred my departure for a month it was two before he again returned to uspenniless six months later he was again enabled to start for the eastern states and this time he got as far as san francisco i have before me a letter which i received a few days after his arrival from which i venture to give an extract you know my dear boy that i have always believed that gambling as it is absurdly called is still in its infancy in california i have always maintained that a perfect system might be invented by which the game of poker may be made to yield a certain percentage to the intelligent player i am not at liberty at present to disclose the system but before leaving this city i intend to perfect it he seems to have done so and returned to monte flat with two dollars and thirtyseven cents the absolute remainder of his capital after such perfection  it was not until 1868 that he appeared to have finally succeeded in going home he left us by the overland routea route which he declared would give great opportunity for the discovery of undeveloped resources his last letter was dated virginia city he was absent three years at the close of a very hot day in midsummer he alighted from the wingdam stage with hair and beard powdered with dust and age there was a certain shyness about his greeting quite different from his usual frank volubility that did not however impress us as any accession of character for some days he was reserved regarding his recent visit contenting himself with asserting with more or less aggressiveness that he had always said he was going home and now he had been there later he grew more communicative and spoke freely and critically of the manners and customs of new york and boston commented on the social changes in the years of his absence and i remember was very hard upon what he deemed the follies incidental to a high state of civilization still later he darkly alluded to the moral laxity of the higher planes of eastern society but it was not long before he completely tore away the veil and revealed the naked wickedness of new york social life in a way i even now shudder to recall vinous intoxication it appeared was a common habit of the first ladies of the city immoralities which he scarcely dared name were daily practised by the refined of both sexes niggardliness and greed were the common vices of the rich i have always asserted he continued that corruption must exist where luxury and riches are rampant and capital is not used to develop the natural resources of the country thank youi will take mine without sugar it is possible that some of these painful details crept into the local journals i remember an editorial in the monte flat monitor entitled the effete east in which the fatal decadence of new york and new england was elaborately stated and california offered as a means of natural salvation perhaps said the monitor we might add that calaveras county offers superior inducements to the eastern visitor with capital  later he spoke of his family the daughter he had left a child had grown into beautiful womanhood the son was already taller and larger than his father and in a playful trial of strength the young rascal added plunkett with a voice broken with paternal pride and humorous objurgation had twice thrown his doting parent to the ground but it was of his daughter he chiefly spoke perhaps emboldened by the evident interest which masculine monte flat held in feminine beauty he expatiated at some length on her various charms and accomplishments and finally produced her photographthat of a very pretty girlto their infinite peril but his account of his first meeting with her was so peculiar that i must fain give it after his own methods which were perhaps some shades less precise and elegant than his written style  you see boys its always been my opinion that a man oughter be able to tell his own flesh and blood by instinct its ten years since id seen my melindy and she was then only seven and about so high so when i went to new york what did i do did i go straight to my house and ask for my wife and daughter like other folks no sir i rigged myself up as a peddler as a peddler sir and i rung the bell when the servant came to the door i wanteddont you seeto show the ladies some trinkets then there was a voice over the banister says dont want any thing send him awaysome nice laces maam smuggled i says looking up get out you wretch says she i knew the voice boys it was my wife sure as a gun thar wasnt any instinct thar maybe the young ladies want somethin i said did you hear me says she and with that she jumps forward and i left its ten years boys since ive seen the old woman but somehow when she fetched that leap i naterally left  he had been standing beside the barhis usual attitudewhen he made this speech but at this point he half faced his auditors with a look that was very effective indeed a few who had exhibited some signs of scepticism and lack of interest at once assumed an appearance of intense gratification and curiosity as he went on  well by hangin round there for a day or two i found out at last it was to be melindys birthday next week and that she was goin to have a big party i tell ye what boys it werent no slouch of a reception the whole house was bloomin with flowers and blazin with lights and there was no end of servants and plate and refreshments and fixins  uncle joe  well  where did they get the money  plunkett faced his interlocutor with a severe glance i always said he replied slowly that when i went home id send on ahead of me a draft for ten thousand dollars i always said that didnt i eh and i said i was goin homeand ive been home havent i well  either there was something irresistibly conclusive in this logic or else the desire to hear the remainder of plunketts story was stronger but there was no more interruption his ready goodhumor quickly returned and with a slight chuckle he went on  i went to the biggest jewelry shop in town and i bought a pair of diamond earrings and put them in my pocket and went to the house what name says the chap who opened the door and he looked like a cross twixt a restaurant waiter and a parson skeesicks said i he takes me in and pretty soon my wife comes sailin into the parlor and says excuse me but i dont think i recognize the name she was mighty polite for i had on a red wig and sidewhiskers a friend of your husbands from california maam with a present for your daughter miss and i made as i had forgot the name but all of a sudden a voice said thats too thin and in walked melindy its playin it rather low down father to pretend you dont know your daughters name aint it now how are you old man and with that she tears off my wig and whiskers and throws her arms around my neckinstinct sir pure instinct  emboldened by the laughter which followed his description of the filial utterances of melinda he again repeated her speech with more or less elaboration joining in with and indeed often leading the hilarity that accompanied it and returning to it with more or less incoherency several times during the evening  and so at various times and at various places but chiefly in barrooms did this ulysses of monte flat recount the story of his wanderings there were several discrepancies in his statement there was sometimes considerable prolixity of detail there was occasional change of character and scenery there was once or twice an absolute change in the denoument but always the fact of his having visited his wife and children remained of course in a sceptical community like that of monte flata community accustomed to great expectation and small realizationa community wherein to use the local dialect they got the color and struck hardpan more frequently than any other miningcampin such a community the fullest credence was not given to old man plunketts facts there was only one exception to the general unbeliefhenry york of sandy bar it was he who was always an attentive listener it was his scant purse that had often furnished plunkett with means to pursue his unprofitable speculations it was to him that the charms of melinda were more frequently rehearsed it was he that had borrowed her photograph and it was he that sitting alone in his little cabin one night kissed that photograph until his honest handsome face glowed again in the firelight  it was dusty in monte flat the ruins of the long dry season were crumbling everywhere everywhere the dying summer had strewn its red ashes a foot deep or exhaled its last breath in a red cloud above the troubled highways the alders and cottonwoods that marked the line of the watercourses were grimy with dust and looked as if they might have taken root in the open air the gleaming stones of the parched watercourses themselves were as dry bones in the valley of death the dusty sunset at times painted the flanks of the distant hills a dull coppery hue on other days there was an odd indefinable earthquake halo on the volcanic cones of the farther coastspurs again an acrid resinous smoke from the burning wood on heavytree hill smarted the eyes and choked the free breath of monte flat or a fierce wind driving every thing including the shrivelled summer like a curled leaf before it swept down the flanks of the sierras and chased the inhabitants to the doors of their cabins and shook its red fist in at their windows and on such a night as this the dust having in some way choked the wheels of material progress in monte flat most of the inhabitants were gathered listlessly in the gilded barroom of the moquelumne hotel spitting silently at the redhot stove that tempered the mountain winds to the shorn lambs of monte flat and waiting for the rain  every method known to the flat of beguiling the time until the advent of this longlookedfor phenomenon had been tried it is true the methods were not many being limited chiefly to that form of popular facetiae known as practical joking and even this had assumed the seriousness of a businesspursuit tommy roy who had spent two hours in digging a ditch in front of his own door into which a few friends casually dropped during the evening looked ennuye and dissatisfied the four prominent citizens who disguised as footpads had stopped the county treasurer on the wingdam road were jaded from their playful efforts next morning the principal physician and lawyer of monte flat who had entered into an unhallowed conspiracy to compel the sheriff of calaveras and his posse to serve a writ of ejectment on a grizzly bear feebly disguised under the name of one major ursus who haunted the groves of heavytree hill wore an expression of resigned weariness even the editor of the monte flat monitor who had that morning written a glowing account of a battle with the wipneck indians for the benefit of eastern readerseven he looked grave and worn when at last abner dean of angels who had been on a visit to san francisco walked into the room he was of course victimized in the usual way by one or two apparently honest questions which ended in his answering them and then falling into the trap of asking another to his utter and complete shame and mortification but that was all nobody laughed and abner although a victim did not lose his goodhumor he turned quietly on his tormentors and said  ive got something better than thatyou know old man plunkett  everybody simultaneously spat at the stove and nodded his head  you know he went home three years ago two or three changed the position of their legs from the backs of different chairs and one man said yes  had a good time home  everybody looked cautiously at the man who had said yes and he accepting the responsibility with a fainthearted smile said yes again and breathed hard saw his wife and childpurty gal said abner cautiously yes answered the man doggedly saw her photograph perhaps continued abner dean quietly  the man looked hopelessly around for support two or three who had been sitting near him and evidently encouraging him with a look of interest now shamelessly abandoned him and looked another way henry york flushed a little and veiled his gray eyes the man hesitated and then with a sickly smile that was intended to convey the fact that he was perfectly aware of the object of this questioning and was only humoring it from abstract good feeling returned yes again  sent homelets seeten thousand dollars wasnt it abner dean went on yes reiterated the man with the same smile  well i thought so said abner quietly but the fact is you see that he never went home at allnary time  everybody stared at abner in genuine surprise and interest as with provoking calmness and a halflazy manner he went on  you see thar was a man down in frisco as knowed him and saw him in sonora during the whole of that three years he was herding sheep or tending cattle or spekilating all that time and hadnt a red cent well it mounts to thisthat ar plunkett aint been east of the rocky mountains since 49  the laugh which abner dean had the right to confidently expect came but it was bitter and sardonic i think indignation was apparent in the minds of his hearers it was felt for the first time that there was a limit to practical joking a deception carried on for a year compromising the sagacity of monte flat was deserving the severest reprobation of course nobody had believed plunkett but then the supposition that it might be believed in adjacent camps that they had believed him was gall and bitterness the lawyer thought that an indictment for obtaining money under false pretences might be found the physician had long suspected him of insanity and was not certain but that he ought to be confined the four prominent merchants thought that the businessinterests of monte flat demanded that something should be done in the midst of an excited and angry discussion the door slowly opened and old man plunkett staggered into the room  he had changed pitifully in the last six months his hair was a dusty yellowish gray like the chemisal on the flanks of heavytree hill his face was waxen white and blue and puffy under the eyes his clothes were soiled and shabby streaked in front with the stains of hurriedly eaten luncheons and fluffy behind with the wool and hair of hurriedlyextemporized couches in obedience to that odd law that the more seedy and soiled a mans garments become the less does he seem inclined to part with them even during that portion of the twentyfour hours when they are deemed less essential plunketts clothes had gradually taken on the appearance of a kind of a bark or an outgrowth from within for which their possessor was not entirely responsible howbeit as he entered the room he attempted to button his coat over a dirty shirt and passed his fingers after the manner of some animal over his crackerstrewn beard in recognition of a cleanly public sentiment but even as he did so the weak smile faded from his lips and his hand after fumbling aimlessly around a button dropped helplessly at his side for as he leaned his back against the bar and faced the group he for the first time became aware that every eye but one was fixed upon him his quick nervous apprehension at once leaped to the truth his miserable secret was out and abroad in the very air about him as a last resort he glanced despairingly at henry york but his flushed face was turned toward the windows  no word was spoken as the barkeeper silently swung a decanter and glass before him he took a cracker from a dish and mumbled it with affected unconcern he lingered over his liquor until its potency stiffened his relaxed sinews and dulled the nervous edge of his apprehension and then he suddenly faced around it dont look as if we were goin to hev any rain much afore christmas he said with defiant ease  no one made any reply  just like this in 52 and again in 60 its always been my opinion that these dry seasons come reglar ive said it afore i say it again its jist as i said about going home you know he added with desperate recklessness  thars a man said abner dean lazily ez sez you never went home thars a man ez sez youve been three years in sonora thars a man ez sez you haint seen your wife and daughter since 49 thars a man ez sez youve been playin this camp for six months  there was a dead silence then a voice said quite as quietly  that man lies  it was not the old mans voice everybody turned as henry york slowly rose stretching out his six feet of length and brushing away the ashes that had fallen from his pipe upon his breast deliberately placed himself beside plunkett and faced the others  that man aint here continued abner dean with listless indifference of voice and a gentle preoccupation of manner as he carelessly allowed his right hand to rest on his hip near his revolver that man aint here but if im called upon to make good what he says why im on hand  all rose as the two menperhaps the least externally agitated of them allapproached each other the lawyer stepped in between them  perhaps theres some mistake here york do you know that the old man has been home  yes  how do you know it  york turned his clear honest frank eyes on his questioner and without a tremor told the only direct and unmitigated lie of his life because ive seen him there  the answer was conclusive it was known that york had been visiting the east during the old mans absence the colloquy had diverted attention from plunkett who pale and breathless was staring at his unexpected deliverer as he turned again toward his tormentors there was something in the expression of his eye that caused those that were nearest to him to fall back and sent a strange indefinable thrill through the boldest and most reckless as he made a step forward the physician almost unconsciously raised his hand with a warning gesture and old man plunkett with his eyes fixed upon the redhot stove and an odd smile playing about his mouth began  yesof course you did who says you didnt it aint no lie i said i was goin homeand ive been home havent i my god i have who says ive been lyin who says im dreamin is it truewhy dont you speak it is true after all you say you saw me there why dont you speak again say sayis it true its going now o my god its going again its going now save me and with a fierce cry he fell forward in a fit upon the floor  when the old man regained his senses he found himself in yorks cabin a flickering fire of pineboughs lit up the rude rafters and fell upon a photograph tastefully framed with fircones and hung above the brush whereon he lay it was the portrait of a young girl it was the first object to meet the old mans gaze and it brought with it a flush of such painful consciousness that he started and glanced quickly around but his eyes only encountered those of yorkclear gray critical and patientand they fell again  tell me old man said york not unkindly but with the same cold clear tone in his voice that his eye betrayed a moment agotell me is that a lie too and he pointed to the picture  the old man closed his eyes and did not reply two hours before the question would have stung him into some evasion or bravado but the revelation contained in the question as well as the tone of yorks voice was to him now in his pitiable condition a relief it was plain even to his confused brain that york had lied when he had indorsed his story in the barroom it was clear to him now that he had not been home that he was not as he had begun to fear going mad it was such a relief that with characteristic weakness his former recklessness and extravagance returned he began to chuckle finally to laugh uproariously  york with his eyes still fixed on the old man withdrew the hand with which he had taken his  didnt we fool em nicely eh yorky he he the biggest thing yet ever played in this camp i always said id play em all some day and i haveplayed em for six months aint it richaint it the richest thing you ever seed did you see abners face when he spoke bout that man as seed me in sonora warnt it good as the minstrels oh its too much and striking his leg with the palm of his hand he almost threw himself from the bed in a paroxysm of laughtera paroxysm that nevertheless appeared to be half real and half affected  is that photograph hers said york in a low voice after a slight pause  hers no its one of the san francisco actresses he he dont you see i bought it for two bits in one of the bookstores i never thought theyd swaller that too but they did oh but the old man played em this time didnt heeh and he peered curiously in yorks face  yes and he played me too said york looking steadily in the old mans eye  yes of course interposed plunkett hastily but you know yorky you got out of it well youve sold em too weve both got em on a string nowyou and megot to stick together now you did it well yorky you did it well why when you said youd seen me in york city im dd if i didnt  didnt what said york gently for the old man had stopped with a pale face and wandering eye  eh  you say when i said i had seen you in new york you thought  you lie said the old man fiercely i didnt say i thought any thing what are you trying to go back on me for eh his hands were trembling as he rose muttering from the bed and made his way toward the hearth  gimme some whiskey he said presently and dry up you oughter treat anyway them fellows oughter treated last night by hookey id made emonly i fell sick  york placed the liquor and a tin cup on the table beside him and going to the door turned his back upon his guest and looked out on the night although it was clear moonlight the familiar prospect never to him seemed so dreary the dead waste of the broad wingdam highway never seemed so monotonous so like the days that he had passed and were to come to him so like the old man in its suggestion of going sometime and never getting there he turned and going up to plunkett put his hand upon his shoulder and said  i want you to answer one question fairly and squarely  the liquor seemed to have warmed the torpid blood in the old mans veins and softened his acerbity for the face he turned up to york was mellowed in its rugged outline and more thoughtful in expression as he said  go on my boy  have you a wife anddaughter  before god i have  the two men were silent for a moment both gazing at the fire then plunkett began rubbing his knees slowly  the wife if it comes to that aint much he began cautiously being a little on the shoulder you know and wantin so to speak a liberal california education which makes you know a bad combination its always been my opinion that there aint any worse why shes as ready with her tongue as abner dean is with his revolver only with the difference that she shoots from principle as she calls it and the consequence is shes always layin for you its the effete east my boy thats ruinin her its them ideas she gets in new york and boston thats made her and me what we are i dont mind her havin em if she didnt shoot but havin that propensity them principles oughtnt to be lying round loose no moren firearms  but your daughter said york  the old mans hands went up to his eyes here and then both hands and head dropped forward on the table dont say any thing bout her my boy dont ask me now with one hand concealing his eyes he fumbled about with the other in his pockets for his handkerchiefbut vainly perhaps it was owing to this fact that he repressed his tears for when he removed his hand from his eyes they were quite dry then he found his voice  shes a beautiful girl beautiful though i say it and you shall see her my boyyou shall see her sure ive got things about fixed now i shall have my plan for reducin ores perfected a day or two and ive got proposals from all the smeltin works here here he hastily produced a bundle of papers that fell upon the floor and im goin to send for em ive got the papers here as will give me ten thousand dollars clear in the next month he added as he strove to collect the valuable documents again ill have em here by christmas if i live and you shall eat your christmas dinner with me york my boyyou shall sure  with his tongue now fairly loosened by liquor and the suggestive vastness of his prospects he rambled on more or less incoherently elaborating and amplifying his plans occasionally even speaking of them as already accomplished until the moon rode high in the heavens and york led him again to his couch here he lay for some time muttering to himself until at last he sank into a heavy sleep when york had satisfied himself of the fact he gently took down the picture and frame and going to the hearth tossed them on the dying embers and sat down to see them burn  the fircones leaped instantly into flame then the features that had entranced san francisco audiences nightly flashed up and passed away as such things are apt to pass and even the cynical smile on yorks lips faded too and then there came a supplemental and unexpected flash as the embers fell together and by its light york saw a paper upon the floor it was one that had fallen from the old mans pocket as he picked it up listlessly a photograph slipped from its folds it was the portrait of a young girl and on its reverse was written in a scrawling hand melinda to father  it was at best a cheap picture but ah me i fear even the deft graciousness of the highest art could not have softened the rigid angularities of that youthful figure its selfcomplacent vulgarity its cheap finery its expressionless illfavor york did not look at it a second time he turned to the letter for relief  it was misspelled it was unpunctuated it was almost illegible it was fretful in tone and selfish in sentiment it was not i fear even original in the story of its woes it was the harsh recital of poverty of suspicion of mean makeshifts and compromises of low pains and lower longings of sorrows that were degrading of a grief that was pitiable yet it was sincere in a certain kind of vague yearning for the presence of the degraded man to whom it was writtenan affection that was more like a confused instinct than a sentiment  york folded it again carefully and placed it beneath the old mans pillow then he returned to his seat by the fire a smile that had been playing upon his face deepening the curves behind his mustache and gradually overrunning his clear gray eyes presently faded away it was last to go from his eyes and it left there oddly enough to those who did not know him a tear  he sat there for a long time leaning forward his head upon his hands the wind that had been striving with the canvas roof all at once lifted its edges and a moonbeam slipped suddenly in and lay for a moment like a shining blade upon his shoulder and knighted by its touch straightway plain henry york arose sustained highpurposed and selfreliant   the rains had come at last there was already a visible greenness on the slopes of heavytree hill and the long white track of the wingdam road was lost in outlying pools and ponds a hundred rods from monte flat the spent watercourses whose white bones had been sinuously trailed over the flat like the vertebrae of some forgotten saurian were full again the dry bones moved once more in the valley and there was joy in the ditches and a pardonable extravagance in the columns of the monte flat monitor never before in the history of the county has the yield been so satisfactory our contemporary of the hillside beacon who yesterday facetiously alluded to the fact  that our best citizens were leaving town in dugouts on account of the flood will be glad to hear that our distinguished fellowtownsman mr henry york now on a visit to his relatives in the east lately took with him in his dugout the modest sum of fifty thousand dollars the result of one weeks cleanup we can imagine continued that sprightly journal that no such misfortune is likely to overtake hillside this season and yet we believe the beacon man wants a railroad a few journals broke out into poetry the operator at simpsons crossing telegraphed to the sacramento universe all day the low clouds have shook their garnered fulness down a san francisco journal lapsed into noble verse thinly disguised as editorial prose rejoice the gentle rain has come the bright and pearly rain which scatters blessings on the hills and sifts them oer the plain rejoice c indeed there was only one to whom the rain had not brought blessing and that was plunkett in some mysterious and darksome way it had interfered with the perfection of his new method of reducing ores and thrown the advent of that invention back another season it had brought him down to an habitual seat in the barroom where to heedless and inattentive ears he sat and discoursed of the east and his family  no one disturbed him indeed it was rumored that some funds had been lodged with the landlord by a person or persons unknown whereby his few wants were provided for his maniafor that was the charitable construction which monte flat put upon his conductwas indulged even to the extent of monte flats accepting his invitation to dine with his family on christmas dayan invitation extended frankly to every one with whom the old man drank or talked but one day to everybodys astonishment he burst into the barroom holding an open letter in his hand it read as follows   be ready to meet your family at the new cottage on heavytree hill on christmas day invite what friends you choose  henry york   the letter was handed round in silence the old man with a look alternating between hope and fear gazed in the faces of the group the doctor looked up significantly after a pause its a forgery evidently he said in a low voice hes cunning enough to conceive it they always are but youll find hell fail in executing it watch his faceold man he said suddenly in a loud peremptory tone this is a trick a forgery and you know it answer me squarely and look me in the eye isnt it so  the eyes of plunkett stared a moment and then dropped weakly then with a feebler smile he said youre too many for me boys the docs right the little games up you can take the old mans hat and so tottering trembling and chuckling he dropped into silence and his accustomed seat but the next day he seemed to have forgotten this episode and talked as glibly as ever of the approaching festivity  and so the days and weeks passed until christmasa bright clear day warmed with south winds and joyous with the resurrection of springing grassesbroke upon monte flat and then there was a sudden commotion in the hotel barroom and abner dean stood beside the old mans chair and shook him out of a slumber to his feet rouse up old man york is here with your wife and daughter at the cottage on heavytree come old man here boys give him a lift and in another moment a dozen strong and willing hands had raised the old man and bore him in triumph to the street up the steep grade of heavytree hill and deposited him struggling and confused in the porch of a little cottage at the same instant two women rushed forward but were restrained by a gesture from henry york the old man was struggling to his feet with an effort at last he stood erect trembling his eye fixed a gray pallor on his cheek and a deep resonance in his voice  its all a trick and a lie they aint no flesh and blood or kin o mine it aint my wife nor child my daughters a beautiful girla beautiful girl dye hear shes in new york with her mother and im going to fetch her here i said id go home and ive been home dye hear me ive been home its a mean trick youre playin on the old man let me go dye hear keep them women off me let me go im goingim goinghome  his hands were thrown up convulsively in the air and half turning round he fell sideways on the porch and so to the ground they picked him up hurriedly but too late he had gone home     the fool of five forks   he lived alone i do not think this peculiarity arose from any wish to withdraw his foolishness from the rest of the camp nor was it probable that the combined wisdom of five forks ever drove him into exile my impression is that he lived alone from choicea choice he made long before the camp indulged in any criticism of his mental capacity he was much given to moody reticence and although to outward appearances a strong man was always complaining of illhealth indeed one theory of his isolation was that it afforded him better opportunities for taking medicine of which he habitually consumed large quantities  his folly first dawned upon five forks through the postoffice windows he was for a long time the only man who wrote home by every mail his letters being always directed to the same persona woman now it so happened that the bulk of the five forks correspondence was usually the other way there were many letters received the majority being in the female hand but very few answered the men received them indifferently or as a matter of course a few opened and read them on the spot with a barely repressed smile of selfconceit or quite as frequently glanced over them with undisguised impatience some of the letters began with my dear husband and some were never called for but the fact that the only regular correspondent of five forks never received any reply became at last quite notorious consequently when an envelope was received bearing the stamp of the dead letter office addressed to the fool under the more conventional title of cyrus hawkins there was quite a fever of excitement i do not know how the secret leaked out but it was eventually known to the camp that the envelope contained hawkinss own letters returned this was the first evidence of his weakness any man who repeatedly wrote to a woman who did not reply must be a fool i think hawkins suspected that his folly was known to the camp but he took refuge in symptoms of chills and fever which he at once developed and effected a diversion with three bottles of indian cholagogue and two boxes of pills at all events at the end of a week he resumed a pen stiffened by tonics with all his old epistolatory pertinacity this time the letters had a new address  in those days a popular belief obtained in the mines that luck particularly favored the foolish and unscientific consequently when hawkins struck a pocket in the hillside near his solitary cabin there was but little surprise he will sink it all in the next hole was the prevailing belief predicated upon the usual manner in which the possessor of nigger luck disposed of his fortune to everybodys astonishment hawkins after taking out about eight thousand dollars and exhausting the pocket did not prospect for another the camp then waited patiently to see what he would do with his money i think however that it was with the greatest difficulty their indignation was kept from taking the form of a personal assault when it became known that he had purchased a draft for eight thousand dollars in favor of that woman more than this it was finally whispered that the draft was returned to him as his letters had been and that he was ashamed to reclaim the money at the expressoffice it wouldnt be a bad specilation to go east get some smart gal for a hundred dollars to dress herself up and represent that hag and jest freeze onto that eight thousand suggested a farseeing financier i may state here that we always alluded to hawkinss fair unknown as the hag without having i am confident the least justification for that epithet  that the fool should gamble seemed eminently fit and proper that he should occasionally win a large stake according to that popular theory which i have recorded in the preceding paragraph appeared also a not improbable or inconsistent fact that he should however break the faro bank which mr john hamlin had set up in five forks and carry off a sum variously estimated at from ten to twenty thousand dollars and not return the next day and lose the money at the same table really appeared incredible yet such was the fact a day or two passed without any known investment of mr hawkinss recentlyacquired capital ef he allows to send it to that hag said one prominent citizen suthin ought to be done its jest ruinin the reputation of this yer campthis sloshin around o capital on nonresidents ez dont claim it its settin an example o extravagance said another ez is little better nor a swindle thais morn five men in this camp thet hearin thet hawkins hed sent home eight thousand dollars must jest rise up and send home their hard earnings too and then to think thet thet eight thousand was only a bluff after all and thet its lyin there on call in adams  cos bank well i say its one o them things a vigilance committee oughter look into  when there seemed no possibility of this repetition of hawkinss folly the anxiety to know what he had really done with his money became intense at last a selfappointed committee of four citizens dropped artfully but to outward appearances carelessly upon him in his seclusion when some polite formalities had been exchanged and some easy vituperation of a backward season offered by each of the parties tom wingate approached the subject  sorter dropped heavy on jack hamlin the other night didnt ye he allows you didnt give him no show for revenge i said you wasnt no such dd fool didnt i dick continued the artful wingate appealing to a confederate  yes said dick promptly you said twenty thousand dollars wasnt goin to be thrown around recklessly you said cyrus had suthin better to do with his capital superadded dick with gratuitous mendacity i disremember now what partickler investment you said he was goin to make with it he continued appealing with easy indifference to his friend  of course wingate did not reply but looked at the fool who with a troubled face was rubbing his legs softly after a pause he turned deprecatingly toward his visitors  ye didnt enny of ye ever hev a sort of tremblin in your legs a kind o shakiness from the knee down suthin he continued slightly brightening with his topicsuthin that begins like chills and yet aint chills a kind o sensation of goneness here and a kind o feelin as it you might die suddintwhen wrights pills dont somehow reach the spot and quinine dont fetch you  no said wingate with a curt directness and the air of authoritatively responding for his friendsno never had you was speakin of this yer investment  and your bowels all the time irregular continued hawkins blushing under wingates eye and yet clinging despairingly to his theme like a shipwrecked mariner to his plank  wingate did not reply but glanced significantly at the rest hawkins evidently saw this recognition of his mental deficiency and said apologetically you was saying suthin about my investment  yes said wingate so rapidly as to almost take hawkinss breath awaythe investment you made in  raffertys ditch said the fool timidly  for a moment the visitors could only stare blankly at each other raffertys ditch the one notorious failure of five forksraffertys ditch the impracticable scheme of an utterly unpractical manraffertys ditch a ridiculous plan for taking water that could not be got to a place where it wasnt wantedraffertys ditch that had buried the fortunes of rafferty and twenty wretched stockholders in its muddy depths  and thets it is it said wingate after a gloomy pause thets it i see it all now boys thats how ragged pat rafferty went down to san francisco yesterday in storeclothes and his wife and four children went off in a kerridge to sacramento thets why them ten workmen of his ez hadnt a cent to bless themselves with was playin billiards last night and eatin isters thets whar that money kum frumone hundred dollars to pay for the long advertisement of the new issue of ditch stock in the times yesterday thets why them six strangers were booked at the magnolia hotel yesterday dont you see its thet moneyand that fool  the fool sat silent the visitors rose without a word  you never took any of them indian vegetable pills asked hawkins timidly of wingate  no roared wingate as he opened the door  they tell me that took with the panaceathey was out o the panacea when i went to the drugstore last weekthey say that took with the panacea they always effect a certin cure but by this time wingate and his disgusted friends had retreated slamming the door on the fool and his ailments  nevertheless in six months the whole affair was forgotten the money had been spent the ditch had been purchased by a company of boston capitalists fired by the glowing description of an eastern tourist who had spent one drunken night at five forks and i think even the mental condition of hawkins might have remained undisturbed by criticism but for a singular incident  it was during an exciting political campaign when partyfeeling ran high that the irascible capt mcfadden of sacramento visited five forks during a heated discussion in the prairie rose saloon words passed between the captain and the hon calhoun bungstarter ending in a challenge the captain bore the infelicitous reputation of being a notorious duellist and a deadshot the captain was unpopular the captain was believed to have been sent by the opposition for a deadly purpose and the captain was moreover a stranger i am sorry to say that with five forks this latter condition did not carry the quality of sanctity or reverence that usually obtains among other nomads there was consequently some little hesitation when the captain turned upon the crowd and asked for some one to act as his friend to everybodys astonishment and to the indignation of many the fool stepped forward and offered himself in that capacity i do not know whether capt mcfadden would have chosen him voluntarily but he was constrained in the absence of a better man to accept his services  the duel never took place the preliminaries were all arranged the spot indicated the men were present with their seconds there was no interruption from without there was no explanation or apology passedbut the duel did not take place it may be readily imagined that these facts which were all known to five forks threw the whole community into a fever of curiosity the principals the surgeon and one second left town the next day only the fool remained he resisted all questioning declaring himself held in honor not to divulge in short conducted himself with consistent but exasperating folly it was not until six months had passed that col starbottle the second of calhoun bungstarter in a moment of weakness superinduced by the social glass condescended to explain i should not do justice to the parties if i did not give that explanation in the colonels own words i may remark in passing that the characteristic dignity of col starbottle always became intensified by stimulants and that by the same process all sense of humor was utterly eliminated  with the understanding that i am addressing myself confidentially to men of honor said the colonel elevating his chest above the barroom counter of the prairie rose saloon i trust that it will not be necessary for me to protect myself from levity as i was forced to do in sacramento on the only other occasion when i entered into an explanation of this delicate affair byerercalling the individual to a personal accounter i do not believe added the colonel slightly waving his glass of liquor in the air with a graceful gesture of courteous deprecation knowing what i do of the present company that such a course of action is required here certainly not sir in the home of mr hawkinserthe gentleman who represented mr bungstarter whose conduct ged sir is worthy of praise blank me  apparently satisfied with the gravity and respectful attention of his listeners col starbottle smiled relentingly and sweetly closed his eyes halfdreamily as if to recall his wandering thoughts and began  as the spot selected was nearest the tenement of mr hawkins it was agreed that the parties should meet there they did so promptly at halfpast six the morning being chilly mr hawkins extended the hospitalities of his house with a bottle of bourbon whiskey of which all partook but myself the reason for that exception is i believe well known it is my invariable custom to take brandya wineglassful in a cup of strong coffeeimmediately on rising it stimulates the functions sir without producing any blank derangement of the nerves  the barkeeper to whom as an expert the colonel had graciously imparted this information nodded approvingly and the colonel amid a breathless silence went on  we were about twenty minutes in reaching the spot the ground was measured the weapons were loaded when mr bungstarter confided to me the information that he was unwell and in great pain on consultation with mr hawkins it appeared that his principal in a distant part of the field was also suffering and in great pain the symptoms were such as a medical man would pronounce choleraic i say would have pronounced for on examination the surgeon was also found to beerin pain and i regret to say expressing himself in language unbecoming the occasion his impression was that some powerful drug had been administered on referring the question to mr hawkins he remembered that the bottle of whiskey partaken by them contained a medicine which he had been in the habit of taking but which having failed to act upon him he had concluded to be generally ineffective and had forgotten his perfect willingness to hold himself personally responsible to each of the parties his genuine concern at the disastrous effect of the mistake mingled with his own alarm at the state of his system whicherfailed toerrespond to the peculiar qualities of the medicine was most becoming to him as a man of honor and a gentleman after an hours delay both principals being completely exhausted and abandoned by the surgeon who was unreasonably alarmed at his own condition mr hawkins and i agreed to remove our men to markleville there after a further consultation with mr hawkins an amicable adjustment of all difficulties honorable to both parties and governed by profound secrecy was arranged i believe added the colonel looking around and setting down his glass no gentleman has yet expressed himself other than satisfied with the result  perhaps it was the colonels manner but whatever was the opinion of five forks regarding the intellectual display of mr hawkins in this affair there was very little outspoken criticism at the moment in a few weeks the whole thing was forgotten except as part of the necessary record of hawkinss blunders which was already a pretty full one again some later follies conspired to obliterate the past until a year later a valuable lead was discovered in the blazing star tunnel in the hill where he lived and a large sum was offered him for a portion of his land on the hilltop accustomed as five forks had become to the exhibition of his folly it was with astonishment that they learned that he resolutely and decidedly refused the offer the reason that he gave was still more astoundinghe was about to build  to build a house upon property available for miningpurposes was preposterous to build at all with a roof already covering him was an act of extravagance to build a house of the style he proposed was simply madness  yet here were facts the plans were made and the lumber for the new building was already on the ground while the shaft of the blazing star was being sunk below the site was in reality a very picturesque one the building itself of a style and quality hitherto unknown in five forks the citizens at first sceptical during their moments of recreation and idleness gathered doubtingly about the locality day by day in that climate of rapid growths the building pleasantly known in the slang of five forks as the idiot asylum rose beside the green oaks and clustering firs of hawkins hill as if it were part of the natural phenomena at last it was completed then mr hawkins proceeded to furnish it with an expensiveness and extravagance of outlay quite in keeping with his former idiocy carpets sofas mirrors and finally a pianothe only one known in the county and brought at great expense from sacramentokept curiosity at a feverheat more than that there were articles and ornaments which a few married experts declared only fit for women when the furnishing of the house was completeit had occupied two months of the speculative and curious attention of the campmr hawkins locked the frontdoor put the key in his pocket and quietly retired to his more humble roof lower on the hillside  i have not deemed it necessary to indicate to the intelligent reader all of the theories which obtained in five forks during the erection of the building some of them may be readily imagined that the hag had by artful coyness and systematic reticence at last completely subjugated the fool and that the new house was intended for the nuptial bower of the predestined unhappy pair was of course the prevailing opinion but when after a reasonable time had elapsed and the house still remained untenanted the more exasperating conviction forced itself upon the general mind that the fool had been for the third time imposed upon when two months had elapsed and there seemed no prospect of a mistress for the new housei think public indignation became so strong that had the hag arrived the marriage would have been publicly prevented but no one appeared that seemed to answer to this idea of an available tenant and all inquiry of mr hawkins as to his intention in building a house and not renting it or occupying it failed to elicit any further information the reasons that he gave were felt to be vague evasive and unsatisfactory he was in no hurry to move he said when he was ready it surely was not strange that he should like to have his house all ready to receive him he was often seen upon the veranda of a summer evening smoking a cigar it is reported that one night the house was observed to be brilliantly lighted from garret to basement that a neighbor observing this crept toward the open parlorwindow and looking in espied the fool accurately dressed in evening costume lounging upon a sofa in the drawingroom with the easy air of socially entertaining a large party notwithstanding this the house was unmistakably vacant that evening save for the presence of the owner as the witness afterward testified when this story was first related a few practical men suggested the theory that mr hawkins was simply drilling himself in the elaborate duties of hospitality against a probable event in his history a few ventured the belief that the house was haunted the imaginative editor of the five forks record evolved from the depths of his professional consciousness a story that hawkinss sweetheart had died and that he regularly entertained her spirit in this beautifully furnished mausoleum the occasional spectacle of hawkinss tall figure pacing the veranda on moonlight nights lent some credence to this theory until an unlookedfor incident diverted all speculation into another channel  it was about this time that a certain wild rude valley in the neighborhood of five forks had become famous as a picturesque resort travellers had visited it and declared that there were more cubic yards of rough stone cliff and a waterfall of greater height than any they had visited correspondents had written it up with extravagant rhetoric and inordinate poetical quotation men and women who had never enjoyed a sunset a tree or a flower who had never appreciated the graciousness or meaning of the yellow sunlight that flecked their homely doorways or the tenderness of a midsummers night to whose moonlight they bared their shirtsleeves or their tulle dresses came from thousands of miles away to calculate the height of this rock to observe the depth of this chasm to remark upon the enormous size of this unsightly tree and to believe with ineffable selfcomplacency that they really admired nature and so it came to pass that in accordance with the tastes or weaknesses of the individual the more prominent and salient points of the valley were christened and there was a lace handkerchief fall and the tears of sympathy cataract and one distinguished orators peak and several mounts of various noted people living or dead and an exclamationpoint and a valley of silent adoration and in course of time empty sodawater bottles were found at the base of the cataract and greasy newspapers and fragments of hamsandwiches lay at the dusty roots of giant trees with this there were frequent irruptions of closelyshaven and tightlycravated men and delicate flowerfaced women in the one long street of five forks and a scampering of mules and an occasional procession of dusty brownlinen cavalry  a year after hawkinss idiot asylum was completed one day there drifted into the valley a riotous cavalcade of schoolmarms teachers of the san francisco public schools out for a holiday not severelyspectacled minervas and chastely armed and mailed pallases but i fear for the security of five forks very human charming and mischievous young women at least so the men thought working in the ditches and tunnelling on the hillside and when in the interests of science and the mental advancement of juvenile posterity it was finally settled that they should stay in five forks two or three days for the sake of visiting the various mines and particularly the blazing star tunnel there was some flutter of masculine anxiety there was a considerable inquiry for storeclothes a hopeless overhauling of old and disused raiment and a general demand fox boiled shirts and the barber  meanwhile with that supreme audacity and impudent hardihood of the sex when gregarious the schoolmarms rode through the town admiring openly the handsome faces and manly figures that looked up from the ditches or rose behind the cars of ore at the mouths of tunnels indeed it is alleged that jenny forester backed and supported by seven other equally shameless young women had openly and publicly waved her handkerchief to the florid hercules of five forks one tom flynn formerly of virginia leaving that goodnatured but not overbright giant pulling his blonde mustaches in bashful amazement  it was a pleasant june afternoon that miss milly arnot principal of the primary department of one of the public schools of san francisco having evaded her companions resolved to put into operation a plan which had lately sprung up in her courageous and mischiefloving fancy with that wonderful and mysterious instinct of her sex from whom no secrets of the affections are hid and to whom all hearts are laid open she had heard the story of hawkinss folly and the existence of the idiot asylum alone on hawkins hill she had determined to penetrate its seclusion skirting the underbrush at the foot of the hill she managed to keep the heaviest timber between herself and the blazing star tunnel at its base as well as the cabin of hawkins halfway up the ascent until by a circuitous route at last she reached unobserved the summit before her rose silent darkened and motionless the object of her search here her courage failed her with all the characteristic inconsequence of her sex a sudden fear of all the dangers she had safely passedbears tarantulas drunken men and lizardscame upon her for a moment as she afterward expressed it she thought she should die with this belief probably she gathered three large stones which she could hardly lift for the purpose of throwing a great distance put two hairpins in her mouth and carefully readjusted with both hands two stray braids of her lovely blueblack mane which had fallen in gathering the stones then she felt in the pockets of her linen duster for her cardcase handkerchief pocketbook and smellingbottle and finding them intact suddenly assumed an air of easy ladylike unconcern went up the steps of the veranda and demurely pulled the front doorbell which she knew would not be answered after a decent pause she walked around the encompassing veranda examining the closed shutters of the french windows until she found one that yielded to her touch here she paused again to adjust her coquettish hat by the mirrorlike surface of the long sashwindow that reflected the full length of her pretty figure and then she opened the window and entered the room  although long closed the house had a smell of newness and of fresh paint that was quite unlike the mouldiness of the conventional haunted house the bright carpets the cheerful walls the glistening oilcloths were quite inconsistent with the idea of a ghost with childish curiosity she began to explore the silent house at first timidlyopening the doors with a violent push and then stepping back from the threshold to make good a possible retreatand then more boldly as she became convinced of her security and absolute loneliness in one of the chambersthe largestthere were fresh flowers in a vase evidently gathered that morning and what seemed still more remarkable the pitchers and ewers were freshly filled with water this obliged miss milly to notice another singular fact namely that the house was free from dust the one most obtrusive and penetrating visitor of five forks the floors and carpets had been recently swept the chairs and furniture carefully wiped and dusted if the house was haunted it was possessed by a spirit who had none of the usual indifference to decay and mould and yet the beds had evidently never been slept in the very springs of the chair in which she sat creaked stiffly at the novelty the closetdoors opened with the reluctance of fresh paint and varnish and in spite of the warmth cleanliness and cheerfulness of furniture and decoration there was none of the ease of tenancy and occupation as miss milly afterward confessed she longed to tumble things around and when she reached the parlor or drawingroom again she could hardly resist the desire particularly was she tempted by a closed piano that stood mutely against the wall she thought she would open it just to see who was the maker that done it would be no harm to try its tone she did so with one little foot on the soft pedal but miss milly was too good a player and too enthusiastic a musician to stop at halfmeasures she tried it again this time so sincerely that the whole house seemed to spring into voice then she stopped and listened there was no response the empty rooms seemed to have relapsed into their old stillness she stepped out on the veranda a woodpecker recommenced his tapping on an adjacent tree the rattle of a cart in the rocky gulch below the hill came faintly up no one was to be seen far or near miss milly reassured returned she again ran her fingers over the keys stopped caught at a melody running in her mind half played it and then threw away all caution before five minutes had elapsed she had entirely forgotten herself and with her linen duster thrown aside her straw hat flung on the piano her white hands bared and a black loop of her braided hair hanging upon her shoulder was fairly embarked upon a flowing sea of musical recollection  she had played perhaps half an hour when having just finished an elaborate symphony and resting her hands on the keys she heard very distinctly and unmistakably the sound of applause from without in an instant the fires of shame and indignation leaped into her cheeks and she rose from the instrument and ran to the window only in time to catch sight of a dozen figures in blue and red flannel shirts vanishing hurriedly through the trees below  miss millys mind was instantly made up i think i have already intimated that under the stimulus of excitement she was not wanting in courage and as she quietly resumed her gloves hat and duster she was not perhaps exactly the young person that it would be entirely safe for the timid embarrassed or inexperienced of my sex to meet alone she shut down the piano and having carefully reclosed all the windows and doors and restored the house to its former desolate condition she stepped from the veranda and proceeded directly to the cabin of the unintellectual hawkins that reared its adobe chimney above the umbrage a quarter of a mile below  the door opened instantly to her impulsive knock and the fool of five forks stood before her miss milly had never before seen the man designated by this infelicitous title and as he stepped backward in half courtesy and half astonishment she was for the moment disconcerted he was tall finely formed and darkbearded above cheeks a little hollowed by care and illhealth shone a pair of hazel eyes very large very gentle but inexpressibly sad and mournful this was certainly not the kind of man miss milly had expected to see yet after her first embarrassment had passed the very circumstance oddly enough added to her indignation and stung her wounded pride still more deeply nevertheless the arch hypocrite instantly changed her tactics with the swift intuition of her sex  i have come she said with a dazzling smile infinitely more dangerous than her former dignified severityi have come to ask your pardon for a great liberty i have just taken i believe the new house above us on the hill is yours i was so much pleased with its exterior that i left my friends for a moment below here she continued artfully with a slight wave of the hand as if indicating a band of fearless amazons without and waiting to avenge any possible insult offered to one of their number and ventured to enter it finding it unoccupied as i had been told i am afraid i had the audacity to sit down and amuse myself for a few moments at the piano while waiting for my friends  hawkins raised his beautiful eyes to hers he saw a very pretty girl with frank gray eyes glistening with excitement with two red slightly freckled cheeks glowing a little under his eyes with a short scarlet upperlip turned back like a roseleaf over a little line of white teeth as she breathed somewhat hurriedly in her nervous excitement he saw all this calmly quietly and save for the natural uneasiness of a shy reticent man i fear without a quickening of his pulse  i knowed it he said simply i heerd ye as i kem up  miss milly was furious at his grammar his dialect his coolness and still more at the suspicion that he was an active member of her in visible elaque  ah she said still smiling then i think i heard you  i reckon not he interrupted gravely i didnt stay long i found the boys hanging round the house and i allowed at first id go in and kinder warn you but they promised to keep still and you looked so comfortable and wrapped up in your music that i hadnt the heart to disturb you and kem away i hope he added earnestly they didnt let on ez they heerd you they aint a bad lotthem blazin star boysthough theyre a little hard at times but theyd no more hurt ye then they would aaa cat continued mr hawkins blushing with a faint apprehension of the inelegance of his simile  no no said miss milly feeling suddenly very angry with herself the fool and the entire male population of five forks no i have behaved foolishly i supposeand if they had it would have served me right but i only wanted to apologize to you youll find every thing as you left it goodday  she turned to go mr hawkins began to feel embarrassed id have asked ye to sit down he said finally if it hed been a place fit for a lady i oughter done so enny way i dont know what kept me from it but i aint well miss times i get a sort o dumb agerits the ditches i think missand i dont seem to hev my wits about me  instantly miss arnot was all sympathy her quick womans heart was touched  can ican any thing be done she asked more timidly than she had before spoken  nonot onless ye remember suthin about these pills he exhibited a box containing about half a dozen i forget the directioni dont seem to remember much any way these times theyre joness vegetable compound if yeve ever took em yell remember whether the reglar dose is eight they aint but six here but perhaps ye never tuk any he added deprecatingly  no said miss milly curtly she had usually a keen sense of the ludicrous but somehow mr hawkinss eccentricity only pained her  will you let me see you to the foot of the hill he said again after another embarrassing pause  miss arnot felt instantly that such an act would condone her trespass in the eyes of the world she might meet some of her invisible admirers or even her companions and with all her erratic impulses she was nevertheless a woman and did not entirely despise the verdict of conventionality she smiled sweetly and assented and in another moment the two were lost in the shadows of the wood  like many other apparently trivial acts in an uneventful life it was decisive as she expected she met two or three of her late applauders whom she fancied looked sheepish and embarrassed she met also her companions looking for her in some alarm who really appeared astonished at her escort and she fancied a trifle envious of her evident success i fear that miss arnot in response to their anxious inquiries did not state entirely the truth but without actual assertion led them to believe that she had at a very early stage of the proceeding completely subjugated this weakminded giant and had brought him triumphantly to her feet from telling this story two or three times she got finally to believing that she had some foundation for it then to a vague sort of desire that it would eventually prove to be true and then to an equally vague yearning to hasten that consummation that it would redound to any satisfaction of the fool she did not stop to doubt that it would cure him of his folly she was quite confident indeed there are very few of us men or women who do not believe that even a hopeless love for ourselves is more conducive to the salvation of the lover than a requited affection for another  the criticism of five forks was as the reader may imagine swift and conclusive when it was found out that miss arnot was not the hag masquerading as a young and pretty girl to the ultimate deception of five forks in general and the fool in particular it was at once decided that nothing but the speedy union of the fool and the pretty schoolmarm was consistent with ordinary common sense the singular goodfortune of hawkins was quite in accordance with the theory of his luck as propounded by the camp that after the hag failed to make her appearance he should strike a lead in his own house without the trouble of prospectin seemed to these casuists as a wonderful but inevitable law to add to these fateful probabilities miss arnot fell and sprained her ankle in the ascent of mount lincoln and was confined for some weeks to the hotel after her companions had departed during this period hawkins was civilly but grotesquely attentive when after a reasonable time had elapsed there still appeared to be no immediate prospect of the occupancy of the new house public opinion experienced a singular change in regard to its theories of mr hawkinss conduct the hag was looked upon as a saintlike and longsuffering martyr to the weaknesses and inconsistency of the fool that after erecting this new house at her request he had suddenly gone back on her that his celibacy was the result of a long habit of weak proposal and subsequent shameless rejection and that he was now trying his hand on the helpless schoolmarm was perfectly plain to five forks that he should be frustrated in his attempts at any cost was equally plain miss milly suddenly found herself invested with a rude chivalry that would have been amusing had it not been at times embarrassing that would have been impertinent but for the almost superstitious respect with which it was proffered every day somebody from five forks rode out to inquire the health of the fair patient hez hawkins bin over yer today queried tom flynn with artful ease and indifference as he leaned over miss millys easychair on the veranda miss milly with a faint pink flush on her cheek was constrained to answer no well he sorter sprained his foot agin a rock yesterday continued flynn with shameless untruthfulness you musnt think any thing o that miss arnot hell be over yer tomorrer and meantime he told me to hand this yer bookay with his regards and this yer specimen and mr flynn laid down the flowers he had picked en route against such an emergency and presented respectfully a piece of quartz and gold which he had taken that morning from his own sluicebox you musnt mind hawkinss ways miss milly said another sympathizing miner there aint a better man in camp than that theer cy hawkinsbut he dont understand the ways o the world with wimen he hasnt mixed as much with society as the rest of us he added with an elaborate chesterfieldian ease of manner but he means well meanwhile a few other sympathetic tunnelmen were impressing upon mr hawkins the necessity of the greatest attention to the invalid it wont do hawkins they explained to let that there gal go back to san francisco and say that when she was sick and alone the only man in five forks under whose roof she had rested and at whose table she had sat this was considered a natural but pardonable exaggeration of rhetoric ever threw off on her and it shant be done it aint the square thing to five forks and then the fool would rush away to the valley and be received by miss milly with a certain reserve of manner that finally disappeared in a flush of color some increased vivacity and a pardonable coquetry and so the days passed miss milly grew better in health and more troubled in mind and mr hawkins became more and more embarrassed and five forks smiled and rubbed its hands and waited for the approaching denoument and then it camebut not perhaps in the manner that five forks had imagined  it was a lovely afternoon in july that a party of eastern tourists rode into five forks they had just done the valley of big things and there being one or two eastern capitalists among the party it was deemed advisable that a proper knowledge of the practical miningresources of california should be added to their experience of the merely picturesque in nature thus far every thing had been satisfactory the amount of water which passed over the fall was large owing to a backward season some snow still remained in the canyons near the highest peaks they had ridden round one of the biggest trees and through the prostrate trunk of another to say that they were delighted is to express feebly the enthusiasm of these ladies and gentlemen drunk with the champagny hospitality of their entertainers the utter novelty of scene and the dry exhilarating air of the valley one or two had already expressed themselves ready to live and die there another had written a glowing account to the eastern press depreciating all other scenery in europe and america and under these circumstances it was reasonably expected that five forks would do its duty and equally impress the stranger after its own fashion  letters to this effect were sent from san francisco by prominent capitalists there and under the able superintendence of one of their agents the visitors were taken in hand shown what was to be seen carefully restrained from observing what ought not to be visible and so kept in a blissful and enthusiastic condition and so the graveyard of five forks in which but two of the occupants had died natural deaths the dreary ragged cabins on the hillsides with their sadeyed cynical brokenspirited occupants toiling on day by day for a miserable pittance and a fare that a selfrespecting eastern mechanic would have scornfully rejectedwere not a part of the eastern visitors recollection but the hoisting works and machinery of the blazing star tunnel company wasthe blazing star tunnel company whose gentlemanly superintendent had received private information from san francisco to do the proper thing for the party wherefore the valuable heaps of ore in the companys works were shown the oblong bars of gold ready for shipment were playfully offered to the ladies who could lift and carry them away unaided and even the tunnel itself gloomy fateful and peculiar was shown as part of the experience and in the noble language of one correspondent the wealth of five forks and the peculiar inducements that it offered to eastern capitalists were established beyond a doubt and then occurred a little incident which as an unbiassed spectator i am free to say offered no inducements to anybody whatever but which for its bearing upon the central figure of this veracious chronicle i cannot pass over  it had become apparent to one or two more practical and soberminded in the party that certain portions of the blazing star tunnel owing perhaps to the exigencies of a flattering annual dividend were economically and imperfectly shored and supported and were consequently unsafe insecure and to be avoided nevertheless at a time when champagne corks were popping in dark corners and enthusiastic voices and happy laughter rang through the halflighted levels and galleries there came a sudden and mysterious silence a few lights dashed swiftly by in the direction of a distant part of the gallery and then there was a sudden sharp issuing of orders and a dull ominous rumble some of the visitors turned pale one woman fainted  something had happened what nothing the speaker is fluent but uneasyone of the gentlemen in trying to dislodge a specimen from the wall had knocked away a support there had been a cavethe gentleman was caught and buried below his shoulders it was all right theyd get him out in a momentonly it required great care to keep from extending the cave didnt know his name it was that little man the husband of that lively lady with the black eyes eh hullo there stop her for gods sake not that way shell fall from that shaft shell be killed  but the lively lady was already gone with staring black eyes imploringly trying to pierce the gloom with hands and feet that sought to batter and break down the thick darkness with incoherent cries and supplications following the moving of ignis fatuus lights ahead she ran and ran swiftlyran over treacherous foundations ran by yawning gulfs ran past branching galleries and arches ran wildly ran despairingly ran blindly and at last ran into the arms of the fool of five forks  in an instant she caught at his hand oh save him she cried you belong here you know this dreadful place bring me to him tell me where to go and what to do i implore you quick he is dying come  he raised his eyes to hers and then with a sudden cry dropped the rope and crowbar he was carrying and reeled against the wall  annie he gasped slowly is it you  she caught at both his hands brought her face to his with staring eyes murmured good god cyrus and sank upon her knees before him  he tried to disengage the hand that she wrung with passionate entreaty  no no cyrus you will forgive meyou will forget the past god has sent you here today you will come with me you willyou mustsave him  save who cried cyrus hoarsely  my husband  the blow was so direct so strong and overwhelming that even through her own stronger and more selfish absorption she saw it in the face of the man and pitied him  i thoughtyouknewit she faltered  he did not speak but looked at her with fixed dumb eyes and then the sound of distant voices and hurrying feet started her again into passionate life she once more caught his hand  o cyrus hear me if you have loved me through all these years you will not fail me now you must save him you can you are brave and strongyou always were cyrus you will save him cyrus for my sake for the sake of your love for me you willi know it god bless you  she rose as if to follow him but at a gesture of command she stood still he picked up the rope and crowbar slowly and in a dazed blinded way that in her agony of impatience and alarm seemed protracted to cruel infinity then he turned and raising her hand to his lips kissed it slowly looked at her again and the next moment was gone  he did not return for at the end of the next halfhour when they laid before her the halfconscious breathing body of her husband safe and unharmed but for exhaustion and some slight bruises she learned that the worst fears of the workmen had been realized in releasing him a second cave had taken place they had barely time to snatch away the helpless body of her husband before the strong frame of his rescuer cyrus hawkins was struck and smitten down in his place  for two hours he lay there crushed and brokenlimbed with a heavy beam lying across his breast in sight of all conscious and patient for two hours they had labored around him wildly despairingly hopefully with the wills of gods and the strength of giants and at the end of that time they came to an upright timber which rested its base upon the beam there was a cry for axes and one was already swinging in the air when the dying man called to them feebly  dont cut that upright  why  it will bring down the whole gallery with it  how  its one of the foundations of my house  the axe fell from the workmans hand and with a blanched face he turned to his fellows it was too true they were in the uppermost gallery and the cave had taken place directly below the new house after a pause the fool spoke again more feebly  the ladyquick  they brought hera wretched fainting creature with pallid face and streaming eyesand fell back as she bent her face above him  it was built for you annie darling he said in a hurried whisper and has been waiting up there for you and me all these long days its deeded to you annie and you mustlive therewith him he will not mind that i shall be always near you for it stands abovemy grave  and he was right in a few minutes later when he had passed away they did not move him but sat by his body all night with a torch at his feet and head and the next day they walled up the gallery as a vault but they put no mark or any sign thereon trusting rather to the monument that bright and cheerful rose above him in the sunlight of the hill and those who heard the story said this is not an evidence of death and gloom and sorrow as are other monuments but is a sign of life and light and hope wherefore shall all know that he who lies under it is what men calla fool     baby sylvester   it was at a little miningcamp in the california sierras that he first dawned upon me in all his grotesque sweetness  i had arrived early in the morning but not in time to intercept the friend who was the object of my visit he had gone prospectingso they told me on the riverand would not probably return until late in the afternoon they could not say what direction he had taken they could not suggest that i would be likely to find him if i followed but it was the general opinion that i had better wait  i looked around me i was standing upon the bank of the river and apparently the only other human beings in the world were my interlocutors who were even then just disappearing from my horizon down the steep bank toward the rivers dry bed i approached the edge of the bank  where could i wait  oh anywheredown with them on the riverbar where they were working if i liked or i could make myself at home in any of those cabins that i found lying round loose or perhaps it would be cooler and pleasanter for me in my friends cabin on the hill did i see those three large sugarpines and a little to the right a canvas roof and chimney over the bushes well that was my friendsthat was dick sylvesters cabin i could stake my horse in that little hollow and just hang round there till he came i would find some books in the shanty i could amuse myself with them or i could play with the baby  do what  but they had already gone i leaned over the bank and called after their vanishing figureswhat did you say i could do the answer floated slowly up on the hot sluggish air  plaay with the baby  the lazy echoes took it up and tossed it languidly from hill to hill until bald mountain opposite made some incoherent remark about the baby and then all was still  i must have been mistaken my friend was not a man of family there was not a woman within forty miles of the river camp he never was so passionately devoted to children as to import a luxury so expensive i must have been mistaken  i turned my horses head toward the hill as we slowly climbed the narrow trail the little settlement might have been some exhumed pompeiian suburb so deserted and silent were its habitations the open doors plainly disclosed each rudelyfurnished interiorthe rough pine table with the scant equipage of the morning meal still standing the wooden bunk with its tumbled and dishevelled blankets a golden lizard the very genius of desolate stillness had stopped breathless upon the threshold of one cabin a squirrel peeped impudently into the window of another a woodpecker with the general flavor of undertaking which distinguishes that bird withheld his sepulchral hammer from the coffinlid of the roof on which he was professionally engaged as we passed for a moment i half regretted that i had not accepted the invitation to the riverbed but the next moment a breeze swept up the long dark canyon and the waiting files of the pines beyond bent toward me in salutation i think my horse understood as well as myself that it was the cabins that made the solitude human and therefore unbearable for he quickened his pace and with a gentle trot brought me to the edge of the wood and the three pines that stood like vedettes before the sylvester outpost  unsaddling my horse in the little hollow i unslung the long riata from the saddlebow and tethering him to a young sapling turned toward the cabin but i had gone only a few steps when i heard a quick trot behind me and poor pomposo with every fibre tingling with fear was at my heels i looked hurriedly around the breeze had died away and only an occasional breath from the deepchested woods more like a long sigh than any articulate sound or the dry singing of a cicala in the heated canyon were to be heard i examined the ground carefully for rattlesnakes but in vain yet here was pomposo shivering from his arched neck to his sensitive haunches his very flanks pulsating with terror i soothed him as well as i could and then walked to the edge of the wood and peered into its dark recesses the bright flash of a birds wing or the quick dart of a squirrel was all i saw i confess it was with something of superstitious expectation that i again turned towards the cabin a fairychild attended by titania and her train lying in an expensive cradle would not have surprised me a sleeping beauty whose awakening would have repeopled these solitudes with life and energy i am afraid i began to confidently look for and would have kissed without hesitation  but i found none of these here was the evidence of my friends taste and refinement in the hearth swept scrupulously clean in the picturesque arrangement of the furskins that covered the floor and furniture and the striped serape lying on the wooden couch here were the walls fancifully papered with illustrations from the london news here was the woodcut portrait of mr emerson over the chimney quaintly framed with bluejays wings here were his few favorite books on the swingingshelf and here lying upon the couch the latest copy of punch dear dick the floursack was sometimes empty but the gentle satirist seldom missed his weekly visit  i threw myself on the couch and tried to read but i soon exhausted my interest in my friends library and lay there staring through the open door on the green hillside beyond the breeze again sprang up and a delicious coolness mixed with the rare incense of the woods stole through the cabin the slumbrous droning of bumblebees outside the canvas roof the faint cawing of rooks on the opposite mountain and the fatigue of my morning ride began to droop my eyelids i pulled the serape over me as a precaution against the freshening mountain breeze and in a few moments was asleep  i do not remember how long i slept i must have been conscious however during my slumber of my inability to keep myself covered by the serape for i awoke once or twice clutching it with a despairing hand as it was disappearing over the foot of the couch then i became suddenly aroused to the fact that my efforts to retain it were resisted by some equally persistent force and letting it go i was horrified at seeing it swiftly drawn under the couch at this point i sat up completely awake for immediately after what seemed to be an exaggerated muff began to emerge from under the couch presently it appeared fully dragging the serape after it there was no mistaking it now it was a babybeara mere suckling it was true a helpless roll of fat and fur but unmistakably a grizzly cub  i cannot recall any thing more irresistibly ludicrous than its aspect as it slowly raised its small wondering eyes to mine it was so much taller on its haunches than its shoulders its forelegs were so disproportionately small that in walking its hindfeet invariably took precedence it was perpetually pitching forward over its pointed inoffensive nose and recovering itself always after these involuntary somersaults with the gravest astonishment to add to its preposterous appearance one of its hindfeet was adorned by a shoe of sylvesters into which it had accidentally and inextricably stepped as this somewhat impeded its first impulse to fly it turned to me and then possibly recognizing in the stranger the same species as its master it paused presently it slowly raised itself on its hindlegs and vaguely and deprecatingly waved a babypaw fringed with little hooks of steel i took the paw and shook it gravely from that moment we were friends the little affair of the serape was forgotten  nevertheless i was wise enough to cement our friendship by an act of delicate courtesy following the direction of his eyes i had no difficulty in finding on a shelf near the ridgepole the sugarbox and the square lumps of white sugar that even the poorest miner is never without while he was eating them i had time to examine him more closely his body was a silky dark but exquisitelymodulated gray deepening to black in his paws and muzzle his fur was excessively long thick and soft as eiderdown the cushions of flesh beneath perfectly infantine in their texture and contour he was so very young that the palms of his halfhuman feet were still tender as a babys except for the bright blue steely hooks half sheathed in his little toes there was not a single harsh outline or detail in his plump figure he was as free from angles as one of ledas offspring your caressing hand sank away in his fur with dreamy languor to look at him long was an intoxication of the senses to pat him was a wild delirium to embrace him an utter demoralization of the intellectual faculties  when he had finished the sugar he rolled out of the door with a halfdiffident halfinviting look in his eyes as if he expected me to follow i did so but the sniffing and snorting of the keenscented pomposo in the hollow not only revealed the cause of his former terror but decided me to take another direction after a moments hesitation he concluded to go with me although i am satisfied from a certain impish look in his eye that he fully understood and rather enjoyed the fright of pomposo as he rolled along at my side with a gait not unlike a drunken sailor i discovered that his long hair concealed a leather collar around his neck which bore for its legend the single word baby i recalled the mysterious suggestion of the two miners this then was the baby with whom i was to play  how we played how baby allowed me to roll him down hill crawling and puffing up again each time with perfect goodhumor how he climbed a young sapling after my panama hat which i had shied into one of the topmost branches how after getting it he refused to descend until it suited his pleasure how when he did come down he persisted in walking about on three legs carrying my hat a crushed and shapeless mass clasped to his breast with the remaining one how i missed him at last and finally discovered him seated on a table in one of the tenantless cabins with a bottle of sirup between his paws vainly endeavoring to extract its contentsthese and other details of that eventful day i shall not weary the reader with now enough that when dick sylvester returned i was pretty well fagged out and the baby was rolled up an immense bolster at the foot of the couch asleep sylvesters first words after our greeting were  isnt he delicious  perfectly where did you get him  lying under his dead mother five miles from here said dick lighting his pipe knocked her over at fifty yards perfectly clean shot never moved afterwards baby crawled out scared but unhurt she must have been carrying him in her mouth and dropped him when she faced me for he wasnt more than three days old and not steady on his pins he takes the only milk that comes to the settlement brought up by adams express at seven oclock every morning they say he looks like me do you think so asked dick with perfect gravity stroking his haycolored mustachios and evidently assuming his best expression  i took leave of the baby early the next morning in sylvesters cabin and out of respect to pomposos feelings rode by without any postscript of expression but the night before i had made sylvester solemnly swear that in the event of any separation between himself and baby it should revert to me at the same time he had added its only fair to say that i dont think of dying just yet old fellow and i dont know of any thing else that would part the cub and me  two months after this conversation as i was turning over the mornings mail at my office in san francisco i noticed a letter bearing sylvesters familiar hand but it was postmarked stockton and i opened it with some anxiety at once its contents were as follows   o frankdont you remember what we agreed upon anent the baby well consider me as dead for the next six months or gone where cubs cant follow meeast i know you love the baby but do you think dear boynow really do you think you could be a father to it consider this well you are young thoughtless wellmeaning enough but dare you take upon yourself the functions of guide genius or guardian to one so young and guileless could you be the mentor to this telemachus think of the temptations of a metropolis look at the question well and let me know speedily for ive got him as far as this place and hes kicking up an awful row in the hotelyard and rattling his chain like a maniac let me know by telegraph at once  sylvester  psof course hes grown a little and doesnt take things always as quietly as he did he dropped rather heavily on two of watsons purps last week and snatched old watson himself bald headed for interfering you remember watson for an intelligent man he knows very little of california fauna how are you fixed for bears on montgomery street i mean in regard to corrals and things s  ppshes got some new tricks the boys have been teaching him to put up his hands with them he slings an ugly left s   i am afraid that my desire to possess myself of baby overcame all other considerations and i telegraphed an affirmative at once to sylvester when i reached my lodgings late that afternoon my landlady was awaiting me with a telegram it was two lines from sylvester   all right baby goes down on nightboat be a father to him s   it was due then at one oclock that night for a moment i was staggered at my own precipitation i had as yet made no preparations had said nothing to my landlady about her new guest i expected to arrange every thing in time and now through sylvesters indecent haste that time had been shortened twelve hours  something however must be done at once i turned to mrs brown i had great reliance in her maternal instincts i had that still greater reliance common to our sex in the general tenderheartedness of pretty women but i confess i was alarmed yet with a feeble smile i tried to introduce the subject with classical ease and lightness i even said if shakspeares athenian clown mrs brown believed that a lion among ladies was a dreadful thing what mustbut here i broke down for mrs brown with the awful intuition of her sex i saw at once was more occupied with my manner than my speech so i tried a business brusquerie and placing the telegram in her hand said hurriedly we must do something about this at once its perfectly absurd but he will be here at one tonight beg thousand pardons but business prevented my speaking beforeand paused out of breath and courage  mrs brown read the telegram gravely lifted her pretty eyebrows turned the paper over and looked on the other side and then in a remote and chilling voice asked me if she understood me to say that the mother was coming also  oh dear no i exclaimed with considerable relief the mother is dead you know sylvester that is my friend who sent this shot her when the baby was only three days old but the expression of mrs browns face at this moment was so alarming that i saw that nothing but the fullest explanation would save me hastily and i fear not very coherently i told her all  she relaxed sweetly she said i had frightened her with my talk about lions indeed i think my picture of poor baby albeit a trifle highly colored touched her motherly heart she was even a little vexed at what she called sylvesters hardheartedness still i was not without some apprehension it was two months since i had seen him and sylvesters vague allusion to his slinging an ugly left pained me i looked at sympathetic little mrs brown and the thought of watsons pups covered me with guilty confusion  mrs brown had agreed to sit up with me until he arrived one oclock came but no baby two oclock three oclock passed it was almost four when there was a wild clatter of horses hoofs outside and with a jerk a wagon stopped at the door in an instant i had opened it and confronted a stranger almost at the same moment the horses attempted to run away with the wagon  the strangers appearance was to say the least disconcerting his clothes were badly torn and frayed his linen sack hung from his shoulders like a heralds apron one of his hands was bandaged his face scratched and there was no hat on his dishevelled head to add to the general effect he had evidently sought relief from his woes in drink and he swayed from side to side as he clung to the doorhandle and in a very thick voice stated that he had suthin for me outside when he had finished the horses made another plunge  mrs brown thought they must be frightened at something  frightened laughed the stranger with bitter irony oh no hossish aint frightened ony ran away four timesh comin here oh no nobodys frightened every thins all ri aint it bill he said addressing the driver ony been overboard twish knocked down a hatchway once thash nothin ony two men unner doctors hans at stockton thash nothin six hunner dollarsh cover all dammish  i was too much disheartened to reply but moved toward the wagon the stranger eyed me with an astonishment that almost sobered him  do you reckon to tackle that animile yourself he asked as he surveyed me from head to foot  i did not speak but with an appearance of boldness i was far from feeling walked to the wagon and called baby  all ri cash loose them straps bill and stan clear  the straps were cut loose and baby the remorseless the terrible quietly tumbled to the ground and rolling to my side rubbed his foolish head against me  i think the astonishment of the two men was beyond any vocal expression without a word the drunken stranger got into the wagon and drove away  and baby he had grown it is true a trifle larger but he was thin and bore the marks of evident ill usage his beautiful coat was matted and unkempt and his claws those bright steel hooks had been ruthlessly pared to the quick his eyes were furtive and restless and the old expression of stupid good humor had changed to one of intelligent distrust his intercourse with mankind had evidently quickened his intellect without broadening his moral nature  i had great difficulty in keeping mrs brown from smothering him in blankets and ruining his digestion with the delicacies of her larder but i at last got him completely rolled up in the corner of my room and asleep i lay awake some time later with plans for his future i finally determined to take him to oaklandwhere i had built a little cottage and always spent my sundaysthe very next day and in the midst of a rosy picture of domestic felicity i fell asleep  when i awoke it was broad day my eyes at once sought the corner where baby had been lying but he was gone i sprang from the bed looked under it searched the closet but in vain the door was still locked but there were the marks of his blunted claws upon the sill of the window that i had forgotten to close he had evidently escaped that way but where the window opened upon a balcony to which the only other entrance was through the hall he must be still in the house  my hand was already upon the bellrope but i stayed it in time if he had not made himself known why should i disturb the house i dressed myself hurriedly and slipped into the hall the first object that met my eyes was a boot lying upon the stairs it bore the marks of babys teeth and as i looked along the hall i saw too plainly that the usual array of freshlyblackened boots and shoes before the lodgers doors was not there as i ascended the stairs i found another but with the blacking carefully licked off on the third floor were two or three more boots slightly mouthed but at this point babys taste for blacking had evidently palled a little farther on was a ladder leading to an open scuttle i mounted the ladder and reached the flat roof that formed a continuous level over the row of houses to the corner of the street behind the chimney on the very last roof something was lurking it was the fugitive baby he was covered with dust and dirt and fragments of glass but he was sitting on his hindlegs and was eating an enormous slab of peanut candy with a look of mingled guilt and infinite satisfaction he even i fancied slightly stroked his stomach with his disengaged forepaw as i approached he knew that i was looking for him and the expression of his eye said plainly the past at least is secure  i hurried him with the evidences of his guilt back to the scuttle and descended on tiptoe to the floor beneath providence favored us i met no one on the stairs and his own cushioned tread was inaudible i think he was conscious of the dangers of detection for he even forebore to breathe or much less chew the last mouthful he had taken and he skulked at my side with the sirup dropping from his motionless jaws i think he would have silently choked to death just then for my sake and it was not until i had reached my room again and threw myself panting on the sofa that i saw how near strangulation he had been he gulped once or twice apologetically and then walked to the corner of his own accord and rolled himself up like an immense sugarplum sweating remorse and treacle at every pore  i locked him in when i went to breakfast when i found mrs browns lodgers in a state of intense excitement over certain mysterious events of the night before and the dreadful revelations of the morning it appeared that burglars had entered the block from the scuttles that being suddenly alarmed they had quitted our house without committing any depredation dropping even the boots they had collected in the halls but that a desperate attempt had been made to force the till in the confectioners shop on the corner and that the glass showcases had been ruthlessly smashed a courageous servant in no 4 had seen a masked burglar on his hands and knees attempting to enter their scuttle but on her shouting away wid yees he instantly fled  i sat through this recital with cheeks that burned uncomfortably nor was i the less embarrassed on raising my eyes to meet mrs browns fixed curiously and mischievously on mine as soon as i could make my escape from the table i did so and running rapidly up stairs sought refuge from any possible inquiry in my own room baby was still asleep in the corner it would not be safe to remove him until the lodgers had gone down town and i was revolving in my mind the expediency of keeping him until night veiled his obtrusive eccentricity from the public eye when there came a cautious tap at my door i opened it mrs brown slipped in quietly closed the door softly stood with her back against it and her hand on the knob and beckoned me mysteriously towards her then she asked in a low voice  is hairdye poisonous  i was too confounded to speak  oh do you know what i mean she said impatiently this stuff she produced suddenly from behind her a bottle with a greek label so long as to run two or three times spirally around it from top to bottom he says it isnt a dye its a vegetable preparation for invigorating  who says i asked despairingly  why mr parker of course said mrs brown severely with the air of having repeated the name a great many timesthe old gentleman in the room above the simple question i want to ask she continued with the calm manner of one who has just convicted another of gross ambiguity of language is only this if some of this stuff were put in a saucer and left carelessly on the table and a child or a baby or a cat or any young animal should come in at the window and drink it upa whole saucer fullbecause it had a sweet taste would it be likely to hurt them  i cast an anxious glance at baby sleeping peacefully in the corner and a very grateful one at mrs brown and said i didnt think it would  because said mrs brown loftily as she opened the door i thought if it was poisonous remedies might be used in time because she added suddenly abandoning her lofty manner and wildly rushing to the corner with a frantic embrace of the unconscious baby because if any nasty stuff should turn its booful hair a horrid green or a naughty pink it would break its own muzzers heart it would  but before i could assure mrs brown of the inefficiency of hairdye as an internal application she had darted from the room  that night with the secrecy of defaulters baby and i decamped from mrs browns distrusting the too emotional nature of that noble animal the horse i had recourse to a handcart drawn by a stout irishman to convey my charge to the ferry even then baby refused to go unless i walked by the cart and at times rode in it  i wish said mrs brown as she stood by the door wrapped in an immense shawl and saw us depart i wish it looked less solemnless like a paupers funeral  i must admit that as i walked by the cart that night i felt very much as if i were accompanying the remains of some humble friend to his last restingplace and that when i was obliged to ride in it i never could entirely convince myself that i was not helplessly overcome by liquor or the victim of an accident en route to the hospital but at last we reached the ferry on the boat i think no one discovered baby except a drunken man who approached me to ask for a light for his cigar but who suddenly dropped it and fled in dismay to the gentlemens cabin where his incoherent ravings were luckily taken for the earlier indications of delirium tremens  it was nearly midnight when i reached my little cottage on the outskirts of oakland and it was with a feeling of relief and security that i entered locked the door and turned him loose in the hall satisfied that henceforward his depredations would be limited to my own property he was very quiet that night and after he had tried to mount the hatrack under the mistaken impression that it was intended for his own gymnastic exercise and knocked all the hats off he went peaceably to sleep on the rug  in a week with the exercise afforded him by the run of a large carefullyboarded enclosure he recovered his health strength spirits and much of his former beauty his presence was unknown to my neighbors although it was noticeable that horses invariably shied in passing to the windward of my house and that the baker and milkman had great difficulty in the delivery of their wares in the morning and indulged in unseemly and unnecessary profanity in so doing  at the end of the week i determined to invite a few friends to see the baby and to that purpose wrote a number of formal invitations after descanting at some length on the great expense and danger attending his capture and training i offered a programme of the performance of the infant phenomenon of sierran solitudes drawn up into the highest professional profusion of alliteration and capital letters a few extracts will give the reader some idea of his educational progress   1 he will rolled up in a round ball roll down the woodshed rapidly illustrating his manner of escaping from his enemy in his native wilds  2 he will ascend the wellpole and remove from the very top a hat and as much of the crown and brim thereof as may be permitted  3 he will perform in a pantomime descriptive of the conduct of the big bear the middlesized bear and the little bear of the popular nursery legend  4 he will shake his chain rapidly showing his manner of striking dismay and terror in the breasts of wanderers in ursine wildernesses   the morning of the exhibition came but an hour before the performance the wretched baby was missing the chinese cook could not indicate his whereabouts i searched the premises thoroughly and then in despair took my hat and hurried out into the narrow lane that led toward the open fields and the woods beyond but i found no trace nor track of baby sylvester i returned after an hours fruitless search to find my guests already assembled on the rear veranda i briefly recounted my disappointment my probable loss and begged their assistance  why said a spanish friend who prided himself on his accurate knowledge of english to barker who seemed to be trying vainly to rise from his reclining position on the veranda why do you not disengage yourself from the veranda of our friend and why in the name of heaven do you attach to yourself so much of this thing and make to yourself such unnecessary contortion ah he continued suddenly withdrawing one of his own feet from the veranda with an evident effort i am myself attached surely it is something here  it evidently was my guests were all rising with difficulty the floor of the veranda was covered with some glutinous substance it wassirup  i saw it all in a flash i ran to the barn the keg of golden sirup purchased only the day before lay empty upon the floor there were sticky tracks all over the enclosure but still no baby  theres something moving the ground over there by that pile of dirt said barker  he was right the earth was shaking in one corner of the enclosure like an earthquake i approached cautiously i saw what i had not before noticed that the ground was thrown up and there in the middle of an immense gravelike cavity crouched baby sylvester still digging and slowly but surely sinking from sight in a mass of dust and clay  what were his intentions whether he was stung by remorse and wished to hide himself from my reproachful eyes or whether he was simply trying to dry his sirupbesmeared coat i never shall know for that day alas was his last with me  he was pumped upon for two hours at the end of which time he still yielded a thin treacle he was then taken and carefully inwrapped in blankets and locked up in the storeroom the next morning he was gone the lower portion of the window sash and pane were gone too his successful experiments on the fragile texture of glass at the confectioners on the first day of his entrance to civilization had not been lost upon him his first essay at combining cause and effect ended in his escape  where he went where he hid who captured him if he did not succeed in reaching the foothills beyond oakland even the offer of a large reward backed by the efforts of an intelligent police could not discover i never saw him again from that day until  did i see him i was in a horsecar on sixth avenue a few days ago when the horses suddenly became unmanageable and left the track for the sidewalk amid the oaths and execrations of the driver immediately in front of the car a crowd had gathered around two performing bears and a showman one of the animals thin emaciated and the mere wreck of his native strength attracted my attention i endeavored to attract his he turned a pair of bleared sightless eyes in my direction but there was no sign of recognition i leaned from the carwindow and called softly baby but he did not heed i closed the window the car was just moving on when he suddenly turned and either by accident or design thrust a callous paw through the glass  its worth a dollar and half to put in a new pane said the conductor if folks will play with bears     an episode of fiddletown   in 1858 fiddletown considered her a very pretty woman she had a quantity of light chestnut hair a good figure a dazzling complexion and a certain languid grace which passed easily for gentlewomanliness she always dressed becomingly and in what fiddletown accepted as the latest fashion she had only two blemishes one of her velvety eyes when examined closely had a slight cast and her left cheek bore a small scar left by a single drop of vitriolhappily the only drop of an entire phialthrown upon her by one of her own jealous sex that reached the pretty face it was intended to mar but when the observer had studied the eyes sufficiently to notice this defect he was generally incapacitated for criticism and even the scar on her cheek was thought by some to add piquancy to her smile the youthful editor of the fiddletown avalanche had said privately that it was an exaggerated dimple col starbottle was instantly reminded of the beautifying patches of the days of queen anne but more particularly sir of the blankest beautiful women that blank you you ever laid your two blank eyes upona creole woman sir in new orleans and this woman had a scara line extending blank me from her eye to her blank chin and this woman sir thrilled you sir maddened you sir absolutely sent your blank soul to perdition with her blank fascination and one day i said to her celeste how in blank did you come by that beautiful scar blank you and she said to me star there isnt another white man that id confide in but you but i made that scar myself purposely i did blank me these were her very words sir and perhaps you think it a blank lie sir but ill put up any blank sum you can name and prove it blank me  indeed most of the male population of fiddletown were or had been in love with her of this number about onehalf believed that their love was returned with the exception possibly of her own husband he alone had been known to express scepticism  the name of the gentleman who enjoyed this infelicitous distinction was tretherick he had been divorced from an excellent wife to marry this fiddletown enchantress she also had been divorced but it was hinted that some previous experiences of hers in that legal formality had made it perhaps less novel and probably less sacrificial i would not have it inferred from this that she was deficient in sentiment or devoid of its highest moral expression her intimate friend had written on the occasion of her second divorce the cold world does not understand clara yet and col starbottle had remarked blankly that with the exception of a single woman in opelousas parish la she had more soul than the whole caboodle of them put together few indeed could read those lines entitled infelissimus commencing why waves no cypress oer this brow originally published in the avalanche over the signature of the lady clare without feeling the tear of sensibility tremble on his eyelids or the glow of virtuous indignation mantle his cheek at the low brutality and pitiable jocularity of the dutch flat intelligencer which the next week had suggested the exotic character of the cypress and its entire absence from fiddletown as a reasonable answer to the query  indeed it was this tendency to elaborate her feelings in a metrical manner and deliver them to the cold world through the medium of the newspapers that first attracted the attention of tretherick several poems descriptive of the effects of california scenery upon a too sensitive soul and of the vague yearnings for the infinite which an enforced study of the heartlessness of california society produced in the poetic breast impressed mr tretherick who was then driving a sixmule freightwagon between knights ferry and stockton to seek out the unknown poetess mr tretherick was himself dimly conscious of a certain hidden sentiment in his own nature and it is possible that some reflections on the vanity of his pursuithe supplied several miningcamps with whiskey and tobaccoin conjunction with the dreariness of the dusty plain on which he habitually drove may have touched some chord in sympathy with this sensitive woman howbeit after a brief courtshipas brief as was consistent with some previous legal formalitiesthey were married and mr tretherick brought his blushing bride to fiddletown or fideletown as mrs tretherick preferred to call it in her poems  the union was not a felicitous one it was not long before mr tretherick discovered that the sentiment he had fostered while freighting between stockton and knights ferry was different from that which his wife had evolved from the contemplation of california scenery and her own soul being a man of imperfect logic this caused him to beat her and she being equally faulty in deduction was impelled to a certain degree of unfaithfulness on the same premise then mr tretherick began to drink and mrs tretherick to contribute regularly to the columns of the avalanche it was at this time that col starbottle discovered a similarity in mrs trethericks verse to the genius of sappho and pointed it out to the citizens of fiddletown in a twocolumned criticism signed a s also published in the avalanche and supported by extensive quotation as the avalanche did not possess a font of greek type the editor was obliged to reproduce the leucadian numbers in the ordinary roman letter to the intense disgust of col starbottle and the vast delight of fiddletown who saw fit to accept the text as an excellent imitation of choctawa language with which the colonel as a whilom resident of the indian territories was supposed to be familiar indeed the next weeks intelligencer contained some vile doggerel supposed to be an answer to mrs trethericks poem ostensibly written by the wife of a digger indian chief accompanied by a glowing eulogium signed a s s  the result of this jocularity was briefly given in a later copy of the avalanche an unfortunate rencounter took place on monday last between the hon jackson flash of the dutch flat intelligencer and the wellknown col starbottle of this place in front of the eureka saloon two shots were fired by the parties without injury to either although it is said that a passing chinaman received fifteen buckshot in the calves of his legs from the colonels doublebarrelled shotgun which were not intended for him john will learn to keep out of the way of melican mans firearms hereafter the cause of the affray is not known although it is hinted that there is a lady in the case the rumor that points to a wellknown and beautiful poetess whose lucubrations have often graced our columns seems to gain credence from those that are posted  meanwhile the passiveness displayed by tretherick under these trying circumstances was fully appreciated in the gulches the old mans head is level said one longbooted philosopher ef the colonel kills flash mrs tretherick is avenged if flash drops the colonel tretherick is all right either way hes got a sure thing during this delicate condition of affairs mrs tretherick one day left her husbands home and took refuge at the fiddletown hotel with only the clothes she had on her back here she staid for several weeks during which period it is only justice to say that she bore herself with the strictest propriety  it was a clear morning in early spring that mrs tretherick unattended left the hotel and walked down the narrow street toward the fringe of dark pines which indicated the extreme limits of fiddletown the few loungers at that early hour were preoccupied with the departure of the wingdown coach at the other extremity of the street and mrs tretherick reached the suburbs of the settlement without discomposing observation here she took a cross street or road running at right angles with the main thoroughfare of fiddletown and passing through a belt of woodland it was evidently the exclusive and aristocratic avenue of the town the dwellings were few ambitious and uninterrupted by shops and here she was joined by col starbottle  the gallant colonel notwithstanding that he bore the swelling port which usually distinguished him that his coat was tightly buttoned and his boots tightly fitting and that his cane hooked over his arm swung jauntily was not entirely at his ease mrs tretherick however vouchsafed him a gracious smile and a glance of her dangerous eyes and the colonel with an embarrassed cough and a slight strut took his place at her side  the coast is clear said the colonel and tretherick is over at dutch flat on a spree there is no one in the house but a chinaman and you need fear no trouble from him i he continued with a slight inflation of the chest that imperilled the security of his button i will see that you are protected in the removal of your property  im sure its very kind of you and so disinterested simpered the lady as they walked along its so pleasant to meet some one who has soulsome one to sympathize with in a community so hardened and heartless as this and mrs tretherick cast down her eyes but not until they wrought their perfect and accepted work upon her companion  yes certainly of course said the colonel glancing nervously up and down the streetyes certainly perceiving however that there was no one in sight or hearing he proceeded at once to inform mrs tretherick that the great trouble of his life in fact had been the possession of too much soul that many womenas a gentleman she would excuse him of course from mentioning namesbut many beautiful women had often sought his society but being deficient madam absolutely deficient in this quality he could not reciprocate but when two natures thoroughly in sympathy despising alike the sordid trammels of a low and vulgar community and the conventional restraints of a hypocritical societywhen two souls in perfect accord met and mingled in poetical union thenbut here the colonels speech which had been remarkable for a certain whiskeyandwatery fluency grew husky almost inaudible and decidedly incoherent possibly mrs tretherick may have heard something like it before and was enabled to fill the hiatus nevertheless the cheek that was on the side of the colonel was quite virginal and bashfully conscious until they reached their destination  it was a pretty little cottage quite fresh and warm with paint very pleasantly relieved against a platoon of pines some of whose foremost files had been displaced to give freedom to the fenced enclosure in which it sat in the vivid sunlight and perfect silence it had a new uninhabited look as if the carpenters and painters had just left it at the farther end of the lot a chinaman was stolidly digging but there was no other sign of occupancy the coast as the colonel had said was indeed clear mrs tretherick paused at the gate the colonel would have entered with her but was stopped by a gesture come for me in a couple of hours and i shall have every thing packed she said as she smiled and extended her hand the colonel seized and pressed it with great fervor perhaps the pressure was slightly returned for the gallant colonel was impelled to inflate his chest and trip away as smartly as his stubbytoed highheeled boots would permit when he had gone mrs tretherick opened the door listened a moment in the deserted hall and then ran quickly up stairs to what had been her bedroom  every thing there was unchanged as on the night she left it on the dressingtable stood her bandbox as she remembered to have left it when she took out her bonnet on the mantle lay the other glove she had forgotten in her flight the two lower drawers of the bureau were half open she had forgotten to shut them and on its marble top lay her shawlpin and a soiled cuff what other recollections came upon her i know not but she suddenly grew quite white shivered and listened with a beating heart and her hand upon the door then she stepped to the mirror and half fearfully half curiously parted with her fingers the braids of her blonde hair above her little pink ear until she came upon an ugly halfhealed scar she gazed at this moving her pretty head up and down to get a better light upon it until the slight cast in her velvety eyes became very strongly marked indeed then she turned away with a light reckless foolish laugh and ran to the closet where hung her precious dresses these she inspected nervously and missing suddenly a favorite black silk from its accustomed peg for a moment thought she should have fainted but discovering it the next instant lying upon a trunk where she had thrown it a feeling of thankfulness to a superior being who protects the friendless for the first time sincerely thrilled her then albeit she was hurried for time she could not resist trying the effect of a certain lavender neckribbon upon the dress she was then wearing before the mirror and then suddenly she became aware of a childs voice close beside her and she stopped and then the childs voice repeated is it mamma  mrs tretherick faced quickly about standing in the doorway was a little girl of six or seven her dress had been originally fine but was torn and dirty and her hair which was a very violent red was tumbled seriocomically about her forehead for all this she was a picturesque little thing even through whose childish timidity there was a certain selfsustained air which is apt to come upon children who are left much to themselves she was holding under her arm a rag doll apparently of her own workmanship and nearly as large as herselfa doll with a cylindrical head and features roughly indicated with charcoal a long shawl evidently belonging to a grown person dropped from her shoulders and swept the floor  the spectacle did not excite mrs trethericks delight perhaps she had but a small sense of humor certainly when the child still standing in the doorway again asked is it mamma she answered sharply no it isnt and turned a severe look upon the intruder  the child retreated a step and then gaining courage with the distance said in deliciously imperfect speech  dow way then why dont you dow away  but mrs tretherick was eying the shawl suddenly she whipped it off the childs shoulders and said angrily  how dared you take my things you bad child  is it yours then you are my mamma aint you you are mamma she continued gleefully and before mrs tretherick could avoid her she had dropped her doll and catching the womans skirts with both hands was dancing up and down before her  whats your name child said mrs tretherick coldly removing the small and not very white hands from her garments  tarry  tarry  yeth tarry tarowline  caroline  yeth tarowline tretherick  whose child are you demanded mrs tretherick still more coldly to keep down a rising fear  why yours said the little creature with a laugh im your little durl youre my mamma my new mamma dont you know my ole mammas dorn away never to turn back any more i dont live wid my ol mamma now i live wid you and papa  how long have you been here asked mrs tretherick snappishly  i fink its free days said carry reflectively  you think dont you know sneered mrs tretherick then where did you come from  carrys lip began to work under this sharp crossexamination with a great effort and a small gulp she got the better of it and answered  papa papa fetched mefrom miss simmonsfrom sacramento last week  last week you said three days just now returned mrs tretherick with severe deliberation  i mean a monf said carry now utterly adrift in sheer helplessness and confusion  do you know what you are talking about demanded mrs tretherick shrilly restraining an impulse to shake the little figure before her and precipitate the truth by specific gravity  but the flaming red head here suddenly disappeared in the folds of mrs trethericks dress as if it were trying to extinguish itself forever  there nowstop that sniffling said mrs tretherick extricating her dress from the moist embraces of the child and feeling exceedingly uncomfortable wipe your face now and run away and dont bother stop she continued as carry moved away wheres your papa  hes dorn away too hes sick hes been dornshe hesitatedtwo free days  who takes care of you child said mrs tretherick eying her curiously  john the chinaman i tresses myselth john tooks and makes the beds  well now run away and behave yourself and dont bother me any more said mrs tretherick remembering the object of her visit stopwhere are you going she added as the child began to ascend the stairs dragging the long doll after her by one helpless leg  doin up stairs to play and be dood and no bother mamma  i aint your mamma shouted mrs tretherick and then she swiftly reentered her bedroom and slammed the door  once inside she drew forth a large trunk from the closet and set to work with querulous and fretful haste to pack her wardrobe she tore her best dress in taking it from the hook on which it hung she scratched her soft hands twice with an ambushed pin all the while she kept up an indignant commentary on the events of the past few moments she said to herself she saw it all tretherick had sent for this child of his first wifethis child of whose existence he had never seemed to carejust to insult her to fill her place doubtless the first wife herself would follow soon or perhaps there would be a third red hair not auburn but redof course the child this caroline looked like its mother and if so she was any thing but pretty or the whole thing had been prepared this redhaired child the image of its mother had been kept at a convenient distance at sacramento ready to be sent for when needed she remembered his occasional visits there onbusiness as he said perhaps the mother already was there but no she had gone east nevertheless mrs tretherick in her then state of mind preferred to dwell upon the fact that she might be there she was dimly conscious also of a certain satisfaction in exaggerating her feelings surely no woman had ever been so shamefully abused in fancy she sketched a picture of herself sitting alone and deserted at sunset among the fallen columns of a ruined temple in a melancholy yet graceful attitude while her husband drove rapidly away in a luxurious coachandfour with a redhaired woman at his side sitting upon the trunk she had just packed she partly composed a lugubrious poem describing her sufferings as wandering alone and poorly clad she came upon her husband and another flaunting in silks and diamonds she pictured herself dying of consumption brought on by sorrowa beautiful wreck yet still fascinating gazed upon adoringly by the editor of the avalanche and col starbottle and where was col starbottle all this while why didnt he come he at least understood her heshe laughed the reckless light laugh of a few moments before and then her face suddenly grew grave as it had not a few moments before  what was that little redhaired imp doing all this time why was she so quiet she opened the door noiselessly and listened she fancied that she heard above the multitudinous small noises and creakings and warpings of the vacant house a smaller voice singing on the floor above this as she remembered was only an open attic that had been used as a storeroom with a halfguilty consciousness she crept softly up stairs and pushing the door partly open looked within  athwart the long lowstudded attic a slant sunbeam from a single small window lay filled with dancing motes and only half illuminating the barren dreary apartment in the ray of this sunbeam she saw the childs glowing hair as if crowned by a red aureola as she sat upon the floor with her exaggerated doll between her knees she appeared to be talking to it and it was not long before mrs tretherick observed that she was rehearsing the interview of a halfhour before she catechised the doll severely crossexamining it in regard to the duration of its stay there and generally on the measure of time the imitation of mrs trethericks manner was exceedingly successful and the conversation almost a literal reproduction with a single exception after she had informed the doll that she was not her mother at the close of the interview she added pathetically that if she was dood very dood she might be her mamma and love her very much  i have already hinted that mrs tretherick was deficient in a sense of humor perhaps it was for this reason that this whole scene affected her most unpleasantly and the conclusion sent the blood tingling to her cheek there was something too inconceivably lonely in the situation the unfurnished vacant room the halflights the monstrous doll whose very size seemed to give a pathetic significance to its speechlessness the smallness of the one animate selfcentred figureall these touched more or less deeply the halfpoetic sensibilities of the woman she could not help utilizing the impression as she stood there and thought what a fine poem might be constructed from this material if the room were a little darker the child loneliersay sitting beside a dead mothers bier and the wind wailing in the turrets and then she suddenly heard footsteps at the door below and recognized the tread of the colonels cane  she flew swiftly down the stairs and encountered the colonel in the hall here she poured into his astonished ear a voluble and exaggerated statement of her discovery and indignant recital of her wrongs dont tell me the whole thing wasnt arranged beforehand for i know it was she almost screamed and think she added of the heartlessness of the wretch leaving his own child alone here in that way  its a blank shame stammered the colonel without the least idea of what he was talking about in fact utterly unable as he was to comprehend a reason for the womans excitement with his estimate of her character i fear he showed it more plainly than he intended he stammered expanded his chest looked stern gallant tender but all unintelligently mrs tretherick for an instant experienced a sickening doubt of the existence of natures in perfect affinity  its of no use said mrs tretherick with sudden vehemence in answer to some inaudible remark of the colonels and withdrawing her hand from the fervent grasp of that ardent and sympathetic man its of no use my mind is made up you can send for my trunk as soon as you like but i shall stay here and confront that man with the proof of his vileness i will put him face to face with his infamy  i do not know whether col starbottle thoroughly appreciated the convincing proof of trethericks unfaithfulness and malignity afforded by the damning evidence of the existence of trethericks own child in his own house he was dimly aware however of some unforeseen obstacle to the perfect expression of the infinite longing of his own sentimental nature but before he could say any thing carry appeared on the landing above them looking timidly and yet halfcritically at the pair  thats her said mrs tretherick excitedly in her deepest emotions either in verse or prose she rose above a consideration of grammatical construction  ah said the colonel with a sudden assumption of parental affection and jocularity that was glaringly unreal and affected ah pretty little girl pretty little girl how do you do how are you you find yourself pretty well do you pretty little girl the colonels impulse also was to expand his chest and swing his cane until it occurred to him that this action might be ineffective with a child of six or seven carry however took no immediate notice of this advance but further discomposed the chivalrous colonel by running quickly to mrs tretherick and hiding herself as if for protection in the folds of her gown nevertheless the colonel was not vanquished falling back into an attitude of respectful admiration he pointed out a marvellous resemblance to the madonna and child mrs tretherick simpered but did not dislodge carry as before there was an awkward pause for a moment and then mrs tretherick motioning significantly to the child said in a whisper go now dont come here again but meet me tonight at the hotel she extended her hand the colonel bent over it gallantly and raising his hat the next moment was gone  do you think said mrs tretherick with an embarrassed voice and a prodigious blush looking down and addressing the fiery curls just visible in the folds of her dressdo you think you will be dood if i let you stay in here and sit with me  and let me tall you mamma queried carry looking up  and let you call me mamma assented mrs tretherick with an embarrassed laugh  yeth said carry promptly  they entered the bedroom together carrys eye instantly caught sight of the trunk  are you dowin away adain mamma she said with a quick nervous look and a clutch at the womans dress  noo said mrs tretherick looking out of the window  only playing your dowin away suggested carry with a laugh let me play too  mrs tretherick assented carry flew into the next room and presently reappeared dragging a small trunk into which she gravely proceeded to pack her clothes mrs tretherick noticed that they were not many a question or two regarding them brought out some further replies from the child and before many minutes had elapsed mrs tretherick was in possession of all her earlier history but to do this mrs tretherick had been obliged to take carry upon her lap pending the most confidential disclosures they sat thus a long time after mrs tretherick had apparently ceased to be interested in carrys disclosures and when lost in thought she allowed the child to rattle on unheeded and ran her fingers through the scarlet curls  you dont hold me right mamma said carry at last after one or two uneasy shiftings of position  how should i hold you asked mrs tretherick with a halfamused halfembarrassed laugh  dis way said carry curling up into position with one arm around mrs trethericks neck and her cheek resting on her bosomdis waydere after a little preparatory nestling not unlike some small animal she closed her eyes and went to sleep  for a few moments the woman sat silent scarcely daring to breathe in that artificial attitude and then whether from some occult sympathy in the touch or god best knows what a sudden fancy began to thrill her she began by remembering an old pain that she had forgotten an old horror that she had resolutely put away all these years she recalled days of sickness and distrustdays of an overshadowing feardays of preparation for something that was to be prevented that was prevented with mortal agony and fear she thought of a life that might have beenshe dared not say had beenand wondered it was six years ago if it had lived it would have been as old as carry the arms which were folded loosely around the sleeping child began to tremble and tighten their clasp and then the deep potential impulse came and with a halfsob halfsigh she threw her arms out and drew the body of the sleeping child down down into her breast down again and again as if she would hide it in the grave dug there years before and the gust that shook her passed and then ah me the rain  a drop or two fell upon the curls of carry and she moved uneasily in her sleep but the woman soothed her againit was so easy to do it nowand they sat there quiet and undisturbed so quiet that they might have seemed incorporate of the lonely silent house the slowlydeclining sunbeams and the general air of desertion and abandonment yet a desertion that had in it nothing of age decay or despair   col starbottle waited at the fiddletown hotel all that night in vain and the next morning when mr tretherick returned to his husks he found the house vacant and untenanted except by motes and sunbeams  when it was fairly known that mrs tretherick had run away taking mr trethericks own child with her there was some excitement and much diversity of opinion in fiddletown the dutch flat intelligencer openly alluded to the forcible abduction of the child with the same freedom and it is to be feared the same prejudice with which it had criticised the abductors poetry all of mrs trethericks own sex and perhaps a few of the opposite sex whose distinctive quality was not however very strongly indicated fully coincided in the views of the intelligencer the majority however evaded the moral issue that mrs tretherick had shaken the red dust of fiddletown from her dainty slippers was enough for them to know they mourned the loss of the fair abductor more than her offence they promptly rejected tretherick as an injured husband and disconsolate father and even went so far as to openly cast discredit on the sincerity of his grief they reserved an ironical condolence for col starbottle overbearing that excellent man with untimely and demonstrative sympathy in barrooms saloons and other localities not generally deemed favorable to the display of sentiment she was alliz a skittish thing kernel said one sympathizer with a fine affectation of gloomy concern and great readiness of illustration and its kinder natril thet shed get away some day and stampede that theer colt but thet she should shake you kernel thet she should just shake youis what gits me and they do say thet you jist hung around thet hotel all night and payrolled them corriders and histed yourself up and down them stairs and meandered in and out o thet piazzy and all for nothing it was another generous and tenderly commiserating spirit that poured additional oil and wine on the colonels wounds the boys yer let on thet mrs tretherick prevailed on ye to pack her trunk and a baby over from the house to the stageoffis and that the chap ez did go off with her thanked you and offered you two short bits and sed ez how he liked your looks and ud employ you aginand now you say it aint so well ill tell the boys it aint so and im glad i met you for stories do get round  happily for mrs trethericks reputation however the chinaman in trethericks employment who was the only eyewitness of her flight stated that she was unaccompanied except by the child he further deposed that obeying her orders he had stopped the sacramento coach and secured a passage for herself and child to san francisco it was true that ah fes testimony was of no legal value but nobody doubted it even those who were sceptical of the pagans ability to recognize the sacredness of the truth admitted his passionless unprejudiced unconcern but it would appear from a hitherto unrecorded passage of this veracious chronicle that herein they were mistaken  it was about six months after the disappearance of mrs tretherick that ah fe while working in trethericks lot was hailed by two passing chinamen they were the ordinary mining coolies equipped with long poles and baskets for their usual pilgrimages an animated conversation at once ensued between ah fe and his brother mongoliansa conversation characterized by that usual shrill volubility and apparent animosity which was at once the delight and scorn of the intelligent caucasian who did not understand a word of it such at least was the feeling with which mr tretherick on his veranda and col starbottle who was passing regarded their heathenish jargon the gallant colonel simply kicked them out of his way the irate tretherick with an oath threw a stone at the group and dispersed them but not before one or two slips of yellow ricepaper marked with hieroglyphics were exchanged and a small parcel put into ah fes hands when ah fe opened this in the dim solitude of his kitchen he found a little girls apron freshly washed ironed and folded on the corner of the hem were the initials c t ah fe tucked it away in a corner of his blouse and proceeded to wash his dishes in the sink with a smile of guileless satisfaction  two days after this ah fe confronted his master me no likee fiddletown me belly sick me go now mr tretherick violently suggested a profane locality ah fe gazed at him placidly and withdrew  before leaving fiddletown however he accidentally met col starbottle and dropped a few incoherent phrases which apparently interested that gentleman when he concluded the colonel handed him a letter and a twentydollar goldpiece if you bring me an answer ill double thatsabe john ah fe nodded an interview equally accidental with precisely the same result took place between ah fe and another gentleman whom i suspect to have been the youthful editor of the avalanche yet i regret to state that after proceeding some distance on his journey ah fe calmly broke the seals of both letters and after trying to read them upside down and sideways finally divided them into accurate squares and in this condition disposed of them to a brother celestial whom he met on the road for a trifling gratuity the agony of col starbottle on finding his washbill made out on the unwritten side of one of these squares and delivered to him with his weekly clean clothes and the subsequent discovery that the remaining portions of his letter were circulated by the same method from the chinese laundry of one fung ti of fiddletown has been described to me as peculiarly affecting yet i am satisfied that a higher nature rising above the levity induced by the mere contemplation of the insignificant details of this breach of trust would find ample retributive justice in the difficulties that subsequently attended ah fes pilgrimage  on the road to sacramento he was twice playfully thrown from the top of the stagecoach by an intelligent but deeplyintoxicated caucasian whose moral nature was shocked at riding with one addicted to opiumsmoking at hangtown he was beaten by a passing strangerpurely an act of christian supererogation at dutch flat he was robbed by wellknown hands from unknown motives at sacramento he was arrested on suspicion of being something or other and discharged with a severe reprimandpossibly for not being it and so delaying the course of justice at san francisco he was freely stoned by children of the public schools but by carefully avoiding these monuments of enlightened progress he at last reached in comparative safety the chinese quarters where his abuse was confined to the police and limited by the strong arm of the law  the next day he entered the washhouse of chy fook as an assistant and on the following friday was sent with a basket of clean clothes to chy fooks several clients  it was the usual foggy afternoon as he climbed the long windswept hill of california streetone of those bleak gray intervals that made the summer a misnomer to any but the liveliest san franciscan fancy there was no warmth or color in earth or sky no light nor shade within or without only one monotonous universal neutral tint over every thing there was a fierce unrest in the windwhipped streets there was a dreary vacant quiet in the gray houses when ah fe reached the top of the hill the mission ridge was already hidden and the chill seabreeze made him shiver as he put down his basket to rest himself it is possible that to his defective intelligence and heathen experience this gods own climate as it was called seemed to possess but scant tenderness softness or mercy but it is possible that ah fe illogically confounded this season with his old persecutors the schoolchildren who being released from studious confinement at this hour were generally most aggressive so he hastened on and turning a corner at last stopped before a small house  it was the usual san franciscan urban cottage there was the little strip of cold green shrubbery before it the chilly bare veranda and above this again the grim balcony on which no one sat ah fe rang the bell a servant appeared glanced at his basket and reluctantly admitted him as if he were some necessary domestic animal ah fe silently mounted the stairs and entering the open door of the frontchamber put down the basket and stood passively on the threshold  a woman who was sitting in the cold gray light of the window with a child in her lap rose listlessly and came toward him ah fe instantly recognized mrs tretherick but not a muscle of his immobile face changed nor did his slant eyes lighten as he met her own placidly she evidently did not recognize him as she began to count the clothes but the child curiously examining him suddenly uttered a short glad cry  why its john mamma its our old john what we had in fiddletown  for an instant ah fes eyes and teeth electrically lightened the child clapped her hands and caught at his blouse then he said shortly me johnah feallee same me know you how do  mrs tretherick dropped the clothes nervously and looked hard at ah fe wanting the quickwitted instinct of affection that sharpened carrys perception she even then could not distinguish him above his fellows with a recollection of past pain and an obscure suspicion of impending danger she asked him when he had left fiddletown  longee time no likee fiddletown no likee tlevelick likee san flisco likee washee likee tally  ah fes laconics pleased mrs tretherick she did not stop to consider how much an imperfect knowledge of english added to his curt directness and sincerity but she said dont tell anybody you have seen me and took out her pocketbook  ah fe without looking at it saw that it was nearly empty ah fe without examining the apartment saw that it was scantily furnished ah fe without removing his eyes from blank vacancy saw that both mrs tretherick and carry were poorly dressed yet it is my duty to state that ah fes long fingers closed promptly and firmly over the halfdollar which mrs tretherick extended to him  then he began to fumble in his blouse with a series of extraordinary contortions after a few moments he extracted from apparently no particular place a childs apron which he laid upon the basket with the remark  one piecee washman flagittee  then he began anew his fumblings and contortions at last his efforts were rewarded by his producing apparently from his right ear a manyfolded piece of tissuepaper unwrapping this carefully he at last disclosed two twentydollar goldpieces which he handed to mrs tretherick  you leavee money topside of blulow fiddletown me findee money me fetchee money to you all lightee  but i left no money on the top of the bureau john said mrs tretherick earnestly there must be some mistake it belongs to some other person take it back john  ah fes brow darkened he drew away from mrs trethericks extended hand and began hastily to gather up his basket  me no takee it back no no bimeby pleesman he catchee me he say god damn thiefcatchee flowty dollar come to jailee me no takee back you leavee money topside blulow fiddletown me fetchee money you me no takee back  mrs tretherick hesitated in the confusion of her flight she might have left the money in the manner he had said in any event she had no right to jeopardize this honest chinamans safety by refusing it so she said very well john i will keep it but you must come again and see mehere mrs tretherick hesitated with a new and sudden revelation of the fact that any man could wish to see any other than herselfand andcarry  ah fes face lightened he even uttered a short ventriloquistic laugh without moving his mouth then shouldering his basket he shut the door carefully and slid quietly down stairs in the lower hall he however found an unexpected difficulty in opening the frontdoor and after fumbling vainly at the lock for a moment looked around for some help or instruction but the irish handmaid who had let him in was contemptuously oblivious of his needs and did not appear  there occurred a mysterious and painful incident which i shall simply record without attempting to explain on the halltable a scarf evidently the property of the servant before alluded to was lying as ah fe tried the lock with one hand the other rested lightly on the table suddenly and apparently of its own volition the scarf began to creep slowly towards ah fes hand from ah fes hand it began to creep up his sleeve slowly and with an insinuating snakelike motion and then disappeared somewhere in the recesses of his blouse without betraying the least interest or concern in this phenomenon ah fe still repeated his experiments upon the lock a moment later the tablecloth of red damask moved by apparently the same mysterious impulse slowly gathered itself under ah fes fingers and sinuously disappeared by the same hidden channel what further mystery might have followed i cannot say for at this moment ah fe discovered the secret of the lock and was enabled to open the door coincident with the sound of footsteps upon the kitchenstairs ah fe did not hasten his movements but patiently shouldering his basket closed the door carefully behind him again and stepped forth into the thick encompassing fog that now shrouded earth and sky  from her high casementwindow mrs tretherick watched ah fes figure until it disappeared in the gray cloud in her present loneliness she felt a keen sense of gratitude toward him and may have ascribed to the higher emotions and the consciousness of a good deed that certain expansiveness of the chest and swelling of the bosom that was really due to the hidden presence of the scarf and tablecloth under his blouse for mrs tretherick was still poetically sensitive as the gray fog deepened into night she drew carry closer towards her and above the prattle of the child pursued a vein of sentimental and egotistic recollection at once bitter and dangerous the sudden apparition of ah fe linked her again with her past life at fiddletown over the dreary interval between she was now wanderinga journey so piteous wilful thorny and useless that it was no wonder that at last carry stopped suddenly in the midst of her voluble confidences to throw her small arms around the womans neck and bid her not to cry  heaven forefend that i should use a pen that should be ever dedicated to an exposition of unalterable moral principle to transcribe mrs trethericks own theory of this interval and episode with its feeble palliations its illogical deductions its fond excuses and weak apologies it would seem however that her experience had been hard her slender stock of money was soon exhausted at sacramento she found that the composition of verse although appealing to the highest emotions of the human heart and compelling the editorial breast to the noblest commendation in the editorial pages was singularly inadequate to defray the expenses of herself and carry then she tried the stage but failed signally possibly her conception of the passions was different from that which obtained with a sacramento audience but it was certain that her charming presence so effective at short range was not sufficiently pronounced for the footlights she had admirers enough in the greenroom but awakened no abiding affection among the audience in this strait it occurred to her that she had a voicea contralto of no very great compass or cultivation but singularly sweet and touching and she finally obtained position in a churchchoir she held it for three months greatly to her pecuniary advantage and it is said much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen in the backpews who faced toward her during the singing of the last hymn  i remember her quite distinctly at this time the light that slanted through the oriel of st dives choir was wont to fall very tenderly on her beautiful head with its stacked masses of deerskincolored hair on the low black arches of her brows and to deepen the pretty fringes that shaded her eyes of genoa velvet very pleasant it was to watch the opening and shutting of that small straight mouth with its quick revelation of little white teeth and to see the foolish blood faintly deepen her satin cheek as you watched for mrs tretherick was very sweetly conscious of admiration and like most pretty women gathered herself under your eye like a racer under the spur  and then of course there came trouble i have it from the sopranoa little lady who possessed even more than the usual unprejudiced judgment of her sexthat mrs trethericks conduct was simply shameful that her conceit was unbearable that if she considered the rest of the choir as slaves she the soprano would like to know it that her conduct on easter sunday with the basso had attracted the attention of the whole congregation and that she herself had noticed dr cope twice look up during the service that her the sopranos friends had objected to her singing in the choir with a person who had been on the stage but she had waived this yet she had it from the best authority that mrs tretherick had run away from her husband and that this redhaired child who sometimes came in the choir was not her own the tenor confided to me behind the organ that mrs tretherick had a way of sustaining a note at the end of a line in order that her voice might linger longer with the congregationan act that could be attributed only to a defective moral nature that as a man he was a very popular drygoods clerk on weekdays and sang a good deal from apparently behind his eyebrows on the sabbaththat as a man sir he would put up with it no longer the basso alonea short german with a heavy voice for which he seemed reluctantly responsible and rather grieved at its possessionstood up for mrs tretherick and averred that they were jealous of her because she was bretty the climax was at last reached in an open quarrel wherein mrs tretherick used her tongue with such precision of statement and epithet that the soprano burst into hysterical tears and had to be supported from the choir by her husband and the tenor this act was marked intentionally to the congregation by the omission of the usual soprano solo mrs tretherick went home flushed with triumph but on reaching her room frantically told carry that they were beggars henceforward that sheher motherhad just taken the very bread out of her darlings mouth and ended by bursting into a flood of penitent tears they did not come so quickly as in her old poetical days but when they came they stung deeply she was roused by a formal visit from a vestrymanone of the music committee mrs tretherick dried her long lashes put on a new neckribbon and went down to the parlor she staid there two hoursa fact that might have occasioned some remark but that the vestryman was married and had a family of grownup daughters when mrs tretherick returned to her room she sang to herself in the glass and scolded carrybut she retained her place in the choir  it was not long however in due course of time her enemies received a powerful addition to their forces in the committeemans wife that lady called upon several of the churchmembers and on dr copes family the result was that at a later meeting of the music committee mrs trethericks voice was declared inadequate to the size of the building and she was invited to resign she did so she had been out of a situation for two months and her scant means were almost exhausted when ah fes unexpected treasure was tossed into her lap  the gray fog deepened into night and the streetlamps started into shivering life as absorbed in these unprofitable memories mrs tretherick still sat drearily at her window even carry had slipped away unnoticed and her abrupt entrance with the damp evening paper in her hand roused mrs tretherick and brought her back to an active realization of the present for mrs tretherick was wont to scan the advertisements in the faint hope of finding some avenue of employmentshe knew not whatopen to her needs and carry had noted this habit  mrs tretherick mechanically closed the shutters lit the lights and opened the paper her eye fell instinctively on the following paragraph in the telegraphic column   fiddletown 7thmr james tretherick an old resident of this place died last night of delirium tremens mr tretherick was addicted to intemperate habits said to have been induced by domestic trouble   mrs tretherick did not start she quietly turned over another page of the paper and glanced at carry the child was absorbed in a book mrs tretherick uttered no word but during the remainder of the evening was unusually silent and cold when carry was undressed and in bed mrs tretherick suddenly dropped on her knees beside the bed and taking carrys flaming head between her hands said  should you like to have another papa carry darling  no said carry after a moments thought  but a papa to help mamma take care of you to love you to give you nice clothes to make a lady of you when you grow up  carry turned her sleepy eyes toward the questioner should you mamma  mrs tretherick suddenly flushed to the roots of her hair go to sleep she said sharply and turned away  but at midnight the child felt two white arms close tightly around her and was drawn down into a bosom that heaved fluttered and at last was broken up by sobs  dont ky mamma whispered carry with a vague retrospect of their recent conversation dont ky i fink i should like a new papa if he loved you very muchvery very much  a month afterward to everybodys astonishment mrs tretherick was married the happy bridegroom was one col starbottle recently elected to represent calaveras county in the legislative councils of the state as i cannot record the event in finer language than that used by the correspondent of the sacramento globe i venture to quote some of his graceful periods the relentless shafts of the sly god have been lately busy among our gallant solons we quote one more unfortunate the latest victim is the hon c starbottle of calaveras the fair enchantress in the case is a beautiful widow a former votary of thespis and lately a fascinating st cecilia of one of the most fashionable churches of san francisco where she commanded a high salary  the dutch flat intelligencer saw fit however to comment upon the fact with that humorous freedom characteristic of an unfettered press the new democratic warhorse from calaveras has lately advented in the legislature with a little bill to change the name of tretherick to starbottle they call it a marriagecertificate down there mr tretherick has been dead just one month but we presume the gallant colonel is not afraid of ghosts it is but just to mrs tretherick to state that the colonels victory was by no means an easy one to a natural degree of coyness on the part of the lady was added the impediment of a rivala prosperous undertaker from sacramento who had first seen and loved mrs tretherick at the theatre and church his professional habits debarring him from ordinary social intercourse and indeed any other than the most formal public contact with the sex as this gentleman had made a snug fortune during the felicitous prevalence of a severe epidemic the colonel regarded him as a dangerous rival fortunately however the undertaker was called in professionally to lay out a brothersenator who had unhappily fallen by the colonels pistol in an affair of honor and either deterred by physical consideration from rivalry or wisely concluding that the colonel was professionally valuable he withdrew from the field  the honeymoon was brief and brought to a close by an untoward incident during their bridaltrip carry had been placed in the charge of col starbottles sister on their return to the city immediately on reaching their lodgings mrs starbottle announced her intention of at once proceeding to mrs culpeppers to bring the child home col starbottle who had been exhibiting for some time a certain uneasiness which he had endeavored to overcome by repeated stimulation finally buttoned his coat tightly across his breast and after walking unsteadily once or twice up and down the room suddenly faced his wife with his most imposing manner  i have deferred said the colonel with an exaggeration of port that increased with his inward fear and a growing thickness of speechi have deferri may say poshponed statement o fack thash my duty ter dishclose ter ye i did no wish to mar sushine mushal happness to bligh bud o promise to

you she cried bringing out a chest note that made the chandeliers ringyou that i married to give my darling food and clothesyou a dog that i whistled to my side to keep the men off meyou  she choked up and then dashed past him into the inner room which had been carrys then she swept by him again into her own bedroom and then suddenly reappeared before him erect menacing with a burning fire over her cheekbones a quick straightening of her arched brows and mouth a squaring of jaw and ophidian flattening of the head  listen she said in a hoarse halfgrown boys voice hear me if you ever expect to set eyes on me again you must find the child if you ever expect to speak to me again to touch me you must bring her back for where she goes i go you hear me where she has gone look for me  she struck out past him again with a quick feminine throwingout of her arms from the elbows down as if freeing herself from some imaginary bonds and dashing into her chamber slammed and locked the door col starbottle although no coward stood in superstitious fear of an angry woman and recoiling as she swept by lost his unsteady foothold and rolled helplessly on the sofa here after one or two unsuccessful attempts to regain his foothold he remained uttering from time to time profane but not entirely coherent or intelligible protests until at last he succumbed to the exhausting quality of his emotions and the narcotic quantity of his potations  meantime within mrs starbottle was excitedly gathering her valuables and packing her trunk even as she had done once before in the course of this remarkable history perhaps some recollection of this was in her mind for she stopped to lean her burning cheeks upon her hand as if she saw again the figure of the child standing in the doorway and heard once more a childish voice asking is it mamma but the epithet now stung her to the quick and with a quick passionate gesture she dashed it away with a tear that had gathered in her eye and then it chanced that in turning over some clothes she came upon the childs slipper with a broken sandalstring she uttered a great cry herethe first she had utteredand caught it to her breast kissing it passionately again and again and rocking from side to side with a motion peculiar to her sex and then she took it to the window the better to see it through her now streaming eyes here she was taken with a sudden fit of coughing that she could not stifle with the handkerchief she put to her feverish lips and then she suddenly grew very faint the window seemed to recede before her the floor to sink beneath her feet and staggering to the bed she fell prone upon it with the sandal and handkerchief pressed to her breast her face was quite pale the orbit of her eyes dark and there was a spot upon her lip another on her handkerchief and still another on the white counterpane of the bed  the wind had risen rattling the windowsashes and swaying the white curtains in a ghostly way later a gray fog stole softly over the roofs soothing the windroughened surfaces and inwrapping all things in an uncertain light and a measureless peace she lay there very quietfor all her troubles still a very pretty bride and on the other side of the bolted door the gallant bridegroom from his temporary couch snored peacefully   a week before christmas day 1870 the little town of genoa in the state of new york exhibited perhaps more strongly than at any other time the bitter irony of its founders and sponsors a driving snowstorm that had whitened every windward hedge bush wall and telegraphpole played around this soft italian capitol whirled in and out of the great staring wooden doric columns of its postoffice and hotel beat upon the cold green shutters of its best houses and powdered the angular stiff dark figures in its streets from the level of the street the four principal churches of the town stood out starkly even while their misshapen spires were kindly hidden in the low driving storm near the railroadstation the new methodist chapel whose resemblance to an enormous locomotive was further heightened by the addition of a pyramidal row of frontsteps like a cowcatcher stood as if waiting for a few more houses to be hitched on to proceed to a pleasanter location but the pride of genoathe great crammer institute for young ladiesstretched its bare brick length and reared its cupola plainly from the bleak parnassian hill above the principal avenue there was no evasion in the crammer institute of the fact that it was a public institution a visitor upon its doorsteps a pretty face at its window were clearly visible all over the township  the shriek of the engine of the fouroclock northern express brought but few of the usual loungers to the depot only a single passenger alighted and was driven away in the solitary waiting sleigh toward the genoa hotel and then the train sped away again with that passionless indifference to human sympathies or curiosity peculiar to expresstrains the one baggagetruck was wheeled into the station again the stationdoor was locked and the stationmaster went home  the locomotivewhistle however awakened the guilty consciousness of three young ladies of the crammer institute who were even then surreptitiously regaling themselves in the bakeshop and confectionerysaloon of mistress phillips in a bylane for even the admirable regulations of the institute failed to entirely develop the physical and moral natures of its pupils they conformed to the excellent dietary rules in public and in private drew upon the luxurious rations of their village caterer they attended church with exemplary formality and flirted informally during service with the village beaux they received the best and most judicious instruction during schoolhours and devoured the trashiest novels during recess the result of which was an aggregation of quite healthy quite human and very charming young creatures that reflected infinite credit on the institute even mistress phillips to whom they owed vast sums exhilarated by the exuberant spirits and youthful freshness of her guests declared that the sight of them young things did her good and had even been known to shield them by shameless equivocation  four oclock girls and if were not back to prayers by five well be missed said the tallest of these foolish virgins with an aquiline nose and certain quiet elan that bespoke the leader as she rose from her seat have you got the books addy addy displayed three dissipatedlooking novels under her waterproof and the provisions carry carry showed a suspicious parcel filling the pocket of her sack all right then come girls trudgecharge it she added nodding to her host as they passed toward the door ill pay you when my quarters allowance comes  no kate interposed carry producing her purse let me pay its my turn  never said kate arching her black brows loftily even if you do have rich relatives and regular remittances from california nevercome girls forward march  as they opened the door a gust of wind nearly took them off their feet kindhearted mrs phillips was alarmed sakes alive galls ye mussnt go out in sich weather better let me send word to the institoot and make ye up a nice bed tonight in my parlor but the last sentence was lost in a chorus of halfsuppressed shrieks as the girls hand in hand ran down the steps into the storm and were at once whirled away  the short december day unlit by any sunset glow was failing fast it was quite dark already and the air was thick with driving snow for some distance their high spirits youth and even inexperience kept them bravely up but in ambitiously attempting a shortcut from the highroad across an open field their strength gave out the laugh grew less frequent and tears began to stand in carrys brown eyes when they reached the road again they were utterly exhausted let us go back said carry  wed never get across that field again said addy  lets stop at the first house then said carry  the first house said addy peering through the gathering darkness is squire robinsons she darted a mischievous glance at carry that even in her discomfort and fear brought the quick blood to her cheek  oh yes said kate with gloomy irony certainly stop at the squires by all means and be invited to tea and be driven home after tea by your dear friend mr harry with a formal apology from mrs robinson and hopes that the young ladies may be excused this time no continued kate with sudden energy that may suit you but im going back as i cameby the window or not at all then she pounced suddenly like a hawk on carry who was betraying a tendency to sit down on a snowbank and whimper and shook her briskly youll be going to sleep next stay hold your tongues all of youwhats that  it was the sound of sleighbells coming down toward them out of the darkness was a sleigh with a single occupant hold down your heads girls if its anybody that knows us were lost but it was not for a voice strange to their ears but withal very kindly and pleasant asked if its owner could be of any help to them as they turned toward him they saw it was a man wrapped in a handsome sealskin cloak wearing a sealskin cap his face half concealed by a muffler of the same material disclosing only a pair of long mustaches and two keen dark eyes its a son of old santa claus whispered addy the girls tittered audibly as they tumbled into the sleigh they had regained their former spirits where shall i take you said the stranger quietly there was a hurried whispering and then kate said boldly to the institute they drove silently up the hill until the long ascetic building loomed up before them the stranger reined up suddenly you know the way better than i he said where do you go inthrough the backwindow said kate with sudden and appalling frankness i see responded their strange driver quietly and alighting quickly removed the bells from the horses we can drive as near as you please now he added by way of explanation he certainly is a son of santa claus whispered addy hadnt we better ask after his father hush said kate decidedly he is an angel i dare say she added with a delicious irrelevance which was however perfectly understood by her feminine auditors we are looking like three frights  cautiously skirting the fences they at last pulled up a few feet from a dark wall the stranger proceeded to assist them to alight there was still some light from the reflected snow and as he handed his fair companions to the ground each was conscious of undergoing an intense though respectful scrutiny he assisted them gravely to open the window and then discreetly retired to the sleigh until the difficult and somewhat discomposing ingress was made he then walked to the window thank you and goodnight whispered three voices a single figure still lingered the stranger leaned over the windowsill will you permit me to light my cigar here it might attract attention if i struck a match outside by the upspringing light he saw the figure of kate very charmingly framed in by the window the match burnt slowly out in his fingers kate smiled mischievously the astute young woman had detected the pitiable subterfuge for what else did she stand at the head of her class and had doting parents paid three years tuition  the storm had passed and the sun was shining quite cheerily in the eastern recitationroom the next morning when miss kate whose seat was nearest the window placing her hand pathetically upon her heart affected to fall in bashful and extreme agitation upon the shoulder of carry her neighbor he has come she gasped in a thrilling whisper who asked carry sympathetically who never clearly under stood when kate was in earnest whowhy the man who rescued us last night i saw him drive to the door this moment dont speak i shall be better in a momentthere she said and the shameless hypocrite passed her hand pathetically across her forehead with a tragic air  what can he want asked carry whose curiosity was excited  i dont know said kate suddenly relapsing into gloomy cynicism possibly to put his five daughters to school perhaps to finish his young wife and warn her against us  he didnt look old and he didnt seem like a married man rejoined addy thoughtfully  that was his art you poor creature returned kate scornfully you can never tell any thing of these men they are so deceitful besides its just my fate  why kate began carry in serious concern  hush miss walker is saying something said kate laughing  the young ladies will please give attention said a slow perfunctory voice miss carry tretherick is wanted in the parlor  meantime mr jack prince the name given on the card and various letters and credentials submitted to the rev mr crammer paced the somewhat severe apartment known publicly as the reception parlor and privately to the pupils as purgatory his keen eyes had taken in the various rigid details from the flat steam radiator like an enormous japanned sodacracker that heated one end of the room to the monumental bust of dr crammer that hopelessly chilled the other from the lords prayer executed by a former writingmaster in such gratuitous variety of elegant calligraphic trifling as to considerably abate the serious value of the composition to three views of genoa from the institute which nobody ever recognized taken on the spot by the drawingteacher from two illuminated texts of scripture in an english letter so gratuitously and hideously remote as to chill all human interest to a large photograph of the senior class in which the prettiest girls were ethiopian in complexion and sat apparently on each others heads and shoulders his fingers had turned listlessly the leaves of schoolcatalogues the sermons of dr crammer the poems of henry kirke white the lays of the sanctuary and lives of celebrated women his fancy and it was a nervously active one had gone over the partings and greetings that must have taken place here and wondered why the apartment had yet caught so little of the flavor of humanity indeed i am afraid he had almost forgotten the object of his visit when the door opened and carry tretherick stood before him  it was one of those faces he had seen the night before prettier even than it had seemed then and yet i think he was conscious of some disappointment without knowing exactly why her abundant waving hair was of a guineagolden tint her complexion of a peculiar flowerlike delicacy her brown eyes of the color of seaweed in deep water it certainly was not her beauty that disappointed him  without possessing his sensitiveness to impression carry was on her part quite as vaguely ill at ease she saw before her one of those men whom the sex would vaguely generalize as nice that is to say correct in all the superficial appointments of style dress manners and feature yet there was a decidedly unconventional quality about him he was totally unlike any thing or anybody that she could remember and as the attributes of originality are often as apt to alarm as to attract people she was not entirely prepossessed in his favor  i can hardly hope he began pleasantly that you remember me it is eleven years ago and you were a very little girl i am afraid i cannot even claim to have enjoyed that familiarity that might exist between a child of six and a young man of twentyone i dont think i was fond of children but i knew your mother very well i was editor of the avalanche in fiddletown when she took you to san francisco  you mean my stepmother she wasnt my mother you know interposed carry hastily  mr prince looked at her curiously i mean your stepmother he said gravely i never had the pleasure of meeting your mother  no mother hasnt been in california these twelve years  there was an intentional emphasizing of the title and of its distinction that began to coldly interest prince after his first astonishment was past  as i come from your stepmother now he went on with a slight laugh i must ask you to go back for a few moments to that point after your fathers death your motheri mean your stepmotherrecognized the fact that your mother the first mrs tretherick was legally and morally your guardian and although much against her inclination and affections placed you again in her charge  my stepmother married again within a month after father died and sent me home said carry with great directness and the faintest toss of her head  mr prince smiled so sweetly and apparently so sympathetically that carry began to like him with no other notice of the interruption he went on after your stepmother had performed this act of simple justice she entered into an agreement with your mother to defray the expenses of your education until your eighteenth year when you were to elect and choose which of the two should thereafter be your guardian and with whom you would make your home this agreement i think you are already aware of and i believe knew at the time  i was a mere child then said carry  certainly said mr prince with the same smile still the conditions i think have never been oppressive to you nor your mother and the only time they are likely to give you the least uneasiness will be when you come to make up your mind in the choice of your guardian that will be on your eighteenth birthdaythe 20th i think of the present month  carry was silent  pray do not think that i am here to receive your decision even if it be already made i only came to inform you that your stepmother mrs starbottle will be in town tomorrow and will pass a few days at the hotel if it is your wish to see her before you make up your mind she will be glad to meet you she does not however wish to do any thing to influence your judgment  does mother know she is coming said carry hastily  i do not know said prince gravely i only know that if you conclude to see mrs starbottle it will be with your mothers permission mrs starbottle will keep sacredly this part of the agreement made ten years ago but her health is very poor and the change and country quiet of a few days may benefit her mr prince bent his keen bright eyes upon the young girl and almost held his breath until she spoke again  mothers coming up today or tomorrow she said looking up  ah said mr prince with a sweet and languid smile  is col starbottle here too asked carry after a pause  col starbottle is dead your stepmother is again a widow  dead repeated carry  yes replied mr prince your stepmother has been singularly unfortunate in surviving her affections  carry did not know what he meant and looked so mr prince smiled reassuringly  presently carry began to whimper  mr prince softly stepped beside her chair  i am afraid he said with a very peculiar light in his eye and a singular dropping of the corners of his mustachei am afraid you are taking this too deeply it will be some days before you are called upon to make a decision let us talk of something else i hope you caught no cold last evening  carrys face shone out again in dimples  you must have thought us so queer it was too bad to give you so much trouble  none whatever i assure you my sense of propriety he added demurely which might have been outraged had i been called upon to help three young ladies out of a schoolroom window at night was deeply gratified at being able to assist them in again the doorbell rang loudly and mr prince rose take your own time and think well before you make your decision but carrys ear and attention were given to the sound of voices in the hall at the same moment the door was thrown open and a servant announced mrs tretherick and mr robinson  the afternoon train had just shrieked out its usual indignant protest at stopping at genoa at all as mr jack prince entered the outskirts of the town and drove towards his hotel he was wearied and cynical a drive of a dozen miles through unpicturesque outlying villages past small economic farmhouses and hideous villas that violated his fastidious taste had i fear left that gentleman in a captious state of mind he would have even avoided his taciturn landlord as he drove up to the door but that functionary waylaid him on the steps theres a lady in the sittinroom waitin for ye mr prince hurried up stairs and entered the room as mrs starbottle flew towards him  she had changed sadly in the last ten years her figure was wasted to half its size the beautiful curves of her bust and shoulders were broken or inverted the once full rounded arm was shrunken in its sleeve and the golden hoops that encircled her wan wrists almost slipped from her hands as her long scant fingers closed convulsively around jacks her cheekbones were painted that afternoon with the hectic of fever somewhere in the hollows of those cheeks were buried the dimples of long ago but their graves were forgotten her lustrous eyes were still beautiful though the orbits were deeper than before her mouth was still sweet although the lips parted more easily over the little teeth and even in breathing and showed more of them than she was wont to do before the glory of her blonde hair was still left it was finer more silken and ethereal yet it failed even in its plenitude to cover the hollows of the blueveined temples  clara said jack reproachfully  oh forgive me jack she said falling into a chair but still clinging to his hand forgive me dear but i could not wait longer i should have died jackdied before another night bear with me a little longer it will not be long but let me stay i may not see her i know i shall not speak to her but its so sweet to feel that i am at last near her that i breathe the same air with my darling i am better already jack i am indeed and you have seen her today how did she look what did she say tell me all every thing jack was she beautiful they say she is has she grown would you have known her again will she come jack perhaps she has been here already perhaps she had risen with tremulous excitement and was glancing at the doorperhaps she is here now why dont you speak jack tell me all  the keen eyes that looked down into hers were glistening with an infinite tenderness that none perhaps but she would have deemed them capable of clara he said gently and cheerily try and compose yourself you are trembling now with the fatigue and excitement of your journey i have seen carry she is well and beautiful let that suffice you now  his gentle firmness composed and calmed her now as it had often done before stroking her thin hand he said after a pause did carry ever write to you  twice thanking me for some presents they were only schoolgirl letters she added nervously answering the interrogation of his eyes  did she ever know of your own troubles of your poverty of the sacrifices you made to pay her bills of your pawning your clothes and jewels of your  no no interrupted the woman quickly no how could she i have no enemy cruel enough to tell her that  but if sheor if mrs tretherickhad heard of it if carry thought you were poor and unable to support her properly it might influence her decision young girls are fond of the position that wealth can give she may have rich friends maybe a lover  mrs starbottle winced at the last sentence but she said eagerly grasping jacks hand when you found me sick and helpless at sacramento when yougod bless you for it jackoffered to help me to the east you said you knew of something you had some plan that would make me and carry independent  yes said jack hastily but i want you to get strong and well first and now that you are calmer you shall listen to my visit to the school  it was then that mr jack prince proceeded to describe the interview already recorded with a singular felicity and discretion that shames my own account of that proceeding without suppressing a single fact without omitting a word or detail he yet managed to throw a poetic veil over that prosaic episode to invest the heroine with a romantic roseate atmosphere which though not perhaps entirely imaginary still i fear exhibited that genius which ten years ago had made the columns of the fiddletown avalanche at once fascinating and instructive it was not until he saw the heightening color and heard the quick breathing of his eager listener that he felt a pang of selfreproach god help her and forgive me he muttered between his clinched teeth but how can i tell her all now  that night when mrs starbottle laid her weary head upon her pillow she tried to picture to herself carry at the same moment sleeping peacefully in the great schoolhouse on the hill and it was a rare comfort to this yearning foolish woman to know that she was so near but at this moment carry was sitting on the edge of her bed half undressed pouting her pretty lips and twisting her long leonine locks between her fingers as miss kate van corleardramatically wrapped in a long white counterpane her black eyes sparkling and her thoroughbred nose thrown high in airstood over her like a wrathful and indignant ghost for carry had that evening imparted her woes and her history to miss kate and that young lady had proved herself no friend by falling into a state of fiery indignation over carrys ingratitude and openly and shamelessly espousing the claims of mrs starbottle why if the half you tell me is true your mother and those robinsons are making of you not only a little coward but a little snob miss respectability forsooth look you my family are centuries before the trethericks but if my family had ever treated me in this way and then asked me to turn my back on my best friend id whistle them down the wind and here kate snapped her fingers bent her black brows and glared around the room as if in search of a recreant van corlear  you just talk this way because you have taken a fancy to that mr prince said carry  in the debasing slang of the period that had even found its way into the virgin cloisters of the crammer institute miss kate as she afterwards expressed it instantly went for her  first with a shake of her head she threw her long black hair over one shoulder then dropping one end of the counterpane from the other like a vestal tunic she stepped before carry with a purposelyexaggerated classic stride and what if i have miss what if i happen to know a gentleman when i see him what if i happen to know that among a thousand such traditional conventional feeble editions of their grandfathers as mr harry robinson you cannot find one original independent individualized gentleman like your prince go to bed miss and pray to heaven that he may be your prince indeed ask to have a contrite and grateful heart and thank the lord in particular for having sent you such a friend as kate van corlear yet after an imposing dramatic exit she reappeared the next moment as a straight white flash kissed carry between the brows and was gone  the next day was a weary one to jack prince he was convinced in his mind that carry would not come yet to keep this consciousness from mrs starbottle to meet her simple hopefulness with an equal degree of apparent faith was a hard and difficult task he would have tried to divert her mind by taking her on a long drive but she was fearful that carry might come during her absence and her strength he was obliged to admit had failed greatly as he looked into her large and aweinspiring clear eyes a something he tried to keep from his mindto put off day by day from contemplationkept asserting itself directly to his inner consciousness he began to doubt the expediency and wisdom of his management he recalled every incident of his interview with carry and half believed that its failure was due to himself yet mrs starbottle was very patient and confident her very confidence shook his faith in his own judgment when her strength was equal to the exertion she was propped up in her chair by the window where she could see the school and the entrance to the hotel in the intervals she would elaborate pleasant plans for the future and would sketch a country home she had taken a strange fancy as it seemed to prince to the present location but it was notable that the future always thus outlined was one of quiet and repose she believed she would get well soon in fact she thought she was now much better than she had been but it might be long before she should be quite strong again she would whisper on in this way until jack would dash madly down into the barroom order liquors that he did not drink light cigars that he did not smoke talk with men that he did not listen to and behave generally as our stronger sex is apt to do in periods of delicate trials and perplexity  the day closed with a clouded sky and a bitter searching wind with the night fell a few wandering flakes of snow she was still content and hopeful and as jack wheeled her from the window to the fire she explained to him how that as the schoolterm was drawing near its close carry was probably kept closely at her lessons during the day and could only leave the school at night so she sat up the greater part of the evening and combed her silken hair and as far as her strength would allow made an undress toilet to receive her guest we must not frighten the child jack she said apologetically and with something of her old coquetry  it was with a feeling of relief that at ten oclock jack received a message from the landlord saying that the doctor would like to see him for a moment down stairs as jack entered the grim dimlylighted parlor he observed the hooded figure of a woman near the fire he was about to withdraw again when a voice that he remembered very pleasantly said  oh its all right im the doctor  the hood was thrown back and prince saw the shining black hair and black audacious eyes of kate van corlear  dont ask any questions im the doctor and theres my prescription and she pointed to the halffrightened halfsobbing carry in the cornerto be taken at once  then mrs tretherick has given her permission  not much if i know the sentiments of that lady replied kate saucily  then how did you get away asked prince gravely  by the window  when mr prince had left carry in the arms of her stepmother he returned to the parlor  well demanded kate  she will stayyou will i hope alsotonight  as i shall not be eighteen and my own mistress on the 20th and as i havent a sick stepmother i wont  then you will give me the pleasure of seeing you safely through the window again  when mr prince returned an hour later he found carry sitting on a low stool at mrs starbottles feet her head was in her stepmothers lap and she had sobbed herself to sleep mrs starbottle put her finger to her lip i told you she would come god bless you jack and goodnight  the next morning mrs tretherick indignant the rev asa crammer principal injured and mr joel robinson sen complacently respectable called upon mr prince there was a stormy meeting ending in a demand for carry we certainly cannot admit of this interference said mrs tretherick a fashionably dressed indistinctive looking woman it is several days before the expiration of our agreement and we do not feel under the circumstances justified in releasing mrs starbottle from its conditions until the expiration of the schoolterm we must consider miss tretherick as complying entirely with its rules and discipline imposed dr crammer the whole proceeding is calculated to injure the prospects and compromise the position of miss tretherick in society suggested mr robinson  in vain mr prince urged the failing condition of mrs starbottle her absolute freedom from complicity with carrys flight the pardonable and natural instincts of the girl and his own assurance that they were willing to abide by her decision and then with a rising color in his cheek a dangerous look in his eye but a singular calmness in his speech he added  one word more it becomes my duty to inform you of a circumstance which would certainly justify me as an executor of the late mr tretherick in fully resisting your demands a few months after mr trethericks death through the agency of a chinaman in his employment it was discovered that he had made a will which was subsequently found among his papers the insignificant value of his bequestmostly land then quite valuelessprevented his executors from carrying out his wishes or from even proving the will or making it otherwise publicly known until within the last two or three years when the property had enormously increased in value the provisions of that bequest are simple but unmistakable the property is divided between carry and her stepmother with the explicit condition that mrs starbottle shall become her legal guardian provide for her education and in all details stand to her in loco parentis  what is the value of this bequest asked mr robinson i cannot tell exactly but not far from half a million i should say returned prince certainly with this knowledge as a friend of miss tretherick i must say that her conduct is as judicious as it is honorable to her responded mr robinson i shall not presume to question the wishes or throw any obstacles in the way of carrying out the intentions of my dead husband added mrs tretherick and the interview was closed  when its result was made known to mrs starbottle she raised jacks hand to her feverish lips it cannot add to my happiness now jack but tell me why did you keep it from her jack smiled but did not reply  within the next week the necessary legal formalities were concluded and carry was restored to her stepmother at mrs starbottles request a small house in the outskirts of the town was procured and thither they removed to wait the spring and mrs starbottles convalescence both came tardily that year  yet she was happy and patient she was fond of watching the budding of the trees beyond her windowa novel sight to her californian experienceand of asking carry their names and seasons even at this time she projected for that summer which seemed to her so mysteriously withheld long walks with carry through the leafy woods whose gray misty ranks she could see along the hilltop she even thought she could write poetry about them and recalled the fact as evidence of her gaining strength and there is i believe still treasured by one of the members of this little household a little carol so joyous so simple and so innocent that it might have been an echo of the robin that called to her from the window as perhaps it was  and then without warning there dropped from heaven a day so tender so mystically soft so dreamily beautiful so throbbing and alive with the fluttering of invisible wings so replete and bounteously overflowing with an awakening and joyous resurrection not taught by man or limited by creed that they thought it fit to bring her out and lay her in that glorious sunshine that sprinkled like the droppings of a bridal torch the happy lintels and doors and there she lay beatified and calm  wearied by watching carry had fallen asleep by her side and mrs starbottles thin fingers lay like a benediction on her head presently she called jack to her side  who was that she whispered who just came in  miss van corlear said jack answering the look in her great hollow eyes  jack she said after a moments silence sit by me a moment dear jack ive something i must say if i ever seemed hard or cold or coquettish to you in the old days it was because i loved you jack too well to mar your future by linking it with my own i always loved you dear jack even when i seemed least worthy of you that is gone now but i had a dream lately jack a foolish womans dreamthat you might find what i lacked in her and she glanced lovingly at the sleeping girl at her side that you might love her as you have loved me but even that is not to be jack is it and she glanced wistfully in his face jack pressed her hand but did not speak after a few moments silence she again said perhaps you are right in your choice she is a goodhearted girl jackbut a little bold  and with this last flicker of foolish weak humanity in her struggling spirit she spoke no more when they came to her a moment later a tiny bird that had lit upon her breast flew away and the hand that they lifted from carrys head fell lifeless at her side     a jersey centenarian   i have seen her at last she is a hundred and seven years old and remembers george washington quite distinctly it is somewhat confusing however that she also remembers a contemporaneous josiah w perkins of basking ridge n j and i think has the impression that perkins was the better man perkins at the close of the last century paid her some little attention there are a few things that a really noble woman of a hundred and seven never forgets  it was perkins who said to her in 1795 in the streets of philadelphia shall i show thee gen washington then she said carelesslike for you know child at that time it wasnt what it is now to see gen washington she said so do josiah so do then he pointed to a tall man who got out of a carriage and went into a large house he was larger than you be he wore his own hairnot powdered had a flowered chintz vest with yellow breeches and blue stockings and a broadbrimmed hat in summer he wore a white straw hat and at his farm at basking ridge he always wore it at this point it became too evident that she was describing the clothes of the allfascinating perkins so i gently but firmly led her back to washington then it appeared that she did not remember exactly what he wore to assist her i sketched the general historic dress of that period she said she thought he was dressed like that emboldened by my success i added a hat of charles ii and pointed shoes of the eleventh century she indorsed these with such cheerful alacrity that i dropped the subject  the house upon which i had stumbled or rather to which my horsea jersey hack accustomed to historic researchhad brought me was low and quaint like most old houses it had the appearance of being encroached upon by the surrounding glebe as if it were already half in the grave with a sod or two in the shape of moss thrown on it like ashes on ashes and dust on dust a wooden house instead of acquiring dignity with age is apt to lose its youth and respectability together a porch with scant sloping seats from which even the winters snow must have slid uncomfortably projected from a doorway that opened most unjustifiably into a small sittingroom there was no vestibule or locus poenitentiae for the embarrassed or bashful visitor he passed at once from the security of the public road into shameful privacy and here in the mellow autumnal sunlight that streaming through the maples and sumach on the opposite bank flickered and danced upon the floor she sat and discoursed of george washington and thought of perkins she was quite in keeping with the house and the season albeit a little in advance of both her skin being of a faded russet and her hands so like dead november leaves that i fancied they even rustled when she moved them  for all that she was quite bright and cheery her faculties still quite vigorous although performing irregularly and spasmodically it was somewhat discomposing i confess to observe that at times her lower jaw would drop leaving her speechless until one of the family would notice it and raise it smartly into place with a slight snapan operation always performed in such an habitual perfunctory manner generally in passing to and fro in their household duties that it was very trying to the spectator it was still more embarrassing to observe that the dear old lady had evidently no knowledge of this but believed she was still talking and that on resuming her actual vocal utterance she was often abrupt and incoherent beginning always in the middle of a sentence and often in the middle of a word sometimes said her daughter a giddy thoughtless young thing of eightyfivesometimes just moving her head sort of unhitches her jaw and if we dont happen to see it shell go on talking for hours without ever making a sound although i was convinced after this that during my interview i had lost several important revelations regarding george washington through these peculiar lapses i could not help reflecting how beneficent were these provisions of the creatorhow if properly studied and applied they might be fraught with happiness to mankindhow a slight jostle or jar at a dinnerparty might make the postprandial eloquence of garrulous senility satisfactory to itself yet harmless to othershow a more intimate knowledge of anatomy introduced into the domestic circle might make a home tolerable at least if not happyhow a longsuffering husband under the pretence of a conjugal caress might so unhook his wifes condyloid process as to allow the flow of expostulation criticism or denunciation to go on with gratification to her and perfect immunity to himself  but this was not getting back to george washington and the early struggles of the republic so i returned to the commanderinchief but found after one or two leading questions that she was rather inclined to resent his reappearance on the stage her reminiscences here were chiefly social and local and more or less flavored with perkins we got back as far as the revolutionary epoch or rather her impressions of that epoch when it was still fresh in the public mind and here i came upon an incident purely personal and local but withal so novel weird and uncanny that for a while i fear it quite displaced george washington in my mind and tinged the autumnal fields beyond with a red that was not of the sumach i do not remember to have read of it in the books i do not know that it is entirely authentic it was attested to me by mother and daughter as an uncontradicted tradition  in the little field beyond where the plough still turns up musketballs and cartridgeboxes took place one of those irregular skirmishes between the militiamen and knyphausens stragglers that made the retreat historical a hessian soldier wounded in both legs and utterly helpless dragged himself to the cover of a hazelcopse and lay there hidden for two days on the third day maddened by thirst he managed to creep to the railfence of an adjoining farmhouse but found himself unable to mount it or pass through there was no one in the house but a little girl of six or seven years he called to her and in a faint voice asked for water she returned to the house as if to comply with his request but mounting a chair took from the chimney a heavilyloaded queen anne musket and going to the door took deliberate aim at the helpless intruder and fired the man fell back dead without a groan she replaced the musket and returning to the fence covered the body with boughs and leaves until it was hidden two or three days after she related the occurrence in a careless casual way and leading the way to the fence with a piece of bread and butter in her guileless little fingers pointed out the result of her simple unsophisticated effort the hessian was decently buried but i could not find out what became of the little girl nobody seemed to remember i trust that in afteryears she was happily married that no jersey lovelace attempted to trifle with a heart whose impulses were so prompt and whose purposes were so sincere they did not seem to know if she had married or not yet it does not seem probable that such simplicity of conception frankness of expression and deftness of execution were lost to posterity or that they failed in their time and season to give flavor to the domestic felicity of the period beyond this the story perhaps has little value except as an offset to the usual anecdotes of hessian atrocity  they had their financial panics even in jersey in the old days she remembered when dr white married your cousin maryor was it susanyes it was susan she remembers that your uncle harry brought in an armful of banknotespaper money you knowand threw them in the corner saying they were no good to anybody she remembered playing with them and giving them to your aunt annano child it was your own mother bless your heart some of them was marked as high as a hundred dollars everybody kept gold and silver in a stocking or in a chaney vase like that you never used money to buy any thing when josiah went to springfield to buy any thing he took a cartload of things with him to exchange that yaller pictureframe was paid for in greenings but then people knew jest what they had they didnt fritter their substance away in unchristian trifles like your father eliza jane who doesnt know that there is a god who will smite him hip and thigh for vengeance is mine and those that believe in me but here singularly enough the inferior maxillaries gave out and her jaw dropped i noticed that her giddy daughter of eightyfive was sitting near her but i do not pretend to connect this fact with the arrested flow of personal disclosure howbeit when she recovered her speech again it appeared that she was complaining of the weather  the seasons had changed very much since your father went to sea the winters used to be terrible in those days when she went over to springfield in june she saw the snow still on watsons ridge there were whole days when you couldnt git over to william henrys their next neighbor a quarter of a mile away it was that drefful winter that the spanish sailor was found you dont remember the spanish sailor eliza janeit was before your time there was a little personal skirmishing here which i feared at first might end in a suspension of maxillary functions and the loss of the story but here it is ah me it is a pure white winter idyl how shall i sing it this bright gay autumnal day  it was a terrible night that winters night when she and the century were young together the sun was lost at three oclock the snowy night came down like a white sheet that flapped around the house beat at the windows with its edges and at last wrapped it in a close embrace in the middle of the night they thought they heard above the wind a voice crying christus christus in a foreign tongue they opened the doorno easy task in the north wind that pressed its strong shoulders against itbut nothing was to be seen but the drifting snow the next morning dawned on fences hidden and a landscape changed and obliterated with drift during the day they again heard the cry of christus this time faint and hidden like a childs voice they searched in vain the drifted snow hid its secret on the third day they broke a path to the fence and then they heard the cry distinctly digging down they found the body of a mana spanish sailor dark and bearded with earrings in his ears as they stood gazing down at his cold and pulseless figure the cry of christus again rose upon the wintry air and they turned and fled in superstitious terror to the house and then one of the children bolder than the rest knelt down and opened the dead mans rough peajacket and foundwhat think youa little blueandgreen parrot nestling against his breast it was the bird that had echoed mechanically the last despairing cry of the life that was given to save it it was the bird that ever after amid outlandish oaths and wilder sailorsongs that i fear often shocked the pure ears of its gentle mistress and brought scandal into the jerseys still retained that one weird and mournful cry  the sun meanwhile was sinking behind the steadfast range beyond and i could not help feeling that i must depart with my wants unsatisfied i had brought away no historic fragment i absolutely knew little or nothing new regarding george washington i had been addressed variously by the names of different members of the family who were dead and forgotten i had stood for an hour in the past yet i had not added to my historical knowledge nor the practical benefit of your readers i spoke once more of washington and she replied with a reminiscence of perkins  stand forth o josiah w perkins of basking ridge n j thou wast of little account in thy life i warrant thou didst not even feel the greatness of thy day and time thou didst criticise thy superiors thou wast small and narrow in thy ways thy very name and grave are unknown and uncared for but thou wast once kind to a woman who survived thee and lo thy name is again spoken of men and for a moment lifted up above thy betters
