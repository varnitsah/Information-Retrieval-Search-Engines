from the thirteenth century onwards the name under the various disguises of stevinstoun stevensoun stevensonne stenesone and stewinsoune spread across scotland from the mouth of the firth of forth to the mouth of the firth of clyde four times at least it occurs as a placename there is a parish of stevenston in cunningham a second place of the name in the barony of bothwell in lanark a third on lyne above drochil castle the fourth on the tyne near traprain law stevenson of stevenson co lanark swore fealty to edward i in 1296 and the last of that family died after the restoration stevensons of hirdmanshiels in midlothian rode in the bishops raid of aberlady served as jurors stood bail for neighbourshunter of polwood for instanceand became extinct about the same period or possibly earlier a stevenson of luthrie and another of pitroddie make their bows give their names and vanish and by the year 1700 it does not appear that any acre of scots land was vested in any stevenson1  here is so far a melancholy picture of backward progress and a family posting towards extinction but the law however administered and i am bound to aver that in scotland it couldna weel be waur acts as a kind of dredge and with dispassionate impartiality brings up into the light of day and shows us for a moment in the jurybox or on the gallows the creeping things of the past by these broken glimpses we are able to trace the existence of many other and more inglorious stevensons picking a private way through the brawl that makes scots history they were members of parliament for peebles stirling pittenweem kilrenny and inverurie we find them burgesses of edinburgh indwellers in biggar perth and dalkeith thomas was the forester of newbattle park gavin was a baker john a maltman francis a chirurgeon and schir william a priest in the feuds of humes and heatleys cunninghams montgomeries mures ogilvies and turnbulls we find them inconspicuously involved and apparently getting rather better than they gave schir william reverend gentleman was cruellie slaughtered on the links of kincraig in 1532 james in the milltown of roberton murdered in 1590 archibald in gallowfarren killed with shots of pistols and hagbuts in 1608 three violent deaths in about seventy years against which we can only put the case of thomas servant to hume of cowden knowes who was arraigned with his two young masters for the death of the bastard of mellerstanes in 1569 john in dalkeith stood sentry without holyrood while the banded lords were despatching rizzio within william at the ringing of perth bell ran before cowrie house with ane sword and entering to the yearde saw george craiggingilt with ane twahandit sword and utheris nychtbouris at quilk time james boig cryit ower ane wynds awa hame ye will all be hangita piece of advice which william took and immediately depairtit john got a maid with child to him in biggar and seemingly deserted her she was hanged on the castle hill for infanticide june 1614 and martin elder in dalkeith eternally disgraced the name by signing witness in a witch trial 1661 these are two of our black sheep2 under the restoration one stevenson was a bailie in edinburgh and another the lessee of the canonmills there were at the same period two physicians of the name in edinburgh one of whom dr archibald appears to have been a famous man in his day and generation the court had continual need of him it was he who reported for instance on the state of rumbold and he was for some time in the enjoyment of a pension of a thousand pounds scots about eighty pounds sterling at a time when five hundred pounds is described as an opulent future i do not know if i should be glad or sorry that he failed to keep favour but on 6th january 1682 rather a cheerless new years present his pension was expunged3 there need be no doubt at least of my exultation at the fact that he was knighted and recorded arms not quite so genteel but still in public life hugh was underclerk to the privy council and liked being so extremely i gather this from his conduct in september 1681 when with all the lords and their servants he took the woful and souldestroying test swearing it word by word upon his knees and behold it was in vain for hugh was turned out of his small post in 16844 sir archibald and hugh were both plainly inclined to be trimmers but there was one witness of the name of stevenson who held high the banner of the covenantjohn landlabourer5 in the parish of daily in carrick that eminently pious man he seems to have been a poor sickly soul and shows himself disabled with scrofula and prostrate and groaning aloud with fever but the enthusiasm of the martyr burned high within him  i was made to take joyfully the spoiling of my goods and with pleasure for his names sake wandered in deserts and in mountains in dens and caves of the earth i lay four months in the coldest season of the year in a haystack in my fathers garden and a whole february in the open fields not far from camragen and this i did without the least prejudice from the night air one night when lying in the fields near to the carrickmiln i was all covered with snow in the morning many nights have i lain with pleasure in the churchyard of old daily and made a grave my pillow frequently have i resorted to the old walls about the glen near to camragen and there sweetly rested the visible hand of god protected and directed him dragoons were turned aside from the bramblebush where he lay hidden miracles were performed for his behoof i got a horse and a woman to carry the child and came to the same mountain where i wandered by the mist before it is commonly known by the name of kellsrhins when we came to go up the mountain there came on a great rain which we thought was the occasion of the childs weeping and she wept so bitterly that all we could do could not divert her from it so that she was ready to burst when we got to the top of the mountain where the lord had been formerly kind to my soul in prayer i looked round me for a stone and espying one i went and brought it when the woman with me saw me set down the stone she smiled and asked what i was going to do with it i told her i was going to set it up as my ebenezer because hitherto and in that place the lord had formerly helped and i hoped would yet help the rain still continuing the child weeping bitterly i went to prayer and no sooner did i cry to god but the child gave over weeping and when we got up from prayer the rain was pouring down on every side but in the way where we were to go there fell not one drop the place not rained on was as big as an ordinary avenue and so great a saint was the natural butt of satans persecutions i retired to the fields for secret prayer about midnight when i went to pray i was much straitened and could not get one request but lord pity lord help this i came over frequently at length the terror of satan fell on me in a high degree and all i could say even then waslord help i continued in the duty for some time notwithstanding of this terror at length i got up to my feet and the terror still increased then the enemy took me by the armpits and seemed to lift me up by my arms i saw a loch just before me and i concluded he designed to throw me there by force and had he got leave to do so it might have brought a great reproach upon religion6 but it was otherwise ordered and the cause of piety escaped that danger7  on the whole the stevensons may be described as decent reputable folk following honest tradesmillers maltsters and doctors playing the character parts in the waverley novels with propriety if without distinction and to an orphan looking about him in the world for a potential ancestry offering a plain and quite unadorned refuge equally free from shame and glory john the landlabourer is the one living and memorable figure and he alas cannot possibly be more near than a collateral it was on august 12 1678 that he heard mr john welsh on the craigdowhill and took the heavens earth and sun in the firmament that was shining on us as also the ambassador who made the offer and the clerk who raised the psalms to witness that i did give myself away to the lord in a personal and perpetual covenant never to be forgotten and already in 1675 the birth of my direct ascendant was registered in glasgow so that i have been pursuing ancestors too far down and john the landlabourer is debarred me and i must relinquish from the trophies of my house his rare soulstrengthening and comforting cordial it is the same case with the edinburgh bailie and the miller of the canonmills worthy man and with that public character hugh the underclerk and more than all with sir archibald the physician who recorded arms and i am reduced to a family of inconspicuous maltsters in what was then the clean and handsome little city on the clyde  the name has a certain air of being norse but the story of scottish nomenclature is confounded by a continual process of translation and halftranslation from the gaelic which in olden days may have been sometimes reversed roy becomes reid gow smith a great highland clan uses the name of robertson a sept in appin that of livingstone maclean in glencoe answers to johnstone at lockerby and we find such hybrids as macalexander for macallister there is but one rule to be deduced that however uncompromisingly saxon a name may appear you can never be sure it does not designate a celt my greatgrandfather wrote the name stevenson but pronounced it steenson after the fashion of the immortal minstrel in redgauntlet and this elision of a medial consonant appears a gaelic process and curiously enough i have come across no less than two gaelic forms john macstophane cordinerius in crossraguel 1573 and william msteen in dunskeith co ross 1605 stevenson steenson macstophane msteen which is the original which the translation or were these separate creations of the patronymic some english some gaelic the curiously compact territory in which we find them seatedayr lanark peebles stirling perth fife and the lothianswould seem to forbid the supposition8  stevensonor according to tradition of one of the proscribed of the clan macgregor who was born among the willows or in a hillside sheeppenson of my love a heraldic bar sinister but history reveals a reason for the birth among the willows far other than the sinister aspect of the name these are the dark words of mr cosmo innes but history or tradition being interrogated tells a somewhat tangled tale the heir of macgregor of glenorchy murdered about 1353 by the argyll campbells appears to have been the original son of my love and his more loyal clansmen took the name to fight under it may be supposed the story of their resistance became popular and the name in some sort identified with the idea of opposition to the campbells twice afterwards on some renewed aggression in 1502 and 1552 we find the macgregors again banding themselves into a sept of sons of my love and when the great disaster fell on them in 1603 the whole original legend reappears and we have the heir of alaster of glenstrae born among the willows of a fugitive mother and the more loyal clansmen again rallying under the name of stevenson a story would not be told so often unless it had some base in fact nor if there were no bond at all between the red macgregors and the stevensons would that extraneous and somewhat uncouth name be so much repeated in the legends of the children of the mist  but i am enabled by my very lively and obliging correspondent mr george a macgregor stevenson of new york to give an actual instance his grandfather greatgrandfather greatgreatgrandfather and greatgreatgreatgrandfather all used the names of macgregor and stevenson as occasion served being perhaps macgregor by night and stevenson by day the greatgreatgreatgrandfather was a mighty man of his hands marched with the clan in the fortyfive and returned with spolia opima in the shape of a sword which he had wrested from an officer in the retreat and which is in the possession of my correspondent to this day his greatgrandson the grandfather of my correspondent being converted to methodism by some wayside preacher discarded in a moment his name his old nature and his political principles and with the zeal of a proselyte sealed his adherence to the protestant succession by baptising his next son george this george became the publisher and editor of the wesleyan times his children were brought up in ignorance of their highland pedigree and my correspondent was puzzled to overhear his father speak of him as a true macgregor and amazed to find in rummaging about that peaceful and pious house the sword of the hanoverian officer after he was grown up and was better informed of his descent i frequently asked my father he writes why he did not use the name of macgregor his replies were significant and give a picture of the man it isnt a good methodist name you can use it but it will do you no good yet the old gentleman by way of pleasantry used to announce himself to friends as colonel macgregor  here then are certain macgregors habitually using the name of stevenson and at last under the influence of methodism adopting it entirely doubtless a proscribed clan could not be particular they took a name as a man takes an umbrella against a shower as rob roy took campbell and his son took drummond but this case is different stevenson was not taken and leftit was consistently adhered to it does not in the least follow that all stevensons are of the clan alpin but it does follow that some may be and i cannot conceal from myself the possibility that james stevenson in glasgow my first authentic ancestor may have had a highland alias upon his conscience and a claymore in his back parlour  to one more tradition i may allude that we are somehow descended from a french barbersurgeon who came to st andrews in the service of one of the cardinal beatons no details were added but the very name of france was so detested in my family for three generations that i am tempted to suppose there may be something in it9   footnotes    1 an error stevensons owned at this date the barony of     dolphingston in haddingtonshire montgrennan in ayrshire and     several other lesser places    2

the only witness of the name     other stevensons were actually killed during the persecutions in     the glen of trool on pentland etc and it is very possible that     the authors own ancestor was

the name of     stevenson is most common it is in point of fact far more     widespread than the text indicates and occurs from dumfries and     berwickshire to aberdeen and orkney    9 mr jh stevenson is satisfied that these speculations as to a     possible norse highland or french origin are vain all we know     about the engineer family is that it was sprung from a stock of     westland whigs settled in the latter part of the seventeenth century     in the parish of neilston as mentioned at the beginning of the next     chapter it may be noted that the ayrshire parish of stevenson the     lands of which are said to have received the name in the twelfth     century lies within thirteen miles southwest of this place the     lands of stevenson in lanarkshire first mentioned in the next     century in the ragman roll lie within twenty miles east     chapter i  domestic annals   it is believed that in 1665 james stevenson in nether carsewell parish of neilston county of renfrew and presumably a tenant farmer married one jean keir and in 1675 without doubt there was born to these two a son robert possibly a maltster in glasgow in 1710 robert married for a second time elizabeth cumming and there was born to them in 1720 another robert certainly a maltster in glasgow in 1742 robert the second married margaret fulton margret she called herself by whom he had ten children among whom were hugh born february 1749 and alan born june 1752  with these two brothers my story begins their deaths were simultaneous their lives unusually brief and full tradition whispered me in childhood they were the owners of an islet near st kitts and it is certain they had risen to be at the head of considerable interests in the west indies which hugh managed abroad and alan at home at an age when others are still curveting a clerks stool my kinsman mr stevenson of stirling has heard his father mention that there had been something romantic about alans marriage and alas he has forgotten what it was early at least his wife was jean daughter of david lillie a builder in glasgow and several times deacon of the wrights the date of the marriage has not reached me but on 8th june 1772 when robert the only child of the union was born the husband and father had scarce passed or had not yet attained his twentieth year here was a youth making haste to give hostages to fortune but this early scene of prosperity in love and business was on the point of closing  there hung in the house of this young family and successively in those of my grandfather and father an oil painting of a ship of many tons burthen doubtless the brothers had an interest in the vessel i was told she had belonged to them outright and the picture was preserved through years of hardship and remains to this day in the possession of the family the only memorial of my greatgrandsire alan it was on this ship that he sailed on his last adventure summoned to the west indies by hugh an agent had proved unfaithful on a serious scale and it used to be told me in my childhood how the brothers pursued him from one island to another in an open boat were exposed to the pernicious dews of the tropics and simultaneously struck down the dates and places of their deaths now before me would seem to indicate a more scattered and prolonged pursuit hugh on the 16th april 1774 in tobago within sight of trinidad alan so late as may 26th and so far away as santt kittes in the leeward islandsboth says the family bible of a fiver  the death of hugh was probably announced by alan in a letter to which we may refer the details of the open boat and the dew thus at least in something like the course of post both were called away the one twentyfive the other twentytwo their brief generation became extinct their shortlived house fell with them and in these lawless parts and lawless timesthe words are my grandfatherstheir property was stolen or became involved many years later i understand some small recovery to have been made but at the moment almost the whole means of the family seem to have perished with the young merchants on the 27th april eleven days after hugh stevenson twentynine before alan died david lillie the deacon of the wrights so that mother and son were orphaned in one month thus from a few scraps of paper bearing little beyond dates we construct the outlines of the tragedy that shadowed the cradle of robert stevenson  jean lillie was a young woman of strong sense well fitted to contend with poverty and of a pious disposition which it is like that these misfortunes heated like so many other widowed scotswomen she vowed her son should wag his head in a pulpit but her means were inadequate to her ambition a charity school and some time under a mr mintyre a famous linguist were all she could afford in the way of education to the wouldbe minister he learned no greek in one place he mentions that the orations of cicero were his highest book in latin in another that he had delighted in virgil and horace but his delight could never have been scholarly this appears to have been the whole of his training previous to an event which changed his own destiny and moulded that of his descendantsthe second marriage of his mother  there was a merchantburgess of edinburgh of the name of thomas smith the smith pedigree has been traced a little more particularly than the stevensons with a similar dearth of illustrious names one character seems to have appeared indeed for a moment at the wings of history a skipper of dundee who smuggled over some jacobite bigwig at the time of the fifteen and was afterwards drowned in dundee harbour while going on board his ship with this exception the generations of the smiths present no conceivable interest even to a descendant and thomas of edinburgh was the first to issue from respectable obscurity his father a skipper out of broughty ferry was drowned at sea while thomas was still young he seems to have owned a ship or twowhalers i suppose or coastersand to have been a member of the dundee trinity house whatever that implies on his death the widow remained in broughty and the son came to push his future in edinburgh there is a story told of him in the family which i repeat here because i shall have to tell later on a similar but more perfectly authenticated experience of his stepson robert stevenson word reached thomas that his mother was unwell and he prepared to leave for broughty on the morrow it was between two and three in the morning and the early northern daylight was already clear when he awoke and beheld the curtains at the bedfoot drawn aside and his mother appear in the interval smile upon him for a moment and then vanish the sequel is stereotype he took the time by his watch and arrived at broughty to learn it was the very moment of her death the incident is at least curious in having happened to such a personas the tale is being told of him in all else he appears as a man ardent passionate practical designed for affairs and prospering in them far beyond the average he founded a solid business in lamps and oils and was the sole proprietor of a concern called the greenside companys worksa multifarious concern it was writes my cousin professor swan of tinsmiths coppersmiths brassfounders blacksmiths and japanners he was also it seems a shipowner and underwriter he built himself a landnos 1 and 2 baxters place then no such unfashionable neighbourhoodand died leaving his only son in easy circumstances and giving to his three surviving daughters portions of five thousand pounds and upwards there is no standard of success in life but in one of its meanings this is to succeed  in what we know of his opinions he makes a figure highly characteristic of the time a high tory and patriot a captainso i find it in my notesof edinburgh spearmen and on duty in the castle during the muir and palmer troubles he bequeathed to his descendants a bloodless sword and a somewhat violent tradition both long preserved the judge who sat on muir and palmer the famous braxfield let fall from the bench the obiter dictumi never liked the french all my days but now i hate them if thomas smith the edinburgh spearman were in court he must have been tempted to applaud the people of that land were his abhorrence he loathed buonaparte like antichrist towards the end he fell into a kind of dotage his family must entertain him with games of tin soldiers which he took a childish pleasure to array and overset but those who played with him must be upon their guard for if his side which was always that of the english against the french should chance to be defeated there would be trouble in baxters place for these opinions he may almost be said to have suffered baptised and brought up in the church of scotland he had upon some conscientious scruple joined the communion of the baptists like other nonconformists these were inclined to the liberal side in politics and at least in the beginning regarded buonaparte as a deliverer from the time of his joining the spearmen thomas smith became in consequence a bugbear to his brethren in the faith they that take the sword shall perish with the sword they told him they gave him no rest his position became intolerable it was plain he must choose between his political and his religious tenets and in the last years of his life about 1812 he returned to the church of his fathers  august 1786 was the date of his chief advancement when having designed a system of oil lights to take the place of the primitive coal fires before in use he was dubbed engineer to the newlyformed board of northern lighthouses not only were his fortunes bettered by the appointment but he was introduced to a new and wider field for the exercise of his abilities and a new way of life highly agreeable to his active constitution he seems to have rejoiced in the long journeys and to have combined them with the practice of field sports a tall stout man coming ashore with his gun over his armso he was described to my fatherthe only description that has come down to meby a lightkeeper old in the service nor did this change come alone on the 9th july of the same year thomas smith had been left for the second time a widower as he was still but thirtythree years old prospering in his affairs newly advanced in the world and encumbered at the time with a family of children five in number it was natural that he should entertain the notion of another wife expeditious in business he was no less so in his choice and it was not later than june 1787for my grandfather is described as still in his fifteenth yearthat he married the widow of alan stevenson  the perilous experiment of bringing together two families for once succeeded mr smiths two eldest daughters jean and janet fervent in piety unwearied in kind deeds were well qualified both to appreciate and to attract the stepmother and her son on the other hand seems to have found immediate favour in the eyes of mr smith it is perhaps easy to exaggerate the readymade resemblances the tired woman must have done much to fashion girls who were under ten the man lusty and opinionated must have stamped a strong impression on the boy of fifteen but the cleavage of the family was too marked the identity of character and interest produced between the two men on the one hand and the three women on the other was too complete to have been the result of influence alone particular bonds of union must have preexisted on each side and there is no doubt that the man and the boy met with common ambitions and a common bent to the practice of that which had not so long before acquired the name of civil engineering  for the profession which is now so thronged famous and influential was then a thing of yesterday my grandfather had an anecdote of smeaton probably learned from john clerk of eldin their common friend smeaton was asked by the duke of argyll to visit the west highland coast for a professional purpose he refused appalled it seems by the rough travelling you can recommend some other fit person asked the duke no said smeaton im sorry i cant what cried the duke a profession with only one man in it pray who taught you why said smeaton i believe i may say i was selftaught ant please your grace smeaton at the date of thomas smiths third marriage was yet living and as the one had grown to the new profession from his place at the instrumentmakers the other was beginning to enter it by the way of his trade the engineer of today is confronted with a library of acquired results tables and formulæ to the value of folios full have been calculated and recorded and the student finds everywhere in front of him the footprints of the pioneers in the eighteenth century the field was largely unexplored the engineer must read with his own eyes the face of nature he arose a volunteer from the workshop or the mill to undertake works which were at once inventions and adventures it was not a science thenit was a living art and it visibly grew under the eyes and between the hands of its practitioners  the charm of such an occupation was strongly felt by stepfather and stepson it chanced that thomas smith was a reformer the superiority of his proposed lamp and reflectors over open fires of coal secured his appointment and no sooner had he set his hand to the task than the interest of that employment mastered him the vacant stage on which he was to act and where all had yet to be createdthe greatness of the difficulties the smallness of the means intrusted himwould rouse a man of his disposition like a call to battle the lad introduced by marriage under his roof was of a character to sympathise the public usefulness of the service would appeal to his judgment the perpetual need for fresh expedients stimulate his ingenuity and there was another attraction which in the younger man at least appealed to and perhaps first aroused a profound and enduring sentiment of romance i mean the attraction of the life the seas into which his labours carried the new engineer were still scarce charted the coasts still dark his way on shore was often far beyond the convenience of any road the isles in which he must sojourn were still partly savage he must toss much in boats he must often adventure on horseback by the dubious bridletrack through unfrequented wildernesses he must sometimes plant his lighthouse in the very camp of wreckers and he was continually enforced to the vicissitudes of outdoor life the joy of my grandfather in this career was strong as the love of woman it lasted him through youth and manhood it burned strong in age and at the approach of death his last yearning was to renew these loved experiences what he felt himself he continued to attribute to all around him and to this supposed sentiment in others i find him continually almost pathetically appealing often in vain  snared by these interests the boy seems to have become almost at once the eager confidant and adviser of his new connection the church if he had ever entertained the prospect very warmly faded from his view and at the age of nineteen i find him already in a post of some authority superintending the construction of the lighthouse on the isle of little cumbrae in the firth of clyde the change of aim seems to have caused or been accompanied by a change of character it sounds absurd to couple the name of my grandfather with the word indolence but the lad who had been destined from the cradle to the church and who had attained the age of fifteen without acquiring more than a moderate knowledge of latin was at least no unusual student and from the day of his charge at little cumbrae he steps before us what he remained until the end a man of the most zealous industry greedy of occupation greedy of knowledge a stern husband of time a reader a writer unflagging in his task of selfimprovement thenceforward his summers were spent directing works and ruling workmen now in uninhabited now in halfsavage islands his winters were set apart first at the andersonian institution then at the university of edinburgh to improve himself in mathematics chemistry natural history agriculture moral philosophy and logic a bearded studentalthough no doubt scrupulously shaved i find one reference to his years in class which will have a meaning for all who have studied in scottish universities he mentions a recommendation made by the professor of logic the highschool men he writes and bearded men like myself were all attention if my grandfather were throughout life a thought too studious of the art of getting on much must be forgiven to the bearded and belated student who looked across with a sense of difference at the highschool men here was a gulf to be crossed but already he could feel that he had made a beginning and that must have been a proud hour when he devoted his earliest earnings to the repayment of the charitable foundation in which he had received the rudiments of knowledge  in yet another way he followed the example of his fatherinlaw and from 1794 to 1807 when the affairs of the bell rock made it necessary for him to resign he served in different corps of volunteers in the last of these he rose to a position of distinction no less than captain of the grenadier company and his colonel in accepting his resignation entreated he would do them the favour of continuing as an honorary member of a corps which has been so much indebted for your zeal and exertions  to very pious women the men of the house are apt to appear worldly the wife as she puts on her new bonnet before church is apt to sigh over that assiduity which enabled her husband to pay the milliners bill and in the household of the smiths and stevensons the women were not only extremely pious but the men were in reality a trifle worldly religious they both were conscious like all scots of the fragility and unreality of that scene in which we play our uncomprehended parts like all scots realising daily and hourly the sense of another will than ours and a perpetual direction in the affairs of life but the current of their endeavours flowed in a more obvious channel they had got on so far to get on further was their next ambitionto gather wealth to rise in society to leave their descendants higher than themselves to be in some sense among the founders of families scott was in the same town nourishing similar dreams but in the eyes of the women these dreams would be foolish and idolatrous  i have before me some volumes of old letters addressed to mrs smith and the two girls her favourites which depict in a strong light their characters and the society in which they moved     my very dear and much esteemed friend writes one correspondent    this day being the anniversary of our acquaintance i feel inclined    to address you but where shall i find words to express the fealings    of a graitful heart first to the lord who graiciously inclined you    on this day last year to notice an afflicted strainger providentially    cast in your way far from any earthly friend methinks i shall    hear him say unto you inasmuch as ye shewed kindness to my    afflicted handmaiden ye did it unto me  this is to jean but the same afflicted lady wrote indifferently to jean to janet and to mrs smith whom she calls my edinburgh mother it is plain the three were as one person moving to acts of kindness like the graces inarmed too much stress must not be laid on the style of this correspondence clarinda survived not far away and may have met the ladies on the calton hill and many of the writers appear underneath the conventions of the period to be genuinely moved but what unpleasantly strikes a reader is that these devout unfortunates found a revenue in their devotion it is everywhere the same tale on the side of the softhearted ladies substantial acts of help on the side of the correspondents affection italics texts ecstasies and imperfect spelling when a midwife is recommended not at all for proficiency in her important art but because she has a sister whom i the correspondent esteem and respect and who is a spiritual daughter of my hond father in the gosple the mask seems to be torn off and the wages of godliness appear too openly capacity is a secondary matter in a midwife temper in a servant affection in a daughter and the repetition of a shibboleth fulfils the law common decency is at times forgot in the same page with the most sanctified advice and aspiration thus i am introduced to a correspondent who appears to have been at the time the housekeeper at invermay and who writes to condole with my grandmother in a season of distress for nearly half a sheet she keeps to the point with an excellent discretion in language then suddenly breaks out     it was fully my intention to have left this at martinmass but the    lord fixes the bounds of our habitation i have had more need of    patience in my situation here than in any other partly from the very    violent unsteady deceitful temper of the mistress of the family    and also from the state of the house it was in a train of repair    when i came here two years ago and is still in confusion there is    above six thousand pounds worth of furniture come from london to be    put up when the rooms are completely finished and then woe be to    the person who is housekeeper at invermay  and by the tail of the document which is torn i see she goes on to ask the bereaved family to seek her a new place it is extraordinary that people should have been so deceived in so careless an impostor that a few sprinkled god willings should have blinded them to the essence of this venomous letter and that they should have been at the pains to bind it in with others many of them highly touching in their memorial of harrowing days but the good ladies were without guile and without suspicion they were victims marked for the axe and the religious impostors snuffed up the wind as they drew near  i have referred above to my grandmother it was no slip of the pen for by an extraordinary arrangement in which it is hard not to suspect the managing hand of a mother jean smith became the wife of robert stevenson mrs smith had failed in her design to make her son a minister and she saw him daily more immersed in business and worldly ambition one thing remained that she might do she might secure for him a godly wife that great means of sanctification and she had two under her hand trained by herself her dear friends and daughters both in law and lovejean and janet jeans complexion was extremely pale janets was florid my grandmothers nose was straight my greataunts aquiline but by the sound of the voice not even a son was able to distinguish one from other the marriage of a man of twentyseven and a girl of twenty who have lived for twelve years as brother and sister is difficult to conceive it took place however and thus in 1799 the family was still further cemented by the union of a representative of the male or worldly element with one of the female and devout  this essential difference remained unbridged yet never diminished the strength of their relation my grandfather pursued his design of advancing in the world with some measure of success rose to distinction in his calling grew to be the familiar of members of parliament judges of the court of session and landed gentlemen learned a ready address had a flow of interesting conversation and when he was referred to as a highly respectable bourgeois resented the description my grandmother remained to the end devout and unambitious occupied with her bible her children and her house easily shocked and associating largely with a clique of godly parasites i do not know if she called in the midwife already referred to but the principle on which that lady was recommended she accepted fully the cook was a godly woman the butcher a christian man and the table suffered the scene has been often described to me of my grandfather sawing with darkened countenance at some indissoluble jointpreserve me my dear what kind of a reedy stringy beast is thisof the joint removed the pudding substituted and uncovered and of my grandmothers anxious glance and hasty deprecatory comment just mismanaged yet with the invincible obstinacy of soft natures she would adhere to the godly woman and the christian man or find others of the same kidney to replace them one of her confidants had once a narrow escape an unwieldy old woman she had fallen from an outside stair in a close of the old town and my grandmother rejoiced to communicate the providential circumstance that a baker had been passing underneath with his bread upon his head i would like to know what kind of providence the baker thought it cried my grandfather  but the sally must have been unique in all else that i have heard or read of him so far from criticising he was doing his utmost to honour and even to emulate his wifes pronounced opinions in the only letter which has come to my hand of thomas smiths i find him informing his wife that he was in time for afternoon church  similar assurances or cognate excuses abound in the correspondence of robert stevenson and it is comical and pretty to see the two generations paying the same court to a female piety more highly strung thomas smith to the mother of robert stevensonrobert stevenson to the daughter of thomas smith and if for once my grandfather suffered himself to be hurried by his sense of humour and justice into that remark about the case of providence and the baker i should be sorry for any of his children who should have stumbled into the same attitude of criticism in the apocalyptic style of the housekeeper of invermay woe be to that person but there was no fear husband and sons all entertained for the pious tender soul the same chivalrous and moved affection i have spoken with one who remembered her and who had been the intimate and equal of her sons and i found this witness had been struck as i had been with a sense of disproportion between the warmth of the adoration felt and the nature of the woman whether as described or observed she diligently read and marked her bible she was a tender nurse she had a sense of humour under strong control she talked and found some amusement at her or rather at her husbands dinnerparties it is conceivable that even my grandmother was amenable to the seductions of dress at least i find her husband inquiring anxiously about the gowns from glasgow and very careful to describe the toilet of the princess charlotte whom he had seen in church in a pelisse and bonnet of the same colour of cloth as the boys dress jackets trimmed with blue satin ribbons the hat or bonnet mr spittal said was a parisian slouch and had a plume of three white feathers but all this leaves a blank impression and it is rather by reading backward in these old musty letters which have moved me now to laughter and now to impatience that i glean occasional glimpses of how she seemed to her contemporaries and trace at work in her queer world of godly and grateful parasites a mobile and responsive nature fashion moulds us and particularly women deeper than we sometimes think but a little while ago and in some circles women stood or fell by the degree of their appreciation of old pictures in the early years of the century and surely with more reason a character like that of my grandmother warmed charmed and subdued like a strain of music the hearts of the men of her own household and there is little doubt that mrs smith as she looked on at the domestic life of her son and her stepdaughter and numbered the heads in their increasing nursery must have breathed fervent thanks to her creator  yet this was to be a family unusually tried it was not for nothing that one of the godly women saluted miss janet smith as a veteran in affliction and they were all before middle life experienced in that form of service by the 1st of january 1808 besides a pair of stillborn twins five children had been born and still survived to the young couple by the 11th two were gone by the 28th a third had followed and the two others were still in danger in the letters of a former nurserymaidi give her name jean mitchell honoris causawe are enabled to feel even at this distance of time some of the bitterness of that month of bereavement     i have this day received she writes to miss janet the melancholy    news of my dear babys deaths my heart is like to break for my dear    mrs stevenson o may she be supported on this trying occasion i    hope her other three babys will be spared to her o miss smith did    i think when i parted from my sweet babys that i never was to see    them more i received she begins her next the mournful news of    my dear jessies death i also received the hair of my three sweet    babys which i will preserve as dear to their memorys and as a token    of mr and mrs stevensons friendship and esteem at my leisure    hours when the children are in bed they occupy all my thoughts i    dream of them about two weeks ago i dreamed that my sweet little    jessie came running to me in her usual way and i took her in my    arms o my dear babys were mortal eyes permitted to see them in    heaven we would not repine nor grieve for their loss  by the 29th of february the reverend john campbell a man of obvious sense and human value but hateful to the present biographer because he wrote so many letters and conveyed so little information summed up this first period of affliction in a letter to miss smith your dear sister but a little while ago had a full nursery and the dear blooming creatures sitting around her table filled her breast with hope that one day they should fill active stations in society and become an ornament in the church below but ah  near a hundred years ago these little creatures ceased to be and for not much less a period the tears have been dried and to this day looking in these stitched sheaves of letters we hear the sound of many softhearted women sobbing for the lost never was such a massacre of the innocents teething and chincough and scarlet fever and smallpox ran the round and little lillies and smiths and stevensons fell like moths about a candle and nearly all the sympathetic correspondents deplore and recall the little losses of their own it is impossible to describe the heavnly looks of the dear babe the three last days of his life writes mrs laurie to mrs smith nevernever my dear aunt could i wish to eface the rememberance of this dear child never never my dear aunt and so soon the memory of the dead and the dust of the survivors are buried in one grave  there was another death in 1812 it passes almost unremarked a single funeral seemed but a small event to these veterans in affliction and by 1816 the nursery was full again seven little hopefuls enlivened the house some were growing up to the elder girl my grandfather already wrote notes in current hand at the tail of his letters to his wife and to the elder boys he had begun to print with laborious care sheets of childish gossip and pedantic applications here for instance under date of may 26th 1816 is part of a mythological account of london with a moral for the three gentlemen messieurs alan robert and james stevenson to whom the document is addressed     there are many prisons here like bridewell for like other large    towns there are many bad men here as well as many good men the    natives of london are in general not so tall and strong as the people    of edinburgh because they have not so much pure air and instead of    taking porridge they eat cakes made with sugar and plums here you    have thousands of carts to draw timber thousands of coaches to take    you to all parts of the town and thousands of boats to sail on the    river thames but you must have money to pay otherwise you can get    nothing now the way to get money is become clever men and men of    education by being good scholars  from the same absence he writes to his wife on a sunday     it is now about eight oclock with me and i imagine you to be busy    with the young folks hearing the questions anglicé catechism    and indulging the boys with a chapter from the large bible with    their interrogations and your answers in the soundest doctrine i    hope james is getting his verse as usual and that mary is not    forgetting her little hymn while jeannie will be reading    wotherspoon or some other suitable and instructive book i presume    our friend aunt mary will have just arrived with the news of a    throng kirk a crowded church and a great sermon you may mention    with my compliments to my mother that i was at st pauls today    and attended a very excellent service with mr james lawrie the text    was examine and see that ye be in the faith  a twinkle of humour lights up this evocation of the distant scenethe humour of happy men and happy homes yet it is penned upon the threshold of fresh sorrow james and maryhe of the verse and she of the hymndid not much more than survive to welcome their returning father on the 25th one of the godly women writes to janet     my dearest beloved madam when i last parted from you you was so    affected with your affliction you or i could think of nothing    else but on saturday when i went to inquire after your health how    was i startled to hear that dear james was gone ah what is this my    dear benefactors doing so much good to many to the lord suddenly    to be deprived of their most valued comforts i was thrown into great    perplexity could do nothing but murmur why these things were done    to such a family i could not rest but at midnight whether spoken    or not it was presented to my mindthose whom ye deplore are    walking with me in white i conclude from this the lord saying to    sweet mrs stevenson i gave them to be brought up for me well    done good and faithful they are fully prepared and now i must    present them to my father and your father to my god and your god  it would be hard to lay on flattery with a more sure and daring hand i quote it as a model of a letter of condolence be sure it would console very different perhaps quite as welcome is this from a lighthouse inspector to my grandfather     in reading your letter the trickling tear ran down my cheeks in    silent sorrow for your departed dear ones my sweet little friends    well do i remember and you will call to mind their little innocent    and interesting stories often have they come round me and taken me    by the hand but alas i am no more destined to behold them  the child who is taken becomes canonised and the looks of the homeliest babe seem in the retrospect heavenly the three last days of his life but it appears that james and mary had indeed been children more than usually engaging a record was preserved a long while in the family of their remarks and little innocent and interesting stories and the blow and the blank were the more sensible  early the next month robert stevenson must proceed upon his voyage of inspection part by land part by sea he left his wife plunged in low spirits the thought of his loss and still more of her concern was continually present in his mind and he draws in his letters home an interesting picture of his family relations        windygates inn monday postmark july 16th     my dearest jeanniewhile the people of the inn are getting me a    little bit of something to eat i sit down to tell you that i had a    most excellent passage across the water and got to wemyss at    midday i hope the children will be very good and that robert will    take a course with you to learn his latin lessons daily he may    however read english in company let them have strawberries on    saturdays        westhaven 17th july     i have been occupied today at the harbour of newport opposite    dundee and am this far on my way to arbroath you may tell the boys    that i slept last night in mr steadmans tent i found my bed rather    hard but the lodgings were otherwise extremely comfortable the    encampment is on the fife side of the tay immediately opposite to    dundee from the door of the tent you command the most beautiful view    of the firth both up and down to a great extent at night all was    serene and still the sky presented the most beautiful appearance of    bright stars and the morning was ushered in with the song of many    little birds        aberdeen july 19th     i hope my dear that you are going out of doors regularly and    taking much exercise i would have you to make the markets    dailyand by all means to take a seat in the coach once or twice in    the week and see what is going on in town the family were at the    seaside it will be good not to be too great a stranger to the    house it will be rather painful at first but as it is to be done i    would have you not to be too strange to the house in town     tell the boys that i fell in with a soldierhis name is    hendersonwho was twelve years with lord wellington and other    commanders he returned very lately with only eightpencehalfpenny in    his pocket and found his father and mother both in life though they    had never heard from him nor he from them he carried my greatcoat    and umbrella a few miles        fraserburgh july 20th     fraserburgh is the same dull place which auntie mary and jeannie    found it as i am travelling along the coast which they are    acquainted with you had better cause robert bring down the map from    edinburgh and it will be a good exercise in geography for the young    folks to trace my course i hope they have entered upon the writing    the library will afford abundance of excellent books which i wish    you would employ a little i hope you are doing me the favour to go    much out with the boys which will do you much good and prevent them    from getting so very much overheated      to the boysprinted     when i had last the pleasure of writing to you your dear little    brother james and your sweet little sister mary were still with us    but it has pleased god to remove them to another and a better world    and we must submit to the will of providence i must however    request of you to think sometimes upon them and to be very careful    not to do anything that will displease or vex your mother it is    therefore proper that you do not roamp scottish indeed too much    about and that you learn your lessons     i went to fraserburgh and visited kinnaird head lighthouse which i    found in good order all this time i travelled upon good roads and    paid many a tollman by the way but from fraserburgh to banff there    is no tollbars and the road is so bad that i had to walk up and    down many a hill and for want of bridges the horses had to drag the    chaise up to the middle of the wheels in water at banff i saw a    large ship of 300 tons lying on the sands upon her beamends and a    wreck for want of a good harbour captain wilsonto whom i beg my    complimentswill show you a ship of 300 tons at the towns of    macduff banff and portsoy many of the houses are built of marble    and the rocks on this part of the coast or seaside are marble but    my dear boys unless marble be polished and dressed it is a very    coarselooking stone and has no more beauty than common rock as a    proof of this ask the favour of your mother to take you to thomsons    marble works in south leith and you will see marble in all its    stages and perhaps you may there find portsoy marble the use i wish    to make of this is to tell you that without education a man is just    like a block of rough unpolished marble notice in proof of this    how much mr neill and mr mgregor the tutor know and observe how    little a man knows who is not a good scholar on my way to fochabers    i passed through many thousand acres of fir timber and saw many deer    running in these woods      to mrs stevenson       inverness july 21st     i propose going to church in the afternoon and as i have    breakfasted late i shall afterwards take a walk and dine about six    oclock i do not know who is the clergyman here but i shall think    of you all i travelled in the mailcoach from banff almost alone    while it was daylight i kept the top and the passing along a country    i had never before seen was a considerable amusement but my dear    you are all much in my thoughts and many are the objects which    recall the recollection of our tender and engaging children we have    so recently lost we must not however repine i could not for a    moment wish any change of circumstances in their case and in every    comparative view of their state i see the lords goodness in    removing them from an evil world to an abode of bliss and i must    earnestly hope that you may be enabled to take such a view of this    affliction as to live in the happy prospect of our all meeting again    to part no moreand that under such considerations you are getting    up your spirits i wish you would walk about and by all means go to    town and do not sit much at home        inverness july 23rd     i am duly favoured with your muchvalued letter and i am happy to    find that you are so much with my mother because that sort of    variety has a tendency to occupy the mind and to keep it from    brooding too much upon one subject sensibility and tenderness are    certainly two of the most interesting and pleasing qualities of the    mind these qualities are also none of the least of the many    endearingments of the female character but if that kind of sympathy    and pleasing melancholy which is familiar to us under distress be    much indulged it becomes habitual and takes such a hold of the mind    as to absorb all the other affections and unfit us for the duties    and proper enjoyments of life resignation sinks into a kind of    peevish discontent i am far however from thinking there is the    least danger of this in your case my dear for you have been on all    occasions enabled to look upon the fortunes of this life as under the    direction of a higher power and have always preserved that propriety    and consistency of conduct in all circumstances which endears your    example to your family in particular and to your friends i am    therefore my dear for you to go out much and to go to the house    upstairs he means to go upstairs in the house to visit the place    of the dead children and to put yourself in the way of the visits    of your friends i wish you would call on the miss grays and it    would be a good thing upon a saturday to dine with my mother and    take meggy and all the family with you and let them have their    strawberries in town the tickets of one of the oldfashioned    coaches would take you all up and if the evening were good they    could all walk down excepting meggy and little david        inverness july 25th 11 pm     captain wemyss of wemyss has come to inverness to go the voyage    with me and as we are sleeping in a doublebedded room i must no    longer transgress you must remember me the best way you can to the    children        on board of the lighthouse yacht july 29th     i got to cromarty yesterday about midday and went to church it    happened to be the sacrament there and i heard a mr smith at that    place conclude the service with a very suitable exhortation there    seemed a great concourse of people but they had rather an    unfortunate day for them at the tent as it rained a good deal after    drinking tea at the inn captain wemyss accompanied me on board and    we sailed about eight last night the wind at present being rather a    beating one i think i shall have an opportunity of standing into the    bay of wick and leaving this letter to let you know my progress and    that i am well        lighthouse yacht stornoway august 4th     today we had prayers on deck as usual when at sea i read the 14th    chapter i think of job captain wemyss has been in the habit of    doing this on board his own ship agreeably to the articles of war    our passage round the cape cape wrath was rather a cross one and    as the wind was northerly we had a pretty heavy sea but upon the    whole have made a good passage leaving many vessels behind us in    orkney i am quite well my dear and captain wemyss who has much    spirit and who is much given to observation and a perfect    enthusiast in his profession enlivens the voyage greatly let me    entreat you to move about much and take a walk with the boys to    leith i think they have still many places to see there and i wish    you would indulge them in this respect mr scales is the best person    i know for showing them the sailclothweaving etc and he would    have great pleasure in undertaking this my dear i trust soon to be    with you and that through the goodness of god we shall meet all    well     there are two vessels lying here with emigrants for america each    with eighty people on board at all ages from a few days to upwards    of sixty their prospects must be very forlorn to go with a slender    purse for distant and unknown countries        lighthouse yacht off greenock aug 18th     it was after churchtime before we got here but we had prayers    upon deck on the way up the clyde this has upon the whole been a    very good voyage and captain wemyss who enjoys it much has been an    excellent companion we met with pleasure and shall part with    regret  strange that after his long experience my grandfather should have learned so little of the attitude and even the dialect of the spirituallyminded that after fortyfour years in a most religious circle he could drop without sense of incongruity from a period of accepted phrases to trust his wife was getting up her spirits or think to reassure her as to the character of captain wemyss by mentioning that he had read prayers on the deck of his frigate agreeably to the articles of war yet there is no doubtand it is one of the most agreeable features of the kindly seriesthat he was doing his best to please and there is little doubt that he succeeded almost all my grandfathers private letters have been destroyed this correspondence has not only been preserved entire but stitched up in the same covers with the works of the godly women the reverend john campbell and the painful mrs ogle i did not think to mention the good dame but she comes in usefully as an example amongst the treasures of the ladies of my family her letters have been honoured with a volume to themselves i read about a half of them myself then handed over the task to one of stauncher resolution with orders to communicate any fact that should be found to illuminate these pages not one was found it was her only art to communicate by post secondrate sermons at secondhand and such i take it was the correspondence in which my grandmother delighted if i am right that of robert stevenson with his quaint smack of the contemporary sandford and merton his interest in the whole page of experience his perpetual quest and fine scent of all that seems romantic to a boy his needless pomp of language his excellent good sense his unfeigned unstained unwearied human kindliness would seem to her in a comparison dry and trivial and worldly and if these letters were by an exception cherished and preserved it would be for one or both of two reasonsbecause they dealt with and were bittersweet reminders of a time of sorrow or because she was pleased perhaps touched by the writers guileless efforts to seem spirituallyminded  after this date there were two more births and two more deaths so that the number of the family remained unchanged in all five children survived to reach maturity and to outlive their parents     chapter ii  the service of the northern lights     i  it were hard to imagine a contrast more sharply defined than that between the lives of the men and women of this family the one so chambered so centred in the affections and the sensibilities the other so active healthy and expeditious from may to november thomas smith and robert stevenson were on the mail in the saddle or at sea and my grandfather in particular seems to have been possessed with a demon of activity in travel in 1802 by direction of the northern lighthouse board he had visited the coast of england from st bees in cumberland and round by the scilly islands to some place undecipherable by me in all a distance of 2500 miles in 1806 i find him starting on a tour round the south coast of england from the humber to the severn peace was not long declared ere he found means to visit holland where he was in time to see in the navyyard at helvoetsluys about twenty of bonapartes english flotilla lying in a state of decay the object of curiosity to englishmen by 1834 he seems to have been acquainted with the coast of france from dieppe to bordeaux and a main part of his duty as engineer to the board of northern lights was one round of dangerous and laborious travel  in 1786 when thomas smith first received the appointment the extended and formidable coast of scotland was lighted at a single pointthe isle of may in the jaws of the firth of forth where on a tower already a hundred and fifty years old an open coalfire blazed in an iron chauffer the whole archipelago thus nightly plunged in darkness was shunned by seagoing vessels and the favourite courses were north about shetland and west about st kilda when the board met four new lights formed the extent of their intentionskinnaird head in aberdeenshire at the eastern elbow of the coast north ronaldsay in orkney to keep the north and guide ships passing to the southard of shetland island glass on harris to mark the inner shore of the hebrides and illuminate the navigation of the minch and the mull of kintyre these works were to be attempted against obstacles material and financial that might have staggered the most bold smith had no ship at his command till 1791 the roads in those outlandish quarters where his business lay were scarce passable when they existed and the tower on the mull of kintyre stood eleven months unlighted while the apparatus toiled and foundered by the way among rocks and mosses not only had towers to be built and apparatus transplanted the supply of oil must be maintained and the men fed in the same inaccessible and distant scenes a whole service with its routine and hierarchy had to be called out of nothing and a new trade that of lightkeeper to be taught recruited and organised the funds of the board were at the first laughably inadequate they embarked on their career on a loan of twelve hundred pounds and their income in 1789 after relief by a fresh act of parliament amounted to less than three hundred it must be supposed that the thoughts of thomas smith in these early years were sometimes coloured with despair and since he built and lighted one tower after another and created and bequeathed to his successors the elements of an excellent administration it may be conceded that he was not after all an unfortunate choice for a first engineer  war added fresh complications in 1794 smith came very near to be taken by a french squadron in 1813 robert stevenson was cruising about the neighbourhood of cape wrath in the immediate fear of commodore rogers the men and especially the sailors of the lighthouse service must be protected by a medal and ticket from the brutal activity of the pressgang and the zeal of volunteer patriots was at times embarrassing     i set off on foot writes my grandfather for marazion a town at    the head of mounts bay where i was in hopes of getting a boat to    freight i had just got that length and was making the necessary    inquiry when a young man accompanied by several idlelooking    fellows came up to me and in a hasty tone said sir in the kings    name i seize your person and papers to which i replied that i    should be glad to see his authority and know the reason of an    address so abrupt he told me the want of time prevented his taking    regular steps but that it would be necessary for me to return to    penzance as i was suspected of being a french spy i proposed to    submit my papers to the nearest justice of peace who was immediately    applied to and came to the inn where i was he seemed to be greatly    agitated and quite at a loss how to proceed the complaint preferred    against me was that i had examined the longships lighthouse with the    most minute attention and was no less particular in my inquiries at    the keepers of the lighthouse regarding the sunk rocks lying off the    lands end with the sets of the currents and tides along the coast    that i seemed particularly to regret the situation of the rocks    called the seven stones and the loss of a beacon which the trinity    board had caused to be fixed on the wolf rock that i had taken notes    of the bearings of several sunk rocks and a drawing of the    lighthouse and of cape cornwall further that i had refused the    honour of lord edgecombes invitation to dinner offering as an    apology that i had some particular business on hand  my grandfather produced in answer his credentials and letter of credit but the justice after perusing them very gravely observed that they were musty bits of paper and proposed to maintain the arrest some more enlightened magistrates at penzance relieved him of suspicion and left him at liberty to pursue his journeywhich i did with so much eagerness he adds that i gave the two coal lights on the lizard only a very transient look  lighthouse operations in scotland differed essentially in character from those in england the english coast is in comparison a habitable homely place well supplied with towns the scottish presents hundreds of miles of savage islands and desolate moors the parliamentary committee of 1834 profoundly ignorant of this distinction insisted with my grandfather that the work at the various stations should be let out on contract in the neighbourhood where sheep and deer and gulls and cormorants and a few ragged gillies perhaps crouching in a beehive house made up the only neighbours in such situations repairs and improvements could only be overtaken by collecting as my grandfather expressed it a few lads placing them under charge of a foreman and despatching them about the coast as occasion served the particular danger of these seas increased the difficulty the course of the lighthouse tender lies amid ironbound coasts among tideraces the whirlpools of the pentland firth flocks of islands flocks of reefs many of them uncharted the aid of steam was not yet at first in random coasting sloop and afterwards in the cutter belonging to the service the engineer must ply and run amongst these multiplied dangers and sometimes late into the stormy autumn for pages together my grandfathers diary preserves a record of these rude experiences of hard winds and rough seas and of the trysail and stormjib those old friends which i never like to see they do not tempt to quotation but it was the mans element in which he lived and delighted to live and some specimen must be presented on friday september 10th 1830 the regent lying in lerwick bay we have this entry the gale increases with continued rain on the morrow saturday 11th the weather appeared to moderate and they put to sea only to be driven by evening into levenswick there they lay rolling much with both anchors ahead and the square yard on deck till the morning of saturday 18th saturday and sunday they were plying to the southward with a strong breeze and a heavy sea and on sunday evening anchored in otterswick monday 20th it blows so fresh that we have no communication with the shore we see mr rome on the beach but we cannot communicate with him it blows mere fire as the sailors express it and for three days more the diary goes on with tales of davits unshipped high seas strong gales from the southward and the ship driven to refuge in kirkwall or deer sound i have many a passage before me to transcribe in which my grandfather draws himself as a man of minute and anxious exactitude about details it must not be forgotten that these voyages in the tender were the particular pleasure and reward of his existence that he had in him a reserve of romance which carried him delightedly over these hardships and perils that to him it was great gain to be eight nights and seven days in the savage bay of levenswickto read a book in the much agitated cabinto go on deck and hear the gale scream in his ears and see the landscape dark with rain and the ship plunge at her two anchorsand to turn in at night and wake again at morning in his narrow berth to the clamorous and continued voices of the gale  his perils and escapes were beyond counting i shall only refer to two the first because of the impression made upon himself the second from the incidental picture it presents of the north islanders on the 9th october 1794 he took passage from orkney in the sloop elizabeth of stromness she made a fair passage till within view of kinnaird head where as she was becalmed some three miles in the offing and wind seemed to threaten from the southeast the captain landed him to continue his journey more expeditiously ashore a gale immediately followed and the elizabeth was driven back to orkney and lost with all hands the second escape i have been in the habit of hearing related by an eyewitness my own father from the earliest days of childhood on a september night the regent lay in the pentland firth in a fog and a violent and windless swell it was still dark when they were alarmed by the sound of breakers and an anchor was immediately let go the peep of dawn discovered them swinging in desperate proximity to the isle of swona10 and the surf bursting close under their stern there was in this place a hamlet of the inhabitants fisherfolk and wreckers their huts stood close about the head of the beach all slept the doors were closed and there was no smoke and the anxious watchers on board ship seemed to contemplate a village of the dead it was thought possible to launch a boat and tow the regent from her place of danger and with this view a signal of distress was made and a gun fired with a redhot poker from the galley its detonation awoke the sleepers door after door was opened and in the grey light of the morning fisher after fisher was seen to come forth yawning and stretching himself nightcap on head fisher after fisher i wrote and my pen tripped for it should rather stand wrecker after wrecker there was no emotion no animation it scarce seemed any interest not a hand was raised but all callously awaited the harvest of the sea and their children stood by their side and waited also to the end of his life my father remembered that amphitheatre of placid spectators on the beach and with a special and natural animosity the boys of his own age but presently a light air sprang up and filled the sails and fainted and filled them again and little by little the regent fetched way against the swell and clawed off shore into the turbulent firth  the purpose of these voyages was to effect a landing on open beaches or among shelving rocks not for persons only but for coals and food and the fragile furniture of lightrooms it was often impossible in 1831 i find my grandfather hovering for a week about the pentland skerries for a chance to land and it was almost always difficult much knack and enterprise were early developed among the seamen of the service their management of boats is to this day a matter of admiration and i find my grandfather in his diary depicting the nature of their excellence in one happily descriptive phrase when he remarks that captain soutar had landed the small stores and nine casks of oil with all the activity of a smuggler and it was one thing to land another to get on board again i have here a passage from the diary where it seems to have been touchandgo i landed at tarbetness on the eastern side of the point in a mere gale or blast of wind from westsouthwest at 2 pm it blew so fresh that the captain in a kind of despair went off to the ship leaving myself and the steward ashore while i was in the lightroom i felt it shaking and waving not with the tremor of the bell rock but with the waving of a tree this the lightkeepers seemed to be quite familiar to the principal keeper remarking that it was very pleasant perhaps meaning interesting or curious the captain worked the vessel into smooth water with admirable dexterity and i got on board again about 6 pm from the other side of the point but not even the dexterity of soutar could prevail always and my grandfather must at times have been left in strange berths and with but rude provision i may instance the case of my father who was stormbound three days upon an islet sleeping in the uncemented and unchimneyed houses of the islanders and subsisting on a diet of nettlesoup and lobsters  the name of soutar has twice escaped my pen and i feel i owe him a vignette soutar first attracted notice as mate of a praam at the bell rock and rose gradually to be captain of the regent he was active admirably skilled in his trade and a man incapable of fear once in london he fell among a gang of confidencemen naturally deceived by his rusticity and his prodigious accent they plied him with drinka hopeless enterprise for soutar could not be made drunk they proposed cards and soutar would not play at last one of them regarding him with a formidable countenance inquired if he were not frightened im no very easy fleyed replied the captain and the rooks withdrew after some easier pigeon so many perils shared and the partial familiarity of so many voyages had given this man a stronghold in my grandfathers estimation and there is no doubt but he had the art to court and please him with much hypocritical skill he usually dined on sundays in the cabin he used to come down daily after dinner for a glass of port or whisky often in his full rig of souwester oilskins and long boots and i have often heard it described how insinuatingly he carried himself on these appearances artfully combining the extreme of deference with a blunt and seamanlike demeanour my father and uncles with the devilish penetration of the boy were far from being deceived and my father indeed was favoured with an objectlesson not to be mistaken he had crept one rainy night into an applebarrel on deck and from this place of ambush overheard soutar and a comrade conversing in their oilskins the smooth sycophant of the cabin had wholly disappeared and the boy listened with wonder to a vulgar and truculent ruffian of soutar i may say tantum vidi having met him in the leith docks now more than thirty years ago when he abounded in the praises of my grandfather encouraged me in the most admirable manner to pursue his footprints and left impressed for ever on my memory the image of his own bardolphian nose he died not long after  the engineer was not only exposed to the hazards of the sea he must often ford his way by land to remote and scarce accessible places beyond reach of the mail or the postchaise beyond even the tracery of the bridlepath and guided by natives across bog and heather up to 1807 my grandfather seems to have travelled much on horseback but he then gave up the ideasuch he writes with characteristic emphasis and capital letters is the plague of baiting he was a good pedestrian at the age of fiftyeight i find him covering seventeen miles over the moors of the mackay country in less than seven hours and that is not bad travelling for a scramble the piece of country traversed was already a familiar track being that between loch eriboll and cape wrath and i think i can scarce do better than reproduce from the diary some traits of his first visit the tender lay in loch eriboll by five in the morning they sat down to breakfast on board by six they were ashoremy grandfather mr slight an assistant and soutar of the jolly nose and had been taken in charge by two young gentlemen of the neighbourhood and a pair of gillies about noon they reached the kyle of durness and passed the ferry by halfpast three they were at cape wrathnot yet known by the emphatic abbreviation of the capeand beheld upon all sides of them unfrequented shores an expanse of desert moor and the highpiled western ocean the site of the tower was chosen perhaps it is by inheritance of blood but i know few things more inspiriting than this location of a lighthouse in a designated space of heather and air through which the seabirds are still flying by 9 pm the return journey had brought them again to the shores of the kyle the night was dirty and as the sea was high and the ferryboat small soutar and mr stevenson were left on the far side while the rest of the party embarked and were received into the darkness they made in fact a safe though an alarming passage but the ferryman refused to repeat the adventure and my grandfather and the captain long paced the beach impatient for their turn to pass and tormented with rising anxiety as to the fate of their companions at length they sought the shelter of a shepherds house we had miserable upputting the diary continues and on both sides of the ferry much anxiety of mind our beds were clean straw and but for the circumstance of the boat i should have slept as soundly as ever i did after a walk through moss and mire of sixteen hours  to go round the lights even today is to visit past centuries the tide of tourists that flows yearly in scotland vulgarising all where it approaches is still defined by certain barriers it will be long ere there is a hotel at sumburgh or a hydropathic at cape wrath it will be long ere any charàbanc laden with tourists shall drive up to barra head or monach the island of the monks they are farther from london than st petersburg and except for the towers sounding and shining all night with fogbells and the radiance of the lightroom glittering by day with the trivial brightness of white paint these island and moorland stations seem inaccessible to the civilisation of today and even to the end of my grandfathers career the isolation was far greater there ran no post at all in the long island from the lighthouse on barra head a boat must be sent for letters as far as tobermory between sixty and seventy miles of open sea and the posts of shetland which had surprised sir walter scott in 1814 were still unimproved in 1833 when my grandfather reported on the subject the group contained at the time a population of 30000 souls and enjoyed a trade which had increased in twenty years sevenfold to between three and four thousand tons yet the mails were despatched and received by chance coasting vessels at the rate of a penny a letter six and eight weeks often elapsed between opportunities and when a mail was to be made up sometimes at a moments notice the bellman was sent hastily through the streets of lerwick between shetland and orkney only seventy miles apart there was no trade communication whatever  such was the state of affairs only sixty years ago with the three largest clusters of the scottish archipelago and fortyseven years earlier when thomas smith began his rounds or fortytwo when robert stevenson became conjoined with him in these excursions the barbarism was deep the people sunk in superstition the circumstances of their life perhaps unique in history lerwick and kirkwall like guam or the bay of islands were but barbarous ports where whalers called to take up and to return experienced seamen on the outlying islands the clergy lived isolated thinking other thoughts dwelling in a different country from their parishioners like missionaries in the south seas my grandfathers unrivalled treasury of anecdote was never written down it embellished his talk while he yet was and died with him when he died and such as have been preserved relate principally to the islands of ronaldsay and sanday two of the orkney group these bordered on one of the waterhighways of civilisation a great fleet passed annually in their view and of the shipwrecks of the world they were the scene and cause of a proportion wholly incommensurable to their size in one year 1798 my grandfather found the remains of no fewer than five vessels on the isle of sanday which is scarcely twelve miles long     hardly a year passed he writes without instances of this kind    for owing to the projecting points of this strangely formed island    the lowness and whiteness of its eastern shores and the wonderful    manner in which the scanty patches of land are intersected with lakes    and pools of water it becomes even in daylight a deception and    has often been fatally mistaken for an open sea it had even become    proverbial with some of the inhabitants to observe that if wrecks    were to happen they might as well be sent to the poor isle of sanday    as anywhere else on this and the neighbouring islands the    inhabitants had certainly had their share of wrecked goods for the    eye is presented with these melancholy remains in almost every form    for example although quarries are to be met with generally in these    islands and the stones are very suitable for building dykes    anglicé walls yet instances occur of the land being enclosed    even to a considerable extent with shiptimbers the author has    actually seen a park anglicé meadow paled round chiefly with    cedarwood and mahogany from the wreck of a hondurasbuilt ship and    in one island after the wreck of a ship laden with wine the    inhabitants have been known to take claret to their barleymeal    porridge on complaining to one of the pilots of the badness of his    boats sails he replied to the author with some degree of    pleasantry had it been his will that you camena here wi your    lights we might a had better sails to our boats and more o other    things it may further be mentioned that when some of lord dundass    farms are to be let in these islands a competition takes place for    the lease and it is bona fide understood that a much higher rent    is paid than the lands would otherwise give were it not for the    chance of making considerably by the agency and advantages attending    shipwrecks on the shores of the respective farms  the people of north ronaldsay still spoke norse or rather mixed it with their english the walls of their huts were built to a great thickness of rounded stones from the seabeach the roof flagged loaded with earth and perforated by a single hole for the escape of smoke the grass grew beautifully green on the flat housetop where the family would assemble with their dogs and cats as on a pastoral lawn there were no windows and in my grandfathers expression there was really no demonstration of a house unless it were the diminutive door he once landed on ronaldsay with two friends the inhabitants crowded and pressed so much upon the strangers that the bailiff or resident factor of the island blew with his oxhorn calling out to the natives to stand off and let the gentlemen come forward to the laird upon which one of the islanders as spokesman called out god hae us man thou needsna mak sic a noise its no every day we hae three hatted men on our isle when the surveyor of taxes came for the first time perhaps to sanday and began in the kings name to complain of the unconscionable swarms of dogs and to menace the inhabitants with taxation it chanced that my grandfather and his friend dr patrick neill were received by an old lady in a ronaldsay hut her hut which was similar to the model described stood on a ness or point of land jutting into the sea they were made welcome in the firelit cellar placed in casey or strawworked chairs after the norwegian fashion with arms and a canopy overhead and given milk in a wooden dish these hospitalities attended to the old lady turned at once to dr neill whom she took for the surveyor of taxes sir said she gin yell tell the king that i canna keep the ness free o the bangers sheep without twa huns and twa guid huns too hell pass me threa the tax on dugs  this familiar confidence these traits of engaging simplicity are characters of a secluded people mankindand above all islanderscome very swiftly to a bearing and find very readily upon one convention or another a tolerable corporate life the danger is to those from without who have not grown up from childhood in the islands but appear suddenly in that narrow horizon lifesized apparitions for these no bond of humanity exists no feeling of kinship is awakened by their peril they will assist at a shipwreck like the fisherfolk of lunga as spectators and when the fatal scene is over and the beach strewn with dead bodies they will fence their fields with mahogany and after a decent grace sup claret to their porridge it is not wickedness it is scarce evil it is only in its highest power the sense of isolation and the wise disinterestedness of feeble and poor races think how many viking ships had sailed by these islands in the past how many vikings had landed and raised turmoil and broken up the barrows of the dead and carried off the wines of the living and blame them if you are able for that belief which may be called one of the parables of the devils gospel that a man rescued from the sea will prove the bane of his deliverer it might be thought that my grandfather coming there unknown and upon an employment so hateful to the inhabitants must have run the hazard of his life but this were to misunderstand he came franked by the laird and the clergyman he was the kings officer the work was opened with prayer by the rev walter trail minister of the parish god and the king had decided it and the people of these pious islands bowed their heads there landed indeed in north ronaldsay during the last decade of the eighteenth century a traveller whose life seems really to have been imperilled a very little man of a swarthy complexion he came ashore exhausted and unshaved from a long boat passage and lay down to sleep in the home of the parish schoolmaster but he had been seen landing the inhabitants had identified him for a pict as by some singular confusion of name they called the dark and dwarfish aboriginal people of the land immediately the obscure ferment of a racehatred grown into a superstition began to work in their bosoms and they crowded about the house and the roomdoor with fearful whisperings for some time the schoolmaster held them at bay and at last despatched a messenger to call my grandfather he came he found the islanders beside themselves at this unwelcome resurrection of the dead and the detested he was shown as adminicular of testimony the travellers uncouth and thicksoled boots he argued and finding argument unavailing consented to enter the room and examine with his own eyes the sleeping pict one glance was sufficient the man was now a missionary but he had been before that an edinburgh shopkeeper with whom my grandfather had dealt he came forth again with this report and the folk of the island wholly relieved dispersed to their own houses they were timid as sheep and ignorant as limpets that was all but the lord deliver us from the tender mercies of a frightened flock  i will give two more instances of their superstition when sir walter scott visited the stones of stennis my grandfather put in his pocket a hundredfoot line which he unfortunately lost     some years afterwards he writes one of my assistants on a visit    to the stones of stennis took shelter from a storm in a cottage close    by the lake and seeing a boxmeasuringline in the bole or sole of    the cottage window he asked the woman where she got this wellknown    professional appendage she said o sir ane of the bairns fand it    lang syne at the stanes and when drawing it out we took fright and    thinking it had belanged to the fairies we threw it into the bole    and it has layen there ever since  this is for the one the last shall be a sketch by the master hand of scott himself     at the village of stromness on the orkney main island called    pomona lived in 1814 an aged dame called bessie millie who helped    out her subsistence by selling favourable winds to mariners he was a    venturous master of a vessel who left the roadstead of stromness    without paying his offering to propitiate bessie millie her fee was    extremely moderate being exactly sixpence for which she boiled her    kettle and gave the bark the advantage of her prayers for she    disclaimed all unlawful acts the wind thus petitioned for was sure    she said to arrive though occasionally the mariners had to wait    some time for it the womans dwelling and appearance were not    unbecoming her pretensions her house which was on the brow of the    steep hill on which stromness is founded was only accessible by a    series of dirty and precipitous lanes and for exposure might have    been the abode of eolus himself in whose commodities the inhabitant    dealt she herself was as she told us nearly one hundred years old    withered and dried up like a mummy a claycoloured kerchief folded    round her neck corresponded in colour to her corpselike complexion    two light blue eyes that gleamed with a lustre like that of insanity    an utterance of astonishing rapidity a nose and chin that almost met    together and a ghastly expression of cunning gave her the effect of    hecate such was bessie millie to whom the mariners paid a sort of    tribute with a feeling between jest and earnest     ii  from about the beginning of the century up to 1807 robert stevenson was in partnership with thomas smith in the lastnamed year the partnership was dissolved thomas smith returning to his business and my grandfather becoming sole engineer to the board of northern lights  i must try by excerpts from his diary and correspondence to convey to the reader some idea of the ardency and thoroughness with which he threw himself into the largest and least of his multifarious engagements in this service but first i must say a word or two upon the life of lightkeepers and the temptations to which they are more particularly exposed the lightkeeper occupies a position apart among men in seatowers the complement has always been three since the deplorable business in the eddystone when one keeper died and the survivor signalling in vain for relief was compelled to live for days with the dead body these usually pass their time by the pleasant human expedient of quarrelling and sometimes i am assured not one of the three is on speaking terms with any other on shore stations which on the scottish coast are sometimes hardly less isolated the usual number is two a principal and an assistant the principal is dissatisfied with the assistant or perhaps the assistant keeps pigeons and the principal wants the water from the roof their wives and families are with them living cheek by jowl the children quarrel jockie hits jimsie in the eye and the mothers make haste to mingle in the dissension perhaps there is trouble about a broken dish perhaps mrs assistant is more highly born than mrs principal and gives herself airs and the men are drawn in and the servants presently follow church privileges have been denied the keepers and the assistants servants i read in one case and the eminently scots periphrasis means neither more nor less than excommunication on account of the discordant and quarrelsome state of the families the cause when inquired into proves to be tittletattle on both sides the tender comes round the foremen and artificers go from station to station the gossip flies through the whole system of the service and the stories disfigured and exaggerated return to their own birthplace with the returning tender the english board was apparently shocked by the picture of these dissensions when the trinity house can i find my grandfather writing at beachy head in 1834 they do not appoint two keepers they disagree so ill a man who has a family is assisted by his family and in this way to my experience and present observation the business is very much neglected one keeper is in my view a bad system this days visit to an english lighthouse convinces me of this as the lightkeeper was walking on a staff with the gout and the business performed by one of his daughters a girl of thirteen or fourteen years of age this man received a hundred a year it shows a different reading of human nature perhaps typical of scotland and england that i find in my grandfathers diary the following pregnant entry the lightkeepers agreeing ill keep one another to their duty but the scottish system was not alone founded on this cynical opinion the dignity and the comfort of the northern lightkeeper were both attended to he had a uniform to raise him in his own estimation and in that of his neighbour which is of consequence to a person of trust the keepers my grandfather goes on in another place are attended to in all the detail of accommodation in the best style as shipmasters and this is believed to have a sensible effect upon their conduct and to regulate their general habits as members of society he notes with the same dip of ink that the brasses were not clean and the persons of the keepers not trig and thus we find him writing to a culprit i have to complain that you are not cleanly in your person and that your manner of speech is ungentle and rather inclines to rudeness you must therefore take a different view of your duties as a lightkeeper a high ideal for the service appears in these expressions and will be more amply illustrated further on but even the scottish lightkeeper was frail during the unbroken solitude of the winter months when inspection is scarce possible it must seem a vain toil to polish the brass handrail of the stair or to keep an unrewarded vigil in the lightroom and the keepers are habitually tempted to the beginnings of sloth and must unremittingly resist he who temporises with his conscience is already lost i must tell here an anecdote that illustrates the difficulties of inspection in the days of my uncle david and my father there was a station which they regarded with jealousy the two engineers compared notes and were agreed the tower was always clean but seemed always to bear traces of a hasty cleansing as though the keepers had been suddenly forewarned on inquiry it proved that such was the case and that a wandering fiddler was the unfailing harbinger of the engineer at last my father was stormstayed one sunday in a port at the other side of the island the visit was quite overdue and as he walked across upon the monday morning he promised himself that he should at last take the keepers unprepared they were both waiting for him in uniform at the gate the fiddler had been there on saturday  my grandfather as will appear from the following extracts was much a martinet and had a habit of expressing himself on paper with an almost startling emphasis personally with his powerful voice sanguine countenance and eccentric and original locutions he was well qualified to inspire a salutary terror in the service     i find that the keepers have by some means or another got into the    way of cleaning too much with rottenstone and oil i take the    principal keeper to task on this subject and make him bring a    clean towel and clean one of the brazen frames which leaves the    towel in an odious state this towel i put up in a sheet of paper    seal and take with me to confront mr murdoch who has just left the    station this lettera stern enumeration of complaintsto lie a    week on the lightroom bookplace and to be put in the inspectors    hands when he comes round it is the most painful thing that can    occur for me to have a correspondence of this kind with any of the    keepers and when i come to the lighthouse instead of having the    satisfaction to meet them with approbation it is distressing when    one is obliged to put on a most angry countenance and demeanour but    from such culpable negligence as you have shown there is no avoiding    it i hold it as a fixed maxim that when a man or a family put on a    slovenly appearance in their houses stairs and lanterns i always    find their reflectors burners windows and light in general ill    attended to and therefore i must insist on cleanliness    throughout i find you very deficient in the duty of the high    tower you thus place your appointment as principal keeper in    jeopardy and i think it necessary as an old servant of the board    to put you upon your guard once for all at this time i call upon you    to recollect what was formerly and is now said to you the state of    the backs of the reflectors at the high tower was disgraceful as i    pointed out to you on the spot they were as if spitten upon and    greasy fingermarks upon the back straps i demand an explanation of    this state of things the cause of the commissioners dismissing you    is expressed in the minute and it must be a matter of regret to you    that you have been so much engaged in smuggling and also that the    reports relative to the cleanliness of the lighthouse upon being    referred to rather added to their unfavourable opinion i do not    go into the dwellinghouse but severely chide the lightkeepers for    the disagreement that seems to subsist among them the families of    the two lightkeepers here agree very ill i have effected a    reconciliation for the present things are in a very humdrum    state here there is no painting and in and out of doors no taste or    tidiness displayed roberts wife greets and mgregors scolds and    robert is so downhearted that he says he is unfit for duty i told    him that if he was to mind wives quarrels and to take them up the    only way was for him and mgregor to go down to the point like sir g    grant and lord somerset i cannot say that i have experienced a    more unpleasant meeting than that of the lighthouse folks this    morning or ever saw a stronger example of unfeeling barbarity than    the conduct which the s exhibited these two coldhearted    persons not contented with having driven the daughter of the poor    nervous woman from her fathers house both kept pouncing at her    lest she should forget her great misfortune write me of their    conduct do not make any communication of the state of these families    at kinnaird head as this would be like talebearing  there is the great word out tales and talebearing always with the emphatic capitals run continually in his correspondence i will give but two instances     write to david one of the lightkeepers and caution him to be more    prudent how he expresses himself let him attend his duty to the    lighthouse and his family concerns and give less heed to    talebearers i have not your last letter at hand to quote its    date but if i recollect it contains some kind of tales which    nonsense i wish you would lay aside and notice only the concerns of    your family and the important charge committed to you  apparently however my grandfather was not himself inaccessible to the talebearer as the following indicates     inwalking along with mr  i explain to him that i should be    under the necessity of looking more closely into the business here    from his conduct at buddonness which had given an instance of    weakness in the moral principle which had staggered my opinion of    him his answer was that will be with regard to the lass i told    him i was to enter no farther with him upon the subject mr miller    appears to be master and man i am sorry about this foolish fellow    had i known his train i should not as i did have rather forced him    into the service upon finding the windows in the state they were i    turned upon mr watt and especially upon mr stewart the latter did    not appear for a length of time to have visited the lightroom on    asking the causedid mr watt and him sic disagree he said no    but he had got very bad usage from the assistant who was a very    obstreperous man i could not bring mr watt to put in language his    objections to miller all i could get was that he being your friend    and saying he was unwell he did not like to complain or to push the    man that the man seemed to have no liking to anything like work    that he was unruly that being an educated man he despised them i    was however determined to have out of these unwilling witnesses    the language alluded to i fixed upon mr stewart as chief he    hedged my curiosity increased and i urged then he said what    would i think just exactly of mr watt being called an old b    you may judge of my surprise there was not another word uttered    this was quite enough as coming from a person i should have    calculated upon quite different behaviour from it spoke a volume of    the mans mind and want of principle object to the keeper keeping    a bullterrier dog of ferocious appearance it is dangerous as we    land at all times of the night have only to complain of the    storehouse floor being spotted with oil give orders for this being    instantly rectified so that on my return tomorrow i may see things    in good order the furniture of both houses wants much rubbing    mrs s carpets are absurd beyond anything i have seen i want    her to turn the fenders up with the bottom to the fireplace the    carpets when not likely to be in use folded up and laid as a    hearthrug partly under the fender  my grandfather was king in the service to his fingertips all should go in his way from the principal lightkeepers coat to the assistants fender from the gravel in the gardenwalks to the bad smell in the kitchen or the oilspots on the storeroom floor it might be thought there was nothing more calculated to awake mens resentment and yet his rule was not more thorough than it was beneficent his thought for the keepers was continual and it did not end with their lives he tried to manage their successions he thought no pains too great to arrange between a widow and a son who had succeeded his father he was often harassed and perplexed by tales of hardship and i find him writing almost in despair of their improvident habits and the destitution that awaited their families upon a death the house being completely furnished they come into possession without necessaries and they go out naked the insurance seems to have failed and what next is to be tried while they lived he wrote behind their backs to arrange for the education of their children or to get them other situations if they seemed unsuitable for the northern lights when he was at a lighthouse on a sunday he held prayers and heard the children read when a keeper was sick he lent him his horse and sent him mutton and brandy from the ship the assistants wife having been this morning confined there was sent ashore a bottle of sherry and a few rusksa practice which i have always observed in this service he writes they dwelt many of them in uninhabited isles or desert forelands totally cut off from shops many of them were besides fallen into a rustic dishabitude of life so that even when they visited a city they could scarce be trusted with their own affairs as for example he who carried home to his children thinking they were oranges a bag of lemons and my grandfather seems to have acted at least in his early years as a kind of gratuitous agent for the service thus i find him writing to a keeper in 1806 when his mind was already preoccupied with arrangements for the bell rock i am much afraid i stand very unfavourably with you as a man of promise as i was to send several things of which i believe i have more than once got the memorandum all i can say is that in this respect you are not singular this makes me no better but really i have been driven about beyond all example in my past experience and have been essentially obliged to neglect my own urgent affairs no servant of the northern lights came to edinburgh but he was entertained at baxters place to breakfast there at his own table my grandfather sat down delightedly with his broadspoken homespun officers his whole relation to the service was in fact patriarchal and i believe i may say that throughout its ranks he was adored i have spoken with many who knew him i was his grandson and their words may have very well been words of flattery but there was one thing that could not be affected and that was the look and light that came into their faces at the name of robert stevenson  in the early part of the century the foreman builder was a young man of the name of george peebles a native of anstruther my grandfather had placed in him a very high degree of confidence and he was already designated to be foreman at the bell rock when on christmasday 1806 on his way home from orkney he was lost in the schooner traveller the tale of the loss of the traveller is almost a replica of that of the elizabeth of stromness like the elizabeth she came as far as kinnaird head was then surprised by a storm driven back to orkney and bilged and sank on the island of flotta it seems it was about the dusk of the day when the ship struck and many of the crew and passengers were drowned about the same hour my grandfather was in his office at the writingtable and the room beginning to darken he laid down his pen and fell asleep in a dream he saw the door open and george peebles come in reeling to and fro and staggering like a drunken man with water streaming from his head and body to the floor there it gathered into a wave which sweeping forward submerged my grandfather well no matter how deep versions vary and at last he awoke and behold it was a dream but it may be conceived how profoundly the impression was written even on the mind of a man averse from such ideas when the news came of the wreck on flotta and the death of george  georges vouchers and accounts had perished with himself and it appeared he was in debt to the commissioners but my grandfather wrote to orkney twice collected evidence of his disbursements and proved him to be seventy pounds ahead with this sum he applied to georges brothers and had it apportioned between their mother and themselves he approached the board and got an annuity of £5 bestowed on the widow peebles and we find him writing her a long letter of explanation and advice and pressing on her the duty of making a will that he should thus act executor was no singular instance but besides this we are able to assist at some of the stages of a rather touching experiment no less than an attempt to secure charles peebles heir to georges favour he is despatched under the character of a fine young man recommended to gentlemen for advice as hes a stranger in your place and indeed to this kind of charge this being his first outset as foreman and for a long while after the letterbook in the midst of that thrilling first year of the bell rock is encumbered with pages of instruction and encouragement the nature of a bill and the precautions that are to be observed about discounting it are expounded at length and with clearness you are not i hope neglecting charles to work the harbour at springtides and see that you pay the greatest attention to get the well so as to supply the keeper with water for he is a very helpless fellow and so unfond of hard work that i fear he could do ill to keep himself in water by going to the other side for itwith regard to spirits charles i see very little occasion for it these abrupt apostrophes sound to me like the voice of an awakened conscience but they would seem to have reverberated in vain in the ears of charles there was trouble in pladda his scene of operations his men ran away from him there was at least a talk of calling in the sheriff i fear writes my grandfather you have been too indulgent and i am sorry to add that men do not answer to be too well treated a circumstance which i have experienced and which you will learn as you go on in business i wonder was not charles peebles himself a case in point either death at least or disappointment and discharge must have ended his service in the northern lights and in later correspondence i look in vain for any mention of his namecharles i mean not peebles for as late as 1839 my grandfather is patiently writing to another of the family i am sorry you took the trouble of applying to me about your son as it lies quite out of my way to forward his views in the line of his profession as a draper     iii  a professional life of robert stevenson has been already given to the world by his son david and to that i would refer those interested in such matters but my own design which is to represent the man would be very ill carried out if i suffered myself or my reader to forget that he was first of all and last of all an engineer his chief claim to the style of a mechanical inventor is on account of the jib or balance crane of the bell rock which are beautiful contrivances but the great merit of this engineer was not in the field of engines he was above all things a projector of works in the face of nature and a modifier of nature itself a road to be made a tower to be built a harbour to be constructed a river to be trained and guided in its channelthese were the problems with which his mind was continually occupied and for these and similar ends he travelled the world for more than half a century like an artist notebook in hand  he once stood and looked on at the emptying of a certain oiltube he did so watch in hand and accurately timed the operation and in so doing offered the perfect type of his profession the fact acquired might never be of use it was acquired another link in the worlds huge chain of processes was brought down to figures and placed at the service of the engineer the very term mensuration sounds engineerlike i find him writing and in truth what the engineer most properly deals with is that which can be measured weighed and numbered the time of any operation in hours and minutes its cost in pounds shillings and pence the strain upon a given point in footpoundsthese are his conquests with which he must continually furnish his mind and which after he has acquired them he must continually apply and exercise they must be not only entries in notebooks to be hurriedly consulted in the actors phrase he must be stale in them in a word of my grandfathers they must be fixed in the mind like the ten fingers and ten toes  these are the certainties of the engineer so far he finds a solid footing and clear views but the province of formulas and constants is restricted even the mechanical engineer comes at last to an end of his figures and must stand up a practical man face to face with the discrepancies of nature and the hiatuses of theory after the machine is finished and the steam turned on the next is to drive it and experience and an exquisite sympathy must teach him where a weight should be applied or a nut loosened with the civil engineer more properly so called if anything can be proper with this awkward coinage the obligation starts with the beginning he is always the practical man the rains the winds and the waves the complexity and the fitfulness of nature are always before him he has to deal with the unpredictable with those forces in smeatons phrase that are subject to no calculation and still he must predict still calculate them at his peril his work is not yet in being and he must foresee its influence how it shall deflect the tide exaggerate the waves dam back the rainwater or attract the thunderbolt he visits a piece of seaboard and from the inclination and soil of the beach from the weeds and shellfish from the configuration of the coast and the depth of soundings outside he must deduce what magnitude of waves is to be looked for he visits a river its summer water babbling on shallows and he must not only read in a thousand indications the measure of winter freshets but be able to predict the violence of occasional great floods nay and more he must not only consider that which is but that which may be thus i find my grandfather writing in a report on the north esk bridge a less waterway might have sufficed but the valleys may come to be meliorated by drainage one field drained after another through all that confluence of vales and we come to a time when they shall precipitate by so much a more copious and transient flood as the gush of the flowing drainpipe is superior to the leakage of a peat  it is plain there is here but a restricted use for formulas in this sort of practice the engineer has need of some transcendental sense smeaton the pioneer bade him obey his feelings my father that power of estimating obscure forces which supplies a coefficient of its own to every rule the rules must be everywhere indeed but they must everywhere be modified by this transcendental coefficient everywhere bent to the impression of the trained eye and the feelings of the engineer a sentiment of physical laws and of the scale of nature which shall have been strong in the beginning and progressively fortified by observation must be his guide in the last recourse i had the most opportunity to observe my father he would pass hours on the beach brooding over the waves counting them noting their least deflection noting when they broke on tweedside or by lyne or manor we have spent together whole afternoons to me at the time extremely wearisome to him as i am now sorry to think bitterly mortifying the river was to me a pretty and various spectacle i could not seei could not be made to seeit otherwise to my father it was a chequerboard of lively forces which he traced from pool to shallow with minute appreciation and enduring interest that bank was being undercut he might say why suppose you were to put a groin out here would not the filum fluminis be cast abruptly off across the channel and where would it impinge upon the other shore and what would be the result or suppose you were to blast that boulder what would happen follow ituse the eyes god has given youcan you not see that a great deal of land would be reclaimed upon this side it was to me like school in holidays but to him until i had worn him out with my invincible triviality a delight thus he pored over the engineers voluminous handybook of nature thus must too have pored my grandfather and uncles  but it is of the essence of this knowledge or this knack of mind to be largely incommunicable it cannot be imparted to another says my father the verbal castingnet is thrown in vain over these evanescent inferential relations hence the insignificance of much engineering literature so far as the science can be reduced to formulas or diagrams the book is to the point so far as the art depends on intimate study of the ways of nature the authors words will too often be found vapid this factengineering looks one way and literature anotherwas what my grandfather overlooked all his life long his pen was in his hand piling up a treasury of knowledge preparing himself against all possible contingencies scarce anything fell under his notice but he perceived in it some relation to his work and chronicled it in the pages of his journal in his always lucid but sometimes inexact and wordy style the travelling diary so he called it was kept in fascicles of ruled paper which were at last bound up rudely indexed and put by for future reference such volumes as have reached me contain a surprising medley the whole details of his employment in the northern lights and his general practice the whole biography of an enthusiastic engineer much of it is useful and curious much merely otiose and much can only be described as an attempt to impart that which cannot be imparted in words of such are his repeated and heroic descriptions of reefs monuments of misdirected literary energy which leave upon the mind of the reader no effect but that of a multiplicity of words and the suggested vignette of a lusty old gentleman scrambling among tangle it is to be remembered that he came to engineering while yet it was in the egg and without a library and that he saw the bounds of that profession widen daily he saw iron ships steamers and the locomotive engine introduced he lived to travel from glasgow to edinburgh in the inside of a forenoon and to remember that he himself had often been twelve hours upon the journey and his grandfather lillie two days the profession was still but in its second generation and had already broken down the barriers of time and space who should set a limit to its future encroachments and hence with a kind of sanguine pedantry he pursued his design of keeping up with the day and posting himself and his family on every mortal subject of this unpractical idealism we shall meet with many instances there was not a trade and scarce an accomplishment but he thought it should form part of the outfit of an engineer and not content with keeping an encyclopædic diary himself he would fain have set all his sons to work continuing and extending it they were more happily inspired my fathers engineering pocketbook was not a bulky volume with its store of pregnant notes and vital formulas it served him through life and was not yet filled when he came to die as for robert stevenson and the travelling diary i should be ungrateful to complain for it has supplied me with many lively traits for this and subsequent chapters but i must still remember much of the period of my study there as a sojourn in the valley of the shadow  the duty of the engineer is twofoldto design the work and to see the work done we have seen already something of the vociferous thoroughness of the man upon the cleaning of lamps and the polishing of reflectors in building in roadmaking in the construction of bridges in every detail and byway of his employments he pursued the same ideal perfection with a capital p and violently underscored was his design a crack for a penknife the waste of sixandthirty shillings the loss of a day or a tide in each of these he saw and was revolted by the finger of the sloven and to spirits intense as his and immersed in vital undertakings the slovenly is the dishonest and wasted time is instantly translated into lives endangered on this consistent idealism there is but one thing that now and then trenches with a touch of incongruity and that is his love of the picturesque as when he laid out a road on hogarths line of beauty bade a foreman be careful in quarrying not to disfigure the island or regretted in a report that the great stone called the devil in the hole was blasted or broken down to make roadmetal and for other purposes of the work   footnote    10 this is only a probable hypothesis i have tried to identify my     fathers anecdote in my grandfathers diary and may very well have     been deceivedr l s     chapter iii  the building of the bell rock   off the mouths of the tay and the forth thirteen miles from fifeness eleven from arbroath and fourteen from the red head of angus lies the inchcape or bell rock it extends to a length of about fourteen hundred feet but the part of it discovered at low water to not more than four hundred and twentyseven at a little more than halfflood in fine weather the seamless ocean joins over the reef and at highwater springs it is buried sixteen feet as the tide goes down the higher reaches of the rock are seen to be clothed by conferva rupestris as by a sward of grass upon the more exposed edges where the currents are most swift and the breach of the sea heaviest baderlock or henware flourishes and the great tangle grows at the depth of several fathoms with luxuriance before man arrived and introduced into the silence of the sea the smoke and clangour of a blacksmiths shop it was a favourite restingplace of seals the crab and lobster haunt in the crevices and limpets mussels and the white buckie abound  according to a tradition a bell had been once hung upon this rock by an abbot of arbroath11 and being taken down by a seapirate a year thereafter he perished upon the same rock with ship and goods in the righteous judgment of god from the days of the abbot and the seapirate no man had set foot upon the inchcape save fishers from the neighbouring coast or perhapsfor a moment before the surges swallowed themthe unfortunate victims of shipwreck the fishers approached the rock with an extreme timidity but their harvest appears to have been great and the adventure no more perilous than lucrative in 1800 on the occasion of my grandfathers first landing and during the two or three hours which the ebbtide and the smooth water allowed them to pass upon its shelves his crew collected upwards of two hundredweight of old metal pieces of a kedge anchor and a cabin stove crowbars a hinge and lock of a door a ships markingiron a piece of a ships caboose a soldiers bayonet a cannon ball several pieces of money a shoebuckle and the like such were the spoils of the bell rock but the number of vessels actually lost upon the reef was as nothing to those that were cast away in fruitless efforts to avoid it placed right in the fairway of two navigations and one of these the entrance to the only harbour of refuge between the downs and the moray firth it breathed abroad along the whole coast an atmosphere of terror and perplexity and no ship sailed that part of the north sea at night but what the ears of those on board would be strained to catch the roaring of the seas on the bell rock  from 1794 onward the mind of my grandfather had been exercised with the idea of a light upon this formidable danger to build a tower on a sea rock eleven miles from shore and barely uncovered at low water of neaps appeared a fascinating enterprise it was something yet unattempted unessayed and even now after it has been lighted for more than eighty years it is still an exploit that has never been repeated12 my grandfather was besides but a young man of an experience comparatively restricted and a reputation confined to scotland and when he prepared his first models and exhibited them in merchants hall he can hardly be acquitted of audacity john clerk of eldin stood his friend from the beginning kept the key of the model room to which he carried eminent strangers and found words of counsel and encouragement beyond price mr clerk had been personally known to smeaton and used occasionally to speak of him to me says my grandfather and again i felt regret that i had not the opportunity of a greater range of practice to fit me for such an undertaking but i was fortified by an expression of my friend mr clerk in one of our conversations this work said he is unique and can be little forwarded by experience of ordinary masonic operations in this case smeatons narrative must be the textbook and energy and perseverance the pratique  a bill for the work was introduced into parliament and lost in the lords in 18023 john rennie was afterwards at my grandfathers suggestion called in council with the style of chief engineer the precise meaning attached to these words by any of the parties appears irrecoverable chief engineer should have full authority full responsibility and a proper share of the emoluments and there were none of these for rennie i find in an appendix a paper which resumes the controversy on this subject and it will be enough to say here that rennie did not design the bell rock that he did not execute it and that he was not paid for it13 from so much of the correspondence as has come down to me the acquaintance of this man eleven years his senior and already famous appears to have been both useful and agreeable to robert stevenson it is amusing to find my grandfather seeking high and low for a brace of pistols which his colleague had lost by the way between aberdeen and edinburgh and writing to messrs dollond i have not thought it necessary to trouble mr rennie with this order but i beg you will see to get two minutes of him as he passes your doora proposal calculated rather from the latitude of edinburgh than from london even in 1807 it is pretty too to observe with what affectionate regard smeaton was held in mind by his immediate successors poor old fellow writes rennie to stevenson i hope he will now and then take a peep at us and inspire you with fortitude and courage to brave all difficulties and dangers to accomplish a work which will if successful immortalise you in the annals of fame the style might be bettered but the sentiment is charming  smeaton was indeed the patron saint of the bell rock undeterred by the sinister fate of winstanley he had tackled and solved the problem of the eddystone but his solution had not been in all respects perfect it remained for my grandfather to outdo him in daring by applying to a tidal rock those principles which had been already justified by the success of the eddystone and to perfect the model by more than one exemplary departure smeaton had adopted in his floors the principle of the arch each therefore exercised an outward thrust upon the walls which must be met and combated by embedded chains my grandfathers flooringstones on the other hand were flat made part of the outer wall and were keyed and dovetailed into a central stone so as to bind the work together and be positive elements of strength in 1703 winstanley still thought it possible to erect his strange pagoda with its open gallery its florid scrolls and candlesticks like a rich mans folly for an ornamental water in a park smeaton followed then stevenson in his turn corrected such flaws as were left in smeatons design and with his improvements it is not too much to say the model was made perfect smeaton and stevenson had between them evolved and finished the seatower no subsequent builder has departed in anything essential from the principles of their design it remains and it seems to us as though it must remain for ever an ideal attained every stone in the building it may interest the reader to know my grandfather had himself cut out in the model and the manner in which the courses were fitted joggled trenailed wedged and the bond broken is intricate as a puzzle and beautiful by ingenuity  in 1806 a second bill passed both houses and the preliminary works were at once begun the same year the navy had taken a great harvest of prizes in the north sea one of which a prussian fishing dogger flatbottomed and rounded at the stem and stern was purchased to be a floating lightship and renamed the pharos by july 1807 she was overhauled rigged for her new purpose and turned into the lee of the isle of may it was proposed that the whole party should meet in her and pass the night but she rolled from side to side in so extraordinary a manner that even the most seahardy fled it was humorously observed of this vessel that she was in danger of making a round turn and appearing with her keel uppermost and that she would even turn a halfpenny if laid upon deck by two oclock on the morning of the 15th july this purgatorial vessel was moored by the bell rock  a sloop of forty tons had been in the meantime built at leith and named the smeaton by the 7th of august my grandfather set sail in her     carrying with him mr peter logan foreman builder and five    artificers selected from their having been somewhat accustomed to the    sea the writer being aware of the distressing trial which the    floating light would necessarily inflict upon landsmen from her    rolling motion here he remained till the 10th and as the weather    was favourable a landing was effected daily when the workmen were    employed in cutting the large seaweed from the sites of the    lighthouse and beacon which were respectively traced with pickaxes    upon the rock in the meantime the crew of the smeaton was employed    in laying down the several sets of moorings within about half a mile    of the rock for the convenience of vessels the artificers having    fortunately experienced moderate weather returned to the workyard    of arbroath with a good report of their treatment afloat when their    comrades ashore began to feel some anxiety to see a place of which    they had heard so much and to change the constant operations with    the iron and mallet in the process of hewing for an occasional tides    work on the rock which they figured to themselves as a state of    comparative ease and comfort  i am now for many pages to let my grandfather speak for himself and tell in his own words the story of his capital achievement the tall quarto of 533 pages from which the following narrative has been dug out is practically unknown to the general reader yet good judges have perceived its merit and it has been named with flattering wit the romance of stone and lime and the robinson crusoe of civil engineering the tower was but four years in the building it took robert stevenson in the midst of his many avocations no less than fourteen to prepare the account the titlepage is a solid piece of literature of upwards of a hundred words the table of contents runs to thirteen pages and the dedication to that revered monarch george iv must have cost him no little study and correspondence walter scott was called in council and offered one miscorrection which still blots the page in spite of all this pondering and filing there remain pages not easy to construe and inconsistencies not easy to explain away i have sought to make these disappear and to lighten a little the baggage with which my grandfather marches here and there i have rejointed and rearranged a sentence always with his own words and all with a reverent and faithful hand and i offer here to the reader the true monument of robert stevenson with a little of the moss removed from the inscription and the portrait of the artist with some superfluous canvas cut away     i    operations of 1807    1807 sunday 16th aug  everything being arranged for sailing to the rock on saturday the 15th the vessel might have proceeded on the sunday but understanding that this would not be so agreeable to the artificers it was deferred until monday here we cannot help observing that the men allotted for the operations at the rock seemed to enter upon the undertaking with a degree of consideration which fully marked their opinion as to the hazardous nature of the undertaking on which they were about to enter they went in a body to church on sunday and whether it was in the ordinary course or designed for the occasion the writer is not certain but the service was in many respects suitable to their circumstances    monday 17th aug  the tide happening to fall late in the evening of monday the 17th the party counting twentyfour in number embarked on board of the smeaton about ten oclock pm and sailed from arbroath with a gentle breeze at west our ships colours having been flying all day in compliment to the commencement of the work the other vessels in the harbour also saluted which made a very gay appearance a number of the friends and acquaintances of those on board having been thus collected the piers though at a late hour were perfectly crowded and just as the smeaton cleared the harbour all on board united in giving three hearty cheers which were returned by those on shore in such good earnest that in the still of the evening the sound must have been heard in all parts of the town reechoing from the walls and lofty turrets of the venerable abbey of aberbrothwick the writer felt much satisfaction at the manner of this parting scene though he must own that the present rejoicing was on his part mingled with occasional reflections upon the responsibility of his situation which extended to the safety of all who should be engaged in this perilous work with such sensations he retired to his cabin but as the artificers were rather inclined to move about the deck than to remain in their confined berths below his repose was transient and the vessel being small every motion was necessarily heard some who were musically inclined occasionally sung but he listened with peculiar pleasure to the sailor at the helm who hummed over dibdins characteristic air    they say theres a providence sits up aloft    to keep watch for the life of poor jack    tuesday 18th aug  the weather had been very gentle all night and about four in the morning of the 18th the smeaton anchored agreeably to an arranged plan of operations all hands were called at five oclock am just as the highest part of the bell rock began to show its sable head among the light breakers which occasionally whitened with the foaming sea the two boats belonging to the floating light attended the smeaton to carry the artificers to the rock as her boat could only accommodate about six or eight sitters every one was more eager than his neighbour to leap into the boats and it required a good deal of management on the part of the coxswains to get men unaccustomed to a boat to take their places for rowing and at the same time trimming her properly the landingmaster and foreman went into one boat while the writer took charge of another and steered it to and from the rock this became the more necessary in the early stages of the work as places could not be spared for more than two or at most three seamen to each boat who were always stationed one at the bow to use the boathook in fending or pushing off and the other at the aftermost oar to give the proper time in rowing while the middle oars were doublebanked and rowed by the artificers  as the weather was extremely fine with light airs of wind from the east we landed without difficulty upon the central part of the rock at halfpast five but the water had not yet sufficiently left it for commencing the work this interval however did not pass unoccupied the first and last of all the principal operations at the bell rock were accompanied by three hearty cheers from all hands and on occasions like the present the steward of the ship attended when each man was regaled with a glass of rum as the water left the rock about six some began to bore the holes for the great bats or holdfasts for fixing the beams of the beaconhouse while the smith was fully attended in laying out the site of his forge upon a somewhat sheltered spot of the rock which also recommended itself from the vicinity of a pool of water for tempering his irons these preliminary steps occupied about an hour and as nothing further could be done during this tide towards fixing the forge the workmen gratified their curiosity by roaming about the rock which they investigated with great eagerness till the tide overflowed it those who had been sick picked dulse fucus palmatus which they ate with much seeming appetite others were more intent upon collecting limpets for bait to enjoy the amusement of fishing when they returned on board of the vessel indeed none came away emptyhanded as everything found upon the bell rock was considered valuable being connected with some interesting association several coins and numerous bits of shipwrecked iron were picked up of almost every description and in particular a markingiron lettered jamesa circumstance of which it was thought proper to give notice to the public as it might lead to the knowledge of some unfortunate shipwreck perhaps unheard of till this simple occurrence led to the discovery when the rock began to be overflowed the landingmaster arranged the crews of the respective boats appointing twelve persons to each according to a rule which the writer had laid down to himself he was always the last person who left the rock  in a short time the bell rock was laid completely under water and the weather being extremely fine the sea was so smooth that its place could not be pointed out from the appearance of the surfacea circumstance which sufficiently demonstrates the dangerous nature of this rock even during the day and in the smoothest and calmest state of the sea during the interval between the morning and the evening tides the artificers were variously employed in fishing and reading others were busy in drying and adjusting their wet clothes and one or two amused their companions with the violin and german flute  about seven in the evening the signal bell for landing on the rock was again rung when every man was at his quarters in this service it was thought more appropriate to use the bell than to pipe to quarters as the use of this instrument is less known to the mechanic than the sound of the bell the landing as in the morning was at the eastern harbour during this tide the seaweed was pretty well cleared from the site of the operations and also from the tracks leading to the different landingplaces for walking upon the rugged surface of the bell rock when covered with seaweed was found to be extremely difficult and even dangerous every hand that could possibly be occupied was now employed in assisting the smith to fit up the apparatus for his forge at 9 pm the boats returned to the tender after other two hours work in the same order as formerlyperhaps as much gratified with the success that attended the work of this day as with any other in the whole course of the operations although it could not be said that the fatigues of this day had been great yet all on board retired early to rest the sea being calm and no movement on deck it was pretty generally remarked in the morning that the bell awakened the greater number on board from their first sleep and though this observation was not altogether applicable to the writer himself yet he was not a little pleased to find that thirty people could all at once become so reconciled to a nights quarters within a few hundred paces of the bell rock    wednesday 19th aug  being extremely anxious at this time to get forward with fixing the smiths forge on which the progress of the work at present depended the writer requested that he might be called at daybreak to learn the landingmasters opinion of the weather from the appearance of the rising sun a criterion by which experienced seamen can generally judge pretty accurately of the state of the weather for the following day about five oclock on coming upon deck the suns upper limb or disc had just begun to appear as if rising from the ocean and in less than a minute he was seen in the fullest splendour but after a short interval he was enveloped in a soft cloudy sky which was considered emblematical of fine weather his rays had not yet sufficiently dispelled the clouds which hid the land from view and the bell rock being still overflowed the whole was one expanse of water this scene in itself was highly gratifying and when the morning bell was tolled we were gratified with the happy forebodings of good weather and the expectation of having both a morning and an evening tides work on the rock  the boat which the writer steered happened to be the last which approached the rock at this tide and in standing up in the stern while at some distance to see how the leading boat entered the creek he was astonished to observe something in the form of a human figure in a reclining posture upon one of the ledges of the rock he immediately steered the boat through a narrow entrance to the eastern harbour with a thousand unpleasant sensations in his mind he thought a vessel or boat must have been wrecked upon the rock during the night and it seemed probable that the rock might be strewed with dead bodies a spectacle which could not fail to deter the artificers from returning so freely to their work in the midst of these reveries the boat took the ground at an improper landingplace but without waiting to push her off he leapt upon the rock and making his way hastily to the spot which had privately given him alarm he had the satisfaction to ascertain that he had only been deceived by the peculiar situation and aspect of the smiths anvil and block which very completely represented the appearance of a lifeless body upon the rock the writer carefully suppressed his feelings the simple mention of which might have had a bad effect upon the artificers and his haste passed for an anxiety to examine the apparatus of the smiths forge left in an unfinished state at evening tide  in the course of this mornings work two or three apparently distant peals of thunder were heard and the atmosphere suddenly became thick and foggy but as the smeaton our present tender was moored at no great distance from the rock the crew on board continued blowing with a horn and occasionally fired a musket so that the boats got to the ship without difficulty    thursday 20th aug  the wind this morning inclined from the northeast and the sky had a heavy and cloudy appearance but the sea was smooth though there was an undulating motion on the surface which indicated easterly winds and occasioned a slight surf upon the rock but the boats found no difficulty in landing at the western creek at halfpast seven and after a good tides work left it again about a quarter from eleven in the evening the artificers landed at halfpast seven and continued till halfpast eight having completed the fixing of the smiths forge his vice and a wooden board or bench which were also batted to a ledge of the rock to the great joy of all under a salute of three hearty cheers from an oversight on the part of the smith who had neglected to bring his tinderbox and matches from the vessel the work was prevented from being continued for at least an hour longer  the smiths shop was of course in open space the large bellows were carried to and from the rock every tide for the serviceable condition of which together with the tinderbox fuel and embers of the former fire the smith was held responsible those who have been placed in situations to feel the inconveniency and want of this useful artisan will be able to appreciate his value in a case like the present it often happened to our annoyance and disappointment in the early state of the work when the smith was in the middle of a favourite heat in making some useful article or in sharpening the tools after the floodtide had obliged the pickmen to strike work a sea would come rolling over the rocks dash out the fire and endanger his indispensable implement the bellows if the sea was smooth while the smith often stood at work kneedeep in water the tide rose by imperceptible degrees first cooling the exterior of the fireplace or hearth and then quietly blackening and extinguishing the fire from below the writer has frequently been amused at the perplexing anxiety of the blacksmith when coaxing his fire and endeavouring to avert the effects of the rising tide    friday 21st aug  everything connected with the forge being now completed the artificers found no want of sharp tools and the work went forward with great alacrity and spirit it was also alleged that the rock had a more habitable appearance from the volumes of smoke which ascended from the smiths shop and the busy noise of his anvil the operations of the masons the movements of the boats and shipping at a distanceall contributed to give life and activity to the scene this noise and traffic had however the effect of almost completely banishing the herd of seals which had hitherto frequented the rock as a restingplace during the period of low water the rock seemed to be peculiarly adapted to their habits for excepting two or three days at neaptides a part of it always dries at low waterat least during the summer seasonand as there was good fishingground in the neighbourhood without a human being to disturb or molest them it had become a very favourite residence of these amphibious animals the writer having occasionally counted from fifty to sixty playing about the rock at a time but when they came to be disturbed every tide and their seclusion was broken in upon by the kindling of great fires together with the beating of hammers and picks during low water after hovering about for a time they changed their place and seldom more than one or two were to be seen about the rock upon the more detached outlayers which dry partially whence they seemed to look with that sort of curiosity which is observable in these animals when following a boat    saturday 22nd aug  hitherto the artificers had remained on board the smeaton which was made fast to one of the mooring buoys at a distance only of about a quarter of a mile from the rock and of course a very great conveniency to the work being so near the seamen could never be mistaken as to the progress of the tide or state of the sea upon the rock nor could the boats be much at a loss to pull on board of the vessel during fog or even in very rough weather as she could be cast loose from her moorings at pleasure and brought to the lee side of the rock but the smeaton being only about forty register tons her accommodations were extremely limited it may therefore be easily imagined that an addition of twentyfour persons to her own crew must have rendered the situation of those on board rather uncomfortable the only place for the mens hammocks on board being in the hold they were unavoidably much crowded and if the weather had required the hatches to be fastened down so great a number of men could not possibly have been accommodated to add to this evil the coboose or cookingplace being upon deck it would not have been possible to have cooked for so large a company in the event of bad weather  the stock of water was now getting short and some necessaries being also wanted for the floating light the smeaton was despatched for arbroath and the writer with the artificers at the same time shifted their quarters from her to the floating light  although the rock barely made its appearance at this period of the tides till eight oclock yet having now a full mile to row from the floating light to the rock instead of about a quarter of a mile from the moorings of the smeaton it was necessary to be earlier astir and to form different arrangements breakfast was accordingly served up at seven oclock this morning from the excessive motion of the floating light the writer had looked forward rather with anxiety to the removal of the workmen to this ship some among them who had been congratulating themselves upon having become seahardy while on board the smeaton had a complete relapse upon returning to the floating light this was the case with the writer from the spacious and convenient berthage of the floating light the exchange to the artificers was in this respect much for the better the boats were also commodious measuring sixteen feet in length on the keel so that in fine weather their complement of sitters was sixteen persons for each with which however they were rather crowded but she could not stow two boats of larger dimensions when there was what is called a breeze of wind and a swell in the sea the proper number for each boat could not with propriety be rated at more than twelve persons  when the tidebell rung the boats were hoisted out and two active seamen were employed to keep them from receiving damage alongside the floating light being very buoyant was so quick in her motions that when those who were about to step from her gunwale into a boat placed themselves upon a cleat or step on the ships side with the man or rail ropes in their hands they had often to wait for some time till a favourable opportunity occurred for stepping into the boat while in this situation with the vessel rolling from side to side watching the proper time for letting go the manropes it required the greatest dexterity and presence of mind to leap into the boats one who was rather awkward would often wait a considerable period in this position at one time his side of the ship would be so depressed that he would touch the boat to which he belonged while the next sea would elevate him so much that he would see his comrades in the boat on the opposite side of the ship his friends in the one boat calling to him to jump while those in the boat on the other side as he came again and again into their view would jocosely say are you there yet you seem to enjoy a swing in this situation it was common to see a person upon each side of the ship for a length of time waiting to quit his hold  on leaving the rock today a trial of seamanship was proposed amongst the rowers for by this time the artificers had become tolerably expert in this exercise by inadvertency some of the oars provided had been made of fir instead of ash and although a considerable stock had been laid in the workmen being at first awkward in the art were constantly breaking their oars indeed it was no uncommon thing to see the broken blades of a pair of oars floating astern in the course of a passage from the rock to the vessel the men upon the whole had but little work to perform in the course of a day for though they exerted themselves extremely hard while on the rock yet in the early state of the operations this could not be continued for more than three or four hours at a time and as their rations were largeconsisting of one pound and a half of beef one pound of ship biscuit eight ounces oatmeal two ounces barley two ounces butter three quarts of small beer with vegetables and saltthey got into excellent spirits when free of seasickness the rowing of the boats against each other became a favourite amusement which was rather a fortunate circumstance as it must have been attended with much inconvenience had it been found necessary to employ a sufficient number of sailors for this purpose the writer therefore encouraged this spirit of emulation and the speed of their respective boats became a favourite topic premiums for boatraces were instituted which were contended for with great eagerness and the respective crews kept their stations in the boats with as much precision as they kept their beds on board of the ship with these and other pastimes when the weather was favourable the time passed away among the inmates of the forecastle and waist of the ship the writer looks back with interest upon the hours of solitude which he spent in this lonely ship with his small library  this being the first saturday that the artificers were afloat all hands were served with a glass of rum and water at night to drink the sailors favourite toast of wives and sweethearts it was customary upon these occasions for the seamen and artificers to collect in the galley when the musical instruments were put in requisition for according to invariable practice every man must play a tune sing a song or tell a story    sunday 23rd aug  having on the previous evening arranged matters with the landingmaster as to the business of the day the signal was rung for all hands at halfpast seven this morning in the early state of the springtides the artificers went to the rock before breakfast but as the tides fell later in the day it became necessary to take this meal before leaving the ship at eight oclock all hands were assembled on the quarterdeck for prayers a solemnity which was gone through in as orderly a manner as circumstances would admit when the weather permitted the flags of the ship were hung up as an awning or screen forming the quarterdeck into a distinct compartment the pendant was also hoisted at the mainmast and a large ensign flag was displayed over the stern and lastly the ships companion or top of the staircase was covered with the flag proper of the lighthouse service on which the bible was laid a particular toll of the bell called all hands to the quarterdeck when the writer read a chapter of the bible and the whole ships company being uncovered he also read the impressive prayer composed by the reverend dr brunton one of the ministers of edinburgh  upon concluding this service which was attended with becoming reverence and attention all on board retired to their respective berths to breakfast and at halfpast nine the bell again rung for the artificers to take their stations in their respective boats some demur having been evinced on board about the propriety of working on sunday which had hitherto been touched upon as delicately as possible all hands being called aft the writer from the quarterdeck stated generally the nature of the service expressing his hopes that every man would feel himself called upon to consider the erection of a lighthouse on the bell rock in every point of view as a work of necessity and mercy he knew that scruples had existed with some and these had indeed been fairly and candidly urged before leaving the shore but it was expected that after having seen the critical nature of the rock and the necessity of the measure every man would now be satisfied of the propriety of embracing all opportunities of landing on the rock when the state of the weather would permit the writer further took them to witness that it did not proceed from want of respect for the appointments and established forms of religion that he had himself adopted the resolution of attending the bell rock works on the sunday but as he hoped from a conviction that it was his bounden duty on the strictest principles of morality at the same time it was intimated that if any were of a different opinion they should be perfectly at liberty to hold their sentiments without the imputation of contumacy or disobedience the only difference would be in regard to the pay  upon stating this much he stepped into his boat requesting all who were so disposed to follow him the sailors from their habits found no scruple on this subject and all of the artificers though a little tardy also embarked excepting four of the masons who from the beginning mentioned that they would decline working on sundays it may here be noticed that throughout the whole of the operations it was observable that the men wrought if possible with more keenness upon the sundays than at other times from an impression that they were engaged in a work of imperious necessity which required every possible exertion on returning to the floating light after finishing the tides work the boats were received by the part of the ships crew left on board with the usual attention of handing ropes to the boats and helping the artificers on board but the four masons who had absented themselves from the work did not appear upon deck    monday 24th aug  the boats left the floating light at a quarterpast nine oclock this morning and the work began at threequarters past nine but as the neaptides were approaching the working time at the rock became gradually shorter and it was now with difficulty that two and a half hours work could be got but so keenly had the workmen entered into the spirit of the beaconhouse operations that they continued to bore the holes in the rock till some of them were kneedeep in water  the operations at this time were entirely directed to the erection of the beacon in which every man felt an equal interest as at this critical period the slightest casualty to any of the boats at the rock might have been fatal to himself individually while it was perhaps peculiar to the writer more immediately to feel for the safety of the whole each log or upright beam of the beacon was to be fixed to the rock by two strong and massive bats or stanchions of iron these bats for the fixture of the principal and diagonal beams and bracing chains required fiftyfour holes each measuring two inches in diameter and eighteen inches in depth there had already been so considerable a progress made in boring and excavating the holes that the writers hopes of getting the beacon erected this year began to be more and more confirmed although it was now advancing towards what was considered the latter end of the proper working season at the bell rock the foreman joiner mr francis watt was accordingly appointed to attend at the rock today when the necessary levels were taken for the step or seat of each particular beam of the beacon that they might be cut to their respective lengths to suit the inequalities of the rock several of the stanchions were also tried into their places and other necessary observations made to prevent mistakes on the application of the apparatus and to facilitate the operations when the beams came to be set up which would require to be done in the course of a single tide    tuesday 25th aug  we had now experienced an almost unvaried tract of light airs of easterly wind with clear weather in the forepart of the day and fog in the evenings today however it sensibly changed when the wind came to the southwest and blew a fresh breeze at nine am the bell rung and the boats were hoisted out and though the artificers were now pretty well accustomed to tripping up and down the sides of the floating light yet it required more seamanship this morning than usual it therefore afforded some merriment to those who had got fairly seated in their respective boats to see the difficulties which attended their companions and the hesitating manner in which they quitted hold of the manropes in leaving the ship the passage to the rock was tedious and the boats did not reach it till halfpast ten  it being now the period of neaptides the water only partially left the rock and some of the men who were boring on the lower ledges of the site of the beacon stood kneedeep in water the situation of the smith today was particularly disagreeable but his services were at all times indispensable as the tide did not leave the site of the forge he stood in the water and as there was some roughness on the surface it was with considerable difficulty that with the assistance of the sailors he was enabled to preserve alive his fire and while his feet were immersed in water his face was not only scorched but continually exposed to volumes of smoke accompanied with sparks from the fire which were occasionally set up owing to the strength and direction of the wind    wednesday 26th aug  the wind had shifted this morning to nnw with rain and was blowing what sailors call a fresh breeze to speak perhaps somewhat more intelligibly to the general reader the wind was such that a fishingboat could just carry full sail but as it was of importance specially in the outset of the business to keep up the spirit of enterprise for landing on all practicable occasions the writer after consulting with the landingmaster ordered the bell to be rung for embarking and at halfpast eleven the boats reached the rock and left it again at a quarterpast twelve without however being able to do much work as the smith could not be set to work from the smallness of the ebb and the strong breach of sea which lashed with great force among the bars of the forge  just as we were about to leave the rock the wind shifted to the sw and from a fresh gale it became what seamen term a hard gale or such as would have required the fisherman to take in two or three reefs in his sail it is a curious fact that the respective tides of ebb and flood are apparent upon the shore about an hour and a half sooner than at the distance of three or four miles in the offing but what seems chiefly interesting here is that the tides around this small sunken rock should follow exactly the same laws as on the extensive shores of the mainland when the boats left the bell rock today it was overflowed by the floodtide but the floating light did not swing round to the floodtide for more than an hour afterwards under this disadvantage the boats had to struggle with the ebbtide and a hard gale of wind so that it was with the greatest difficulty they reached the floating light had this gale happened in springtides when the current was strong we must have been driven to sea in a very helpless condition  the boat which the writer steered was considerably behind the other one of the masons having unluckily broken his oar our prospect of getting on board of course became doubtful and our situation was rather perilous as the boat shipped so much sea that it occupied two of the artificers to bale and clear her of water when the oar gave way we were about half a mile from the ship but being fortunately to windward we got into the wake of the floating light at about 250 fathoms astern just as the landingmasters boat reached the vessel he immediately streamed or floated a lifebuoy astern with a line which was always in readiness and by means of this useful implement the boat was towed alongside of the floating light where from her rolling motion it required no small management to get safely on board as the men were worn out with their exertions in pulling from the rock on the present occasion the crews of both boats were completely drenched with spray and those who sat upon the bottom of the boats to bale them were sometimes pretty deep in the water before it could be cleared out after getting on board all hands were allowed an extra dram and having shifted and got a warm and comfortable dinner the affair it is believed was little more thought of    thursday 27th aug  the tides were now in that state which sailors term the dead of the neap and it was not expected that any part of the rock would be seen above water today at any rate it was obvious from the experience of yesterday that no work could be done upon it and therefore the artificers were not required to land the wind was at west with light breezes and fine clear weather and as it was an object with the writer to know the actual state of the bell rock at neaptides he got one of the boats manned and being accompanied by the landingmaster went to it at a quarterpast twelve the parts of the rock that appeared above water being very trifling were covered by every wave so that no landing was made upon trying the depth of water with a boathook particularly on the sites of the lighthouse and beacon on the former at low water the depth was found to be three feet and on the central parts of the latter it was ascertained to be two feet eight inches having made these remarks the boat returned to the ship at two pm and the weather being good the artificers were found amusing themselves with fishing the smeaton came from arbroath this afternoon and made fast to her moorings having brought letters and newspapers with parcels of clean linen etc for the workmen who were also made happy by the arrival of three of their comrades from the workyard ashore from these men they not only received all the news of the workyard but seemed themselves to enjoy great pleasure in communicating whatever they considered to be interesting with regard to the rock some also got letters from their friends at a distance the postage of which for the men afloat was always free so that they corresponded the more readily  the site of the building having already been carefully traced out with the pickaxe the artificers this day commenced the excavation of the rock for the foundation or first course of the lighthouse four men only were employed at this work while twelve continued at the site of the beaconhouse at which every possible opportunity was embraced till this essential part of the operations should be completed    wednesday 2nd sept  the floating lights bell rung this morning at halfpast four oclock as a signal for the boats to be got ready and the landing took place at halfpast five in passing the smeaton at her moorings near the rock her boat followed with eight additional artificers who had come from arbroath with her at last trip but there being no room for them in the floating lights boats they had continued on board the weather did not look very promising in the morning the wind blowing pretty fresh from wsw and had it not been that the writer calculated upon having a vessel so much at command in all probability he would not have ventured to land the smeaton rode at what sailors call a salvagee with a crosshead made fast to the floating buoy this kind of attachment was found to be more convenient than the mode of passing the hawser through the ring of the buoy when the vessel was to be made fast she had then only to be steered very close to the buoy when the salvagee was laid hold of with a boathook and the bite of the hawser thrown over the crosshead but the salvagee by this method was always left at the buoy and was of course more liable to chafe and wear than a hawser passed through the ring which could be wattled with canvas and shifted at pleasure the salvagee and cross method is however much practised but the experience of this morning showed it to be very unsuitable for vessels riding in an exposed situation for any length of time  soon after the artificers landed they commenced work but the wind coming to blow hard the smeatons boat and crew who had brought their complement of eight men to the rock went off to examine her riding ropes and see that they were in proper order the boat had no sooner reached the vessel than she went adrift carrying the boat along with her by the time that she was got round to make a tack towards the rock she had drifted at least three miles to leeward with the praam boat astern and having both the wind and a tide against her the writer perceived with no little anxiety that she could not possibly return to the rock till long after its being overflowed for owing to the anomaly of the tides formerly noticed the bell rock is completely under water when the ebb abates to the offing  in this perilous predicament indeed he found himself placed between hope and despairbut certainly the latter was by much the most predominant feeling of his mindsituate upon a sunken rock in the middle of the ocean which in the progress of the floodtide was to be laid under water to the depth of at least twelve feet in a stormy sea there were this morning thirtytwo persons in all upon the rock with only two boats whose complement even in good weather did not exceed twentyfour sitters but to row to the floating light with so much wind and in so heavy a sea a complement of eight men for each boat was as much as could with propriety be attempted so that in this way about onehalf of our number was unprovided for under these circumstances had the writer ventured to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either working the smeaton sooner up towards the rock or in hopes of getting her boat brought to our assistance this must have given an immediate alarm to the artificers each of whom would have insisted upon taking to his own boat and leaving the eight artificers belonging to the smeaton to their chance of course a scuffle might have ensued and it is hard to say in the ardour of men contending for life where it might have ended it has even been hinted to the writer that a party of the pickmen were determined to keep exclusively to their own boat against all hazards  the unfortunate circumstance of the smeaton and her boat having drifted was for a considerable time only known to the writer and to the landingmaster who removed to the farther point of the rock where he kept his eye steadily upon the progress of the vessel while the artificers were at work chiefly in sitting or kneeling postures excavating the rock or boring with the jumpers and while their numerous hammers with the sound of the smiths anvil continued the situation of things did not appear so awful in this state of suspense with almost certain destruction at hand the water began to rise upon those who were at work on the lower parts of the sites of the beacon and lighthouse from the run of sea upon the rock the forge fire was also sooner extinguished this morning than usual and the volumes of smoke having ceased objects in every direction became visible from all parts of the rock after having had about three hours work the men began pretty generally to make towards their respective boats for their jackets and stockings when to their astonishment instead of three they found only two boats the third being adrift with the smeaton not a word was uttered by any one but all appeared to be silently calculating their numbers and looking to each other with evident marks of perplexity depicted in their countenances the landingmaster conceiving that blame might be attached to him for allowing the boat to leave the rock still kept at a distance at this critical moment the author was standing upon an elevated part of smiths ledge where he endeavoured to mark the progress of the smeaton not a little surprised that her crew did not cut the praam adrift which greatly retarded her way and amazed that some effort was not making to bring at least the boat and attempt our relief the workmen looked steadfastly upon the writer and turned occasionally towards the vessel still far to leeward14 all this passed in the most perfect silence and the melancholy solemnity of the group made an impression never to be effaced from his mind  the writer had all along been considering of various schemesproviding the men could be kept under commandwhich might be put in practice for the general safety in hopes that the smeaton might be able to pick up the boats to leeward when they were obliged to leave the rock he was accordingly about to address the artificers on the perilous nature of their circumstances and to propose that all hands should unstrip their upper clothing when the higher parts of the rock were laid under water that the seamen should remove every unnecessary weight and encumbrance from the boats that a specified number of men should go into each boat and that the remainder should hang by the gunwales while the boats were to be rowed gently towards the smeaton as the course to the pharos or floating light lay rather to windward of the rock but when he attempted to speak his mouth was so parched that his tongue refused utterance and he now learned by experience that the saliva is as necessary as the tongue itself for speech he turned to one of the pools on the rock and lapped a little water which produced immediate relief but what was his happiness when on rising from this unpleasant beverage some one called out a boat a boat and on looking around at no great distance a large boat was seen through the haze making towards the rock this at once enlivened and rejoiced every heart the timeous visitor proved to be james spink the bell rock pilot who had come express from arbroath with letters spink had for some time seen the smeaton and had even supposed from the state of the weather that all hands were on board of her till he approached more nearly and observed people upon the rock but not supposing that the assistance of his boat was necessary to carry the artificers off the rock he anchored on the leeside and began to fish waiting as usual till the letters were sent for as the pilotboat was too large and unwieldy for approaching the rock when there was any roughness or run of the sea at the entrance of the landing creeks  upon this fortunate change of circumstances sixteen of the artificers were sent at two trips in one of the boats with instructions for spink to proceed with them to the floating light this being accomplished the remaining sixteen followed in the two boats belonging to the service of the rock every one felt the most perfect happiness at leaving the bell rock this morning though a very hard and dangerous passage to the floating light still awaited us as the wind by this time had increased to a pretty hard gale accompanied with a considerable swell of sea every one was as completely drenched in water as if he had been dragged astern of the boats the writer in particular being at the helm found on getting on board that his face and ears were completely coated with a thin film of salt from the sea spray which broke constantly over the bows of the boat after much baling of water and severe work at the oars the three boats reached the floating light where some new difficulties occurred in getting on board in safety owing partly to the exhausted state of the men and partly to the violent rolling of the vessel  as the tide flowed it was expected that the smeaton would have got to windward but seeing that all was safe after tacking for several hours and making little progress she bore away for arbroath with the praamboat as there was now too much wind for the pilotboat to return to arbroath she was made fast astern of the floating light and the crew remained on board till next day when the weather moderated there can be very little doubt that the appearance of james spink with his boat on this critical occasion was the means of preventing the loss of lives at the rock this morning when these circumstances some years afterwards came to the knowledge of the board a small pension was ordered to our faithful pilot then in his seventieth year and he still continues to wear the uniform clothes and badge of the lighthouse service spink is a remarkably strong man whose tout ensemble is highly characteristic of a northcountry fisherman he usually dresses in a péjacket cut after a particular fashion and wears a large flat blue bonnet a striking likeness of spink in his pilotdress with the badge or insignia on his left arm which is characteristic of the boatmen in the service of the northern lights has been taken by howe and is in the writers possession    thursday 3rd sept  the bell rung this morning at five oclock but the writer must acknowledge from the circumstances of yesterday that its sound was extremely unwelcome this appears also to have been the feelings of the artificers for when they came to be mustered out of twentysix only eight besides the foreman and seamen appeared upon deck to accompany the writer to the rock such are the baneful effects of anything like misfortune or accident connected with a work of this description the use of argument to persuade the men to embark in cases of this kind would have been out of place as it is not only discomfort or even the risk of the loss of a limb but life itself that becomes the question the boats notwithstanding the thinness of our ranks left the vessel at halfpast five the rough weather of yesterday having proved but a summers gale the wind came today in gentle breezes yet the atmosphere being cloudy it had not a very favourable appearance the boats reached the rock at six am and the eight artificers who landed were employed in clearing out the batholes for the beaconhouse and had a very prosperous tide of four hours work being the longest yet experienced by half an hour  the boats left the rock again at ten oclock and the weather having cleared up as we drew near the vessel the eighteen artificers who had remained on board were observed upon deck but as the boats approached they sought their way below being quite ashamed of their conduct this was the only instance of refusal to go to the rock which occurred during the whole progress of the work excepting that of the four men who declined working upon sunday a case which the writer did not conceive to be at all analogous to the present it may here be mentioned much to the credit of these four men that they stood foremost in embarking for the rock this morning    saturday 5th sept  it was fortunate that a landing was not attempted this evening for at eight oclock the wind shifted to ese and at ten it had become a hard gale when fifty fathoms of the floating lights hempen cable were veered out the gale still increasing the ship rolled and laboured excessively and at midnight eighty fathoms of cable were veered out while the sea continued to strike the vessel with a degree of force which had not before been experienced    sunday 6th sept  during the last night there was little rest on board of the pharos and daylight though anxiously wished for brought no relief as the gale continued with unabated violence the sea struck so hard upon the vessels bows that it rose in great quantities or in green seas as the sailors termed it which were carried by the wind as far aft as the quarterdeck and not unfrequently over the stern of the ship altogether it fell occasionally so heavily on the skylight of the writers cabin though so far aft as to be within five feet of the helm that the glass was broken to pieces before the deadlight could be got into its place so that the water poured down in great quantities in shutting out the water the admission of light was prevented and in the morning all continued in the most comfortless state of darkness about ten oclock am the wind shifted to ne and blew if possible harder than before and it was accompanied by a much heavier swell of sea in the course of the gale the part of the cable in the hausehole had been so often shifted that nearly the whole length of one of her hempen cables of 120 fathoms had been veered out besides the chainmoorings the cable for its preservation was also carefully served or wattled with pieces of canvas round the windlass and with leather well greased in the hausehole in this state things remained during the whole day every sea which struck the vesseland the seas followed each other in close successioncausing her to shake and all on board occasionally to tremble at each of these strokes of the sea the rolling and pitching of the vessel ceased for a time and her motion was felt as if she had either broke adrift before the wind or were in the act of sinking but when another sea came she ranged up against it with great force and this became the regular intimation of our being still riding at anchor  about eleven oclock the writer with some difficulty got out of bed but in attempting to dress he was thrown twice upon the floor at the opposite end of the cabin in an undressed state he made shift to get about halfway up the companionstairs with an intention to observe the state of the sea and of the ship upon deck but he no sooner looked over the companion than a heavy sea struck the vessel which fell on the quarterdeck and rushed downstairs in the officers cabin in so considerable a quantity that it was found necessary to lift one of the scuttles in the floor to let the water into the limbers of the ship as it dashed from side to side in such a manner as to run into the lower tier of beds having been foiled in this attempt and being completely wetted he again got below and went to bed in this state of the weather the seamen had to move about the necessary or indispensable duties of the ship with the most cautious use both of hands and feet while it required all the art of the landsman to keep within the precincts of his bed the writer even found himself so much tossed about that it became necessary in some measure to shut himself in bed in order to avoid being thrown upon the floor indeed such was the motion of the ship that it seemed wholly impracticable to remain in any other than a lying posture on deck the most stormy aspect presented itself while below all was wet and comfortless  about two oclock pm a great alarm was given throughout the ship from the effects of a very heavy sea which struck her and almost filled the waist pouring down into the berths below through every chink and crevice of the hatches and skylights from the motion of the vessel being thus suddenly deadened or checked and from the flowing in of the water above it is believed there was not an individual on board who did not think at the moment that the vessel had foundered and was in the act of sinking the writer could withstand this no longer and as soon as she again began to range to the sea he determined to make another effort to get upon deck in the first instance however he groped his way in darkness from his own cabin through the berths of the officers where all was quietness he next entered the galley and other compartments occupied by the artificers here also all was shut up in darkness the fire having been drowned out in the early part of the gale several of the artificers were employed in prayer repeating psalms and other devotional exercises in a full tone of voice others protesting that if they should fortunately get once more on shore no one should ever see them afloat again with the assistance of the landingmaster the writer made his way holding on step by step among the numerous impediments which lay in the way such was the creaking noise of the bulkheads or partitions the dashing of the water and the whistling noise of the winds that it was hardly possible to break in upon such a confusion of sounds in one or two instances anxious and repeated inquiries were made by the artificers as to the state of things upon deck to which the captain made the usual answer that it could not blow long in this way and that we must soon have better weather the next berth in succession moving forward in the ship was that allotted for the seamen here the scene was considerably different having reached the middle of this darksome berth without its inmates being aware of any intrusion the writer had the consolation of remarking that although they talked of bad weather and the cross accidents of the sea yet the conversation was carried on in that sort of tone and manner which bespoke an ease and composure of mind highly creditable to them and pleasing to him the writer immediately accosted the seamen about the state of the ship to these inquiries they replied that the vessel being light and having but little hold of the water no toprigging with excellent groundtackle and everything being fresh and new they felt perfect confidence in their situation  it being impossible to open any of the hatches in the fore part of the ship in communicating with the deck the watch was changed by passing through the several berths to the companionstair leading to the quarterdeck the writer therefore made the best of his way aft and on a second attempt to look out he succeeded and saw indeed an astonishing sight the sea or waves appeared to be ten or fifteen feet in height of unbroken water and every approaching billow seemed as if it would overwhelm our vessel but she continued to rise upon the waves and to fall between the seas in a very wonderful manner it seemed to be only those seas which caught her in the act of rising which struck her with so much violence and threw such quantities of water aft on deck there was only one solitary individual looking out to give the alarm in the event of the ship breaking from her moorings the seaman on watch continued only two hours he who kept watch at this time was a tall slender man of a black complexion he had no greatcoat nor overall of any kind but was simply dressed in his ordinary jacket and trousers his hat was tied under his chin with a napkin and he stood aft the foremast to which he had lashed himself with a gasket or small rope round his waist to prevent his falling upon deck or being washed overboard when the writer looked up he appeared to smile which afforded a further symptom of the confidence of the crew in their ship this person on watch was as completely wetted as if he had been drawn through the sea which was given as a reason for his not putting on a greatcoat that he might wet as few of his clothes as possible and have a dry shift when he went below upon deck everything that was movable was out of sight having either been stowed below previous to the gale or been washed overboard some trifling parts of the quarter boards were damaged by the breach of the sea and one of the boats upon deck was about onethird full of water the oylehole or drain having been accidentally stopped up and part of her gunwale had received considerable injury these observations were hastily made and not without occasionally shutting the companion to avoid being wetted by the successive seas which broke over the bows and fell upon different parts of the deck according to the impetus with which the waves struck the vessel by this time it was about three oclock in the afternoon and the gale which had now continued with unabated force for twentyseven hours had not the least appearance of going off  in the dismal prospect of undergoing another night like the last and being in imminent hazard of parting from our cable the writer thought it necessary to advise with the master and officers of the ship as to the probable event of the vessels drifting from her moorings they severally gave it as their opinion that we had now every chance of riding out the gale which in all probability could not continue with the same fury many hours longer and that even if she should part from her anchor the stormsails had been laid to hand and could be bent in a very short time they further stated that from the direction of the wind being ne she would sail up the firth of forth to leith roads but if this should appear doubtful after passing the island and light of may it might be advisable at once to steer for tyningham sands on the western side of dunbar and there run the vessel ashore if this should happen at the time of highwater or during the ebbing of the tide they were of opinion from the flatness and strength of the floating light that no danger would attend her taking the ground even with a very heavy sea the writer seeing the confidence which these gentlemen possessed with regard to the situation of things found himself as much relieved with this conversation as he had previously been with the seeming indifference of the forecastlemen and the smile of the watch upon deck though literally lashed to the foremast from this time he felt himself almost perfectly at ease at any rate he was entirely resigned to the ultimate result  about six oclock in the evening the ships company was heard moving upon deck which on the present occasion was rather the cause of alarm the writer accordingly rang his bell to know what was the matter when he was informed by the steward that the weather looked considerably better and that the men upon deck were endeavouring to ship the smokefunnel of the galley that the people might get some meat this was a more favourable account than had been anticipated during the last twentyone hours he himself had not only had nothing to eat but he had almost never passed a thought on the subject upon the mention of a change of weather he sent the steward to learn how the artificers felt and on his return he stated that they now seemed to be all very happy since the cook had begun to light the galleyfire and make preparations for the suetpudding of sunday which was the only dish to be attempted for the mess from the ease with which it could both be cooked and served up  the principal change felt upon the ship as the wind abated was her increased rolling motion but the pitching was much diminished and now hardly any sea came farther aft than the foremast but she rolled so extremely hard as frequently to dip and take in water over the gunwales and rails in the waist by nine oclock all hands had been refreshed by the exertions of the cook and steward and were happy in the prospect of the worst of the gale being over the usual complement of men was also now set on watch and more quietness was experienced throughout the ship although the previous night had been a very restless one it had not the effect of inducing repose in the writers berth on the succeeding night for having been so much tossed about in bed during the last thirty hours he found no easy spot to turn to and his body was all sore to the touch which ill accorded with the unyielding materials with which his bedplace was surrounded    monday 7th sept  this morning about eight oclock the writer was agreeably surprised to see the scuttle of his cabin skylight removed and the bright rays of the sun admitted although the ship continued to roll excessively and the sea was still running very high yet the ordinary business on board seemed to be going forward on deck it was impossible to steady a telescope so as to look minutely at the progress of the waves and trace their breach upon the bell rock but the height to which the crossrunning waves rose in sprays when they met each other was truly grand and the continued roar and noise of the sea was very perceptible to the ear to estimate the height of the sprays at forty or fifty feet would surely be within the mark those of the workmen who were not much afflicted with seasickness came upon deck and the wetness below being dried up the cabins were again brought into a habitable state every one seemed to meet as if after a long absence congratulating his neighbour upon the return of good weather little could be said as to the comfort of the vessel but after riding out such a gale no one felt the least doubt or hesitation as to the safety and good condition of her moorings the master and mate were extremely anxious however to heave in the hempen cable and see the state of the clinch or iron ring of the chaincable but the vessel rolled at such a rate that the seamen could not possibly keep their feet at the windlass nor work the handspikes though it had been several times attempted since the gale took off  about twelve noon however the vessels motion was observed to be considerably less and the sailors were enabled to walk upon deck with some degree of freedom but to the astonishment of every one it was soon discovered that the floating light was adrift the windlass was instantly manned and the men soon gave out that there was no strain upon the cable the mizzen sail which was bent for the occasional purpose of making the vessel ride more easily to the tide was immediately set and the other sails were also hoisted in a short time when in no small consternation we bore away about one mile to the southwestward of the former station and there let go the best bower anchor and cable in twenty fathoms water to ride until the swell of the sea should fall when it might be practicable to grapple for the moorings and find a better anchorage for the ship    tuesday 15th sept  this morning at five am the bell rung as a signal for landing upon the rock a sound which after a lapse of ten days it is believed was welcomed by every one on board there being a heavy breach of sea at the eastern creek we landed though not without difficulty on the western side every one seeming more eager than another to get upon the rock and never did hungry men sit down to a hearty meal with more appetite than the artificers began to pick the dulse from the rocks this marine plant had the effect of reviving the sickly and seemed to be no less relished by those who were more hardy  while the water was ebbing and the men were roaming in quest of their favourite morsel the writer was examining the effects of the storm upon the forge and loose apparatus left upon the rock six large blocks of granite which had been landed by way of experiment on the 1st instant were now removed from their places and by the force of the sea thrown over a rising ledge into a hole at the distance of twelve or fifteen paces from the place on which they had been landed this was a pretty good evidence both of the violence of the storm and the agitation of the sea upon the rock the safety of the smiths forge was always an object of essential regard the ashpan of the hearth or fireplace with its weighty castiron back had been washed from their places of supposed security the chains of attachment had been broken and these ponderous articles were found at a very considerable distance in a hole on the western side of the rock while the tools and picks of the aberdeen masons were scattered about in every direction it is however remarkable that not a single article was ultimately lost  this being the night on which the floating light was advertised to be lighted it was accordingly exhibited to the great joy of every one    wednesday 16th sept  the writer was made happy today by the return of the lighthouse yacht from a voyage to the northern lighthouses having immediately removed on board of this fine vessel of eightyone tons register the artificers gladly followed for though they found themselves more pinched for accommodation on board of the yacht and still more so in the smeaton yet they greatly preferred either of these to the pharos or floating light on account of her rolling motion though in all respects fitted up for their conveniency  the writer called them to the quarterdeck and informed them that having been one month afloat in terms of their agreement they were now at liberty to return to the workyard at arbroath if they preferred this to continuing at the bell rock but they replied that in the prospect of soon getting the beacon erected upon the rock and having made a change from the floating light they were now perfectly reconciled to their situation and would remain afloat till the end of the working season    thursday 17th sept  the wind was at ne this morning and though there were only light airs yet there was a pretty heavy swell coming ashore upon the rock the boats landed at halfpast seven oclock am at the creek on the southern side of the rock marked port hamilton but as one of the boats was in the act of entering this creek the seaman at the bowoar who had just entered the service having inadvertently expressed some fear from a heavy sea which came rolling towards the boat and one of the artificers having at the same time looked round and missed a stroke with his oar such a preponderance was thus given to the rowers upon the opposite side that when the wave struck the boat it threw her upon a ledge of shelving rocks where the water left her and she having kanted to seaward the next wave completely filled her with water after making considerable efforts the boat was again got afloat in the proper track of the creek so that we landed without any other accident than a complete ducking there being no possibility of getting a shift of clothes the artificers began with all speed to work so as to bring themselves into heat while the writer and his assistants kept as much as possible in motion having remained more than an hour upon the rock the boats left it at halfpast nine and after getting on board the writer recommended to the artificers as the best mode of getting into a state of comfort to strip off their wet clothes and go to bed for an hour or two no further inconveniency was felt and no one seemed to complain of the affection called catching cold    friday 18th sept  an important occurrence connected with the operations of this season was the arrival of the smeaton at four pm having in tow the six principal beams of the beaconhouse together with all the stanchions and other work on board for fixing it on the rock the mooring of the floating light was a great point gained but in the erection of the beacon at this late period of the season new difficulties presented themselves the success of such an undertaking at any season was precarious because a single day of bad weather occurring before the necessary fixtures could be made might sweep the whole apparatus from the rock notwithstanding these difficulties the writer had determined to make the trial although he could almost have wished upon looking at the state of the clouds and the direction of the wind that the apparatus for the beacon had been still in the workyard    saturday 19th sept  the main beams of the beacon were made up in two separate rafts fixed with bars and bolts of iron one of these rafts not being immediately wanted was left astern of the floating light and the other was kept in tow by the smeaton at the buoy nearest to the rock the lighthouse yacht rode at another buoy with all hands on board that could possibly be spared out of the floating light the party of artificers and seamen which landed on the rock counted altogether forty in number at halfpast eight oclock a derrick or mast of thirty feet in height was erected and properly supported with guyropes for suspending the block for raising the first principal beam of the beacon and a winch machine was also bolted down to the rock for working the purchasetackle  upon raising the derrick all hands on the rock spontaneously gave three hearty cheers as a favourable omen of our future exertions in pointing out more permanently the position of the rock even to this single spar of timber could it be preserved a drowning man might lay hold when the smeaton drifted on the 2nd of this month such a spar would have been sufficient to save us till she could have come to our relief    sunday 20th sept  the wind this morning was variable but the weather continued extremely favourable for the operations throughout the whole day at six am the boats were in motion and the raft consisting of four of the six principal beams of the beaconhouse each measuring about sixteen inches square and fifty feet in length was towed to the rock where it was anchored that it might ground upon it as the water ebbed the sailors and artificers including all hands today counted no fewer than fiftytwo being perhaps the greatest number of persons ever collected upon the bell rock it was early in the tide when the boats reached the rock and the men worked a considerable time up to their middle in water every one being more eager than his neighbour to be useful even the four artificers who had hitherto declined working on sunday were today most zealous in their exertions they had indeed become so convinced of the precarious nature and necessity of the work that they never afterwards absented themselves from the rock on sunday when a landing was practicable  having made fast a piece of very good new line at about twothirds from the lower end of one of the beams the purchasetackle of the derrick was hooked into the turns of the line and it was speedily raised by the number of men on the rock and the power of the winch tackle when this log was lifted to a sufficient height its foot or lower end was stepped into the spot which had been previously prepared for it two of the great iron stanchions were then set in their respective holes on each side of the beam when a rope was passed round them and the beam to prevent it from slipping till it could be more permanently fixed the derrick or upright spar used for carrying the tackle to raise the first beam was placed in such a position as to become useful for supporting the upper end of it which now became in its turn the prop of the tackle for raising the second beam the whole difficulty of this operation was in the raising and propping of the first beam which became a convenient derrick for raising the second these again a pair of shears for lifting the third and the shears a triangle for raising the fourth having thus got four of the six principal beams set on end it required a considerable degree of trouble to get their upper ends to fit here they formed the apex of a cone and were all together mortised into a large piece of beechwood and secured for the present with ropes in a temporary manner during the short period of one tide all that could further be done for their security was to put a single screwbolt through the great kneed bats or stanchions on each side of the beams and screw the nut home  in this manner these four principal beams were erected and left in a pretty secure state the men had commenced while there was about two or three feet of water upon the side of the beacon and as the sea was smooth they continued the work equally long during floodtide two of the boats being left at the rock to take off the joiners who were busily employed on the upper parts till two oclock pm this tides work may be said to have continued for about seven hours which was the longest that had hitherto been got upon the rock by at least three hours  when the first boats left the rock with the artificers employed on the lower part of the work during the floodtide the beacon had quite a novel appearance the beams erected formed a common base of about thirtythree feet meeting at the top which was about fortyfive feet above the rock and here half a dozen of the artificers were still at work after clearing the rock the boats made a stop when three hearty cheers were given which were returned with equal goodwill by those upon the beacon from the personal interest which every one felt in the prosperity of this work so intimately connected with his safety  all hands having returned to their respective ships they got a shift of dry clothes and some refreshment being sunday they were afterwards convened by signal on board of the lighthouse yacht when prayers were read for every heart upon this occasion felt gladness and every mind was disposed to be thankful for the happy and successful termination of the operations of this day    monday 21st sept   the remaining two principal beams were erected in the course of this tide which with the assistance of those set up yesterday was found to be a very simple operation    tuesday 22nd sept  the six principal beams of the beacon were thus secured at least in a temporary manner in the course of two tides or in the short space of about eleven hours and a half such is the progress that may be made when active hands and willing minds set properly to work in operations of this kind having now got the weighty part of this work over and being thereby relieved of the difficulty both of landing and victualling such a number of men the smeaton could now be spared and she was accordingly despatched to arbroath for a supply of water and provisions and carried with her six of the artificers who could best be spared    wednesday 23rd sept  in going out of the eastern harbour the boat which the writer steered shipped a sea that filled her about onethird with water she had also been hid for a short time by the waves breaking upon the rock from the sight of the crew of the preceding boat who were much alarmed for our safety imagining for a time that she had gone down  the smeaton returned from arbroath this afternoon but there was so much sea that she could not be made fast to her moorings and the vessel was obliged to return to arbroath without being able either to deliver the provisions or take the artificers on board the lighthouse yacht was also soon obliged to follow her example as the sea was breaking heavily over her bows after getting two reefs in the mainsail and the third or stormjib set the wind being sw she bent to windward though blowing a hard gale and got into st andrews bay where we passed the night under the lee of fifeness    thursday 24th sept  at two oclock this morning we were in st andrews bay standing off and on shore with strong gales of wind at sw at seven we were off the entrance of the tay at eight stood towards the rock and at ten passed to leeward of it but could not attempt a landing the beacon however appeared to remain in good order and by six pm the vessel had again beaten up to st andrews bay and got into somewhat smoother water for the night    friday 25th sept  at seven oclock bore away for the bell rock but finding a heavy sea running on it were unable to land the writer however had the satisfaction to observe with his telescope that everything about the beacon appeared entire and although the sea had a most frightful appearance yet it was the opinion of every one that since the erection of the beacon the bell rock was divested of many of its terrors and had it been possible to have got the boats hoisted out and manned it might have even been found practicable to land at six it blew so hard that it was found necessary to strike the topmast and take in a third reef of the mainsail and under this low canvas we soon reached st andrews bay and got again under the lee of the land for the night the artificers being seahardy were quite reconciled to their quarters on board of the lighthouse yacht but it is believed that hardly any consideration would have induced them again to take up their abode in the floating light    saturday 26th sept  at daylight the yacht steered towards the bell rock and at eight am made fast to her moorings at ten all hands to the amount of thirty landed when the writer had the happiness to find that the beacon had withstood the violence of the gale and the heavy breach of sea everything being found in the same state in which it had been left on the 21st the artificers were now enabled to work upon the rock throughout the whole day both at low and high water but it required the strictest attention to the state of the weather in case of their being overtaken with a gale which might prevent the possibility of getting them off the rock  two somewhat memorable circumstances in the annals of the bell rock attended the operations of this day one was the removal of mr james dove the foreman smith with his apparatus from the rock to the upper part of the beacon where the forge was now erected on a temporary platform laid on the cross beams or upper framing the other was the artificers having dined for the first time upon the rock their dinner being cooked on board of the yacht and sent to them by one of the boats but what afforded the greatest happiness and relief was the removal of the large bellows which had all along been a source of much trouble and perplexity by their hampering and incommoding the boat which carried the smiths and their apparatus    saturday 3rd oct  the wind being west today the weather was very favourable for operations at the rock and during the morning and evening tides with the aid of torchlight the masons had seven hours work upon the site of the building the smiths and joiners who landed at halfpast six am did not leave the rock till a quarterpast eleven pm having been at work with little intermission for sixteen hours and threequarters when the water left the rock they were employed at the lower parts of the beacon and as the tide rose or fell they shifted the place of their operations from these exertions the fixing and securing of the beacon made rapid advancement as the men were now landed in the morning and remained throughout the day but as a sudden change of weather might have prevented their being taken off at the proper time of tide a quantity of bread and water was always kept on the beacon  during this period of working at the beacon all the day and often a great part of the night the writer was much on board of the tender but while the masons could work on the rock and frequently also while it was covered by the tide he remained on the beacon especially during the night as he made a point of being on the rock to the latest hour and was generally the last person who stepped into the boat he had laid this down as part of his plan of procedure and in this way had acquired in the course of the first season a pretty complete knowledge and experience of what could actually be done at the bell rock under all circumstances of the weather by this means also his assistants and the artificers and mariners got into a systematic habit of proceeding at the commencement of the work which it is believed continued throughout the whole of the operations    sunday 4th oct  the external part of the beacon was now finished with its supports and bracingchains and whatever else was considered necessary for its stability in so far as the season would permit and although much was still wanting to complete this fabric yet it was in such a state that it could be left without much fear of the consequences of a storm the painting of the upper part was nearly finished this afternoon and the smeaton had brought off a quantity of brushwood and other articles for the purpose of heating or charring the lower part of the principal beams before being laid over with successive coats of boiling pitch to the height of from eight to twelve feet or as high as the rise of springtides a small flagstaff having also been erected today a flag was displayed for the first time from the beacon by which its perspective effect was greatly improved on this as on all like occasions at the bell rock three hearty cheers were given and the steward served out a dram of rum to all hands while the lighthouse yacht smeaton and floating light hoisted their colours in compliment to the erection    monday 5th oct  in the afternoon and just as the tides work was over mr john rennie engineer accompanied by his son mr george on their way to the harbour works of fraserburgh in aberdeenshire paid a visit to the bell rock in a boat from arbroath it being then too late in the tide for landing they remained on board of the lighthouse yacht all night when the writer who had now been secluded from society for several weeks enjoyed much of mr rennies interesting conversation both on general topics and professionally upon the progress of the bell rock works on which he was consulted as chief engineer    tuesday 6th oct  the artificers landed this morning at nine after which one of the boats returned to the ship for the writer and messrs rennie who upon landing were saluted with a display of the colours from the beacon and by three cheers from the workmen everything was now in a prepared state for leaving the rock and giving up the works afloat for this season excepting some small articles which would still occupy the smiths and joiners for a few days longer they accordingly shifted on board of the smealon while the yacht left the rock for arbroath with messrs rennie the writer and the remainder of the artificers but before taking leave the steward served out a farewell glass when three hearty cheers were given and an earnest wish expressed that everything in the spring of 1808 might be found in the same state of good order as it was now about to be left     ii    operations of 1808    monday 29th feb  the writer sailed from arbroath at one am in the lighthouse yacht at seven the floating light was hailed and all on board found to be well the crew were observed to have a very healthylike appearance and looked better than at the close of the works upon the rock they seemed only to regret one thing which was the secession of their cook thomas elliotnot on account of his professional skill but for his facetious and curious manner elliot had something peculiar in his history and was reported by his comrades to have seen better days he was however happy with his situation on board of the floating light and having a taste for music dancing and acting plays he contributed much to the amusement of the ships company in their dreary abode during the winter months he had also recommended himself to their notice as a good shipkeeper for as it did not answer elliot to go often ashore he had always given up his turn of leave to his neighbours at his own desire he was at length paid off when he had a considerable balance of wages to receive which he said would be sufficient to carry him to the west indies and he accordingly took leave of the lighthouse service    tuesday 1st march  at daybreak the lighthouse yacht attended by a boat from the floating light again stood towards the bell rock the weather felt extremely cold this morning the thermometer being at 34 degrees with the wind at east accompanied by occasional showers of snow and the marine barometer indicated 2980 at halfpast seven the sea ran with such force upon the rock that it seemed doubtful if a landing could be effected at halfpast eight when it was fairly above water the writer took his place in the floating lights boat with the artificers while the yachts boat followed according to the general rule of having two boats afloat in landing expeditions of this kind that in case of accident to one boat the other might assist in several unsuccessful attempts the boats were beat back by the breach of the sea upon the rock on the eastern side it separated into two distinct waves which came with a sweep round to the western side where they met and at the instance of their confluence the water rose in spray to a considerable height watching what the sailors term a smooth we caught a favourable opportunity and in a very dexterous manner the boats were rowed between the two seas and made a favourable landing at the western creek  at the latter end of last season as was formerly noticed the beacon was painted white and from the bleaching of the weather and the sprays of the sea the upper parts were kept clean but within the range of the tide the principal beams were observed to be thickly coated with a green stuff the conferva of botanists notwithstanding the intrusion of these works which had formerly banished the numerous seals that played about the rock they were now seen in great numbers having been in an almost undisturbed state for six months it had now also for the first time got some inhabitants of the feathered tribe in particular the scarth or cormorant and the large herringgull had made the beacon a restingplace from its vicinity to their fishinggrounds about a dozen of these birds had rested upon the crossbeams which in some places were coated with their dung and their flight as the boats approached was a very unlookedfor indication of life and habitation on the bell rock conveying the momentary idea of the conversion of this fatal rock from being a terror to the mariner into a residence of man and a safeguard to shipping  upon narrowly examining the great iron stanchions with which the beams were fixed to the rock the writer had the satisfaction of finding that there was not the least appearance of working or shifting at any of the joints or places of connection and excepting the loosening of the bracingchains everything was found in the same entire state in which it had been left in the month of october this in the estimation of the writer was a matter of no small importance to the future success of the work he from that moment saw the practicability and propriety of fitting up the beacon not only as a place of refuge in case of accident to the boats in landing but as a residence for the artificers during the working months  while upon the top of the beacon the writer was reminded by the landingmaster that the sea was running high and that it would be necessary to set off while the rock afforded anything like shelter to the boats which by this time had been made fast by a long line to the beacon and rode with much agitation each requiring two men with boathooks to keep them from striking each other or from ranging up against the beacon but even under these circumstances the greatest confidence was felt by every one from the security afforded by this temporary erection for supposing the wind had suddenly increased to a gale and that it had been found unadvisable to go into the boats or supposing they had drifted or sprung a leak from striking upon the rocks in any of these possible and not at all improbable cases those who might thus have been left upon the rock had now something to lay hold of and though occupying this dreary habitation of the seagull and the cormorant affording only bread and water yet life would be preserved and the mind would still be supported by the hope of being ultimately relieved    wednesday 25th may  on the 25th of may the writer embarked at arbroath on board of the sir joseph banks for the bell rock accompanied by mr logan senior foreman builder with twelve masons and two smiths together with thirteen seamen including the master mate and steward    thursday 26th may  mr james wilson now commander of the pharos floating light and landingmaster in the room of mr sinclair who had left the service came into the writers cabin this morning at six oclock and intimated that there was a good appearance of landing on the rock everything being arranged both boats proceeded in company and at eight am they reached the rock the lighthouse colours were immediately hoisted upon the flagstaff of the beacon a compliment which was duly returned by the tender and floating light when three hearty cheers were given and a glass of rum was served out to all hands to drink success to the operations of 1808    friday 27th may  this morning the wind was at east blowing a fresh gale the weather being hazy with a considerable breach of sea setting in upon the rock the morning bell was therefore rung in some doubt as to the practicability of making a landing after allowing the rock to get fully up or to be sufficiently left by the tide that the boats might have some shelter from the range of the sea they proceeded at eight am and upon the whole made a pretty good landing and after two hours and threequarters work returned to the ship in safety  in the afternoon the wind considerably increased and as a pretty heavy sea was still running the tender rode very hard when mr taylor the commander found it necessary to take in the bowsprit and strike the fore and main topmasts that she might ride more easily after consulting about the state of the weather it was resolved to leave the artificers on board this evening and carry only the smiths to the rock as the sharpening of the irons was rather behind from their being so much broken and blunted by the hard and tough nature of the rock which became much more compact and hard as the depth of excavation was increased besides avoiding the risk of encumbering the boats with a number of men who had not yet got the full command of the oar in a breach of sea the writer had another motive for leaving them behind he wanted to examine the site of the building without interruption and to take the comparative levels of the different inequalities of its area and as it would have been painful to have seen men standing idle upon the bell rock where all moved with activity it was judged better to leave them on board the boats landed at halfpast seven pm and the landingmaster with the seamen was employed during this tide in cutting the seaweeds from the several paths leading to the landingplaces to render walking more safe for from the slippery state of the surface of the rock many severe tumbles had taken place in the meantime the writer took the necessary levels and having carefully examined the site of the building and considered all its parts it still appeared to be necessary to excavate to the average depth of fourteen inches over the whole area of the foundation    saturday 28th may  the wind still continued from the eastward with a heavy swell and today it was accompanied with foggy weather and occasional showers of rain notwithstanding this such was the confidence which the erection of the beacon had inspired that the boats landed the artificers on the rock under very unpromising circumstances at halfpast eight and they continued at work till halfpast eleven being a period of three hours which was considered a great tides work in the present low state of the foundation three of the masons on board were so afflicted with seasickness that they had not been able to take any food for almost three days and they were literally assisted into the boats this morning by their companions it was however not a little surprising to see how speedily these men revived upon landing on the rock and eating a little dulse two of them afterwards assisted the sailors in collecting the chips of stone and carrying them out of the way of the pickmen but the third complained of a pain in his head and was still unable to do anything instead of returning to the tender with the boats these three men remained on the beacon all day and had their victuals sent to them along with the smiths from mr dove the foreman smith they had much sympathy for he preferred remaining on the beacon at all hazards to be himself relieved from the malady of seasickness the wind continuing high with a heavy sea and the tide falling late it was not judged proper to land the artificers this evening but in the twilight the boats were sent to fetch the people on board who had been left on the rock    sunday 29th may  the wind was from the sw today and the signalbell rung as usual about an hour before the period for landing on the rock the writer was rather surprised however to hear the landingmaster repeatedly call all hands for the rock and coming on deck he was disappointed to find the seamen only in the boats upon inquiry it appeared that some misunderstanding had taken place about the wages of the artificers for sundays they had preferred wages for seven days statedly to the former mode of allowing a day for each tides work on sunday as they did not like the appearance of working for double or even treble wages on sunday and would rather have it understood that their work on that day arose more from the urgency of the case than with a view to emolument this having been judged creditable to their religious feelings and readily adjusted to their wish the boats proceeded to the rock and the work commenced at nine am    monday 30th may  mr francis watt commenced with five joiners to fit up a temporary platform upon the beacon about twentyfive feet above the highest part of the rock this platform was to be used as the site of the smiths forge after the beacon should be fitted up as a barrack and here also the mortar was to be mixed and prepared for the building and it was accordingly termed the mortar gallery  the landingmasters crew completed the discharging from the smeaton of her cargo of the castiron rails and timber it must not here be omitted to notice that the smeaton took in ballast from the bell rock consisting of the shivers or chips of stone produced by the workmen in preparing the site of the building which were now accumulating in great quantities on the rock these the boats loaded after discharging the iron the object in carrying off these chips besides ballasting the vessel was to get them permanently out of the way as they were apt to shift about from place to place with every gale of wind and it often required a considerable time to clear the foundation a second time of this rubbish the circumstance of ballasting a ship at the bell rock afforded great entertainment especially to the sailors and it was perhaps with truth remarked that the smeaton was the first vessel that had ever taken on board ballast at the bell rock mr pool the commander of this vessel afterwards acquainted the writer that when the ballast was landed upon the quay at leith many persons carried away specimens of it as part of a cargo from the bell rock when he added that such was the interest excited from the number of specimens carried away that some of his friends suggested that he should have sent the whole to the cross of edinburgh where each piece might have sold for a penny    tuesday 31st may  in the evening the boats went to the rock and brought the joiners and smiths and their sickly companions on board of the tender these also brought with them two baskets full of fish which they had caught at highwater from the beacon reporting at the same time to their comrades that the fish were swimming in such numbers over the rock at highwater that it was completely hid from their sight and nothing seen but the movement of thousands of fish they were almost exclusively of the species called the podlie or young coalfish this discovery made for the first time today by the workmen was considered fortunate as an additional circumstance likely to produce an inclination among the artificers to take up their residence in the beacon when it came to be fitted up as a barrack    tuesday 7th june  at three oclock in the morning the ships bell was rung as the signal for landing at the rock when the landing was to be made before breakfast it was customary to give each of the artificers and seamen a dram and a biscuit and coffee was prepared by the steward for the cabins exactly at four oclock the whole party landed from three boats including one of those belonging to the floating light with a part of that ships crew which always attended the works in moderate weather the landingmasters boat called the seaman but more commonly called the lifeboat took the lead the next boat called the mason was generally steered by the writer while the floating lights boat pharos was under the management of the boatswain of that ship  having now so considerable a party of workmen and sailors on the rock it may be proper here to notice how their labours were directed preparations having been made last month for the erection of a second forge upon the beacon the smiths commenced their operations both upon the lower and higher platforms they were employed in sharpening the picks and irons for the masons and making bats and other apparatus of various descriptions connected with the fitting of the railways the landingmasters crew were occupied in assisting the millwrights in laying the railways to hand sailors of all other descriptions of men are the most accommodating in the use of their hands they worked freely with the boringirons and assisted in all the operations of the railways acting by turns as boatmen seamen and artificers we had no such character on the bell rock as the common labourer all the operations of this department were cheerfully undertaken by the seamen who both on the rock and on shipboard were the inseparable companions of every work connected with the erection of the bell rock lighthouse it will naturally be supposed that about twentyfive masons occupied with their picks in executing and preparing the foundation of the lighthouse in the course of a tide of about three hours would make a considerable impression upon an area even of fortytwo feet in diameter but in proportion as the foundation was deepened the rock was found to be much more hard and difficult to work while the baling and pumping of water became much more troublesome a joiner was kept almost constantly employed in fitting the picks to their handles which as well as the points to the irons were very frequently broken  the bell rock this morning presented by far the most busy and active appearance it had exhibited since the erection of the principal beams of the beacon the surface of the rock was crowded with men the two forges flaming the one above the other upon the beacon while the anvils thundered with the rebounding noise of their wooden supports and formed a curious contrast with the occasional clamour of the surges the wind was westerly and the weather being extremely agreeable so soon after breakfast as the tide had sufficiently overflowed the rock to float the boats over it the smiths with a number of the artificers returned to the beacon carrying their fishingtackle along with them in the course of the forenoon the beacon exhibited a still more extraordinary appearance than the rock had done in the morning the sea being smooth it seemed to be afloat upon the water with a number of men supporting themselves in all the variety of attitude and position while from the upper part of this wooden house the volumes of smoke which ascended from the forges gave the whole a very curious and fanciful appearance  in the course of this tide it was observed that a heavy swell was setting in from the eastward and the appearance of the sky indicated a change of weather while the wind was shifting about the barometer also had fallen from 30 in to 296 it was therefore judged prudent to shift the vessel to the sw or more distant buoy her bowsprit was also soon afterwards taken in the topmasts struck and everything made snug as seamen term it for a gale during the course of the night the wind increased and shifted to the eastward when the vessel rolled very hard and the sea often broke over her bows with great force    wednesday 8th june  although the motion of the tender was much less than that of the floating lightat least in regard to the rolling motionyet she sended or pitched much being also of a very handsome build and what seamen term very clean aft the sea often struck her counter with such force that the writer who possessed the aftermost cabin being unaccustomed to this new vessel could not divest himself of uneasiness for when her stern fell into the sea it struck with so much violence as to be more like the resistance of a rock than the sea the water at the same time often rushed with great force up the ruddercase and forcing up the valve of the watercloset the floor of his cabin was at times laid under water the gale continued to increase and the vessel rolled and pitched in such a manner that the hawser by which the tender was made fast to the buoy snapped and she went adrift in the act of swinging round to the wind she shipped a very heavy sea which greatly alarmed the artificers who imagined that we had got upon the rock but this from the direction of the wind was impossible the writer however sprung upon deck where he found the sailors busily employed in rigging out the bowsprit and in setting sail from the easterly direction of the wind it was considered most advisable to steer for the firth of forth and there wait a change of weather at two pm we accordingly passed the isle of may at six anchored in leith roads and at eight the writer landed when he came in upon his friends who were not a little surprised at his unexpected appearance which gave an instantaneous alarm for the safety of things at the bell rock    thursday 9th june  the wind still continued to blow very hard at e by n and the sir joseph banks rode heavily and even drifted with both anchors ahead in leith roads the artificers did not attempt to leave the ship last night but there being upwards of fifty people on board and the decks greatly lumbered with the two large boats they were in a very crowded and impatient state on board but today they got ashore and amused themselves by walking about the streets of edinburgh some in very humble apparel from having only the worst of their jackets with them which though quite suitable for their work were hardly fit for public inspection being not only tattered but greatly stained with the red colour of the rock    friday 10th june  today the wind was at se with light breezes and foggy weather at six am the writer again embarked for the bell rock when the vessel immediately sailed at eleven pm there being no wind the kedgeanchor was let go off anstruther one of the numerous towns on the coast of fife where we waited the return of the tide    saturday 11th june  at six am the sir joseph got under weigh and at eleven was again made fast to the southern buoy at the bell rock though it was now late in the tide the writer being anxious to ascertain the state of things after the gale landed with the artificers to the number of fortyfour everything was found in an entire state but as the tide was nearly gone only half an hours work had been got when the site of the building was overflowed in the evening the boats again landed at nine and after a good tides work of three hours with torchlight the work was left off at midnight to the distant shipping the appearance of things under night on the bell rock when the work was going forward must have been very remarkable especially to those who were strangers to the operations mr john reid principal lightkeeper who also acted as master of the floating light during the working months at the rock described the appearance of the numerous lights situated so low in the water when seen at the distance of two or three miles as putting him in mind of miltons description of the fiends in the lower regions adding for it seems greatly to surpass willothewisp or any of those earthly spectres of which we have so often heard    monday 13th june  from the difficulties attending the landing on the rock owing to the breach of sea which had for days past been around it the artificers showed some backwardness at getting into the boats this morning but after a little explanation this was got over it was always observable that for some time after anything like danger had occurred at the rock the workmen became much more cautious and on some occasions their timidity was rather troublesome it fortunately happened however that along with the writers assistants and the sailors there were also some of the artificers themselves who felt no such scruples and in this way these difficulties were the more easily surmounted in matters where life is in danger it becomes necessary to treat even unfounded prejudices with tenderness as an accident under certain circumstances would not only have been particularly painful to those giving directions but have proved highly detrimental to the work especially in the early stages of its advancement  at four oclock fiftyeight persons landed but the tides being extremely languid the water only left the higher parts of the rock and no work could be done at the site of the building a third forge was however put in operation during a short time for the greater conveniency of sharpening the picks and irons and for purposes connected with the preparations for fixing the railways on the rock the weather towards the evening became thick and foggy and there was hardly a breath of wind to ruffle the surface of the water had it not therefore been for the noise from the anvils of the smiths who had been left on the beacon throughout the day which afforded a guide for the boats a landing could not have been attempted this evening especially with such a company of artificers this circumstance confirmed the writers opinion with regard to the propriety of connecting large bells to be rung with machinery in the lighthouse to be tolled day and night during the continuance of foggy weather    thursday 23rd june  the boats landed this evening when the artificers had again two hours work the weather still continuing very thick and foggy more difficulty was experienced in getting on board of the vessels tonight than had occurred on any previous occasion owing to a light breeze of wind which carried the sound of the bell and the other signals made on board of the vessels away from the rock having fortunately made out the position of the sloop smeaton at the ne buoyto which we were much assisted by the barking of the ships dogwe parted with the smeatons boat when the boats of the tender took a fresh departure for that vessel which lay about half a mile to the southwestward yet such is the very deceiving state of the tides that although there was a small binnacle and compass in the landingmasters boat we had nevertheless passed the sir joseph a good way when fortunately one of the sailors catched the sound of a blowinghorn the only firearms on board were a pair of swivels of oneinch calibre but it is quite surprising how much the sound is lost in foggy weather as the report was heard but at a very short distance the sound from the explosion of gunpowder is so instantaneous that the effect of the small guns was not so good as either the blowing of a horn or the tolling of a bell which afforded a more constant and steady direction for the pilot    wednesday 6th july  landed on the rock with the three boats belonging to the tender at five pm and began immediately to bale the water out of the foundationpit with a number of buckets while the pumps were also kept in action with relays of artificers and seamen the work commenced upon the higher parts of the foundation as the water left them but it was now pretty generally reduced to a level about twenty men could be conveniently employed at each pump and it is quite astonishing in how short a time so great a body of water could be drawn off the water in the foundationpit at this time measured about two feet in depth on an area of fortytwo feet in diameter and yet it was drawn off in the course of about half an hour after this the artificers commenced with their picks and continued at work for two hours and a half some of the sailors being at the same time busily employed in clearing the foundation of chips and in conveying the irons to and from the smiths on the beacon where they were sharped at eight oclock the sea broke in upon us and overflowed the foundationpit when the boats returned to the tender    thursday 7th july  the landingmasters bell rung this morning about four oclock and at halfpast five the foundation being cleared the work commenced on the site of the building but from the moment of landing the squad of joiners and millwrights was at work upon the higher parts of the rock in laying the railways while the anvils of the smith resounded on the beacon and such columns of smoke ascended from the forges that they were often mistaken by strangers at a distance for a ship on fire after continuing three hours at work the foundation of the building was again overflowed and the boats returned to the ship at halfpast eight oclock the masons and pickmen had at this period a pretty long day on board of the tender but the smiths and joiners were kept constantly at work upon the beacon the stability and great conveniency of which had now been so fully shown that no doubt remained as to the propriety of fitting it up as a barrack the workmen were accordingly employed during the period of highwater in making preparations for this purpose  the foundationpit now assumed the appearance of a great platform and the late tides had been so favourable that it became apparent that the first course consisting of a few irregular and detached stones for making up certain inequalities in the interior parts of the site of the building might be laid in the course of the present springtides having been enabled today to get the dimensions of the foundation or first stone accurately taken a mould was made of its figure when the writer left the rock after the tides work of this morning in a fast rowingboat for arbroath and upon landing two men were immediately set to work upon one of the blocks from mylnefield quarry which was prepared in the course of the following day as the stonecutters relieved each other and worked both night and day so that it was sent off in one of the stonelighters without delay    saturday 9th july  the site of the foundationstone was very difficult to work from its depth in the rock but being now nearly prepared it formed a very agreeable kind of pastime at highwater for all hands to land the stone itself upon the rock the landingmasters crew and artificers accordingly entered with great spirit into this operation the stone was placed upon the deck of the hedderwick praamboat which had just been brought from leith and was decorated with colours for the occasion flags were also displayed from the shipping in the offing and upon the beacon here the writer took his station with the greater part of the artificers who supported themselves in every possible position while the boats towed the praam from her moorings and brought her immediately over the site of the building where her grappling anchors were let go the stone was then lifted off the deck by a tackle hooked into a lewis bat inserted into it when it was gently lowered into the water and grounded on the site of the building amidst the cheering acclamations of about sixty persons    sunday 10th july  at eleven oclock the foundationstone was laid to hand it was of a square form containing about twenty cubic feet and had the figures or date of 1808 simply cut upon it with a chisel a derrick or spar of timber having been erected at the edge of the hole and guyed with ropes the stone was then hooked to the tackle and lowered into its place when the writer attended by his assistantsmr peter logan mr francis watt and mr james wilsonapplied the square the level and the mallet and pronounced the following benediction may the great architect of the universe complete and bless this building on which three hearty cheers were given and success to the future operations was drunk with the greatest enthusiasm    tuesday 26th july  the wind being at se this evening we had a pretty heavy swell of sea upon the rock and some difficulty attended our getting off in safety as the boats got aground in the creek and were in danger of being upset upon extinguishing the torchlights about twelve in number the darkness of the night seemed quite horrible the water being also much charged with the phosphorescent appearance which is familiar to every one on shipboard the waves as they dashed upon the rock were in some degree like so much liquid flame the scene upon the whole was truly awful    wednesday 27th july  in leaving the rock this evening everything after the torches were extinguished had the same dismal appearance as last night but so perfectly acquainted were the landingmaster and his crew with the position of things at the rock that comparatively little inconveniency was experienced on these occasions when the weather was moderate such is the effect of habit even in the most unpleasant situations if for example it had been proposed to a person accustomed to a city life at once to take up his quarters off a sunken reef and land upon it in boats at all hours of the night the proposition must have appeared quite impracticable and extravagant but this practice coming progressively upon the artificers it was ultimately undertaken with the greatest alacrity notwithstanding this however it must be acknowledged that it was not till after much labour and peril and many an anxious hour that the writer is enabled to state that the site of the bell rock lighthouse is fully prepared for the first entire course of the building    friday 12th aug  the artificers landed this morning at halfpast ten and after an hour and a halfs work eight stones were laid which completed the first entire course of the building consisting of 123 blocks the last of which was laid with three hearty cheers    saturday 10th sept  landed at nine am and by a quarterpast twelve noon twentythree stones had been laid the works being now somewhat elevated by the lower courses we got quit of the very serious inconvenience of pumping water to clear the foundationpit this gave much facility to the operations and was noticed with expressions of as much happiness by the artificers as the seamen had shown when relieved of the continual trouble of carrying the smiths bellows off the rock prior to the erection of the beacon    wednesday 21st sept  mr thomas macurich mate of the smeaton and james scott one of the crew a young man about eighteen years of age immediately went into their boat to make fast a hawser to the ring in the top of the floating buoy of the moorings and were forthwith to proceed to land their cargo so much wanted at the rock the tides at this period were very strong and the mooringchain when sweeping the ground had caught hold of a rock or piece of wreck by which the chain was so shortened that when the tide flowed the buoy got almost under water and little more than the ring appeared at the surface when macurich and scott were in the act of making the hawser fast to the ring the chain got suddenly disentangled at the bottom and this large buoy measuring about seven feet in height and three feet in diameter at the middle tapering to both ends being what seamen term a nunbuoy vaulted or sprung up with such force that it upset the boat which instantly filled with water mr macurich with much exertion succeeded in getting hold of the boats gunwale still above the surface of the water and by this means was saved but the young man scott was unfortunately drowned he had in all probability been struck about the head by the ring of the buoy for although surrounded with the oars and the thwarts of the boat which floated near him yet he seemed entirely to want the power of availing himself of such assistance and appeared to be quite insensible while pool the master of the smeaton called loudly to him and before assistance could be got from the tender he was carried away by the strength of the current and disappeared  the young man scott was a great favourite in the service having had something uncommonly mild and complaisant in his manner and his loss was therefore universally regretted the circumstances of his case were also peculiarly distressing to his mother as her husband who was a seaman had for three years past been confined to a french prison and the deceased was the chief support of the family in order in some measure to make up the loss to the poor woman for the monthly aliment regularly allowed her by her late son it was suggested that a younger boy a brother of the deceased might be taken into the service this appeared to be rather a delicate proposition but it was left to the landingmaster to arrange according to circumstances such was the resignation and at the same time the spirit of the poor woman that she readily accepted the proposal and in a few days the younger scott was actually afloat in the place of his brother on representing this distressing case to the board the commissioners were pleased to grant an annuity of £5 to scotts mother  the smeaton not having been made fast to the buoy had with the ebbtide drifted to leeward a considerable way eastward of the rock and could not till the return of the floodtide be worked up to her moorings so that the present tide was lost notwithstanding all exertions which had been made both ashore and afloat with this cargo the artificers landed at six am but as no materials could be got upon the rock this morning they were employed in boring trenail holes and in various other operations and after four hours work they returned on board the tender when the smeaton got up to her moorings the landingmasters crew immediately began to unload her there being too much wind for towing the praams in the usual way they were warped to the rock in the most laborious manner by their windlasses with successive grapplings and hawsers laid out for this purpose at six pm the artificers landed and continued at work till halfpast ten when the remaining seventeen stones were laid which completed the third entire course or fourth of the lighthouse with which the building operations were closed for the season     iii    operations of 1809    wednesday 24th may  the last night was the first that the writer had passed in his old quarters on board of the floating light for about twelve months when the weather was so fine and the sea so smooth that even here he felt but little or no motion excepting at the turn of the tide when the vessel gets into what the seamen term the trough of the sea at six am mr watt who conducted the operations of the railways and beaconhouse had landed with nine artificers at halfpast one pm mr peter logan had also landed with fifteen masons and immediately proceeded to set up the crane the sheercrane or apparatus for lifting the stones out of the praamboats at the eastern creek had been already erected and the railways now formed about twothirds of an entire circle round the building some progress had likewise been made with the reach towards the western landingplace the floors being laid the beacon now assumed the appearance of a habitation the smeaton was at her moorings with the fernie praamboat astern for which she was laying down moorings and the tender being also at her station the bell rock had again put on its former busy aspect    wednesday 31st may  the landingmasters bell often no very favourite sound rung at six this morning but on this occasion it is believed it was gladly received by all on board as the welcome signal of the return of better weather the masons laid thirteen stones today which the seamen had landed together with other building materials during these twentyfour hours the wind was from the south blowing fresh breezes accompanied with showers of snow in the morning the snow showers were so thick that it was with difficulty the landingmaster who always steered the leading boat could make his way to the rock through the drift but at the bell rock neither snow nor rain nor fog nor wind retarded the progress of the work if unaccompanied by a heavy swell or breach of the sea  the weather during the months of april and may had been uncommonly boisterous and so cold that the thermometer seldom exceeded 40º while the barometer was generally about 2950 we had not only hail and sleet but the snow on the last day of may lay on the decks and rigging of the ship to the depth of about three inches and although now entering upon the month of june the length of the day was the chief indication of summer yet such is the effect of habit and such was the expertness of the landingmasters crew that even in this description of weather seldom a tides work was lost such was the ardour and zeal of the heads of the several departments at the rock including mr peter logan foreman builder mr francis watt foreman millwright and captain wilson landingmaster that it was on no occasion necessary to address them excepting in the way of precaution or restraint under these circumstances however the writer not unfrequently felt considerable anxiety of which this days experience will afford an example    thursday 1st june  this morning at a quarterpast eight the artificers were landed as usual and after three hours and threequarters work five stones were laid the greater part of this tide having been taken up in completing the boring and trenailing of the stones formerly laid at noon the writer with the seamen and artificers proceeded to the tender leaving on the beacon the joiners and several of those who were troubled with seasicknessamong whom was mr logan who remained with mr wattcounting altogether eleven persons during the first and middle parts of these twentyfour hours the wind was from the east blowing what the seamen term fresh breezes but in the afternoon it shifted to ene accompanied with so heavy a swell of sea that the smeaton and tender struck their topmasts launched in their boltsprits and made all snug for a gale at four pm the smeaton was obliged to slip her moorings and passed the tender drifting before the wind with only the foresail set in passing mr pool hailed that he must run for the firth of forth to prevent the vessel from riding under  on board of the tender the writers chief concern was about the eleven men left upon the beacon directions were accordingly given that everything about the vessel should be put in the best possible state to present as little resistance to the wind as possible that she might have the better chance of riding out the gale among these preparations the best bower cable was bent so as to have a second anchor in readiness in case the mooringhawser should give way that every means might be used for keeping the vessel within sight of the prisoners on the beacon and thereby keep them in as good spirits as possible from the same motive the boats were kept afloat that they might be less in fear of the vessel leaving her station the landingmaster had however repeatedly expressed his anxiety for the safety of the boats and wished much to have them hoisted on board at seven pm one of the boats as he feared was unluckily filled with sea from a wave breaking into her and it was with great difficulty that she could be baled out and got on board with the loss of her oars rudder and loose thwarts such was the motion of the ship that in taking this boat on board her gunwale was stove in and she otherwise received considerable damage night approached but it was still found quite impossible to go near the rock consulting therefore the safety of the second boat she also was hoisted on board of the tender  at this time the cabins of the beacon were only partially covered and had neither been provided with bedding nor a proper fireplace while the stock of provisions was but slender in these uncomfortable circumstances the people on the beacon were left for the night nor was the situation of those on board of the tender much better the rolling and pitching motion of the ship was excessive and excepting to those who had been accustomed to a residence in the floating light it seemed quite intolerable nothing was heard but the hissing of the winds and the creaking of the bulkheads or partitions of the ship the night was therefore spent in the most unpleasant reflections upon the condition of the people on the beacon especially in the prospect of the tender being driven from her moorings but even in such a case it afforded some consolation that the stability of the fabric was never doubted and that the boats of the floating light were at no great distance and ready to render the people on the rock the earliest assistance which the weather would permit the writers cabin being in the sternmost part of the ship which had what sailors term a good entry or was sharp built the sea as before noticed struck her counter with so much violence that the water with a rushing noise continually forced its way up the ruddercase lifted the valve of the watercloset and overran the cabin floor in these circumstances daylight was eagerly looked for and hailed with delight as well by those afloat as by the artificers upon the rock    friday 2nd june  in the course of the night the writer held repeated conversations with the officer on watch who reported that the weather continued much in the same state and that the barometer still indicated 2920 inches at six am the landingmaster considered the weather to have somewhat moderated and from certain appearances of the sky he was of opinion that a change for the better would soon take place he accordingly proposed to attempt a landing at lowwater and either get the people off the rock or at least ascertain what state they were in at nine am he left the vessel with a boat well manned carrying with him a supply of cooked provisions and a teakettle full of mulled port wine for the people on the beacon who had not had any regular diet for about thirty hours while they were exposed during that period in a great measure both to the winds and the sprays of the sea the boat having succeeded in landing she returned at eleven am with the artificers who had got off with considerable difficulty and who were heartily welcomed by all on board  upon inquiry it appeared that three of the stones last laid upon the building had been partially lifted from their beds by the force of the sea and were now held only by the trenails and that the castiron sheercrane had again been thrown down and completely broken with regard to the beacon the sea at highwater had lifted part of the mortar gallery or lowest floor and washed away all the limecasks and other movable articles from it but the principal parts of this fabric had sustained no damage on pressing messrs logan and watt on the situation of things in the course of the night mr logan emphatically said that the beacon had an illfaured15 twist when the sea broke upon it at highwater but that they were not very apprehensive of danger on inquiring as to how they spent the night it appeared that they had made shift to keep a small fire burning and by means of some old sails defended themselves pretty well from the sea sprays  it was particularly mentioned that by the exertions of james glen one of the joiners a number of articles were saved from being washed off the mortar gallery glen was also very useful in keeping up the spirits of the forlorn party in the early part of life he had undergone many curious adventures at sea which he now recounted somewhat after the manner of the tales of the arabian nights when one observed that the beacon was a most comfortless lodging glen would presently introduce some of his exploits and hardships in comparison with which the state of things at the beacon bore an aspect of comfort and happiness looking to their slender stock of provisions and their perilous and uncertain chance of speedy relief he would launch out into an account of one of his expeditions in the north sea when the vessel being much disabled in a storm was driven before the wind with the loss of almost all their provisions and the ship being much infested with rats the crew hunted these vermin with great eagerness to help their scanty allowance by such means glen had the address to make his companions in some measure satisfied or at least passive with regard to their miserable prospects upon this halftide rock in the middle of the ocean this incident is noticed more particularly to show the effects of such a happy turn of mind even under the most distressing and illfated circumstances    saturday 17th june  at eight am the artificers and sailors fortyfive in number landed on the rock and after four hours work seven stones were laid the remainder of this tide from the threatening appearance of the weather was occupied in trenailing and making all things as secure as possible at twelve noon the rock and building were again overflowed when the masons and seamen went on board of the tender but mr watt with his squad of ten men remained on the beacon throughout the day as it blew fresh from the nw in the evening it was found impracticable either to land the building artificers or to take the artificers off the beacon and they were accordingly left there all night but in circumstances very different from those of the 1st of this month the house being now in a more complete state was provided with bedding and they spent the night pretty well though they complained of having been much disturbed at the time of highwater by the shaking and tremulous motion of their house and by the plashing noise of the sea upon the mortar gallery here james glens versatile powers were again at work in cheering up those who seemed to be alarmed and in securing everything as far as possible on this occasion he had only to recall to the recollections of some of them the former night which they had spent on the beacon the wind and sea being then much higher and their habitation in a far less comfortable state  the wind still continuing to blow fresh from the nw at five pm the writer caused a signal to be made from the tender for the smeaton and patriot to slip their moorings when they ran for lunan bay an anchorage on the east side of the redhead those on board of the tender spent but a very rough night and perhaps slept less soundly than their companions on the beacon especially as the wind was at nw which caused the vessel to ride with her stern towards the bell rock so that in the event of anything giving way she could hardly have escaped being stranded upon it    sunday 18th june  the weather having moderated today the wind shifted to the westward at a quarterpast nine am the artificers landed from the tender and had the pleasure to find their friends who had been left on the rock quite hearty alleging that the beacon was the preferable quarters of the two    saturday 24th june  mr peter logan the foreman builder and his squad twentyone in number landed this morning at three oclock and continued at work four hours and a quarter and after laying seventeen stones returned to the tender at six am mr francis watt and his squad of twelve men landed and proceeded with their respective operations at the beacon and railways and were left on the rock during the whole day without the necessity of having any communication with the tender the kitchen of the beaconhouse being now fitted up it was today also that peter fortunea most obliging and wellknown character in the lighthouse servicewas removed from the tender to the beacon as cook and steward with a stock of provisions as ample as his limited storeroom would admit  when as many stones were built as comprised this days work the demand for mortar was proportionally increased and the task of the mortarmakers on these occasions was both laborious and severe this operation was chiefly performed by john watta strong active quarrier by professionwho was a perfect character in his way and extremely zealous in his department while the operations of the mortarmakers continued the forge upon their gallery was not generally in use but as the working hours of the builders extended with the height of the building the forge could not be so long wanted and then a sad confusion often ensued upon the circumscribed floor of the mortar gallery as the operations of watt and his assistants trenched greatly upon those of the smiths under these circumstances the boundary of the smiths was much circumscribed and they were personally annoyed especially in blowy weather with the dust of the lime in its powdered state the mortarmakers on the other hand were often not a little distressed with the heat of the fire and the sparks elicited on the anvil and not unaptly complained that they were placed between the devil and the deep sea    sunday 25th june  the work being now about ten feet in height admitted of a ropeladder being distended16 between the beacon and the building by this jacobs ladder as the seamen termed it a communication was kept up with the beacon while the rock was considerably under water one end of it being furnished with tackleblocks was fixed to the beams of the beacon at the level of the mortar gallery while the further end was connected with the upper course of the building by means of two lewis bats which were lifted from course to course as the work advanced in the same manner a rope furnished with a travelling pulley was distended for the purpose of transporting the mortarbuckets and other light articles between the beacon and the building which also proved a great conveniency to the work at this period the ropeladder and tackle for the mortar had a descent from the beacon to the building by and by they were on a level and towards the end of the season when the solid part had attained its full height the ascent was from the mortar gallery to the building    friday 30th june  the artificers landed on the rock this morning at a quarterpast six and remained at work five hours the cooking apparatus being now in full operation all hands had breakfast on the beacon at the usual hour and remained there throughout the day the crane upon the building had to be raised today from the eighth to the ninth course an operation which now required all the strength that could be mustered for working the guytackles for as the top of the crane was at this time about thirtyfive feet above the rock it became much more unmanageable while the beam was in the act of swinging round from one guy to another a great strain was suddenly brought upon the opposite tackle with the end of which the artificers had very improperly neglected to take a turn round some stationary object which would have given them the complete command of the tackle owing to this simple omission the crane got a preponderancy to one side and fell upon the building with a terrible crash the surrounding artificers immediately flew in every direction to get out of its way but michael wishart the principal builder having unluckily stumbled upon one of the uncut trenails fell upon his back his body fortunately got between the movable beam and the upright shaft of the crane and was thus saved but his feet got entangled with the wheels of the crane and were severely injured wishart being a robust young man endured his misfortune with wonderful firmness he was laid upon one of the narrow framed beds of the beacon and despatched in a boat to the tender where the writer was when this accident happened not a little alarmed on missing the crane from the top of the building and at the same time seeing a boat rowing towards the vessel with great speed when the boat came alongside with poor wishart stretched upon a bed covered with blankets a moment of great anxiety followed which was however much relieved when on stepping into the boat he was accosted by wishart though in a feeble voice and with an aspect pale as death from excessive bleeding directions having been immediately given to the coxswain to apply to mr kennedy at the workyard to procure the best surgical aid the boat was sent off without delay to arbroath the writer then landed at the rock when the crane was in a very short time got into its place and again put in a working state    monday 3rd july  the writer having come to arbroath with the yacht had an opportunity of visiting michael wishart the artificer who had met with so severe an accident at the rock on the 30th ult and had the pleasure to find him in a state of recovery from dr stevensons account under whose charge he had been placed hopes were entertained that amputation would not be necessary as his patient still kept free of fever or any appearance of mortification and wishart expressed a hope that he might at least be ultimately capable of keeping the light at the bell rock as it was not now likely that he would assist further in building the house    saturday 8th july  it was remarked today with no small demonstration of joy that the tide being neap did not for the first time overflow the building at highwater flags were accordingly hoisted on the beaconhouse and crane on the top of the building which were repeated from the floating light lighthouse yacht tender smeaton patriot and the two praams a salute of three guns was also fired from the yacht at highwater when all the artificers being collected on the top of the building three cheers were given in testimony of this important circumstance a glass of rum was then served out to all hands on the rock and on board of the respective ships    sunday 16th july  besides laying boring trenailing wedging and grouting thirtytwo stones several other operations were proceeded with on the rock at lowwater when some of the artificers were employed at the railways and at highwater at the beaconhouse the seamen having prepared a quantity of tarpaulin or cloth laid over with successive coats of hot tar the joiners had just completed the covering of the roof with it this sort of covering was lighter and more easily managed than sheetlead in such a situation as a further defence against the weather the whole exterior of this temporary residence was painted with three coats of whitelead paint between the timber framing of the habitable part of the beacon the interstices were to be stuffed with moss as a light substance that would resist dampness and check sifting winds the whole interior was then to be lined with green baize cloth so that both without and within the cabins were to have a very comfortable appearance  although the building artificers generally remained on the rock throughout the day and the millwrights joiners and smiths while their number was considerable remained also during the night yet the tender had hitherto been considered as their night quarters but the wind having in the course of the day shifted to the nw and as the passage to the tender in the boats was likely to be attended with difficulty the whole of the artificers with mr logan the foreman preferred remaining all night on the beacon which had of late become the solitary abode of george forsyth a jobbing upholsterer who had been employed in lining the beaconhouse with cloth and in fitting up the bedding forsyth was a tall thin and rather loosemade man who had an utter aversion at climbing upon the trapladders of the beacon but especially at the process of boating and the motion of the ship which he said was death itself he therefore pertinaciously insisted with the landingmaster in being left upon the beacon with a small black dog as his only companion the writer however felt some delicacy in leaving a single individual upon the rock who must have been so very helpless in case of accident this fabric had from the beginning been rather intended by the writer to guard against accident from the loss or damage of a boat and as a place for making mortar a smiths shop and a store for tools during the working months than as permanent quarters nor was it at all meant to be possessed until the joinerwork was completely finished and his own cabin and that for the foreman in readiness when it was still to be left to the choice of the artificers to occupy the tender or the beacon he however considered forsyths partiality and confidence in the latter as rather a fortunate occurrence    wednesday 19th july  the whole of the artificers twentythree in number now removed of their own accord from the tender to lodge in the beacon together with peter fortune a person singularly adapted for a residence of this kind both from the urbanity of his manners and the versatility of his talents fortune in his person was of small stature and rather corpulent besides being a good scots cook he had acted both as groom and houseservant he had been a soldier a sutler a writers clerk and an apothecary from which he possessed the art of writing and suggesting recipes and had hence also perhaps acquired a turn for making collections in natural history but in his practice in surgery on the bell rock for which he received an annual fee of three guineas he is supposed to have been rather partial to the use of the lancet in short peter was the factotum of the beaconhouse where he ostensibly acted in the several capacities of cook steward surgeon and barber and kept a statement of the rations or expenditure of the provisions with the strictest integrity  in the present important state of the building when it had just attained the height of sixteen feet and the upper courses and especially the imperfect one were in the wash of the heaviest seas an express boat arrived at the rock with a letter from mr kennedy of the workyard stating that in consequence of the intended expedition to walcheren an embargo had been laid on shipping at all the ports of great britain that both the smeaton and patriot were detained at arbroath and that but for the proper view which mr ramsey the port officer had taken of his orders neither the express boat nor one which had been sent with provisions and necessaries for the floating light would have been permitted to leave the harbour the writer set off without delay for arbroath and on landing used every possible means with the official people but their orders were deemed so peremptory that even boats were not permitted to sail from any port upon the coast in the meantime the collector of the customs at montrose applied to the board at edinburgh but could of himself grant no relief to the bell rock shipping  at this critical period mr adam duff then sheriff of forfarshire now of the county of edinburgh and ex officio one of the commissioners of the northern lighthouses happened to be at arbroath mr duff took an immediate interest in representing the circumstances of the case to the board of customs at edinburgh but such were the doubts entertained on the subject that on having previously received the appeal from the collector at montrose the case had been submitted to the consideration of the lords of the treasury whose decision was now waited for  in this state of things the writer felt particularly desirous to get the thirteenth course finished that the building might be in a more secure state in the event of bad weather an opportunity was therefore embraced on the 25th in sailing with provisions for the floating light to carry the necessary stones to the rock for this purpose which were landed and built on the 26th and 27th but so closely was the watch kept up that a customhouse officer was always placed on board of the smeaton and patriot while they were afloat till the embargo was especially removed from the lighthouse vessels the artificers at the bell rock had been reduced to fifteen who were regularly supplied with provisions along with the crew of the floating light mainly through the port officers liberal interpretation of his orders    tuesday 1st aug  there being a considerable swell and breach of sea upon the rock yesterday the stones could not be got landed till the day following when the wind shifted to the southward and the weather improved but today no less than seventyeight blocks of stone were landed of which forty were built which completed the fourteenth and part of the fifteenth courses the number of workmen now resident in the beaconhouse were augmented to twentyfour including the landingmasters crew from the tender and the boats crew from the floating light who assisted at landing the stones those daily at work upon the rock at this period amounted to fortysix a cabin had been laid out for the writer on the beacon but his apartment had been the last which was finished and he had not yet taken possession of it for though he generally spent the greater part of the day at this time upon the rock yet he always slept on board of the tender    friday 11th aug  the wind was at se on the 11th and there was so very heavy a swell of sea upon the rock that no boat could approach it    saturday 12th aug  the gale still continuing from the se the sea broke with great violence both upon the building and the beacon the former being twentythree feet in height the upper part of the crane erected on it having been lifted from course to course as the building advanced was now about thirtysix feet above the rock from observations made on the rise of the sea by this crane the artificers were enabled to estimate its height to be about fifty feet above the rock while the sprays fell with a most alarming noise upon their cabins at lowwater in the evening a signal was made from the beacon at the earnest desire of some of the artificers for the boats to come to the rock and although this could not be effected without considerable hazard it was however accomplished when twelve of their number being much afraid applied to the foreman to be relieved and went on board of the tender but the remaining fourteen continued on the rock with mr peter logan the foreman builder although this rule of allowing an option to every man either to remain on the rock or return to the tender was strictly adhered to yet as it would have been extremely inconvenient to have had the men parcelled out in this manner it became necessary to embrace the first opportunity of sending those who had left the beacon to the workyard with as little appearance of intention as possible lest it should hurt their feelings or prevent others from acting according to their wishes either in landing on the rock or remaining on the beacon    tuesday 15th aug  the wind had fortunately shifted to the sw this morning and though a considerable breach was still upon the rock yet the landingmasters crew were enabled to get one praamboat lightly loaded with five stones brought in safety to the western creek these stones were immediately laid by the artificers who gladly embraced the return of good weather to proceed with their operations the writer had this day taken possession of his cabin in the beaconhouse it was small but commodious and was found particularly convenient in coarse and blowing weather instead of being obliged to make a passage to the tender in an open boat at all times both during the day and the night which was often attended with much difficulty and danger    saturday 19th aug  for some days past the weather had been occasionally so thick and foggy that no small difficulty was experienced in going even between the rock and the tender though quite at hand but the floating lights boat lost her way so far in returning on board that the first land she made after rowing all night was fifeness a distance of about fourteen miles the weather having cleared in the morning the crew stood off again for the floating light and got on board in a halffamished and much exhausted state having been constantly rowing for about sixteen hours    sunday 20th aug  the weather being very favourable today fiftythree stones were landed and the builders were not a little gratified in having built the twentysecond course consisting of fiftyone stones being the first course which had been completed in one day this as a matter of course produced three hearty cheers at twelve noon prayers were read for the first time on the bell rock those present counting thirty were crowded into the upper apartment of the beacon where the writer took a central position while two of the artificers joining hands supported the bible    friday 25th aug  today the artificers laid fortyfive stones which completed the twentyfourth course reckoning above the first entire one and the twentysixth above the rock this finished the solid part of the building and terminated the height of the outward casing of granite which is thirtyone feet six inches above the rock or site of the foundationstone and about seventeen feet above high water of springtides being a particular crisis in the progress of the lighthouse the landing and laying of the last stone for the season was observed with the usual ceremonies  from observations often made by the writer in so far as such can be ascertained it appears that no wave in the open seas in an unbroken state rises more than from seven to nine feet above the general surface of the ocean the bell rock lighthouse may therefore now be considered at from eight to ten feet above the height of the waves and although the sprays and heavy seas have often been observed in the present state of the building to rise to the height of fifty feet and fall with a tremendous noise on the beaconhouse yet such seas were not likely to make any impression on a mass of solid masonry containing about 1400 tons    wednesday 30th aug  the whole of the artificers left the rock at midday when the tender made sail for arbroath which she reached about six pm the vessel being decorated with colours and having fired a salute of three guns on approaching the harbour the workyard artificers with a multitude of people assembled at the harbour when mutual cheering and congratulations took place between those afloat and those on the quays the tender had now with little exception been six months on the station at the bell rock and during the last four months few of the squad of builders had been ashore in particular mr peter logan the foreman and mr robert selkirk principal builder had never once left the rock the artificers having made good wages during their stay like seamen upon a return voyage were extremely happy and spent the evening with much innocent mirth and jollity  in reflecting upon the state of the matters at the bell rock during the working months when the writer was much with the artificers nothing can equal the happy manner in which these excellent workmen spent their time they always went from arbroath to their arduous task cheering and they generally returned in the same hearty state while at the rock between the tides they amused themselves in reading fishing music playing cards draughts etc or in sporting with one another in the workyard at arbroath the young men were almost without exception employed in the evening at school in writing and arithmetic and not a few were learning architectural drawing for which they had every convenience and facility and were in a very obliging manner assisted in their studies by mr david logan clerk of the works it therefore affords the most pleasing reflections to look back upon the pursuits of about sixty individuals who for years conducted themselves on all occasions in a sober and rational manner     iv    operations of 1810    thursday 10th may  the wind had shifted today to wnw when the writer with considerable difficulty was enabled to land upon the rock for the first time this season at ten am upon examining the state of the building and apparatus in general he had the satisfaction to find everything in good order the mortar in all the joints was perfectly entire the building now thirty feet in height was thickly coated with fuci to the height of about fifteen feet calculating from the rock on the eastern side indeed the growth of seaweed was observable to the full height of thirty feet and even on the top or upper bed of the lastlaid course especially towards the eastern side it had germinated so as to render walking upon it somewhat difficult  the beaconhouse was in a perfectly sound state and apparently just as it had been left in the month of november but the tides being neap the lower parts particularly where the beams rested on the rock could not now be seen the floor of the mortar gallery having been already laid down by mr watt and his men on a former visit was merely soaked with the sprays but the joistingbeams which supported it had in the course of the winter been covered with a fine downy conferva produced by the range of the sea they were also a good deal whitened with the mute of the cormorant and other seafowls which had roosted upon the beacon in winter upon ascending to the apartments it was found that the motion of the sea had thrown open the door of the cookhouse this was only shut with a single latch that in case of shipwreck at the bell rock the mariner might find ready access to the shelter of this forlorn habitation where a supply of provisions was kept and being within two miles and a half of the floating light a signal could readily be observed when a boat might be sent to his relief as soon as the weather permitted an arrangement for this purpose formed one of the instructions on board of the floating light but happily no instance occurred for putting it in practice the hearth or fireplace of the cookhouse was built of brick in as secure a manner as possible to prevent accident from fire but some of the plasterwork had shaken loose from its damp state and the tremulous motion of the beacon in stormy weather the writer next ascended to the floor which was occupied by the cabins of himself and his assistants which were in tolerably good order having only a damp and musty smell the barrack for the artificers over all was next visited it had now a very dreary and deserted appearance when its former thronged state was recollected in some parts the water had come through the boarding and had discoloured the lining of green cloth but it was nevertheless in a good habitable condition while the seamen were employed in landing a stock of provisions a few of the artificers set to work with great eagerness to sweep and clean the several apartments the exterior of the beacon was in the meantime examined and found in perfect order the painting though it had a somewhat blanched appearance adhered firmly both on the sides and roof and only two or three panes of glass were broken in the cupola which had either been blown out by the force of the wind or perhaps broken by seafowl  having on this occasion continued upon the building and beacon a considerable time after the tide had begun to flow the artificers were occupied in removing the forge from the top of the building to which the gangway or wooden bridge gave great facility and although it stretched or had a span of fortytwo feet its construction was extremely simple while the roadway was perfectly firm and steady in returning from this visit to the rock every one was pretty well soused in spray before reaching the tender at two oclock pm where things awaited the landing party in as comfortable a way as such a situation would admit    friday 11th may  the wind was still easterly accompanied with rather a heavy swell of sea for the operations in hand a landing was however made this morning when the artificers were immediately employed in scraping the seaweed off the upper course of the building in order to apply the moulds of the first course of the staircase that the joggleholes might be marked off in the upper course of the solid this was also necessary previously to the writers fixing the position of the entrance door which was regulated chiefly by the appearance of the growth of the seaweed on the building indicating the direction of the heaviest seas on the opposite side of which the door was placed the landingmasters crew succeeded in towing into the creek on the western side of the rock the praamboat with the balancecrane which had now been on board of the praam for five days the several pieces of this machine having been conveyed along the railways upon the waggons to a position immediately under the bridge were elevated to its level or thirty feet above the rock in the following manner a chaintackle was suspended over a pulley from the crossbeam connecting the tops of the kingposts of the bridge which was worked by a winchmachine with wheel pinion and barrel round which last the chain was wound this apparatus was placed on the beacon side of the bridge at the distance of about twelve feet from the crossbeam and pulley in the middle of the bridge immediately under the crossbeam a hatch was formed in the roadway of the bridge measuring seven feet in length and five feet in breadth made to shut with folding boards like a double door through which stones and other articles were raised the folding doors were then let down and the stone or load was gently lowered upon a waggon which was wheeled on railway trucks towards the lighthouse in this manner the several castings of the balancecrane were got up to the top of the solid of the building  the several apartments of the beaconhouse having been cleaned out and supplied with bedding a sufficient stock of provisions was put into the store when peter fortune formerly noticed lighted his fire in the beacon for the first time this season sixteen artificers at the same time mounted to their barrackroom and all the foremen of the works also took possession of their cabin all heartily rejoiced at getting rid of the trouble of boating and the sickly motion of the tender    saturday 12th may  the wind was at ene blowing so fresh and accompanied with so much sea that no stones could be landed today the people on the rock however were busily employed in screwing together the balancecrane cutting out the joggleholes in the upper course and preparing all things for commencing the building operations    sunday 13th may  the weather still continues boisterous although the barometer has all the while stood at about 30 inches towards evening the wind blew so fresh at e by s that the boats both of the smeaton and tender were obliged to be hoisted in and it was feared that the smeaton would have to slip her moorings the people on the rock were seen busily employed and had the balancecrane apparently ready for use but no communication could be had with them today    monday 14th may  the wind continued to blow so fresh and the smeaton rode so heavily with her cargo that at noon a signal was made for her getting under weigh when she stood towards arbroath and on board of the tender we are still without any communication with the people on the rock where the sea was seen breaking over the top of the building in great sprays and raging with much agitation among the beams of the beacon    thursday 17th may  the wind in the course of the day had shifted from north to west the sea being also considerably less a boat landed on the rock at six pm for the first time since the 11th with the provisions and water brought off by the patriot the inhabitants of the beacon were all well but tired above measure for want of employment as the balancecrane and apparatus was all in readiness under these circumstances they felt no less desirous of the return of good weather than those afloat who were continually tossed with the agitation of the sea the writer in particular felt himself almost as much fatigued and wornout as he had been at any period since the commencement of the work the very backward state of the weather at so advanced a period of the season unavoidably created some alarm lest he should be overtaken with bad weather at a late period of the season with the building operations in an unfinished state these apprehensions were no doubt rather increased by the inconveniences of his situation afloat as the tender rolled and pitched excessively at times this being also his first offset for the season every bone of his body felt sore with preserving a sitting posture while he endeavoured to pass away the time in reading as for writing it was wholly impracticable he had several times entertained thoughts of leaving the station for a few days and going into arbroath with the tender till the weather should improve but as the artificers had been landed on the rock he was averse to this at the commencement of the season knowing also that he would be equally uneasy in every situation till the first cargo was landed and he therefore resolved to continue at his post until this should be effected    friday 18th may  the wind being now nw the sea was considerably run down and this morning at five oclock the landingmasters crew thirteen in number left the tender and having now no detention with the landing of artificers they proceeded to unmoor the hedderwick praamboat and towed her alongside of the smeaton and in the course of the day twentythree blocks of stone three casks of pozzolano three of sand three of lime and one of roman cement together with three bundles of trenails and three of wedges were all landed on the rock and raised to the top of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the crossbeam on the middle of the bridge the stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balancecrane with which they were laid in their respective places on the building the masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenailholes into the course below and otherwise to complete the one in hand when the first stone was to be suspended by the balancecrane the bell on the beacon was rung and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place and the steward served round a glass of rum when success was drunk to the further progress of the building    sunday 20th may  the wind was southerly today but there was much less sea than yesterday and the landingmasters crew were enabled to discharge and land twentythree pieces of stone and other articles for the work the artificers had completed the laying of the twentyseventh or first course of the staircase this morning and in the evening they finished the boring trenailing wedging and grouting it with mortar at twelve oclock noon the beaconhouse bell was rung and all hands were collected on the top of the building where prayers were read for the first time on the lighthouse which forcibly struck every one and had upon the whole a very impressive effect  from the hazardous situation of the beaconhouse with regard to fire being composed wholly of timber there was no small risk from accident and on this account one of the most steady of the artificers was appointed to see that the fire of the cookinghouse and the lights in general were carefully extinguished at stated hours    monday 4th june  this being the birthday of our muchrevered sovereign king george iii now in the fiftieth year of his reign the shipping of the lighthouse service were this morning decorated with colours according to the taste of their respective captains flags were also hoisted upon the beaconhouse and balancecrane on the top of the building at twelve noon a salute was fired from the tender when the kings health was drunk with all the honours both on the rock and on board of the shipping    tuesday 5th june  as the lighthouse advanced in height the cubical contents of the stones were less but they had to be raised to a greater height and the walls being thinner were less commodious for the necessary machinery and the artificers employed which considerably retarded the work inconvenience was also occasionally experienced from the men dropping their coats hats mallets and other tools at highwater which were carried away by the tide and the danger to the people themselves was now greatly increased had any of them fallen from the beacon or building at highwater while the landingmasters crew were generally engaged with the craft at a distance it must have rendered the accident doubly painful to those on the rock who at this time had no boat and consequently no means of rendering immediate and prompt assistance in such cases it would have been too late to have got a boat by signal from the tender a small boat which could be lowered at pleasure was therefore suspended by a pair of davits projected from the cookhouse the keel being about thirty feet from the rock this boat with its tackle was put under the charge of james glen of whose exertions on the beacon mention has already been made and who having in early life been a seaman was also very expert in the management of a boat a lifebuoy was likewise suspended from the bridge to which a coil of line two hundred fathoms in length was attached which could be let out to a person falling into the water or to the people in the boat should they not be able to work her with the oars    thursday 7th june  today twelve stones were landed on the rock being the remainder of the patriots cargo and the artificers built the thirtyninth course consisting of fourteen stones the bell rock works had now a very busy appearance as the lighthouse was daily getting more into form besides the artificers and their cook the writer and his servant were also lodged on the beacon counting in all twentynine and at lowwater the landingmasters crew consisting of from twelve to fifteen seamen were employed in transporting the building materials working the landing apparatus on the rock and dragging the stone waggons along the railways    friday 8th june  in the course of this day the weather varied much in the morning it was calm in the middle part of the day there were light airs of wind from the south and in the evening fresh breezes from the east the barometer in the writers cabin in the beaconhouse oscillated from 30 inches to 3042 and the weather was extremely pleasant this in any situation forms one of the chief comforts of life but as may easily be conceived it was doubly so to people stuck as it were upon a pinnacle in the middle of the ocean    sunday 10th june  one of the praamboats had been brought to the rock with eleven stones notwithstanding the perplexity which attended the getting of those formerly landed taken up to the building mr peter logan the foreman builder interposed and prevented this cargo from being delivered but the landingmasters crew were exceedingly averse to this arrangement from an idea that ill luck would in future attend the praam her cargo and those who navigated her from thus reversing her voyage it may be noticed that this was the first instance of a praamboat having been sent from the bell rock with any part of her cargo on board and was considered so uncommon an occurrence that it became a topic of conversation among the seamen and artificers    tuesday 12th june  today the stones formerly sent from the rock were safely landed notwithstanding the augury of the seamen in consequence of their being sent away two days before    thursday 14th june  today twentyseven stones and eleven jogglepieces were landed part of which consisted of the fortyseventh course forming the storeroom floor the builders were at work this morning by four oclock in the hopes of being able to accomplish the laying of the eighteen stones of this course but at eight oclock in the evening they had still two to lay and as the stones of this course were very unwieldy being six feet in length they required much precaution and care both in lifting and laying them it was only on the writers suggestion to mr logan that the artificers were induced to leave off as they had intended to complete this floor before going to bed the two remaining stones were however laid in their places without mortar when the bell on the beacon was rung and all hands being collected on the top of the building three hearty cheers were given on covering the first apartment the steward then served out a dram to each when the whole retired to their barrack much fatigued but with the anticipation of the most perfect repose even in the hurricanehouse amidst the dashing seas on the bell rock  while the workmen were at breakfast and dinner it was the writers usual practice to spend his time on the walls of the building which notwithstanding the narrowness of the track nevertheless formed his principal walk when the rock was under water but this afternoon he had his writingdesk set upon the storeroom floor when he wrote to mrs stevensoncertainly the first letter dated from the bell rock lighthousegiving a detail of the fortunate progress of the work with an assurance that the lighthouse would soon be completed at the rate at which it now proceeded and the patriot having sailed for arbroath in the evening he felt no small degree of pleasure in despatching this communication to his family  the weather still continuing favourable for the operations at the rock the work proceeded with much energy through the exertions both of the seamen and artificers for the more speedy and effectual working of the several tackles in raising the materials as the building advanced in height and there being a great extent of railway to attend to which required constant repairs two additional millwrights were added to the complement on the rock which including the writer now counted thirtyone in all so crowded was the mens barrack that the beds were ranged five tier in height allowing only about one foot eight inches for each bed the artificers commenced this morning at five oclock and in the course of the day they laid the fortyeighth and fortyninth courses consisting each of sixteen blocks from the favourable state of the weather and the regular manner in which the work now proceeded the artificers had generally from four to seven extra hours work which including their stated wages of 3s 4d yielded them from 5s 4d to about 6s 10d per day besides their board even the postage of their letters was paid while they were at the bell rock in these advantages the foremen also shared having about double the pay and amount of premiums of the artificers the seamen being less out of their element in the bell rock operations than the landsmen their premiums consisted in a slump sum payable at the end of the season which extended from three to ten guineas  as the laying of the floors was somewhat tedious the landingmaster and his crew had got considerably beforehand with the building artificers in bringing materials faster to the rock than they could be built the seamen having therefore some spare time were occasionally employed during fine weather in dredging or grappling for the several mushroom anchors and mooringchains which had been lost in the vicinity of the bell rock during the progress of the work by the breaking loose and drifting of the floating buoys to encourage their exertions in this search five guineas were offered as a premium for each set they should find and after much patient application they succeeded today in hooking one of these lost anchors with its chain  it was a general remark at the bell rock as before noticed that fish were never plenty in its neighbourhood excepting in good weather indeed the seamen used to speculate about the state of the weather from their success in fishing when the fish disappeared at the rock it was considered a sure indication that a gale was not far off as the fish seemed to seek shelter in deeper water from the roughness of the sea during these changes in the weather at this time the rock at highwater was completely covered with podlies or the fry of the coalfish about six or eight inches in length the artificers sometimes occupied half an hour after breakfast and dinner in catching these little fishes but were more frequently supplied from the boats of the tender    saturday 16th june  the landingmaster having this day discharged the smeaton and loaded the hedderwick and dickie praamboats with nineteen stones they were towed to their respective moorings when captain wilson in consequence of the heavy swell of sea came in his boat to the beaconhouse to consult with the writer as to the propriety of venturing the loaded praamboats with their cargoes to the rock while so much sea was running after some dubiety expressed on the subject in which the ardent mind of the landingmaster suggested many arguments in favour of his being able to convey the praams in perfect safety it was acceded to in bad weather and especially on occasions of difficulty like the present mr wilson who was an extremely active seaman measuring about five feet three inches in height of a robust habit generally dressed himself in what he called a monkey jacket made of thick duffle cloth with a pair of dutchmans petticoat trousers reaching only to his knees where they were met with a pair of long watertight boots with this dress his glazed hat and his small brass speakingtrumpet in his hand he bade defiance to the weather when he made his appearance in this most suitable attire for the service his crew seemed to possess additional life never failing to use their utmost exertions when the captain put on his storm rigging they had this morning commenced loading the praamboats at four oclock and proceeded to tow them into the eastern landingplace which was accomplished with much dexterity though not without the risk of being thrown by the force of the sea on certain projecting ledges of the rock in such a case the loss even of a single stone would have greatly retarded the work for the greater safety in entering the creek it was necessary to put out several warps and guyropes to guide the boats into its narrow and intricate entrance and it frequently happened that the sea made a clean breach over the praams which not only washed their decks but completely drenched the crew in water    sunday 17th june  it was fortunate in the present state of the weather that the fiftieth course was in a sheltered spot within the reach of the tackle of the winchmachine upon the bridge a few stones were stowed upon the bridge itself and the remainder upon the building which kept the artificers at work the stowing of the materials upon the rock was the department of alexander brebner mason who spared no pains in attending to the safety of the stones and who in the present state of the work when the stones were landed faster than could be built generally worked till the water rose to his middle at one oclock today the bell rung for prayers and all hands were collected into the upper barrackroom of the beaconhouse when the usual service was performed  the wind blew very hard in the course of last night from ne and today the sea ran so high that no boat could approach the rock during the dinnerhour when the writer was going to the top of the building as usual but just as he had entered the door and was about to ascend the ladder a great noise was heard overhead and in an instant he was soused in water from a sea which had most unexpectedly come over the walls though now about fiftyeight feet in height on making his retreat he found himself completely whitened by the lime which had mixed with the water while dashing down through the different floors and as nearly as he could guess a quantity equal to about a hogshead had come over the walls and now streamed out at the door after having shifted himself he again sat down in his cabin the sea continuing to run so high that the builders did not resume their operations on the walls this afternoon the incident just noticed did not create more surprise in the mind of the writer than the sublime appearance of the waves as they rolled majestically over the rock this scene he greatly enjoyed while sitting at his cabin window each wave approached the beacon like a vast scroll unfolding and in passing discharged a quantity of air which he not only distinctly felt but was even sufficient to lift the leaves of a book which lay before him these waves might be ten or twelve feet in height and about 250 feet in length their smaller end being towards the north where the water was deep and they were opened or cut through by the interposition of the building and beacon the gradual manner in which the sea upon these occasions is observed to become calm or to subside is a very remarkable feature of this phenomenon for example when a gale is succeeded by a calm every third or fourth wave forms one of these great seas which occur in spaces of from three to five minutes as noted by the writers watch but in the course of the next tide they become less frequent and take off so as to occur only in ten or fifteen minutes and singular enough at the third tide after such gales the writer has remarked that only one or two of these great waves appear in the course of the whole tide    tuesday 19th june  the 19th was a very unpleasant and disagreeable day both for the seamen and artificers as it rained throughout with little intermission from four am till eleven pm accompanied with thunder and lightning during which period the work nevertheless continued unremittingly and the builders laid the fiftyfirst and fiftysecond courses this state of weather was no less severe upon the mortarmakers who required to temper or prepare the mortar of a thicker or thinner consistency in some measure according to the state of the weather from the elevated position of the building the mortar gallery on the beacon was now much lower and the limebuckets were made to traverse upon a rope distended between it and the building on occasions like the present however there was often a difference of opinion between the builders and the mortarmakers john watt who had the principal charge of the mortar was a most active worker but being somewhat of an irascible temper the builders occasionally amused themselves at his expense for while he was eagerly at work with his large ironshod pestle in the mortartub they often sent down contradictory orders some crying make it a little stiffer or thicker john while others called out to make it thinner to which he generally returned very speedy and sharp replies so that these conversations at times were rather amusing  during wet weather the situation of the artificers on the top of the building was extremely disagreeable for although their work did not require great exertion yet as each man had his particular part to perform either in working the crane or in laying the stones it required the closest application and attention not only on the part of mr peter logan the foreman who was constantly on the walls but also of the chief workmen robert selkirk the principal builder for example had every stone to lay in its place david cumming a mason had the charge of working the tackle of the balanceweight and james scott also a mason took charge of the purchase with which the stones were laid while the pointing the joints of the walls with cement was intrusted to william reid and william kennedy who stood upon a scaffold suspended over the walls in rather a frightful manner the least act of carelessness or inattention on the part of any of these men might have been fatal not only to themselves but also to the surrounding workmen especially if any accident had happened to the crane itself while the material damage or loss of a single stone would have put an entire stop to the operations until another could have been brought from arbroath the artificers having wrought seven and a half hours of extra time today had 3s 9d of extra pay while the foremen had 7s 6d over and above their stated pay and board although therefore the work was both hazardous and fatiguing yet the encouragement being considerable they were always very cheerful and perfectly reconciled to the confinement and other disadvantages of the place  during fine weather and while the nights were short the duty on board of the floating light was literally nothing but a waiting on and therefore one of her boats with a crew of five men daily attended the rock but always returned to the vessel at night the carpenter however was one of those who was left on board of the ship as he also acted in the capacity of assistant lightkeeper being besides a person who was apt to feel discontent and to be averse to changing his quarters especially to work with the millwrights and joiners at the rock who often for hours together wrought kneedeep and not unfrequently up to the middle in water mr watt having about this time made a requisition for another hand the carpenter was ordered to attend the rock in the floating lights boat this he did with great reluctance and found so much fault that he soon got into discredit with his messmates on this occasion he left the lighthouse service and went as a sailor in a vessel bound for americaa step which it is believed he soon regretted as in the course of things he would in all probability have accompanied mr john reid the principal lightkeeper of the floating light to the bell rock lighthouse as his principal assistant the writer had a wish to be of service to this man as he was one of those who came off to the floating light in the month of september 1807 while she was riding at single anchor after the severe gale of the 7th at a time when it was hardly possible to make up this vessels crew but the crossness of his manner prevented his reaping the benefit of such intentions    friday 22nd june  the building operations had for some time proceeded more slowly from the higher parts of the lighthouse requiring much longer time than an equal tonnage of the lower courses the duty of the landingmasters crew had upon the whole been easy of late for though the work was occasionally irregular yet the stones being lighter they were more speedily lifted from the hold of the stone vessel to the deck of the praamboat and again to the waggons on the railway after which they came properly under the charge of the foreman builder it is however a strange though not an uncommon feature in the human character that when people have least to complain of they are most apt to become dissatisfied as was now the case with the seamen employed in the bell rock service about their rations of beer indeed ever since the carpenter of the floating light formerly noticed had been brought to the rock expressions of discontent had been manifested upon various occasions this being represented to the writer he sent for captain wilson the landingmaster and mr taylor commander of the tender with whom he talked over the subject they stated that they considered the daily allowance of the seamen in every respect ample and that the work being now much lighter than formerly they had no just ground for complaint mr taylor adding that if those who now complained were even to be fed upon soft bread and turkeys they would not think themselves right at twelve noon the work of the landingmasters crew was completed for the day but at four oclock while the rock was under water those on the beacon were surprised by the arrival of a boat from the tender without any signal having been made from the beacon it brought the following note to the writer from the landingmasters crew        sir joseph banks tender     sirwe are informed by our masters that our allowance is to be as    before and it is not sufficient to serve us for we have been at    work since four oclock this morning and we have come on board to    dinner and there is no beer for us before tomorrow morning to    which a sufficient answer is required before we go from the beacon    and we are sir your most obedient servants     on reading this the writer returned a verbal message intimating    that an answer would be sent on board of the tender at the same time    ordering the boat instantly to quit the beacon he then addressed the    following note to the landingmaster        beaconhouse 22nd june 1810 five oclock pm     siri have just now received a letter purporting to be from the    landingmasters crew and seamen on board of the sir joseph banks    though without either date or signature in answer to which i enclose    a statement of the daily allowance of provisions for the seamen in    this service which you will post up in the ships galley and at    seven oclock this evening i will come on board to inquire into this    unexpected and most unnecessary demand for an additional allowance    of beer in the enclosed you will not find any alteration from the    original statement fixed in the galley at the beginning of the    season i have however judged this mode of giving your people an    answer preferable to that of conversing with them on the beaconi    am sir your most obedient servant       robert stevenson        to captain wilson     beacon house 22nd june 1810schedule of the daily allowance    of provisions to be served out on board of the sir joseph banks    tender 112 lb beef 1 lb bread 8 oz oatmeal 2 oz barley 2    oz butter 3 quarts beer vegetables and salt no stated allowance    when the seamen are employed in unloading the smeaton and    patriot a draught of beer is as formerly to be allowed from the    stock of these vessels further in wet and stormy weather or when    the work commences very early in the morning or continues till a    late hour at night a glass of spirits will also be served out to the    crew as heretofore on the requisition of the landingmaster       robert stevenson  on writing this letter and schedule a signal was made on the beacon for the landingmasters boat which immediately came to the rock and the schedule was afterwards stuck up in the tenders galley when sufficient time had been allowed to the crew to consider of their conduct a second signal was made for a boat and at seven oclock the writer left the bell rock after a residence of four successive weeks in the beaconhouse the first thing which occupied his attention on board of the tender was to look round upon the lighthouse which he saw with some degree of emotion and surprise now vying in height with the beaconhouse for although he had often viewed it from the extremity of the western railway on the rock yet the scene upon the whole seemed far more interesting from the tenders moorings at the distance of about half a mile  the smeaton having just arrived at her moorings with a cargo a signal was made for captain pool to come on board of the tender that he might be at hand to remove from the service any of those who might persist in their discontented conduct one of the two principal leaders in this affair the master of one of the praamboats who had also steered the boat which brought the letter to the beacon was first called upon deck and asked if he had read the statement fixed up in the galley this afternoon and whether he was satisfied with it he replied that he had read the paper but was not satisfied as it held out no alteration on the allowance on which he was immediately ordered into the smeatons boat the next man called had but lately entered the service and being also interrogated as to his resolution he declared himself to be of the same mind with the praammaster and was also forthwith ordered into the boat the writer without calling any more of the seamen went forward to the gangway where they were collected and listening to what was passing upon deck he addressed them at the hatchway and stated that two of their companions had just been dismissed the service and sent on board of the smeaton to be conveyed to arbroath he therefore wished each man to consider for himself how far it would be proper by any unreasonableness of conduct to place themselves in a similar situation especially as they were aware that it was optional in him either to dismiss them or send them on board a manofwar it might appear that much inconveniency would be felt at the rock by a change of hands at this critical period by checking for a time the progress of a building so intimately connected with the best interests of navigation yet this would be but of a temporary nature while the injury to themselves might be irreparable it was now therefore required of any man who in this disgraceful manner chose to leave the service that he should instantly make his appearance on deck while the smeatons boat was alongside but those below having expressed themselves satisfied with their situationviz william brown george gibb alexander scott john dick robert couper alexander shephard james grieve david carey william pearson stuart eaton alexander lawrence and john spinkwere accordingly considered as having returned to their duty this disposition to mutiny which had so strongly manifested itself being now happily suppressed captain pool got orders to proceed for arbroath bay and land the two men he had on board and to deliver the following letter at the office of the workyard       on board of the tender off the bell rock        22nd june 1810 eight oclock pm     dear sira discontented and mutinous spirit having manifested    itself of late among the landingmasters crew they struck work    today and demanded an additional allowance of beer and i have found    it necessary to dismiss dd and me who are now sent on shore    with the smeaton you will therefore be so good as to pay them    their wages including this day only nothing can be more    unreasonable than the conduct of the seamen on this occasion as the    landingmasters crew not only had their allowance on board of the    tender but in the course of this day they had drawn no fewer than    twentyfour quart pots of beer from the stock of the patriot while    unloading heri remain yours truly       robert stevenson     to mr lachlan kennedy      bell rock office arbroath  on despatching this letter to mr kennedy the writer returned to the beacon about nine oclock where this afternoons business had produced many conjectures especially when the smeaton got under weigh instead of proceeding to land her cargo the bell on the beacon being rung the artificers were assembled on the bridge when the affair was explained to them he at the same time congratulated them upon the first appearance of mutiny being happily set at rest by the dismissal of its two principal abettors    sunday 24th june  at the rock the landing of the materials and the building operations of the lightroom store went on successfully and in a way similar to those of the provision store today it blew fresh breezes but the seamen nevertheless landed twentyeight stones and the artificers built the fiftyeighth and fiftyninth courses the works were visited by mr murdoch junior from messrs boulton and watts works of soho he landed just as the bell rung for prayers after which the writer enjoyed much pleasure from his very intelligent conversation and having been almost the only stranger he had seen for some weeks he parted with him after a short interview with much regret    thursday 28th june  last night the wind had shifted to northeast and blowing fresh was accompanied with a heavy surf upon the rock towards highwater it had a very grand and wonderful appearance waves of considerable magnitude rose as high as the solid or level of the entrancedoor which being open to the southwest was fortunately to the leeward but on the windward side the sprays flew like lightning up the sloping sides of the building and although the walls were now elevated sixtyfour feet above the rock and about fiftytwo feet from highwater mark yet the artificers were nevertheless wetted and occasionally interrupted in their operations on the top of the walls these appearances were in a great measure new at the bell rock there having till of late been no building to conduct the seas or object to compare with them although from the description of the eddystone lighthouse the mind was prepared for such effects yet they were not expected to the present extent in the summer season the sea being most awful today whether observed from the beacon or the building to windward the sprays fell from the height above noticed in the most wonderful cascades and streamed down the walls of the building in froth as white as snow to leeward of the lighthouse the collision or meeting of the waves produced a pure white kind of drift it rose about thirty feet in height like a fine downy mist which in its fall fell upon the face and hands more like a dry powder than a liquid substance the effect of these seas as they raged among the beams and dashed upon the higher parts of the beacon produced a temporary tremulous motion throughout the whole fabric which to a stranger must have been frightful    sunday 1st july  the writer had now been at the bell rock since the latter end of may or about six weeks during four of which he had been a constant inhabitant of the beacon without having been once off the rock after witnessing the laying of the sixtyseventh or second course of the bedroom apartment he left the rock with the tender and went ashore as some arrangements were to be made for the future conduct of the works at arbroath which were soon to be brought to a close the landingmasters crew having in the meantime shifted on board of the patriot in leaving the rock the writer kept his eyes fixed upon the lighthouse which had recently got into the form of a house having several tiers or stories of windows nor was he unmindful of his habitation in the beaconnow far overtopped by the masonrywhere he had spent several weeks in a kind of active retirement making practical experiment of the fewness of the positive wants of man his cabin measured not more than four feet three inches in breadth on the floor and though from the oblique direction of the beams of the beacon it widened towards the top yet it did not admit of the full extension of his arms when he stood on the floor while its length was little more than sufficient for suspending a cotbed during the night calculated for being triced up to the roof through the day which left free room for the admission of occasional visitants his folding table was attached with hinges immediately under the small window of the apartment and his books barometer thermometer portmanteau and two or three campstools formed the bulk of his movables his diet being plain the paraphernalia of the table were proportionally simple though everything had the appearance of comfort and even of neatness the walls being covered with green cloth formed into panels with red tape and his bed festooned with curtains of yellow cottonstuff if in speculating upon the abstract wants of man in such a state of exclusion one were reduced to a single book the sacred volumewhether considered for the striking diversity of its story the morality of its doctrine or the important truths of its gospelwould have proved by far the greatest treasure    monday 2nd july  in walking over the workyard at arbroath this morning the writer found that the stones of the course immediately under the cornice were all in hand and that a weeks work would now finish the whole while the intermediate courses lay ready numbered and marked for shipping to the rock among other subjects which had occupied his attention today was a visit from some of the relations of george dall a young man who had been impressed near dundee in the month of february last a dispute had arisen between the magistrates of that burgh and the regulating officer as to his right of impressing dall who was bonâ fide one of the protected seamen in the bell rock service in the meantime the poor lad was detained and ultimately committed to the prison of dundee to remain until the question should be tried before the court of session his friends were naturally very desirous to have him relieved upon bail but as this was only to be done by the judgment of the court all that could be said was that his pay and allowances should be continued in the same manner as if he had been upon the sicklist the circumstances of dalls case were briefly thesehe had gone to see some of his friends in the neighbourhood of dundee in winter while the works were suspended having got leave of absence from mr taylor who commanded the bell rock tender and had in his possession one of the protection medals unfortunately however for dall the regulating officer thought proper to disregard these documents as according to the strict and literal interpretation of the admiralty regulations a seaman does not stand protected unless he is actually on board of his ship or in a boat belonging to her or has the admiralty protection in his possession this order of the board however cannot be rigidly followed in practice and therefore when the matter is satisfactorily stated to the regulating officer the impressed man is generally liberated but in dalls case this was peremptorily refused and he was retained at the instance of the magistrates the writer having brought the matter under the consideration of the commissioners of the northern lighthouses they authorised it to be tried on the part of the lighthouse board as one of extreme hardship the court upon the first hearing ordered dall to be liberated from prison and the proceedings never went further    wednesday 4th july  being now within twelve courses of being ready for building the cornice measures were taken for getting the stones of it and the parapetwall of the lightroom brought from edinburgh where as before noticed they had been prepared and were in readiness for shipping the honour of conveying the upper part of the lighthouse and of landing the last stone of the building on the rock was considered to belong to captain pool of the smeaton who had been longer in the service than the master of the patriot the smeaton was therefore now partly loaded with old iron consisting of broken railways and other lumber which had been lying about the rock after landing these at arbroath she took on board james craw with his horse and cart which could now be spared at the workyard to be employed in carting the stones from edinburgh to leith alexander davidson and william kennedy two careful masons were also sent to take charge of the loading of the stones at greenside and stowing them on board of the vessel at leith the writer also went on board with a view to call at the bell rock and to take his passage up the firth of forth the wind however coming to blow very fresh from the eastward with thick and foggy weather it became necessary to reef the mainsail and set the second jib when in the act of making a tack towards the tender the sailors who worked the headsheets were all of a sudden alarmed with the sound of the smiths hammer and anvil on the beacon and had just time to put the ship about to save her from running ashore on the northwestern point of the rock marked james craws horse on looking towards the direction from whence the sound came the building and beaconhouse were seen with consternation while the ship was hailed by those on the rock who were no less confounded at seeing the near approach of the smeaton and just as the vessel cleared the danger the smith and those in the mortar gallery made signs in token of their happiness at our fortunate escape from this occurrence the writer had an experimental proof of the utility of the large bells which were in preparation to be rung by the machinery of the revolving light for had it not been for the sound of the smiths anvil the smeaton in all probability would have been wrecked upon the rock in case the vessel had struck those on board might have been safe having now the beaconhouse as a place of refuge but the vessel which was going at a great velocity must have suffered severely and it was more than probable that the horse would have been drowned there being no means of getting him out of the vessel of this valuable animal and his master we shall take an opportunity of saying more in another place    thursday 5th july  the weather cleared up in the course of the night but the wind shifted to the ne and blew very fresh from the force of the wind being now the period of springtides a very heavy swell was experienced at the rock at two oclock on the following morning the people on the beacon were in a state of great alarm about their safety as the sea had broke up part of the floor of the mortar gallery which was thus cleared of the limecasks and other buoyant articles and the alarmbell being rung all hands were called to render what assistance was in their power for the safety of themselves and the materials at this time some would willingly have left the beacon and gone into the building the sea however ran so high that there was no passage along the bridge of communication and when the interior of the lighthouse came to be examined in the morning it appeared that great quantities of water had come over the wallsnow eighty feet in heightand had run down through the several apartments and out at the entrance door  the upper course of the lighthouse at the workyard of arbroath was completed on the 6th and the whole of the stones were therefore now ready for being shipped to the rock from the present state of the works it was impossible that the two squads of artificers at arbroath and the bell rock could meet together at this period and as in public works of this kind which had continued for a series of years it is not customary to allow the men to separate without what is termed a finishingpint five guineas were for this purpose placed at the disposal of mr david logan clerk of works with this sum the stonecutters at arbroath had a merry meeting in their barrack collected their sweethearts and friends and concluded their labours with a dance it was remarked however that their happiness on this occasion was not without alloy the consideration of parting and leaving a steady and regular employment to go in quest of work and mix with other society after having been harmoniously lodged for years together in one large guildhall or barrack was rather painful    friday 6th july  while the writer was at edinburgh he was fortunate enough to meet with mrs dickson only daughter of the late celebrated mr smeaton whose works at the eddystone lighthouse had been of such essential consequence to the operations at the bell rock even her own elegant accomplishments are identified with her fathers work she having herself made the drawing of the vignette on the titlepage of the narrative of the eddystone lighthouse every admirer of the works of that singularly eminent man must also feel an obligation to her for the very comprehensive and distinct account given of his life which is attached to his reports published in three volumes quarto by the society of civil engineers mrs dickson being at this time returning from a tour to the hebrides and western highlands of scotland had heard of the bell rock works and from their similarity to those of the eddystone was strongly impressed with a desire of visiting the spot but on inquiring for the writer at edinburgh and finding from him that the upper part of the lighthouse consisting of nine courses might be seen in the immediate vicinity and also that one of the vessels which in compliment to her fathers memory had been named the smeaton might also now be seen in leith she considered herself extremely fortunate and having first visited the works at greenside she afterwards went to leith to see the smeaton then loading for the bell rock on stepping on board mrs dickson seemed to be quite overcome with so many concurrent circumstances tending in a peculiar manner to revive and enliven the memory of her departed father and on leaving the vessel she would not be restrained from presenting the crew with a piece of money the smeaton had been named spontaneously from a sense of the obligation which a public work of the description of the bell rock owed to the labours and abilities of mr smeaton the writer certainly never could have anticipated the satisfaction which he this day felt in witnessing the pleasure it afforded to the only representative of this great mans family    friday 20th july  the gale from the ne still continued so strong accompanied with a heavy sea that the patriot could not approach her moorings although the tender still kept her station no landing was made today at the rock at highwater it was remarked that the spray rose to the height of about sixty feet upon the building the smeaton now lay in leith loaded but the wind and weather being so unfavourable for her getting down the firth she did not sail till this afternoon it may be here proper to notice that the loading of the centre of the lightroom floor or last principal stone of the building did not fail when put on board to excite an interest among those connected with the work when the stone was laid upon the cart to be conveyed to leith the seamen fixed an ensignstaff and flag into the circular hole in the centre of the stone and decorated their own hats and that of james craw the bell rock carter with ribbons even his faithful and trusty horse brassey was ornamented with bows and streamers of various colours the masons also provided themselves with new aprons and in this manner the cart was attended in its progress to the ship when the cart came opposite the trinity house of leith the officer of that corporation made his appearance dressed in his uniform with his staff of office and when it reached the harbour the shipping in the different tiers where the smeaton lay hoisted their colours manifesting by these trifling ceremonies the interest with which the progress of this work was regarded by the public as ultimately tending to afford safety and protection to the mariner the wind had fortunately shifted to the sw and about five oclock this afternoon the smeaton reached the bell rock    friday 27th july  the artificers had finished the laying of the balcony course excepting the centrestone of the lightroom floor which like the centres of the other floors could not be laid in its place till after the removal of the foot and shaft of the balancecrane during the dinnerhour when the men were off work the writer generally took some exercise by walking round the walls when the rock was under water but today his boundary was greatly enlarged for instead of the narrow wall as a path he felt no small degree of pleasure in walking round the balcony and passing out and in at the space allotted for the lightroom door in the labours of this day both the artificers and seamen felt their work to be extremely easy compared with what it had been for some days past    sunday 29th july  captain wilson and his crew had made preparations for landing the last stone and as may well be supposed this was a day of great interest at the bell rock that it might lose none of its honours as he expressed himself the hedderwick praamboat with which the first stone of the building had been landed was appointed also to carry the last at seven oclock this evening the seamen hoisted three flags upon the hedderwick when the colours of the dickie praamboat tender smeaton floating light beaconhouse and lighthouse were also displayed and the weather being remarkably fine the whole presented a very gay appearance and in connection with the associations excited the effect was very pleasing the praam which carried the stone was towed by the seamen in gallant style to the rock and on its arrival cheers were given as a finale to the landing department    monday 30th july  the ninetieth or last course of the building having been laid today which brought the masonry to the height of one hundred and two feet six inches the lintel of the lightroom door being the finishingstone of the exterior walls was laid with due formality by the writer who at the same time pronounced the following benediction may the great architect of the universe under whose blessing this perilous work has prospered preserve it as a guide to the mariner    friday 3rd aug  at three pm the necessary preparations having been made the artificers commenced the completing of the floors of the several apartments and at seven oclock the centrestone of the lightroom floor was laid which may be held as finishing the masonry of this important national edifice after going through the usual ceremonies observed by the brotherhood on occasions of this kind the writer addressing himself to the artificers and seamen who were present briefly alluded to the utility of the undertaking as a monument of the wealth of british commerce erected through the spirited measures of the commissioners of the northern lighthouses by means of the able assistance of those who now surrounded him he then took an opportunity of stating that toward those connected with this arduous work he would ever retain the most heartfelt regard in all their interests    saturday 4th aug  when the bell was rung as usual on the beacon this morning every one seemed as if he were at a loss what to make of himself at this period the artificers at the rock consisted of eighteen masons two joiners one millwright one smith and one mortarmaker besides messrs peter logan and francis watt foremen counting in all twentyfive and matters were arranged for proceeding to arbroath this afternoon with all hands the sir joseph banks tender had by this time been afloat with little intermission for six months during greater part of which the artificers had been almost constantly off at the rock and were now much in want of necessaries of almost every description not a few had lost different articles of clothing which had dropped into the sea from the beacon and building some wanted jackets others from want of hats wore nightcaps each was in fact more or less curtailed in his wardrobe and it must be confessed that at best the party were but in a very tattered condition this morning was occupied in removing the artificers and their bedding on board of the tender and although their personal luggage was easily shifted the boats had nevertheless many articles to remove from the beaconhouse and were consequently employed in this service till eleven am all hands being collected and just ready to embark as the water had nearly overflowed the rock the writer in taking leave after alluding to the harmony which had ever marked the conduct of those employed on the bell rock took occasion to compliment the great zeal attention and abilities of mr peter logan and mr francis watt foremen captain james wilson landingmaster and captain david taylor commander of the tender who in their several departments had so faithfully discharged the duties assigned to them often under circumstances the most difficult and trying the health of these gentlemen was drunk with much warmth of feeling by the artificers and seamen who severally expressed the satisfaction they had experienced in acting under them after which the whole party left the rock  in sailing past the floating light mutual compliments were made by a display of flags between that vessel and the tender and at five pm the latter vessel entered the harbour of arbroath where the party were heartily welcomed by a numerous company of spectators who had collected to see the artificers arrive after so long an absence from the port in the evening the writer invited the foremen and captains of the service together with mr david logan clerk of works at arbroath and mr lachlan kennedy engineers clerk and bookkeeper and some of their friends to the principal inn where the evening was spent very happily and after his majestys health and the commissioners of the northern lighthouses had been given stability to the bell rock lighthouse was hailed as a standing toast in the lighthouse service    sunday 5th aug  the author has formerly noticed the uniformly decent and orderly deportment of the artificers who were employed at the bell rock lighthouse and today it is believed they very generally attended church no doubt with grateful hearts for the narrow escapes from personal danger which all of them had more or less experienced during their residence at the rock    tuesday 14th aug  the smeaton sailed today at one pm having on board sixteen artificers with mr peter logan together with a supply of provisions and necessaries who left the harbour pleased and happy to find themselves once more afloat in the bell rock service at seven oclock the tender was made fast to her moorings when the artificers landed on the rock and took possession of their old quarters in the beaconhouse with feelings very different from those of 1807 when the works commenced  the barometer for some days past had been falling from 2990 and today it was 2950 with the wind at ne which in the course of this day increased to a strong gale accompanied with a sea which broke with great violence upon the rock at twelve noon the tender rode very heavily at her moorings when her chain broke at about ten fathoms from the ships bows the kedgeanchor was immediately let go to hold her till the floating buoy and broken chain should be got on board but while this was in operation the hawser of the kedge was chafed through on the rocky bottom and parted when the vessel was again adrift most fortunately however she cast off with her head from the rock and narrowly cleared it when she sailed up the firth of forth to wait the return of better weather the artificers were thus left upon the rock with so heavy a sea running that it was ascertained to have risen to the height of eighty feet on the building under such perilous circumstances it would be difficult to describe the feelings of those who at this time were cooped up in the beacon in so forlorn a situation with the sea not only raging under them but occasionally falling from a great height upon the roof of their temporary lodging without even the attending vessel in view to afford the least gleam of hope in the event of any accident it is true that they had now the masonry of the lighthouse to resort to which no doubt lessened the actual danger of their situation but the building was still without a roof and the deadlights or stormshutters not being yet fitted the windows of the lower story were stove in and broken and at highwater the sea ran in considerable quantities out at the entrance door    thursday 16th aug  the gale continues with unabated violence today and the sprays rise to a still greater height having been carried over the masonry the building or about ninety feet above the level of the sea at four oclock this morning it was breaking into the cooks berth when he rang the alarmbell and all hands turned out to attend to their personal safety the floor of the smiths or mortar gallery was now completely burst up by the force of the sea when the whole of the deals and the remaining articles upon the floor were swept away such as the castiron mortartubs the iron hearth of the forge the smiths bellows and even his anvil were thrown down upon the rock before the tide rose to its full height today some of the artificers passed along the bridge into the lighthouse to observe the effects of the sea upon it and they reported that they had felt a slight tremulous motion in the building when great seas struck it in a certain direction about highwater mark on this occasion the sprays were again observed to wet the balcony and even to come over the parapet wall into the interior of the lightroom    thursday 23rd aug  the wind being at wsw and the weather more moderate both the tender and the smeaton got to their moorings on the 23rd when hands were employed in transporting the sashframes from on board of the smeaton to the rock in the act of setting up one of these frames upon the bridge it was unguardedly suffered to lose its balance and in saving it from damage captain wilson met with a severe bruise in the groin on the seat of a gunshot wound received in the early part of his life this accident laid him aside for several days    monday 27th aug  the sashframes of the lightroom eight in number and weighing each 254 pounds having been got safely up to the top of the building were ranged on the balcony in the order in which they were numbered for their places on the top of the parapetwall and the balancecrane that useful machine having now lifted all the heavier articles was unscrewed and lowered to use the landingmasters phrase in mournful silence    sunday 2nd sept  the steps of the stair being landed and all the weightier articles of the lightroom got up to the balcony the wooden bridge was now to be removed as it had a very powerful effect upon the beacon when a heavy sea struck it and could not possibly have withstood the storms of a winter everything having been cleared from the bridge and nothing left but the two principal beams with their horizontal braces james glen at highwater proceeded with a saw to cut through the beams at the end next the beacon which likewise disengaged their opposite extremity inserted a few inches into the building the frame was then gently lowered into the water and floated off to the smeaton to be towed to arbroath to be applied as part of the materials in the erection of the lightkeepers houses after the removal of the bridge the aspect of things at the rock was much altered the beaconhouse and building had both a naked look to those accustomed to their former appearance a curious optical deception was also remarked by which the lighthouse seemed to incline from the perpendicular towards the beacon the horizontal ropeladder before noticed was again stretched to preserve the communication and the artificers were once more obliged to practise the awkward and straddling manner of their passage between them during 1809  at twelve noon the bell rung for prayers after which the artificers went to dinner when the writer passed along the ropeladder to the lighthouse and went through the several apartments which were now cleared of lumber in the afternoon all hands were summoned to the interior of the house when he had the satisfaction of laying the upper step of the stair or last stone of the building this ceremony concluded with three cheers the sound of which had a very loud and strange effect within the walls of the lighthouse at six oclock mr peter logan and eleven of the artificers embarked with the writer for arbroath leaving mr james glen with the special charge of the beacon and railways mr robert selkirk with the building with a few artificers to fit the temporary windows to render the house habitable    sunday 14th oct  on returning from his voyage to the northern lighthouses the writer landed at the bell rock on sunday the 14th of october and had the pleasure to find from the very favourable state of the weather that the artificers had been enabled to make great progress with the fittingup of the lightroom    friday 19th oct  the lightroom work had proceeded as usual today under the direction of mr dove assisted in the plumberwork by mr john gibson and in the brazierwork by mr joseph fraser while mr james slight with the joiners were fitting up the stormshutters of the windows in these several departments the artificers were at work till seven oclock pm and it being then dark mr dove gave orders to drop work in the lightroom and all hands proceeded from thence to the beaconhouse when charles henderson smith and henry dickson brazier left the work together being both young men who had been for several weeks upon the rock they had become familiar and even playful on the most difficult parts about the beacon and building this evening they were trying to outrun each other in descending from the lightroom when henderson led the way but they were in conversation with each other till they came to the ropeladder distended between the entrancedoor of the lighthouse and the beacon dickson on reaching the cookroom was surprised at not seeing his companion and inquired hastily for henderson upon which the cook replied was he before you upon the ropeladder dickson answered yes and i thought i heard something fall upon this the alarm was given and links were immediately lighted with which the artificers descended on the legs of the beacon as near the surface of the water as possible it being then about full tide and the sea breaking to a considerable height upon the building with the wind at sse but after watching till lowwater and searching in every direction upon the rock it appeared that poor henderson must have unfortunately fallen through the ropeladder and been washed into the deep water  the deceased had passed along this ropeladder many hundred times both by day and night and the operations in which he was employed being nearly finished he was about to leave the rock when this melancholy catastrophe took place the unfortunate loss of henderson cast a deep gloom upon the minds of all who were at the rock and it required some management on the part of those who had charge to induce the people to remain patiently at their work as the weather now became more boisterous and the nights long they found their habitation extremely cheerless while the winds were howling about their ears and the waves lashing with fury against the beams of their insulated habitation    tuesday 23rd oct  the wind had shifted in the night to nw and blew a fresh gale while the sea broke with violence upon the rock it was found impossible to land but the writer from the boat hailed mr dove and directed the ball to be immediately fixed the necessary preparations were accordingly made while the vessel made short tacks on the southern side of the rock in comparatively smooth water at noon mr dove assisted by mr james slight mr robert selkirk mr james glen and mr john gibson plumber with considerable difficulty from the boisterous state of the weather got the gilded ball screwed on measuring two feet in diameter and forming the principal ventilator at the upper extremity of the cupola of the lightroom at mr hamiltons desire a salute of seven guns was fired on this occasion and all hands being called to the quarterdeck stability to the bell rock lighthouse was not forgotten    tuesday 30th oct  on reaching the rock it was found that a very heavy sea still ran upon it but the writer having been disappointed on two former occasions and as the erection of the house might now be considered complete there being nothing wanted externally excepting some of the stormshutters for the defence of the windows he was the more anxious at this time to inspect it two wellmanned boats were therefore ordered to be in attendance and after some difficulty the wind being at nne they got safely into the western creek though not without encountering plentiful sprays it would have been impossible to have attempted a landing today under any other circumstances than with boats perfectly adapted to the purpose and with seamen who knew every ledge of the rock and even the length of the seaweeds at each particular spot so as to dip their oars into the water accordingly and thereby prevent them from getting entangled but what was of no less consequence to the safety of the party captain wilson who always steered the boat had a perfect knowledge of the set of the different waves while the crew never shifted their eyes from observing his motions and the strictest silence was preserved by every individual except himself  on entering the house the writer had the pleasure to find it in a somewhat habitable condition the lower apartments being closed in with temporary windows and fitted with proper stormshutters the lowest apartment at the head of the staircase was occupied with water fuel and provisions put up in a temporary way until the house could be furnished with proper utensils the second or lightroom store was at present much encumbered with various tools and apparatus for the use of the workmen the kitchen immediately over this had as yet been supplied only with a common ships caboose and plateiron funnel while the necessary cooking utensils had been taken from the beacon the bedroom was for the present used as the joiners workshop and the strangers room immediately under the lightroom was occupied by the artificers the beds being ranged in tiers as was done in the barrack of the beacon the lightroom though unprovided with its machinery being now covered over with the cupola glazed and painted had a very complete and cleanly appearance the balcony was only as yet fitted with a temporary rail consisting of a few iron stanchions connected with ropes and in this state it was necessary to leave it during the winter  having gone over the whole of the lowwater works on the rock the beacon and lighthouse and being satisfied that only the most untoward accident in the landing of the machinery could prevent the exhibition of the light in the course of the winter mr john reid formerly of the floating light was now put in charge of the lighthouse as principal keeper mr james slight had charge of the operations of the artificers while mr james dove and the smiths having finished the frame of the lightroom left the rock for the present with these arrangements the writer bade adieu to the works for the season at eleven am the tide was far advanced and there being now little or no shelter for the boats at the rock they had to be pulled through the breach of sea which came on board in great quantities and it was with extreme difficulty that they could be kept in the proper direction of the landingcreek on this occasion he may be permitted to look back with gratitude on the many escapes made in the course of this arduous undertaking now brought so near to a successful conclusion    monday 5th nov  on monday the 5th the yacht again visited the rock when mr slight and the artificers returned with her to the workyard where a number of things were still to prepare connected with the temporary fitting up of the accommodation for the lightkeepers mr john reid and peter fortune were now the only inmates of the house this was the smallest number of persons hitherto left in the lighthouse as four lightkeepers were to be the complement it was intended that three should always be at the rock its present inmates however could hardly have been better selected for such a situation mr reid being a person possessed of the strictest notions of duty and habits of regularity from long service on board of a manofwar while mr fortune had one of the most happy and contented dispositions imaginable    tuesday 13th nov  from saturday the 10th till tuesday the 13th the wind had been from ne blowing a heavy gale but today the weather having greatly moderated captain taylor who now commanded the smeaton sailed at two oclock am for the bell rock at five the floating light was hailed and found to be all well being a fine moonlight morning the seamen were changed from the one ship to the other at eight the smeaton being off the rock the boats were manned and taking a supply of water fuel and other necessaries landed at the western side when mr reid and mr fortune were found in good health and spirits  mr reid stated that during the late gales particularly on friday the 30th the wind veering from se to ne both he and mr fortune sensibly felt the house tremble when particular seas struck about the time of highwater the former observing that it was a tremor of that sort which rather tended to convince him that everything about the building was sound and reminded him of the effect produced when a good log of timber is struck sharply with a mallet but with every confidence in the stability of the building he nevertheless confessed that in so forlorn a situation they were not insensible to those emotions which he emphatically observed made a man look back upon his former life    friday 1st feb  the day long wished for on which the mariner was to see a light exhibited on the bell rock at length arrived captain wilson as usual hoisted the floats lanterns to the topmast on the evening of the 1st of february but the moment that the light appeared on the rock the crew giving three cheers lowered them and finally extinguished the lights   footnotes    11 this is of course the tradition commemorated by southey in     his ballad of the inchcape bell whether true or not it points to     the fact that from the infancy of scottish navigation the seafaring     mind had been fully alive to the perils of this reef repeated     attempts had been made to mark the place with beacons but all     efforts were unavailing one such beacon having been carried away     within eight days of its erection until robert stevenson conceived     and carried out the idea of the stone tower    12 the particular event which concentrated mr stevensons     attention on the problem of the bell rock was the memorable gale of     december 1799 when among many other vessels hms york a     seventyfourgun ship went down with all hands on board shortly     after this disaster mr stevenson made a careful survey and     prepared his models for a stone tower the idea of which was at     first received with pretty general scepticism smeatons eddystone     tower could not be cited as affording a parallel for there the rock     is not submerged even at highwater while the problem of the bell     rock was to build a tower of masonry on a sunken reef far distant     from land covered at every tide to a depth of twelve feet or more     and having thirtytwo fathoms depth of water within a mile of its     eastern edge    13 the grounds for the rejection of the bill by the house of lords     in 18023 had been that the extent of coast over which dues were     proposed to be levied would be too great before going to parliament     again the board of northern lights desiring to obtain support and     corroboration for mr stevensons views consulted first telford     who was unable to give the matter his attention and then on     stevensons suggestion rennie who concurred in affirming the     practicability of a stone tower and supported the bill when it came     again before parliament in 1806 rennie was afterwards appointed by     the commissioners as advising engineer whom stevenson might consult     in cases of emergency it seems certain that the title of chief     engineer had in this instance no more meaning than the above     rennie in point of fact proposed certain modifications in     stevensons plans which the latter did not accept nevertheless     rennie continued to take a kindly interest in the work and the two     engineers remained in friendly correspondence during its progress     the official view taken by the board as to the quarter in which lay     both the merit and the responsibility of the work may be gathered     from a minute of the commissioners at their first meeting held after     stevenson died in which they record their regret at the death of     this zealous faithful and able officer to whom is due the honour     of conceiving and executing the bell rock lighthouse the matter     is briefly summed up in the life of robert stevenson by his son     david stevenson a  c black 1878 and fully discussed on the     basis of official facts and figures by the same writer in a letter     to the civil engineers and architects journal 1862    14 nothing was said but i was looked out of countenance he     says in a letter    15 illformeduglyr l

exciting miseryor at least misery unrelievedis confined to another period to the days of suspense and the dreadful lookingfor of departure when the old life is running to an end and the new life with its new interests not yet begun and to the pain of an imminent parting there is added the unrest of a state of conscious preexistence the area railings the beloved shopwindow the smell of semisuburban

the assaults of sorrow come not from within as it seems to him but from without i was proud and glad to go to school had i been let alone i could have borne up like any hero but there was around me in all my native town a conspiracy of lamentation poor little boy he is going awayunkind little boy he is going to leave us so the unspoken burthen followed me as i went with yearning and reproach and at length one melancholy afternoon in the early autumn and at a place where it seems to me looking back it must be always autumn and generally sunday there came suddenly upon the face of all i sawthe long empty road the lines of the tall houses the church upon the hill the woody hillside gardena look of such a piercing sadness that my heart died and seating myself on a doorstep i shed tears of miserable sympathy a benevolent cat cumbered me the while with consolationswe two were alone in all that was visible of the london road two poor waifs who had each tasted sorrowand she fawned upon the weeper and gambolled for his entertainment watching the effect it seemed with motherly eyes  for the sake of the cat god bless her i confessed at home the story of my weakness and so it comes about that i owed a certain journey and the reader owes the present paper to a cat in the london road it was judged if i had thus brimmed over on the public highway some change of scene was in the medical sense indicated my father at the time was visiting the harbour lights of scotland and it was decided that he should take me along with him around a portion of the shores of fife my first professional

and a greater on the craggy foreland of st abbs and but a little way round the corner of the land imminent itself above the sea stands the gem of the province and the light of mediæval scotland st andrews where the great cardinal beaton held garrison against the world and the second of the name and title perished as you may read in knoxs jeering narrative under the knives of trueblue protestants and to this day after so many centuries the current voice of the professor is not hushed  here it was that my first tour of inspection began early on a bleak easterly morning there was a crashing run of sea upon the shore i recollect and my father and the man of the harbour light must sometimes raise their voices to be audible perhaps it is from this circumstance that i always imagine st andrews to be an ineffectual seat of learning and the sound of the east wind and the bursting surf to linger in its drowsy classrooms and confound the utterance of the professor until teacher and taught are alike drowned in oblivion and only the seagull beats on the windows and the draught of the seaair rustles in the pages of the open lecture but upon all this and the romance of st andrews in general the reader must consult the works of mr andrew lang who has written of it but the other day in his dainty prose and with his incommunicable humour and long ago in one of his best poems with grace and local truth and a note of unaffected pathos mr lang knows all about the romance i say and the educational advantages but i doubt if he had turned his attention to the harbour lights and it may be news even to him that in the year 1863 their case was pitiable hanging about with the east wind humming in my teeth and my hands i make no doubt in my pockets i looked for the first time upon that tragicomedy of the visiting engineer which i have seen so often reenacted on a more important stage eighty years ago i find my grandfather writing it is the most painful thing that can occur to me to have a correspondence of this kind with any of the keepers and when i come to the light house instead of having the satisfaction to meet them with approbation and welcome their family it is distressing when one is obliged to put on a most angry countenance and demeanour this painful obligation has been hereditary in my race i have myself on a perfectly amateur and unauthorised inspection of turnberry point bent my brows upon the keeper on the question of stormpanes and felt a keen pang of selfreproach when we went downstairs again and i found he was making a coffin for his infant child and then regained my equanimity with the thought that i had done the man a service and when the proper inspector came he would be readier with his panes the human race is perhaps credited with more duplicity than it deserves the visitation of a lighthouse at least is a business of the most transparent nature as soon as the boat grates on the shore and the keepers step forward in their uniformed coats the very slouch of the fellows shoulders tells their story and the engineer may begin at once to assume his angry countenance certainly the brass of the handrail will be clouded and if the brass be not immaculate certainly all will be to matchthe reflectors scratched the spare lamp unready the stormpanes in the storehouse if a light is not rather more than middling good it will be radically bad mediocrity except in literature appears to be unattainable by man but of course the unfortunate of st andrews was only an amateur he was not in the service he had no uniform coat he was i believe a plumber by his trade and stood in the mediæval phrase quite out of the danger of my father but he had a painful interview for all that and perspired extremely  from st andrews we drove over magus muir my father had announced we were to post and the phrase called up in my hopeful mind visions of topboots and the pictures in rowlandsons dance of death but it was only a jingling cab that came to the inn door such as i had driven in a thousand times at the low price of one shilling on the streets of edinburgh beyond this disappointment i remember nothing of that drive it is a road i have often travelled and of not one of these journeys do i remember any single trait the fact has not been suffered to encroach on the truth of the imagination i still see magus muir two hundred years ago a desert place quite unenclosed in the midst the primates carriage fleeing at the gallop the assassins loosereined in pursuit burley balfour pistol in hand among the first no scene of history has ever written itself so deeply on my mind not because balfour that questionable zealot was an ancestral cousin of my own not because of the pleadings of the victim and his daughter not even because of the live bumbee that flew out of sharpes baccobox thus clearly indicating his complicity with satan nor merely because as it was after all a crime of a fine religious flavour it figured in sunday books and afforded a grateful relief from ministering children or the memoirs of mrs katherine winslowe the figure that always fixed my attention is that of hackston of rathillet sitting in the saddle with his cloak about his mouth and through all that long bungling vociferous hurlyburly revolving privately a case of conscience he would take no hand in the deed because he had a private spite against the victim and that action must be sullied with no suggestion of a worldly motive on the other hand that action in itself was highly justified he had cast in his lot with the actors and he must stay there inactive but publicly sharing the responsibility you are a gentlemanyou will protect me cried the wounded old man crawling towards him i will never lay a hand on you said hackston and put his cloak about his mouth it is an old temptation with me to pluck away that cloak and see the faceto open that bosom and to read the heart with incomplete romances about hackston the drawers of my youth were lumbered i read him up in every printed book that i could lay my hands on i even dug among the wodrow manuscripts sitting shamefaced in the very room where my hero had been tortured two centuries before and keenly conscious of my youth in the midst of other and as i fondly thought more gifted students all was vain that he had passed a riotous nonage that he was a zealot that he twice displayed compared with his grotesque companions some tincture of soldierly resolution and even of military common sense and that he figured memorably in the scene on magus muir so much and no more could i make out but whenever i cast my eyes backward it is to see him like a landmark on the plains of history sitting with his cloak about his mouth inscrutable how small a thing creates an immortality i do not think he can have been a man entirely commonplace but had he not thrown his cloak about his mouth or had the witnesses forgot to chronicle the action he would not thus have haunted the imagination of my boyhood and today he would scarce delay me for a paragraph an incident at once romantic and dramatic which at once awakes the judgment and makes a picture for the eye how little do we realise its perdurable power perhaps no one does so but the author just as none but he appreciates the influence of jingling words so that he looks on upon life with something of a covert smile seeing people led by what they fancy to be thoughts and what are really the accustomed artifices of his own trade or roused by what they take to be principles and are really picturesque effects in a pleasant book about a schoolclass club colonel fergusson has recently told a little anecdote a philosophical society was formed by some academy boysamong them colonel fergusson himself fleeming jenkin and andrew wilson the christian buddhist and author of the abode of snow before these learned pundits one member laid the following ingenious problem what would be the result of putting a pound of potassium in a pot of porter i should think there would be a number of interesting biproducts said a smatterer at my elbow but for me the tale itself has a biproduct and stands as a type of much that is most human for this inquirer who conceived himself to burn with a zeal entirely chemical was really immersed in a design of a quite different nature unconsciously to his own recently breeched intelligence he was engaged in literature putting pound potassium pot porter initial p mediant tthat was his idea poor little boy so with politics and that which excites men in the present so with history and that which rouses them in the past there lie at the root of what appears most serious unsuspected elements  the triple town of anstruther wester anstruther easter and cellardyke all three royal burghsor two royal burghs and a less distinguished suburb i forget whichlies continuously along the seaside and boasts of either two or three separate parish churches and either two or three separate harbours these ambiguities are painful but the fact is although it argues me uncultured i am but poorly posted up on cellardyke my business lay in the two anstruthers a tricklet of a stream divides them spanned by a bridge and over the bridge at the time of my knowledge the celebrated shell house stood outpost on the west this had been the residence of an agreeable eccentric during his fond tenancy he had illustrated the outer walls as high if i remember rightly as the roof with elaborate patterns and pictures and snatches of verse in the vein of exegi monumentum shells and pebbles artfully contrasted and conjoined had been his medium and i like to think of him standing back upon the bridge when all was finished drinking in the general effect and like gibbon already lamenting his employment  the same bridge saw another sight in the seventeenth century mr thomson the curat of anstruther easter was a man highly obnoxious to the devout in the first place because he was a curat in the second place because he was a person of irregular and scandalous life and in the third place because he was generally suspected of dealings with the enemy of man these three disqualifications in the popular literature of the time go hand in hand but the end of mr thomson was a thing quite by itself and in the proper phrase a manifest judgment he had been at a friends house in anstruther wester where and elsewhere i suspect he had partaken of the bottle indeed to put the thing in our cold modern way the reverend gentleman was on the brink of delirium tremens it was a dark night it seems a little lassie came carrying a lantern to fetch the curate home and away they went down the street of anstruther wester the lantern swinging a bit in the childs hand the barred lustre tossing up and down along the front of slumbering houses and mr thomson not altogether steady on his legs nor to all appearance easy in his mind the pair had reached the middle of the bridge when as i conceive the scene the poor tippler started in some baseless fear and looked behind him the child already shaken by the ministers strange behaviour started also in so doing she would jerk the lantern and for the space of a moment the lights and the shadows would be all confounded then it was that to the unhinged toper and the twittering child a huge bulk of blackness seemed to sweep down to pass them close by as they stood upon the bridge and to vanish on the farther side in the general darkness of the night plainly the devil come for mr thomson thought the child what mr thomson thought himself we have no ground of knowledge but he fell upon his knees in the midst of the bridge like a man praying on the rest of the journey to the manse history is silent but when they came to the door the poor caitiff taking the lantern from the child looked upon her with so lost a countenance that her little courage died within her and she fled home screaming to her parents not a soul would venture out all that night the minister dwelt alone with his terrors in the manse and when the day dawned and men made bold to go about the streets they found the devil had come indeed for mr thomson  this manse of anstruther easter has another and a more cheerful association it was early in the morning about a century before the days of mr thomson that his predecessor was called out of bed to welcome a grandee of spain the duke of medina sidonia just landed in the harbour underneath but sure there was never seen a more decayed grandee sure there was never a duke welcomed from a stranger place of exile halfway between orkney and shetland there lies a certain isle on the one hand the atlantic on the other the north sea bombard its pillared cliffs soreeyed shortliving inbred fishers and their families herd in its few huts in the graveyard pieces of wreckwood stand for monuments there is nowhere a more inhospitable spot belleisleenmerfairisleatseathat is a name that has always rung in my minds ear like music but the only fair isle on which i ever set my foot was this unhomely rugged turrettop of submarine sierras here when his ship was broken my lord duke joyfully got ashore here for long months he and certain of his men were harboured and it was from this durance that he landed at last to be welcomed as well as such a papist deserved no doubt by the godly incumbent of anstruther easter and after the fair isle what a fine city must that have appeared and after the island diet what a hospitable spot the ministers table and yet he must have lived on friendly terms with his outlandish hosts for to this day there still survives a relic of the long winter evenings when the sailors of the great armada crouched about the hearths of the fairislanders the planks of their own lost galleon perhaps lighting up the scene and the gale and the surf that beat about the coast contributing their melancholy voices all the folk of the north isles are great artificers of knitting the fairislanders alone dye their fabrics in the spanish manner to this day gloves and nightcaps innocently decorated may be seen for sale in the shetland warehouse at edinburgh or on the fair isle itself in the catechists house and to this day they tell the story of the duke of medina sidonias adventure  it would seem as if the fair isle had some attraction for persons of quality when i landed there myself an elderly gentleman unshaved poorly attired his shoulders wrapped in a plaid was seen walking to and fro with a book in his hand upon the beach he paid no heed to our arrival which we thought a strange thing in itself but when one of the officers of the pharos passing narrowly by him observed his book to be a greek testament our wonder and interest took a higher flight the catechist was crossexamined he said the gentleman had been put across some time before in mr bruce of sumburghs schooner the only link between the fair isle and the rest of the world and that he held services and was doing good so much came glibly enough but when pressed a little further the catechist displayed embarrassment a singular diffidence appeared upon his face they tell me said he in low tones that hes a lord and a lord he was a peer of the realm pacing that inhospitable beach with his greek testament and his plaid about his shoulders set upon doing good as he understood it worthy man and his grandson a goodlooking little boy much better dressed than the lordly evangelist and speaking with a silken english accent very foreign to the scene accompanied me for a while in my exploration of the island i suppose this little fellow is now my lord and wonder how much he remembers of the fair isle perhaps not much for he seemed to accept very quietly his savage situation and under such guidance it is like that this was not his first nor yet his last adventure     ii  random memories    ii the education of an engineer   anstruther is a place sacred to the muse she inspired really to a considerable extent tennants vernacular poem anster fair and i have there waited upon her myself with much devotion this was when i came as a young man to glean engineering experience from the building of the breakwater what i gleaned i am sure i do not know but indeed i had already my own private determination to be an author i loved the art of words and the appearances of life and travellers and headers and rubble and polished ashlar and pierres perdues and even the thrilling question of the stringcourse interested me only if they interested me at all as properties for some possible romance or as words to add to my vocabulary to grow a little catholic is the compensation of years youth is oneeyed and in those days though i haunted the breakwater by day and even loved the place for the sake of the sunshine the thrilling seaside air the wash of waves on the seaface the green glimmer of the divers helmets far below and the musical chinking of the masons my one genuine preoccupation lay elsewhere and my only industry was in the hours when i was not on duty i lodged with a certain bailie brown a carpenter by trade and there as soon as dinner was despatched in a chamber scented with dry roseleaves drew in my chair to the table and proceeded to pour forth literature at such a speed and with such intimations of early death and immortality as i now look back upon with wonder then it was that i wrote voces fidelium a series of dramatic monologues in verse then that i indited the bulk of a covenanting novellike so many others never finished late i sat into the night toiling as i thought under the very dart of death toiling to leave a memory behind me i feel moved to thrust aside the curtain of the years to hail that poor feverish idiot to bid him go to bed and clap voces fidelium on the fire before he goes so clear does he appear before me sitting there between his candles in the rosescented room and the late night so ridiculous a picture to my elderly wisdom does the fool present but he was driven to his bed at last without miraculous intervention and the manner of his driving sets the last touch upon this eminently youthful business the weather was then so warm that i must keep the windows open the night without was populous with moths as the late darkness deepened my literary tapers beaconed forth more brightly thicker and thicker came the dusty nightfliers to gyrate for one brilliant instant round the flame and fall in agonies upon my paper flesh and blood could not endure the spectacle to capture immortality was doubtless a noble enterprise but not to capture it at such a cost of suffering and out would go the candles and off would i go to bed in the darkness raging to think that the blow might fall on the morrow and there was voces fidelium still incomplete well the moths are all gone and voces fidelium along with them only the fool is still on hand and practises new follies  only one thing in connection with the harbour tempted me and that was the diving an experience i burned to taste of but this was not to be at least in anstruther and the subject involves a change of scene to the subarctic town of wick you can never have dwelt in a country more unsightly than that part of caithness the land faintly swelling faintly falling not a tree not a hedgerow the fields divided by single slate stones set upon their edge the wind always singing in your ears and down the long road that led nowhere thrumming in the telegraph wires only as you approached the coast was there anything to stir the heart the plateau broke down to the north sea in formidable cliffs the tall outstacks rose like pillars ringed about with surf the coves were overbrimmed with clamorous froth the seabirds screamed the wind sang in the thyme on the cliffs edge here and there small ancient castles toppled on the brim here and there it was possible to dip into a dell of shelter where you might lie and tell yourself you were a little warm and hear near at hand the whinpods bursting in the afternoon sun and farther off the rumour of the turbulent sea as for wick itself it is one of the meanest of mans towns and situate certainly on the baldest of gods bays it lives for herring and a strange sight it is to see of an afternoon the heights of pulteney blackened by seawardlooking fishers as when a city crowds to a reviewor as when bees have swarmed the ground is horrible with lumps and clusters and a strange sight and a beautiful to see the fleet put silently out against a rising moon the sealine rough as a wood with sails and ever and again and one after another a boat flitting swiftly by the silver disk this mass of fishers this great fleet of boats is out of all proportion to the town itself and the oars are manned and the nets hauled by immigrants from the long island as we call the outer hebrides who come for that season only and depart again if the take be poor leaving debts behind them in a bad year the end of the herringfishery is therefore an exciting time fights are common riots often possible an apple knocked from a childs hand was once the signal for something like a war and even when i was there a gunboat lay in the bay to assist the authorities to contrary interests it should be observed the curse of babel is here added the lews men are gaelic speakers those of caithness have adopted english an odd circumstance if you reflect that both must be largely norsemen by descent i remember seeing one of the strongest instances of this division a thing like a punchandjudy box erected on the flat gravestones of the churchyard from the hutch or prosceniumi know not what to call itan eldritchlooking preacher laying down the law in gaelic about some one of the name of powl whom i at last divined to be the apostle to the gentiles a large congregation of the lews men very devoutly listening and on the outskirts of the crowd some of the towns children to whom the whole affair was greek and hebrew profanely playing tigg the same descent the same country the same narrow sect of the same religion and all these bonds made very largely nugatory by an accidental difference of dialect  into the bay of wick stretched the dark length of the unfinished breakwater in its cage of open staging the travellers like frames of churches overplumbing all and away at the extreme end the divers toiling unseen on the foundation on a platform of loose planks the assistants turned their airmills a stone might be swinging between wind and water underneath the swell ran gaily and from time to time a mailed dragon with a windowglass snout came dripping up the ladder youth is a blessed season after all my stay at wick was in the year of voces fidelium and the roseleaf room at bailie browns and already i did not care two straws for literary glory posthumous ambition perhaps requires an atmosphere of roses and the more rugged excitant of wick east winds had made another boy of me to go down in the divingdress that was my absorbing fancy and with the countenance of a certain handsome scamp of a diver bob bain by name i gratified the whim  it was grey harsh easterly weather the swell ran pretty high and out in the open there were skippers daughters when i found myself at last on the divers platform twenty pounds of lead upon each foot and my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen underclothing one moment the salt wind was whistling round my nightcapped head the next i was crushed almost double under the weight of the helmet as that intolerable burthen was laid upon me i could have found it in my heart only for shames sake to cry off from the whole enterprise but it was too late the attendants began to turn the hurdygurdy and the air to whistle through the tube some one screwed in the barred window of the vizor and i was cut off in a moment from my fellowmen standing there in their midst but quite divorced from intercourse a creature deaf and dumb pathetically looking forth upon them from a climate of his own except that i could move and feel i was like a man fallen in a catalepsy but time was scarce given me to realise my isolation the weights were hung upon my back and breast the signalrope was thrust into my unresisting hand and setting a twentypound foot upon the ladder i began ponderously to descend  some twenty rounds below the platform twilight fell looking up i saw a low green heaven mottled with vanishing bells of white looking around except for the weedy spokes and shafts of the ladder nothing but a green gloaming somewhat opaque but very restful and delicious thirty rounds lower i stepped off on the pierres perdues of the foundation a dumb helmeted figure took me by the hand and made a gesture as i read it of encouragement and looking in at the creatures window i beheld the face of bain there we were hand to hand and when it pleased us eye to eye and either might have burst himself with shouting and not a whisper come to his companions hearing each in his own little world of air stood incommunicably separate  bob had told me ere this a little tale a five minutes drama at the bottom of the sea which at that moment possibly shot across my mind he was down with another settling a stone of the seawall they had it well adjusted bob gave the signal the scissors were slipped the stone set home and it was time to turn to something else but still his companion remained bowed over the block like a mourner on a tomb or only raised himself to make absurd contortions and mysterious signs unknown to the vocabulary of the diver there then these two stood for a while like the dead and the living till there flashed a fortunate thought into bobs mind and he stooped peered through the window of that other world and beheld the face of its inhabitant wet with streaming tears ah the man was in pain and bob glancing downward saw what was the trouble the block had been lowered on the foot of that unfortunatehe was caught alive at the bottom of the sea under fifteen tons of rock  that two men should handle a stone so heavy even swinging in the scissors may appear strange to the inexpert these must bear in mind the great density of the water of the sea and the surprising results of transplantation to that medium to understand a little what these are and how a mans weight so far from being an encumbrance is the very ground of his agility was the chief lesson of my submarine experience the knowledge came upon me by degrees as i began to go forward with the hand of my estranged companion a world of tumbled stones was visible pillared with the weedy uprights of the staging overhead a flat roof of green a little in front the seawall like an unfinished rampart and presently in our upward progress bob motioned me to leap upon a stone i looked to see if he were possibly in earnest and he only signed to me the more imperiously now the block stood six feet high it would have been quite a leap to me unencumbered with the breast and back weights and the twenty pounds upon each foot and the staggering load of the helmet the thing was out of reason i laughed aloud in my tomb and to prove to bob how far he was astray i gave a little impulse from my toes up i soared like a bird my companion soaring at my side as high as to the stone and then higher i pursued my impotent and empty flight even when the strong arm of bob had checked my shoulders my heels continued their ascent so that i blew out sideways like an autumn leaf and must be hauled in hand over hand as sailors haul in the slack of a sail and propped upon my feet again like an intoxicated sparrow yet a little higher on the foundation and we began to be affected by the bottom of the swell running there like a strong breeze of wind or so i must suppose for safe in my cushion of air i was conscious of no impact only swayed idly like a weed and was now borne helplessly abroad and now swiftlyand yet with dreamlike gentlenessimpelled against my guide so does a childs balloon divagate upon the currents of the air and touch and slide off again from every obstacle so must have ineffectually swung so resented their inefficiency those light crowds that followed the star of hades and uttered exiguous voices in the land beyond cocytus  there was something strangely exasperating as well as strangely wearying in these uncommanded evolutions it is bitter to return to infancy to be supported and directed and perpetually set upon your feet by the hand of some one else the air besides as it is supplied to you by the busy millers on the platform closes the eustachian tubes and keeps the neophyte perpetually swallowing till his throat is grown so dry that he can swallow no longer and for all these reasonsalthough i had a fine dizzy muddleheaded joy in my surroundings and longed and tried and always failed to lay hands on the fish that darted here and there about me swift as hummingbirdsyet i fancy i was rather relieved than otherwise when bain brought me back to the ladder and signed to me to mount and there was one more experience before me even then of a sudden my ascending head passed into the trough of a swell out of the green i shot at once into a glory of rosy almost of sanguine lightthe multitudinous seas incarnadined the heaven above a vault of crimson and then the glory faded into the hard ugly daylight of a caithness autumn with a low sky a grey sea and a whistling wind  bob bain had five shillings for his trouble and i had done what i desired it was one of the best things i got from my education as an engineer of which however as a way of life i wish to speak with sympathy it takes a man into the open air it keeps him hanging about harboursides which is the richest form of idling it carries him to wild islands it gives him a taste of the genial dangers of the sea it supplies him with dexterities to exercise it makes demands upon his ingenuity it will go far to cure him of any taste if ever he had one for the miserable life of cities and when it has done so it carries him back and shuts him in an office from the roaring skerry and the wet thwart of the tossing boat he passes to the stool and desk and with a memory full of ships and seas and perilous headlands and the shining pharos he must apply his longsighted eyes to the pretty niceties of drawing or measure his inaccurate mind with several pages of consecutive figures he is a wise youth to be sure who can balance one part of genuine life against two parts of drudgery between four walls and for the sake of the one manfully accept the other  wick was scarce an eligible place of stay but how much better it was to hang in the cold wind upon the pier to go down with bob bain among the roots of the staging to be all day in a boat coiling a wet rope and shouting ordersnot always very wisethan to be warm and dry and dull and deadalive in the most comfortable office and wick itself had in those days a note of originality it may have still but i misdoubt it much the old minister of keiss would not preach in these degenerate times for an hour and a half upon the clock the gipsies must be gone from their cavern where you might see from the mouth the women tending their fire like meg merrilies and the men sleeping off their coarse potations and where in winter gales the surf would beleaguer them closely bursting in their very door a traveller today upon the thurso coach would scarce observe a little cloud of smoke among the moorlands and be told quite openly it marked a private still he would not indeed make that journey for there is now no thurso coach and even if he could one little thing that happened to me could never happen to him or not with the same trenchancy of contrast  we had been upon the road all evening the coachtop was crowded with lews fishers going home scarce anything but gaelic had sounded in my ears and our way had lain throughout over a moorish country very northern to behold latish at night though it was still broad day in our subarctic latitude we came down upon the shores of the roaring pentland firth that grave of mariners on one hand the cliffs of dunnet head ran seaward in front was the little bare white town of castleton its streets full of blowing sand nothing beyond but the north islands the great deep and the perennial icefields of the pole and here in the last imaginable place there sprang up young outlandish voices and a chatter of some foreign speech and i saw pursuing the coach with its load of hebridean fishersas they had pursued vetturini up the passes of the apennines or perhaps along the grotto under virgils tombtwo little darkeyed whitetoothed italian vagabonds of twelve to fourteen years of age one with a hurdygurdy the other with a cage of white mice the coach passed on and their small italian chatter died in the distance and i was left to marvel how they had wandered into that country and how they fared in it and what they thought of it and when if ever they should see again the silver windbreaks run among the olives and the stonepine stand guard upon etruscan sepulchres  upon any american the strangeness of this incident is somewhat lost for as far back as he goes in his own land he will find some alien camping there the cornish miner the french or mexican halfblood the negro in the south these are deep in the woods and far among the mountains but in an old cold and rugged country such as mine the days of immigration are long at an end and away up there which was at that time far beyond the northernmost extreme of railways hard upon the shore of that illomened strait of whirlpools in a land of moors where no stranger came unless it should be a sportsman to shoot grouse or an antiquary to decipher runes the presence of these small pedestrians struck the mind as though a birdofparadise had risen from the heather or an albatross come fishing in the bay of wick they were as strange to their surroundings as my lordly evangelist or the old spanish grandee on the fair isle     iii  a chapter on dreams   the past is all of one texturewhether feigned or sufferedwhether acted out in three dimensions or only witnessed in that small theatre of the brain which we keep brightly lighted all night long after the jets are down and darkness and sleep reign undisturbed in the remainder of the body there is no distinction on the face of our experiences one is vivid indeed and one dull and one pleasant and another agonising to remember but which of them is what we call true and which a dream there is not one hair to prove the past stands on a precarious footing another straw split in the field of metaphysic and behold us robbed of it there is scarce a family that can count four generations but lays a claim to some dormant title or some castle and estate a claim not prosecutable in any court of law but flattering to the fancy and a great alleviation of idle hours a mans claim to his own past is yet less valid a paper might turn up in proper storybook fashion in the secret drawer of an old ebony secretary and restore your family to its ancient honours and reinstate mine in a certain west indian islet not far from st kitts as beloved tradition hummed in my young ears which was once ours and is now unjustly some one elses and for that matter in the state of the sugar trade is not worth anything to anybody i do not say that these revolutions are likely only no man can deny that they are possible and the past on the other hand is lost for ever our old days and deeds our old selves too and the very world in which these scenes were acted all brought down to the same faint residuum as a last nights dream to some incontinuous images and an echo in the chambers of the brain not an hour not a mood not a glance of the eye can we revoke it is all gone past conjuring and yet conceive us robbed of it conceive that little thread of memory that we trail behind us broken at the pockets edge and in what naked nullity should we be left for we only guide ourselves and only know ourselves by these airpainted pictures of the past  upon these grounds there are some among us who claim to have lived longer and more richly than their neighbours when they lay asleep they claim they were still active and among the treasures of memory that all men review for their amusement these count in no second place the harvests of their dreams there is one of this kind whom i have in my eye and whose case is perhaps unusual enough to be described he was from a child an ardent and uncomfortable dreamer when he had a touch of fever at night and the room swelled and shrank and his clothes hanging on a nail now loomed up instant to the bigness of a church and now drew away into a horror of infinite distance and infinite littleness the poor soul was very well aware of what must follow and struggled hard against the approaches of that slumber which was the beginning of sorrows but his struggles were in vain sooner or later the nighthag would have him by the throat and pluck him strangling and screaming from his sleep his dreams were at times commonplace enough at times very strange at times they were almost formless he would be haunted for instance by nothing more definite than a certain hue of brown which he did not mind in the least while he was awake but feared and loathed while he was dreaming at times again they took on every detail of circumstance as when once he supposed he must swallow the populous world and awoke screaming with the horror of the thought the two chief troubles of his very narrow existencethe practical and everyday trouble of school tasks and the ultimate and airy one of hell and judgmentwere often confounded together into one appalling nightmare he seemed to himself to stand before the great white throne he was called on poor little devil to recite some form of words on which his destiny depended his tongue stuck his memory was blank hell gaped for him and he would awake clinging to the curtainrod with his knees to his chin  these were extremely poor experiences on the whole and at that time of life my dreamer would have very willingly parted with his power of dreams but presently in the course of his growth the cries and physical contortions passed away seemingly for ever his visions were still for the most part miserable but they were more constantly supported and he would awake with no more extreme symptom than a flying heart a freezing scalp cold sweats and the speechless midnight fear his dreams too as befitted a mind better stocked with particulars became more circumstantial and had more the air and continuity of life the look of the world beginning to take hold on his attention scenery came to play a part in his sleeping as well as in his waking thoughts so that he would take long uneventful journeys and see strange towns and beautiful places as he lay in bed and what is more significant an odd taste that he had for the georgian costume and for stories laid in that period of english history began to rule the features of his dreams so that he masqueraded there in a threecornered hat and was much engaged with jacobite conspiracy between the hour for bed and that for breakfast about the same time he began to read in his dreamstales for the most part and for the most part after the manner of g p r james but so incredibly more vivid and moving than any printed book that he has ever since been malcontent with literature  and then while he was yet a student there came to him a dreamadventure which he has no anxiety to repeat he began that is to say to dream in sequence and thus to lead a double lifeone of the day one of the nightone that he had every reason to believe was the true one another that he had no means of proving to be false i should have said he studied or was by way of studying at edinburgh college which it may be supposed was how i came to know him well in his dreamlife he passed a long day in the surgical theatre his heart in his mouth his teeth on edge seeing monstrous malformations and the abhorred dexterity of surgeons in a heavy rainy foggy evening he came forth into the south bridge turned up the high street and entered the door of a tall land at the top of which he supposed himself to lodge all night long in his wet clothes he climbed the stairs stair after stair in endless series and at every second flight a flaring lamp with a reflector all night long he brushed by single persons passing downwardbeggarly women of the street great weary muddy labourers poor scarecrows of men pale parodies of womenbut all drowsy and weary like himself and all single and all brushing against him as they passed in the end out of a northern window he would see day beginning to whiten over the firth give up the ascent turn to descend and in a breath be back again upon the streets in his wet clothes in the wet haggard dawn trudging to another day of monstrosities and operations time went quicker in the life of dreams some seven hours as near as he can guess to one and it went besides more intensely so that the gloom of these fancied experiences clouded the day and he had not shaken off their shadow ere it was time to lie down and to renew them i cannot tell how long it was that he endured this discipline but it was long enough to leave a great black blot upon his memory long enough to send him trembling for his reason to the doors of a certain doctor whereupon with a simple draught he was restored to the common lot of man  the poor gentleman has since been troubled by nothing of the sort indeed his nights were for some while like other mens now blank now chequered with dreams and these sometimes charming sometimes appalling but except for an occasional vividness of no extraordinary kind i will just note one of these occasions ere i pass on to what makes my dreamer truly interesting it seemed to him that he was in the first floor of a rough hillfarm the room showed some poor efforts at gentility a carpet on the floor a piano i think against the wall but for all these refinements there was no mistaking he was in a moorland place among hillside people and set in miles of heather he looked down from the window upon a bare farmyard that seemed to have been long disused a great uneasy stillness lay upon the world there was no sign of the farmfolk or of any live stock save for an old brown curly dog of the retriever breed who sat close in against the wall of the house and seemed to be dozing something about this dog disquieted the dreamer it was quite a nameless feeling for the beast looked right enoughindeed he was so old and dull and dusty and brokendown that he should rather have awakened pity and yet the conviction came and grew upon the dreamer that this was no proper dog at all but something hellish a great many dozing summer flies hummed about the yard and presently the dog thrust forth his paw caught a fly in his open palm carried it to his mouth like an ape and looking suddenly up at the dreamer in the window winked to him with one eye the dream went on it matters not how it went it was a good dream as dreams go but there was nothing in the sequel worthy of that devilish brown dog and the point of interest for me lies partly in that very fact that having found so singular an incident my imperfect dreamer should prove unable to carry the tale to a fit end and fall back on indescribable noises and indiscriminate horrors it would be different now he knows his business better  for to approach at last the point this honest fellow had long been in the custom of setting himself to sleep with tales and so had his father before him but these were irresponsible inventions told for the tellers pleasure with no eye to the crass public or the thwart reviewer tales where a thread might be dropped or one adventure quitted for another on fancys least suggestion so that the little people who manage mans internal theatre had not as yet received a very rigorous training and played upon their stage like children who should have slipped into the house and found it empty rather than like drilled actors performing a set piece to a huge hall of faces but presently my dreamer began to turn his former amusement of storytelling to what is called account by which i mean that he began to write and sell his tales here was he and here were the little people who did that part of his business in quite new conditions the stories must now be trimmed and pared and set upon allfours they must run from a beginning to an end and fit after a manner with the laws of life the pleasure in one word had become a business and that not only for the dreamer but for the little people of his theatre these understood the change as well as he when he lay down to prepare himself for sleep he no longer sought amusement but printable and profitable tales and after he had dozed off in his boxseat his little people continued their evolutions with the same mercantile designs all other forms of dream deserted him but two he still occasionally reads the most delightful books he still visits at times the most delightful places and it is perhaps worthy of note that to these same places and to one in particular he returns at intervals of months and years finding new fieldpaths visiting new neighbours beholding that happy valley under new effects of noon and dawn and sunset but all the rest of the family of visions is quite lost to him the common mangled version of yesterdays affairs the rawheadandbloodybones nightmare rumoured to be the child of toasted cheesethese and their like are gone and for the most part whether awake or asleep he is simply occupiedhe or his little peoplein consciously making stories for the market this dreamer like many other persons has encountered some trifling vicissitudes of fortune when the bank begins to send letters and the butcher to linger at the back gate he sets to belabouring his brains after a story for that is his readiest moneywinner and behold at once the little people begin to bestir themselves in the same quest and labour all night long and all night long set before him truncheons of tales upon their lighted theatre no fear of his being frightened now the flying heart and the frozen scalp are things bygone applause growing applause growing interest growing exultation in his own cleverness for he takes all the credit and at last a jubilant leap to wakefulness with the cry i have it thatll do upon his lips with such and similar emotions he sits at these nocturnal dramas with such outbreaks like claudius in the play he scatters the performance in the midst often enough the waking is a disappointment he has been too deep asleep as i explain the thing drowsiness has gained his little people they have gone stumbling and maundering through their parts and the play to the awakened mind is seen to be a tissue of absurdities and yet how often have these sleepless brownies done him honest service and given him as he sat idly taking his pleasure in the boxes better tales than he could fashion for himself  here is one exactly as it came to him it seemed he was the son of a very rich and wicked man the owner of broad acres and a most damnable temper the dreamer and that was the son had lived much abroad on purpose to avoid his parent and when at length he returned to england it was to find him married again to a young wife who was supposed to suffer cruelly and to loathe her yoke because of this marriage as the dreamer indistinctly understood it was desirable for father and son to have a meeting and yet both being proud and both angry neither would condescend upon a visit meet they did accordingly in a desolate sandy country by the sea and there they quarrelled and the son stung by some intolerable insult struck down the father dead no suspicion was aroused the dead man was found and buried and the dreamer succeeded to the broad estates and found himself installed under the same roof with his fathers widow for whom no provision had been made these two lived very much alone as people may after a bereavement sat down to table together shared the long evenings and grew daily better friends until it seemed to him of a sudden that she was prying about dangerous matters that she had conceived a notion of his guilt that she watched him and tried him with questions he drew back from her company as men draw back from a precipice suddenly discovered and yet so strong was the attraction that he would drift again and again into the old intimacy and again and again be startled back by some suggestive question or some inexplicable meaning in her eye so they lived at cross purposes a life full of broken dialogue challenging glances and suppressed passion until one day he saw the woman slipping from the house in a veil followed her to the station followed her in the train to the seaside country and out over the sandhills to the very place where the murder was done there she began to grope among the bents he watching her flat upon his face and presently she had something in her handi cannot remember what it was but it was deadly evidence against the dreamerand as she held it up to look at it perhaps from the shock of the discovery her foot slipped and she hung at some peril on the brink of the tall sandwreaths he had no thought but to spring up and rescue her and there they stood face to face she with that deadly matter openly in her handhis very presence on the spot another link of proof it was plain she was about to speak but this was more than he could bearhe could bear to be lost but not to talk of it with his destroyer and he cut her short with trivial conversation arm in arm they returned together to the train talking he knew not what made the journey back in the same carriage sat down to dinner and passed the evening in the drawingroom as in the past but suspense and fear drummed in the dreamers bosom she has not denounced me yetso his thoughts ran when will she denounce me will it be tomorrow and it was not tomorrow nor the next day nor the next and their life settled back on the old terms only that she seemed kinder than before and that as for him the burthen of his suspense and wonder grew daily more unbearable so that he wasted away like a man with a disease once indeed he broke all bounds of decency seized an occasion when she was abroad ransacked her room and at last hidden away among her jewels found the damning evidence there he stood holding this thing which was his life in the hollow of his hand and marvelling at her inconsequent behaviour that she should seek and keep and yet not use it and then the door opened and behold herself so once more they stood eye to eye with the evidence between them and once more she raised to him a face brimming with some communication and once more he shied away from speech and cut her off but before he left the room which he had turned upside down he laid back his deathwarrant where he had found it and at that her face lighted up the next thing he heard she was explaining to her maid with some ingenious falsehood the disorder of her things flesh and blood could bear the strain no longer and i think it was the next morning though chronology is always hazy in the theatre of the mind that he burst from his reserve they had been breakfasting together in one corner of a great parqueted sparelyfurnished room of many windows all the time of the meal she had tortured him with sly allusions and no sooner were the servants gone and these two protagonists alone together than he leaped to his feet she too sprang up with a pale face with a pale face she heard him as he raved out his complaint why did she torture him so she knew all she knew he was no enemy to her why did she not denounce him at once what signified her whole behaviour why did she torture him and yet again why did she torture him and when he had done she fell upon her knees and with outstretched hands do you not understand she cried i love you  hereupon with a pang of wonder and mercantile delight the dreamer awoke his mercantile delight was not of long endurance for it soon became plain that in this spirited tale there were unmarketable elements which is just the reason why you have it here so briefly told but his wonder has still kept growing and i think the readers will also if he consider it ripely for now he sees why i speak of the little people as of substantive inventors and performers to the end they had kept their secret i will go bail for the dreamer having excellent grounds for valuing his candour that he had no guess whatever at the motive of the womanthe hinge of the whole wellinvented plotuntil the instant of that highly dramatic declaration it was not his tale it was the little peoples and observe not only was the secret kept the story was told with really guileful craftsmanship the conduct of both actors is in the cant phrase psychologically correct and the emotion aptly graduated up to the surprising climax i am awake now and i know this trade and yet i cannot better it i am awake and i live by this business and yet i could not outdocould not perhaps equalthat crafty artifice as of some old experienced carpenter of plays some dennery or sardou by which the same situation is twice presented and the two actors twice brought face to face over the evidence only once it is in her hand once in hisand these in their due order the least dramatic first the more i think of it the more i am moved to press upon the world my question who are the little people they are near connections of the dreamers beyond doubt they share in his financial worries and have an eye to the bankbook they share plainly in his training they have plainly learned like him to build the scheme of a considerate story and to arrange emotion in progressive order only i think they have more talent and one thing is beyond doubt they can tell him a story piece by piece like a serial and keep him all the while in ignorance of where they aim who are they then and who is the dreamer  well as regards the dreamer i can answer that for he is no less a person than myselfas i might have told you from the beginning only that the critics murmur over my consistent egotismand as i am positively forced to tell you now or i could advance but little further with my story and for the little people what shall i say they are but just my brownies god bless them who do onehalf my work for me while i am fast asleep and in all human likelihood do the rest for me as well when i am wide awake and fondly suppose i do it for myself that part which is done while i am sleeping is the brownies part beyond contention but that which is done when i am up and about is by no means necessarily mine since all goes to show the brownies have a hand in it even then here is a doubt that much concerns my conscience for myselfwhat i call i my conscious ego the denizen of the pineal gland unless he has changed his residence since descartes the man with the conscience and the variable bankaccount the man with the hat and the boots and the privilege of voting and not carrying his candidate at the general electionsi am sometimes tempted to suppose is no storyteller at all but a creature as matter of fact as any cheesemonger or any cheese and a realist bemired up to the ears in actuality so that by that account the whole of my published fiction should be the singlehanded product of some brownie some familiar some unseen collaborator whom i keep locked in a back garret while i get all the praise and he but a share which i cannot prevent him getting of the pudding i am an excellent adviser something like molières servant i pull back and i cut down and i dress the whole in the best words and sentences that i can find and make i hold the pen too and i do the sitting at the table which is about the worst of it and when all is done i make up the manuscript and pay for the registration so that on the whole i have some claim to share though not so largely as i do in the profits of our common enterprise  i can but give an instance or so of what part is done sleeping and what part awake and leave the reader to share what laurels there are at his own nod between myself and my collaborators and to do this i will first take a book that a number of persons have been polite enough to read the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde i had long been trying to write a story on this subject to find a body a vehicle for that strong sense of mans double being which must at times come in upon and overwhelm the mind of every thinking creature i had even written one the travelling companion which was returned by an editor on the plea that it was a work of genius and indecent and which i burned the other day on the ground that it was not a work of genius and that jekyll had supplanted it then came one of those financial fluctuations to which with an elegant modesty i have hitherto referred in the third person for two days i went about racking my brains for a plot of any sort and on the second night i dreamed the scene at the window and a scene afterward split in two in which hyde pursued for some crime took the powder and underwent the change in the presence of his pursuers all the rest was made awake and consciously although i think i can trace in much of it the manner of my brownies the meaning of the tale is therefore mine and had long preexisted in my garden of adonis and tried one body after another in vain indeed i do most of the morality worse luck and my brownies have not a rudiment of what we call a conscience mine too is the setting mine the characters all that was given me was the matter of three scenes and the central idea of a voluntary change becoming involuntary will it be thought ungenerous after i have been so liberally ladling out praise to my unseen collaborators if i here toss them over bound hand and foot into the arena of the critics for the business of the powders which so many have censured is i am relieved to say not mine at all but the brownies of another tale in case the reader should have glanced at it i may say a word the not very defensible story of olalla here the court the mother the mothers niche olalla olallas chamber the meetings on the stair the broken window the ugly scene of the bite were all given me in bulk and detail as i have tried to write them to this i added only the external scenery for in my dream i never was beyond the court the portrait the characters of felipe and the priest the moral such as it is and the last pages such as alas they are and i may even say that in this case the moral itself was given me for it arose immediately on a comparison of the mother and the daughter and from the hideous trick of atavism in the first sometimes a parabolic sense is still more undeniably present in a dream sometimes i cannot but suppose my brownies have been aping bunyan and yet in no case with what would possibly be called a moral in a tract never with the ethical narrowness conveying hints instead of lifes larger limitations and that sort of sense which we seem to perceive in the arabesque of time and space  for the most part it will be seen my brownies are somewhat fantastic like their stories hot and hot full of passion and the picturesque alive with animating incident and they have no prejudice against the supernatural but the other day they gave me a surprise entertaining me with a lovestory a little april comedy which i ought certainly to hand over to the author of a chance acquaintance for he could write it as it should be written and i am sure although i mean to try that i cannotbut who would have supposed that a brownie of mine should invent a tale for mr howells     iv  beggars    i   in a pleasant airy uphill country it was my fortune when i was young to make the acquaintance of a certain beggar i call him beggar though he usually allowed his coat and his shoes which were openmouthed indeed to beg for him he was the wreck of an athletic man tall gaunt and bronzed far gone in consumption with that disquieting smile of the mortally stricken on his face but still active afoot still with the brisk military carriage the ready military salute three ways led through this piece of country and as i was inconstant in my choice i believe he must often have awaited me in vain but often enough he caught me often enough from some place of ambush by the roadside he would spring suddenly forth in the regulation attitude and launching at once into his inconsequential talk fall into step with me upon my farther course a fine morning sir though perhaps a trifle inclining to rain i hope i see you well sir why no sir i dont feel as hearty myself as i could wish but i am keeping about my ordinary i am pleased to meet you on the road sir i assure you i quite look forward to one of our little conversations he loved the sound of his own voice inordinately and though with something too offhand to call servility he would always hasten to agree with anything you said yet he could never suffer you to say it to an end by what transition he slid to his favourite subject i have no memory but we had never been long together on the way before he was dealing in a very military manner with the english poets shelley was a fine poet sir though a trifle atheistical in his opinions his queen mab sir is quite an atheistical work scott sir is not so poetical a writer with the works of shakespeare i am not so well acquainted but he was a fine poet keatsjohn keats sirhe was a very fine poet with such references such trivial criticism such loving parade of his own knowledge he would beguile the road striding forward uphill his staff now clapped to the ribs of his deep resonant chest now swinging in the air with the remembered jauntiness of the private soldier and all the while his toes looking out of his boots and his shirt looking out of his elbows and death looking out of his smile and his big crazy frame shaken by accesses of cough  he would often go the whole way home with me often to borrow a book and that book always a poet off he would march to continue his mendicant rounds with the volume slipped into the pocket of his ragged coat and although he would sometimes keep it quite a while yet it came always back again at last not much the worse for its travels into beggardom and in this way doubtless his knowledge grew and his glib random criticism took a wider range but my library was not the first he had drawn upon at our first encounter he was already brimful of shelley and the atheistical queen mab and keatsjohn keats sir and i have often wondered how he came by these acquirements just as i often wondered how he fell to be a beggar he had served through the mutinyof which like so many people he could tell practically nothing beyond the names of places and that it was difficult work sir and very hot or that soandso was a very fine commander sir he was far too smart a man to have remained a private in the nature of things he must have won his stripes and yet here he was without a pension when i touched on this problem he would content himself with diffidently offering me advice a man should be very careful when he is young sir if youll excuse me saying so a spirited young gentleman like yourself sir should be very careful i was perhaps a trifle inclined to atheistical opinions myself for perhaps with a deeper wisdom than we are inclined in these days to admit he plainly bracketed agnosticism with beer and skittles  keatsjohn keats sirand shelley were his favourite bards i cannot remember if i tried him with rossetti but i know his taste to a hair and if ever i did he must have doted on that author what took him was a richness in the speech he loved the exotic the unexpected word the moving cadence of a phrase a vague sense of emotion about nothing in the very letters of the alphabet the romance of language his honest head was very nearly empty his intellect like a childs and when he read his favourite authors he can almost never have understood what he was reading yet the taste was not only genuine it was exclusive i tried in vain to offer him novels he would none of them he cared for nothing but romantic language that he could not understand the case may be commoner than we suppose i am reminded of a lad who was laid in the next cot to a friend of mine in a public hospital and who was no sooner installed than he sent out perhaps with his last pence for a cheap shakespeare my friend pricked up his ears fell at once in talk with his new neighbour and was ready when the book arrived to make a singular discovery for this lover of great literature understood not one sentence out of twelve and his favourite part was that of which he understood the leastthe inimitable mouthfilling rodomontade of the ghost in hamlet it was a bright day in hospital when my friend expounded the sense of this beloved jargon a task for which i am willing to believe my friend was very fit though i can never regard it as an easy one i know indeed a point or two on which i would gladly question mr shakespeare that lover of big words could he revisit the glimpses of the moon or could i myself climb backward to the spacious days of elizabeth but in the second case i should most likely pretermit these questionings and take my place instead in the pit at the blackfriars to hear the actor in his favourite part playing up to mr burbage and rolling outas i seem to hear himwith a ponderous gusto    unhouseld disappointed unaneld  what a pleasant chance if we could go there in a party and what a surprise for mr burbage when the ghost received the honours of the evening  as for my old soldier like mr burbage and mr shakespeare he is long since dead and now lies buried i suppose and nameless and quite forgotten in some poor city graveyardbut not for me you brave heart have you been buried for me you are still afoot tasting the sun and air and striding southward by the groves of comiston and beside the hermitage of braid by the hunters tryst and where the curlews and plovers cry around fairmilehead i see and hear you stalwartly carrying your deadly sickness cheerfully discoursing of uncomprehended poets     ii  the thought of the old soldier recalls that of another tramp his counterpart this was a little lean and fiery man with the eyes of a dog and the face of a gipsy whom i found one morning encamped with his wife and children and his grinders wheel beside the burn of kinnaird to this beloved dell i went at that time daily and daily the knifegrinder and i for as long as his tent continued pleasantly to interrupt my little wilderness sat on two stones and smoked and plucked grass and talked to the tune of the brown water his children were mere whelps they fought and bit among the fern like vermin his wife was a mere squaw i saw her gather brush and tend the kettle but she never ventured to address her lord while i was present the tent was a mere gipsy hovel like a sty for pigs but the grinder himself had the fine selfsufficiency and grave politeness of the hunter and the savage he did me the honours of this dell which had been mine but the day before took me far into the secrets of his life and used me i am proud to remember as a friend  like my old soldier he was far gone in the national complaint unlike him he had a vulgar taste in letters scarce flying higher than the story papers probably finding no difference certainly seeking none between tannahill and burns his noblest thoughts whether of poetry or music adequately embodied in that somewhat obvious ditty     will ye gang lassie gang     to the braes o balquhidder  which is indeed apt to echo in the ears of scottish children and to him in view of his experience must have found a special directness of address but if he had no fine sense of poetry in letters he felt with a deep joy the poetry of life you should have heard him speak of what he loved of the tent pitched beside the talking water of the stars overhead at night of the blest return of morning the peep of day over the moors the awaking birds among the birches how he abhorred the long winter shut in cities and with what delight at the return of the spring he once more pitched his camp in the living outofdoors but we were a pair of tramps and to you who are doubtless sedentary and a consistent firstclass passenger in life he would scarce have laid himself so opento you he might have been content to tell his story of a ghostthat of a buccaneer with his pistols as he livedwhom he had once encountered in a seaside cave near buckie and that would have been enough for that would have shown you the mettle of the man here was a piece of experience solidly and livingly built up in words here was a story created teres atque rotundus  and to think of the old soldier that lover of the literary bards he had visited stranger spots than any seaside cave encountered men more terrible than any spirit done and dared and suffered in that incredible unsung epic of the mutiny war played his part with the field force of delhi beleaguering and beleaguered shared in that enduring savage anger and contempt of death and decency that for long months together bedevild and inspired the army was hurled to and fro in the battlesmoke of the assault was there perhaps where nicholson fell was there when the attacking column with hell upon every side found the soldiers enemystrong drink and the lives of tens of thousands trembled in the scale and the fate of the flag of england staggered and of all this he had no more to say than hot work sir or the army suffered a great deal sir or i believe general wilson sir was not very highly thought of in the papers his life was naught to him the vivid pages of experience quite blank in words his pleasure laymelodious agitated wordsprinted words about that which he had never seen and was connatally incapable of comprehending we have here two temperaments face to face both untrained unsophisticated surprised we may say in the egg both boldly characteredthat of the artist the lover and artificer of words that of the maker the seeër the lover and forger of experience if the one had a daughter and the other had a son and these married might not some illustrious writer count descent from the beggarsoldier and the needy knifegrinder     iii  every one lives by selling something whatever be his right to it the burglar sells at the same time his own skill and courage and my silver plate the whole at the most moderate figure to a jew receiver the bandit sells the traveller an article of prime necessity that travellers life and as for the old soldier who stands for central mark to my capricious figures of eight he dealt in a specialty for he was the only beggar in the world who ever gave me pleasure for my money he had learned a school of manners in the barracks and had the sense to cling to it accosting strangers with a regimental freedom thanking patrons with a merely regimental difference sparing you at once the tragedy of his position and the embarrassment of yours there was not one hint about him of the beggars emphasis the outburst of revolting gratitude the rant and cant the god bless you kind kind gentleman which insults the smallness of your alms by disproportionate vehemence which is so notably false which would be so unbearable if it were true i am sometimes tempted to suppose this reading of the beggars part a survival of the old days when shakespeare was intoned upon the stage and mourners keened beside the deathbed to think that we cannot now accept these strong emotions unless they be uttered in the just note of life nor save in the pulpit endure these gross conventions they wound us i am tempted to say like mockery the high voice of keening as it yet lingers on strikes in the face of sorrow like a buffet and the rant and cant of the staled beggar stirs in us a shudder of disgust but the fact disproves these amateur opinions the beggar lives by his knowledge of the average man he knows what he is about when he bandages his head and hires and drugs a babe and poisons life with poor mary ann or long long ago he knows what he is about when he loads the critical ear and sickens the nice conscience with intolerable thanks they know what they are about he and his crew when they pervade the slums of cities ghastly parodies of suffering hateful parodies of gratitude this trade can scarce be called an imposition it has been so blown upon with exposures it flaunts its fraudulence so nakedly we pay them as we pay those who show us in huge exaggeration the monsters of our drinkingwater or those who daily predict the fall of britain we pay them for the pain they inflict pay them and wince and hurry on and truly there is nothing that can shake the conscience like a beggars thanks and that polity in which such protestations can be purchased for a shilling seems no scene for an honest man  are there then we may be asked no genuine beggars and the answer is not one my old soldier was a humbug like the rest his ragged boots were in the stage phrase properties whole boots were given him again and again and always gladly accepted and the next day there he was on the road as usual with toes exposed his boots were his method they were the mans trade without his boots he would have starved he did not live by charity but by appealing to a gross taste in the public which loves the limelight on the actors face and the toes out of the beggars boots there is a true poverty which no one sees a false and merely mimetic poverty which usurps its place and dress and lives and above all drinks on the fruits of the usurpation the true poverty does not go into the streets the banker may rest assured he has never put a penny in its hand the selfrespecting poor beg from each other never from the rich to live in the frockcoated ranks of life to hear canting scenes of gratitude rehearsed for twopence a man might suppose that giving was a thing gone out of fashion yet it goes forward on a scale so great as to fill me with surprise in the houses of the working classes all day long there will be a foot upon the stair all day long there will be a knocking at the doors beggars come beggars go without stint hardly with intermission from morning till night and meanwhile in the same city and but a few streets off the castles of the rich stand unsummoned get the tale of any honest tramp you will find it was always the poor who helped him get the truth from any workman who has met misfortunes it was always next door that he would go for help or only with such exceptions as are said to prove a rule look at the course of the mimetic beggar it is through the poor quarters that he trails his passage showing his bandages to every window piercing even to the attics with his nasal song here is a remarkable state of things in our christian commonwealths that the poor only should be asked to give     iv  there is a pleasant tale of some worthless phrasing frenchman who was taxed with ingratitude il faut savoir garder lindépendance du coeur cried he i own i feel with him gratitude without familiarity gratitude otherwise than as a nameless element in a friendship is a thing so near to hatred that i do not care to split the difference until i find a man who is pleased to receive obligations i shall continue to question the tact of those who are eager to confer them what an art it is to give even to our nearest friends and what a test of manners to receive how upon either side we smuggle away the obligation blushing for each other how bluff and dull we make the giver how hasty how falsely cheerful the receiver and yet an act of such difficulty and distress between near friends it is supposed we can perform to a total stranger and leave the man transfixed with grateful emotions the last thing you can do to a man is to burthen him with an obligation and it is what we propose to begin with but let us not be deceived unless he is totally degraded to his trade anger jars in his inside and he grates his teeth at our gratuity  we should wipe two words from our vocabulary gratitude and charity in real life help is given out of friendship or it is not valued it is received from the hand of friendship or it is resented we are all too proud to take a naked gift we must seem to pay it if in nothing else then with the delights of our society here then is the pitiful fix of the rich man here is that needles eye in which he stuck already in the days of christ and still sticks today firmer if possible than ever that he has the money and lacks the love which should make his money acceptable here and now just as of old in palestine he has the rich to dinner it is with the rich that he takes his pleasure and when his turn comes to be charitable he looks in vain for a recipient his friends are not poor they do not want the poor are not his friends they will not take to whom is he to give where to findnote this phrasethe deserving poor charity is what they call centralised offices are hired societies founded with secretaries paid or unpaid the hunt of the deserving poor goes merrily forward i think it will take more than a merely human secretary to disinter that character what a class that is to be in want from no fault of its own and yet greedily eager to receive from strangers and to be quite respectable and at the same time quite devoid of selfrespect and play the most delicate part of friendship and yet never be seen and wear the form of man and yet fly in the face of all the laws of human natureand all this in the hope of getting a bellygod burgess through a needles eye oh let him stick by all means and let his polity tumble in the dust and let his epitaph and all his literature of which my own works begin to form no inconsiderable part be abolished even from the history of man for a fool of this monstrosity of dulness there can be no salvation and the fool who looked for the elixir of life was an angel of reason to the fool who looks for the deserving poor     v  and yet there is one course which the unfortunate gentleman may take he may subscribe to pay the taxes there were the true charity impartial and impersonal cumbering none with obligation helping all there were a destination for loveless gifts there were the way to reach the pocket of the deserving poor and yet save the time of secretaries but alas there is no colour of romance in such a course and people nowhere demand the picturesque so much as in their virtues     v  the lanternbearers    i   these boys congregated every autumn about a certain easterly fishervillage where they tasted in a high degree the glory of existence the place was created seemingly on purpose for the diversion of young gentlemen a street or two of houses mostly red and many of them tiled a number of fine trees clustered about the manse and the kirkyard and turning the chief street into a shady alley many little gardens more than usually bright with flowers nets adrying and fisherwives scolding in the backward parts a smell of fish a genial smell of seaweed whiffs of blowing sand at the streetcorners shops with golfballs and bottled lollipops another shop with penny pickwicks that remarkable cigar and the london journal dear to me for its startling pictures and a few novels dear for their suggestive names such as well as memory serves me were the ingredients of the town these you are to conceive posted on a spit between two sandy bays and sparsely flanked with villasenough for the boys to lodge in with their subsidiary parents not enough not yet enough to cocknify the scene a haven in the rocks in front in front of that a file of grey islets to the left endless links and sand wreaths a wilderness of hidingholes alive with popping rabbits and soaring gulls to the right a range of seaward crags one rugged brow beyond another the ruins of a mighty and ancient fortress on the brink of one coves betweennow charmed into sunshine quiet now whistling with wind and clamorous with bursting surges the dens and sheltered hollows redolent of thyme and southernwood the air at the cliffs edge brisk and clean and pungent of the seain front of all the bass rock tilted seaward like a doubtful bather the surf ringing it with white the solangeese hanging round its summit like a great and glittering smoke this choice piece of seaboard was sacred besides to the wrecker and the bass in the eye of fancy still flew the colours of king james and in the ear of fancy the arches of tantallon still rang with horseshoe iron and echoed to the commands of bellthecat  there was nothing to mar your days if you were a boy summering in that part but the embarrassment of pleasure you might golf if you wanted but i seem to have been better employed you might secrete yourself in the ladys walk a certain sunless dingle of elders all mossed over by the damp as green as grass and dotted here and there by the streamside with roofless walls the cold homes of anchorites to fit themselves for life and with a special eye to acquire the art of smoking it was even common for the boys to harbour there and you might have seen a single penny pickwick honestly shared in lengths with a blunt knife bestrew the glen with these apprentices again you might join our fishing parties where we sat perched as thick as solangeese a covey of little anglers boy and girl angling over each others heads to the much entanglement of lines and loss of podleys and consequent shrill recriminationshrill as the geese themselves indeed had that been all you might have done this often but though fishing be a fine pastime the podley is scarce to be regarded as a dainty for the table and it was a point of honour that a boy should eat all that he had taken or again you might climb the law where the whales jawbone stood landmark in the buzzing wind and behold the face of many counties and the smoke and spires of many towns and the sails of distant ships you might bathe now in the flaws of fine weather that we pathetically call our summer now in a gale of wind with the sand scourging your bare hide your clothes thrashing abroad from underneath their guardian stone the froth of the great breakers casting you headlong ere it had drowned your knees or you might explore the tidal rocks above all in the ebb of springs when the very roots of the hills were for the nonce discovered following my leader from one group to another groping in slippery tangle for the wreck of ships wading in pools after the abominable creatures of the sea and ever with an eye cast backward on the march of the tide and the menaced line of your retreat and then you might go crusoeing a word that covers all extempore eating in the open air digging perhaps a house under the margin of the links kindling a fire of the seaware and cooking apples thereif they were truly apples for i sometimes suppose the merchant must have played us off with some inferior and quite local fruit capable of resolving in the neighbourhood of fire into mere sand and smoke and iodine or perhaps pushing to tantallon you might lunch on sandwiches and visions in the grassy court while the wind hummed in the crumbling turrets or clambering along the coast eat geans17 the worst i must suppose in christendom from an adventurous gean tree that had taken root under a cliff where it was shaken with an ague of east wind and silvered after gales with salt and grew so foreign among its bleak surroundings that to eat of its produce was an adventure in itself  there are mingled some dismal memories with so many that were joyous of the fisherwife for instance who had cut her throat at canty bay and of how i ran with the other children to the top of the quadrant and beheld a posse of silent people escorting a cart and on the cart bound in a chair her throat bandaged and the bandage all bloodyhorrorthe fisherwife herself who continued thenceforth to hagride my thoughts and even today as i recall the scene darkens daylight she was lodged in the little old gaol in the chief street but whether or no she died there with a wise terror of the worst i never inquired she had been tippling it was but a dingy tragedy and it seems strange and hard that after all these years the poor crazy sinner should be still pilloried on her cart in the scrapbook of my memory nor shall i readily forget a certain house in the quadrant where a visitor died and a dark old woman continued to dwell alone with the dead body nor how this old woman conceived a hatred to myself and one of my cousins and in the dread hour of the dusk as we were clambering on the gardenwalls opened a window in that house of mortality and cursed us in a shrill voice and with a marrowy choice of language it was a pair of very colourless urchins that fled down the lane from this remarkable experience but i recall with a more doubtful sentiment compounded out of fear and exultation the coil of equinoctial tempests trumpeting squalls scouring flaws of rain the boats with their reefed lugsails scudding for the harbour mouth where danger lay for it was hard to make when the wind had any east in it the wives clustered with blowing shawls at the pierhead where if fate was against them they might see boat and husband and sonstheir whole wealth and their whole familyengulfed under their eyes and what i saw but once a troop of neighbours forcing such an unfortunate homeward and she squalling and battling in their midst a figure scarcely human a tragic mænad  these are things that i recall with interest but what my memory dwells upon the most i have been all this while withholding it was a sport peculiar to the place and indeed to a week or so of our two months holiday there maybe it still flourishes in its native spot for boys and their pastimes are swayed by periodic forces inscrutable to man so that tops and marbles reappear in their due season regular like the sun and moon and the harmless art of knucklebones has seen the fall of the roman empire and the rise of the united states it may still flourish in its native spot but nowhere else i am persuaded for i tried myself to introduce it on tweedside and was defeated lamentably its charm being quite local like a country wine that cannot be exported  the idle manner of it was this  toward the end of september when schooltime was drawing near and the nights were already black we would begin to sally from our respective villas each equipped with a tin bullseye lantern the thing was so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce of great britain and the grocers about the due time began to garnish their windows with our particular brand of luminary we wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket belt and over them such was the rigour of the game a buttoned topcoat they smelled noisomely of blistered tin they never burned aright though they would always burn our fingers their use was naught the pleasure of them merely fanciful and yet a boy with a bullseye under his topcoat asked for nothing more the fishermen used lanterns about their boats and it was from them i suppose that we had got the hint but theirs were not bullseyes nor did we ever play at being fishermen the police carried them at their belts and we had plainly copied them in that yet we did not pretend to be policemen burglars indeed we may have had some haunting thoughts of and we had certainly an eye to past ages when lanterns were more common and to certain storybooks in which we had found them to figure very largely but take it for all in all the pleasure of the thing was substantive and to be a boy with a bullseye under his topcoat was good enough for us  when two of these asses met there would be an anxious have you got your lantern and a gratified yes that was the shibboleth and very needful too for as it was the rule to keep our glory contained none could recognise a lanternbearer unless like the polecat by the smell four or five would sometimes climb into the belly of a tenman lugger with nothing but the thwarts above themfor the cabin was usually lockedor choose out some hollow of the links where the wind might whistle overhead there the coats would be unbuttoned and the bullseyes discovered and in the chequering glimmer under the huge windy hall of the night and cheered by a rich steam of toasting tinware these fortunate young gentlemen would crouch together in the cold sand of the links or on the scaly bilges of the fishingboat and delight themselves with inappropriate talk woe is me that i may not give some specimenssome of their foresights of life or deep inquiries into the rudiments of man and nature these were so fiery and so innocent they were so richly silly so romantically young but the talk at any rate was but a condiment and these gatherings themselves only accidents in the career of the lanternbearer the essence of this bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night the slide shut the topcoat buttoned not a ray escaping whether to conduct your footsteps or to make your glory public a mere pillar of darkness in the dark and all the while deep down in the privacy of your fools heart to know you had a bullseye at your belt and to exult and sing over the knowledge     ii  it is said that a poet has died young in the breast of the most stolid it may be contended rather that this somewhat minor bard in almost every case survives and is the spice of life to his possessor justice is not done to the versatility and the unplumbed childishness of mans imagination his life from without may seem but a rude mound of mud there will be some golden chamber at the heart of it in which he dwells delighted and for as dark as his pathway seems to the observer he will have some kind of a bullseye at his belt  it would be hard to pick out a career more cheerless than that of dancer the miser as he figures in the old bailey reports a prey to the most sordid persecutions the butt of his neighbourhood betrayed by his hired man his house beleaguered by the impish schoolboy and he himself grinding and fuming and impotently fleeing to the law against these pinpricks you marvel at first that any one should willingly prolong a life so destitute of charm and dignity and then you call to memory that had he chosen had he ceased to be a miser he could have been freed at once from these trials and might have built himself a castle and gone escorted by a squadron for the love of more recondite joys which we cannot estimate which it may be we should envy the man had willingly forgone both comfort and consideration his mind to him a kingdom was and sure enough digging into that mind which seems at first a dustheap we unearth some priceless jewels for dancer must have had the love of power and the disdain of using it a noble character in itself disdain of many pleasures a chief part of what is commonly called wisdom disdain of the inevitable end that finest trait of mankind scorn of mens opinions another element of virtue and at the back of all a conscience just like yours and mine whining like a cur swindling like a thimblerigger but still pointing there or thereabout to some conventional standard here were a cabinet portrait to which hawthorne perhaps had done justice and yet not hawthorne either for he was mildly minded and it lay not in him to create for us that throb of the misers pulse his fretful energy of gusto his vast arms of ambition clutching in he knows not what insatiable insane a god with a muckrake thus at least looking in the bosom of the miser consideration detects the poet in the full tide of life with more indeed of the poetic fire than usually goes to epics and tracing that mean man about his cold hearth and to and fro in his discomfortable house spies within him a blazing bonfire of delight and so with others who do not live by bread alone but by some cherished and perhaps fantastic pleasure who are meat salesmen to the external eye and possibly to themselves are shakespeares napoleons or beethovens who have not one virtue to rub against another in the field of active life and yet perhaps in the life of contemplation sit with the saints we see them on the street and we can count their buttons but heaven knows in what they pride themselves heaven knows where they have set their treasure  there is one fable that touches very near the quick of life the fable of the monk who passed into the woods heard a bird break into song hearkened for a trill or two and found himself on his return a stranger at his convent gates for he had been absent fifty years and of all his comrades there survived but one to recognise him it is not only in the woods that this enchanter carols though perhaps he is native there he sings in the most doleful places the miser hears him and chuckles and the days are moments with no more apparatus than an illsmelling lantern i have evoked him on the naked links all life that is not merely mechanical is spun out of two strands seeking for that bird and hearing him and it is just this that makes life so hard to value and the delight of each so incommunicable and just a knowledge of this and a remembrance of those fortunate hours in which the bird has sung to us that fills us with such wonder when we turn the pages of the realist there to be sure we find a picture of life in so far as it consists of mud and of old iron cheap desires and cheap fears that which we are ashamed to remember and that which we are careless whether we forget but of the note of that timedevouring nightingale we hear no news  the case of these writers of romance is most obscure they have been boys and youths they have lingered outside the window of the beloved who was then most probably writing to some one else they have sat before a sheet of paper and felt themselves mere continents of congested poetry not one line of which would flow they have walked alone in the woods they have walked in cities under the countless lamps they have been to sea they have hated they have feared they have longed to knife a man and maybe done it the wild taste of life has stung their palate or if you deny them all the rest one pleasure at least they have tasted to the fulltheir books are there to prove itthe keen pleasure of successful literary composition and yet they fill the globe with volumes whose cleverness inspires me with despairing admiration and whose consistent falsity to all i care to call existence with despairing wrath if i had no better hope than to continue to revolve among the dreary and petty businesses and to be moved by the paltry hopes and fears with which they surround and animate their heroes i declare i would die now but there has never an hour of mine gone quite so dully yet if it were spent waiting at a railway junction i would have some scattering thoughts i could count some grains of memory compared to which the whole of one of these romances seems but dross  these writers would retort if i take them properly that this was very true that it was the same with themselves and other persons of what they call the artistic temperament that in this we were exceptional and should apparently be ashamed of ourselves but that our works must deal exclusively with what they call the average man who was a prodigious dull fellow and quite dead to all but the paltriest considerations i accept the issue we can only know others by ourselves the artistic temperament a plague on the expression does not make us different from our fellowmen or it would make us incapable of writing novels and the average man a murrain on the word is just like you and me or he would not be average it was whitman who stamped a kind of birmingham sacredness upon the latter phrase but whitman knew very well and showed very nobly that the average man was full of joys and full of poetry of his own and this harping on lifes dulness and mans meanness is a loud profession of incompetence it is one of two things the cry of the blind eye i cannot see or the complaint of the dumb tongue i cannot utter to draw a life without delights is to prove i have not realised it to picture a man without some sort of poetrywell it goes near to prove my case for it shows an author may have little enough to see dancer only as a dirty old smallminded impotently fuming man in a dirty house besieged by harrow boys and probably beset by small attorneys is to show myself as keen an observer as  the harrow boys but these young gentlemen with a more becoming modesty were content to pluck dancer by the coattails they did not suppose they had surprised his secret or could put him living in a book and it is there my error would have lain or say that in the same romancei continue to call these books romances in the hope of giving painsay that in the same romance which now begins really to take shape i should leave to speak of dancer and follow instead the harrow boys and say that i came on some such business as that of my lanternbearers on the links and described the boys as very cold spat upon by flurries of rain and drearily surrounded all of which they were and their talk as silly and indecent which it certainly was i might upon these lines and had i zolas genius turn out in a page or so a gem of literary art render the lanternlight with the touches of a master and lay on the indecency with the ungrudging hand of love and when all was done what a triumph would my picture be of shallowness and dulness how it would have missed the point how it would have belied the boys to the ear of the stenographer the talk is merely silly and indecent but ask the boys themselves and they are discussing as it is highly proper they should the possibilities of existence to the eye of the observer they are wet and cold and drearily surrounded but ask themselves and they are in the heaven of a recondite pleasure the ground of which is an illsmelling lantern     iii  for to repeat the ground of a mans joy is often hard to hit it may hinge at times upon a mere accessory like the lantern it may reside like dancers in the mysterious inwards of psychology it may consist with perpetual failure and find exercise in the continued chase it has so little bond with externals such as the observer scribbles in his notebook that it may even touch them not and the mans true life for which he consents to live lie altogether in the field of fancy the clergyman in his spare hours may be winning battles the farmer sailing ships the banker reaping triumph in the arts all leading another life plying another trade from that they chose like the poets housebuilder who after all is cased in stone     by his fireside as impotent fancy prompts     rebuilds it to his liking  in such a case the poetry runs underground the observer poor soul with his documents is all abroad for to look at the man is but to court deception we shall see the trunk from which he draws his nourishment but he himself is above and abroad in the green dome of foliage hummed through by winds and nested in by nightingales and the true realism were that of the poets to climb up after him like a squirrel and catch some glimpse of the heaven for which he lives and the true realism always and everywhere is that of the poets to find out where joy resides and give it a voice far beyond singing  for to miss the joy is to miss all in the joy of the actors lies the sense of any action that is the explanation that the excuse to one who has not the secret of the lanterns the scene upon the links is meaningless and hence the haunting and truly spectral unreality of realistic books hence when we read the english realists the incredulous wonder with which we observe the heros constancy under the submerging tide of dulness and how he bears up with his jibbing sweetheart and endures the chatter of idiot girls and stands by his whole unfeatured wilderness of an existence instead of seeking relief in drink or foreign travel hence in the french in that meatmarket of middleaged sensuality the disgusted surprise with which we see the hero drift sidelong and practically quite untempted into every description of misconduct and dishonour in each we miss the personal poetry the enchanted atmosphere that rainbow work of fancy that clothes what is naked and seems to ennoble what is base in each life falls dead like dough instead of soaring away like a balloon into the colours of the sunset each is true each inconceivable for no man lives in external truth among salts and acids but in the warm phantasmagoric chamber of his brain with the painted windows and the storied walls  of this falsity we have had a recent example from a man who knows far bettertolstois powers of darkness here is a piece full of force and truth yet quite untrue for before mikita was led into so dire a situation he was tempted and temptations are beautiful at least in part and a work which dwells on the ugliness of crime and gives no hint of any loveliness in the temptation sins against the modesty of life and even when tolstoi writes it sinks to melodrama the peasants are not understood they saw their life in fairer colours even the deaf girl was clothed in poetry for mikita or he had never fallen and so once again even an old bailey melodrama without some brightness of poetry and lustre of existence falls into the inconceivable and ranks with fairy tales     iv  in nobler books we are moved with something like the emotions of life and this emotion is very variously provoked we are so moved when levine labours on the field when andré sinks beyond emotion when richard feverel and lucy desborough meet beside the river when antony not cowardly puts off his helmet when kent has infinite pity on the dying lear when in dostoieffskys despised and rejected the uncomplaining hero drains his cup of suffering and virtue these are notes that please the great heart of man not only love and the fields and the bright face of danger but sacrifice and death and unmerited suffering humbly supported touch in us the vein of the poetic we love to think of them we long to try them we are humbly hopeful that we may prove heroes also  we have heard perhaps too much of lesser matters here is the door here is the open air    itur in antiquam silvam   footnote    17 wild cherries     later essays     later essays  i  fontainebleau  village communities of painters    i   the charm of fontainebleau is a thing apart it is a place that people love even more than they admire the vigorous forest air the silence the majestic avenues of highway the wilderness of tumbled boulders the great age and dignity of certain grovesthese are but ingredients they are not the secret of the philtre the place is sanative the air the light the perfumes and the shapes of things concord in happy harmony the artist may be idle and not fear the blues he may dally with his life mirth lyric mirth and a vivacious classical contentment are of the very essence of the better kind of art and these in that most smiling forest he has the chance to learn or to remember even on the plain of bière where the angelus of millet still tolls upon the ear of fancy a larger air a higher heaven something ancient and healthy in the face of nature purify the mind alike from dulness and hysteria there is no place where the young are more gladly conscious of their youth or the old better contented with their age  the fact of its great and special beauty further recommends this country to the artist the field was chosen by men in whose blood there still raced some of the gleeful or solemn exultation of great artmillet who loved dignity like michelangelo rousseau whose modern brush was dipped in the glamour of the ancients it was chosen before the day of that strange turn in the history of art of which we now perceive the culmination in impressionistic tales and picturesthat voluntary aversion of the eye from all speciously strong and beautiful effectsthat disinterested love of dulness which has set so many peter bells to paint the riverside primrose it was then chosen for its proximity to paris and for the same cause and by the force of tradition the painter of today continues to inhabit and to paint it there is in france scenery incomparable for romance and harmony provence and the valley of the rhone from vienne to tarascon are one succession of masterpieces waiting for the brush the beauty is not merely beauty it tells besides a tale to the imagination and surprises while it charms here you shall see castellated towns that would befit the scenery of dreamland streets that glow with colour like cathedral windows hills of the most exquisite proportions flowers of every precious colour growing thick like grass all these by the grace of railway travel are brought to the very door of the modern painter yet he does not seek them he remains faithful to fontainebleau to the eternal bridge of grez to the wateringpot cascade in cernay valley even fontainebleau was chosen for him even in fontainebleau he shrinks from what is sharply charactered but one thing at least is certain whatever he may choose to paint and in whatever manner it is good for the artist to dwell among graceful shapes fontainebleau if it be but quiet scenery is classically graceful and though the student may look for different qualities this quality silently present will educate his hand and eye  but before all its other advantagescharm loveliness or proximity to pariscomes the great fact that it is already colonised the institution of a painters colony is a work of time and tact the population must be conquered the innkeeper has to be taught and he soon learns the lesson of unlimited credit he must be taught to welcome as a favoured guest a young gentleman in a very greasy coat and with little baggage beyond a box of colours and a canvas and he must learn to preserve his faith in customers who will eat heartily and drink of the best borrow money to buy tobacco and perhaps not pay a stiver for a year a colour merchant has next to be attracted a certain vogue must be given to the place lest the painter most gregarious of animals should find himself alone and no sooner are these first difficulties overcome than fresh perils spring up upon the other side and the bourgeois and the tourist are knocking at the gate this is the crucial moment for the colony if these intruders gain a footing they not only banish freedom and amenity pretty soon by means of their long purses they will have undone the education of the innkeeper prices will rise and credit shorten and the poor painter must fare farther on and find another hamlet not here o apollo will become his song thus trouville and the other day st raphael were lost to the arts curious and not always edifying are the shifts that the french student uses to defend his lair like the cuttlefish he must sometimes blacken the waters of his chosen pool but at such a time and for so practical a purpose mrs grundy must allow him licence where his own purse and credit are not threatened he will do the honours of his village generously any artist is made welcome through whatever medium he may seek expression science is respected even the idler if he prove as he so rarely does a gentleman will soon begin to find himself at home and when that essentially modern creature the english or american girlstudent began to walk calmly into his favourite inns as if into a drawingroom at home the french painter owned himself defenceless he submitted or he fled his french respectability quite as precise as ours though covering different provinces of life recoiled aghast before the innovation but the girls were painters there was nothing to be done and barbizon when i last saw it and for the time at least was practically ceded to the fair invader paterfamilias on the other hand the common tourist the holiday shopman and the cheap young gentleman upon the spree he hounded from his villages with every circumstance of contumely  this purely artistic society is excellent for the young artist the lads are mostly fools they hold the latest orthodoxy in its crudeness they are at that stage of education for the most part when a man is too much occupied with style to be aware of the necessity for any matter and this above all for the englishman is excellent to work grossly at the trade to forget sentiment to think of his material and nothing else is for a while at least the kings highway of progress here in england too many painters and writers dwell dispersed unshielded among the intelligent bourgeois these when they are not merely indifferent prate to him about the lofty aims and moral influence of art and this is the lads ruin for art is first of all and last of all a trade the love of words and not a desire to publish new discoveries the love of form and not a novel reading of historical events mark the vocation of the writer and the painter the arabesque properly speaking and even in literature is the first fancy of the artist he first plays with his material as a child plays with a kaleidoscope and he is already in a second stage when he begins to use his pretty counters for the end of representation in that he must pause long and toil faithfully that is his apprenticeship and it is only the few who will really grow beyond it and go forward fully equipped to do the business of real artto give life to abstractions and significance and charm to facts in the meanwhile let him dwell much among his fellowcraftsmen they alone can take a serious interest in the childish tasks and pitiful successes of these years they alone can behold with equanimity this fingering of the dumb keyboard this polishing of empty sentences this dull and literal painting of dull and insignificant subjects outsiders will spur him on they will say why do you not write a great book paint a great picture if his guardian angel fail him they may even persuade him to the attempt and ten to one his hand is coarsened and his style falsified for life  and this brings me to a warning the life of the apprentice to any art is both unstrained and pleasing it is strewn with small successes in the midst of a career of failure patiently supported the heaviest scholar is conscious of a certain progress and if he come not appreciably nearer to the art of shakespeare grows letterperfect in the domain of ab ab but the time comes when a man should cease prelusory gymnastic stand up put a violence upon his will and for better or worse begin the business of creation this evil day there is a tendency continually to postpone above all with painters they have made so many studies that it has become a habit they make more the walls of exhibitions blush with them and death finds these aged students still busy with their hornbook this class of man finds a congenial home in artist villages in the slang of the english colony at barbizon we used to call them snoozers continual returns to the city the society of men further advanced the study of great works a sense of humour or if such a thing is to be had a little religion or philosophy are the means of treatment it will be time enough to think of curing the malady after it has been caught for to catch it is the very thing for which you seek that dreamland of the painters village snoozing is a part of the artistic education and the rudiments must be learned stupidly all else being forgotten as if they were an object in themselves  lastly there is something or there seems to be something in the very air of france that communicates the love of style precision clarity the cleanly and crafty employment of material a grace in the handling apart from any value in the thought seem to be acquired by the mere residence or if not acquired become at least the more appreciated the air of paris is alive with this technical inspiration and to leave that airy city and awake next day upon the borders of the forest is but to change externals the same spirit of dexterity and finish breathes from the long alleys and the lofty groves from the wildernesses that are still pretty in their confusion and the great plain that contrives to be decorative in its emptiness     ii  in spite of its really considerable extent the forest of fontainebleau is hardly anywhere tedious i know the whole western side of it with what i suppose i may call thoroughness well enough at least to testify that there is no square mile without some special character and charm such quarters for instance as the long rocher the basbréau and the reine blanche might be a hundred miles apart they have scarce a point in common beyond the silence of the birds the two last are really conterminous and in both are tall and ancient trees that have outlived a thousand political vicissitudes but in the one the great oaks prosper placidly upon an even floor they beshadow a great field and the air and the light are very free below their stretching boughs in the other the trees find difficult footing castles of white rock lie tumbled one upon another the foot slips the crooked viper slumbers the moss clings in the crevice and above it all the great beech goes spiring and casting forth her arms and with a grace beyond church architecture canopies this rugged chaos meanwhile dividing the two cantons the broad white causeway of the paris road runs in an avenue a road conceived for pageantry and for triumphal marches an avenue for an army but its days of glory over it now lies grilling in the sun between cool groves and only at intervals the vehicle of the cruising tourist is seen far away and faintly audible along its ample sweep a little upon one side and you find a district of sand and birch and boulder a little upon the other lies the valley of apremont all juniper and heather and close beyond that you may walk into a zone of pine trees so artfully are the ingredients mingled nor must it be forgotten that in all this part you come continually forth upon a hilltop and behold the plain northward and westward like an unrefulgent sea nor that all day long the shadows keep changing and at last to the red fires of sunset night succeeds and with the night a new forest full of whisper gloom and fragrance there are few things more renovating than to leave paris the lamplit arches of the carrousel and the long alignment of the glittering streets and to bathe the senses in this fragrant darkness of the wood  in this continual variety the mind is kept vividly alive it is a changeful place to paint a stirring place to live in as fast as your foot carries you you pass from scene to scene each vigorously painted in the colours of the sun each endeared by that hereditary spell of forests on the mind of man who still remembers and salutes the ancient refuge of his race  and yet the forest has been civilised throughout the most savage corners bear a name and have been cherished like antiquities in the most remote nature has prepared and balanced her effects as if with conscious art and man with his guiding arrows of blue paint has countersigned the picture after your farthest wandering you are never surprised to come forth upon the vast avenue of highway to strike the centre point of branching alleys or to find the aqueduct trailing thousandfooted through the brush it is not a wilderness it is rather a preserve and fitly enough the centre of the maze is not a hermits cavern in the midst a little mirthful town lies sunlit humming with the business of pleasure and the palace breathing distinction and peopled by historic names stands smokeless among gardens  perhaps the last attempt at savage life was that of the harmless humbug who called himself the hermit in a great tree close by the highroad he had built himself a little cabin after the manner of the swiss family robinson thither he mounted at night by the romantic aid of a rope ladder and if dirt be any proof of sincerity the man was savage as a sioux i had the pleasure of his acquaintance he appeared grossly stupid not in his perfect wits and interested in nothing but small change for that he had a great avidity in the course of time he proved to be a chickenstealer and vanished from his perch and perhaps from the first he was no true votary of forest freedom but an ingenious theatricallyminded beggar and his cabin in the tree was only stockintrade to beg withal the choice of his position would seem to indicate so much for if in the forest there are no places still to be discovered there are many that have been forgotten and that lie unvisited there to be sure are the blue arrows waiting to reconduct you now blazed upon a tree now posted in the corner of a rock but your security from interruption is complete you might camp for weeks if there were only water and not a soul suspect your presence and if i may suppose the reader to have committed some great crime and come to me for aid i think i could still find my way to a small cavern fitted with a hearth and chimney where he might lie perfectly concealed a confederate landscapepainter might daily supply him with food for water he would have to make a nightly tramp as far as to the nearest pond and at last when the hue and cry began to blow over he might get gently on the train at some side station work round by a series of junctions and be quietly captured at the frontier  thus fontainebleau although it is truly but a pleasureground and although in favourable weather and in the more celebrated quarters it literally buzzes with the tourist yet has some of the immunities and offers some of the repose of natural forests and the solitary although he must return at night to his frequented inn may yet pass the day with his own thoughts in the companionable silence of the trees the demands of the imagination vary some can be alone in a back garden looked upon by windows others like the ostrich are content with a solitude that meets the eye and others again expand in fancy to the very borders of their desert and are irritably conscious of a hunters camp in an adjacent county to these last of course fontainebleau will seem but an extended teagarden a rosherville on a byday but to the plain man it offers solitude an excellent thing in itself and a good whet for company     iii  i was for some time a consistent barbizonian et ego in arcadia vixi it was a pleasant season and that noiseless hamlet lying close among the borders of the wood is for me as for so many others a green spot in memory the great millet was just dead the green shutters of his modest house were closed his daughters were in mourning the date of my first visit was thus an epoch in the history of art in a lesser way it was an epoch in the history of the latin quarter the petit cénacle was dead and buried murger and his crew of sponging vagabonds were all at rest from their expedients the tradition of their real life was nearly lost and the petrified legend of the vie de bohême had become a sort of gospel and still gave the cue to zealous imitators but if the book be written in rosewater the imitation was still further expurgated honesty was the rule the innkeepers gave as i have said almost unlimited credit they suffered the seediest painter to depart to take all his belongings and to leave his bill unpaid and if they sometimes lost it was by english and americans alone at the same time the great influx of anglosaxons had begun to affect the life of the studious there had been disputes and in one instance at least the english and the americans had made common cause to prevent a cruel pleasantry it would be well if nations and races could communicate their qualities but in practice when they look upon each other they have an eye to nothing but defects the anglosaxon is essentially dishonest the french is devoid by nature of the principle that we call fair play the frenchman marvelled at the scruples of his guest and when that defender of innocence retired overseas and left his bills unpaid he marvelled once again the good and evil were in his eyes part and parcel of the same eccentricity a shrug expressed his judgment upon both  at barbizon there was no master no pontiff in the arts palizzi bore rule at grezurbane superior rulehis memory rich in anecdotes of the great men of yore his mind fertile in theories sceptical composed and venerable to the eye and yet beneath these outworks all twittering with italian superstition his eye scouting for omens and the whole fabric of his manners giving way on the appearance of a hunchback cernay had pelouse the admirable placid pelouse smilingly critical of youth who when a fullblown commercial traveller suddenly threw down his samples bought a colourbox and became the master whom we have all admired marlotte for a central figure boasted olivier de penne only barbizon since the death of millet was a headless commonwealth even its secondary lights and those who in my day made the stranger welcome have since deserted it the good lachèvre has departed carrying his household gods and long before that gaston lafenestre was taken from our midst by an untimely death he died before he had deserved success it may be he would never have deserved it but his kind comely modest countenance still haunts the memory of all who knew him anotherwhom i will not namehas moved farther on pursuing the strange odyssey of his decadence his days of royal favour had departed even then but he still retained in his narrower life at barbizon a certain stamp of conscious importance hearty friendly filling the room the occupant of several chairs nor had he yet ceased his losing battle still labouring upon great canvases that none would buy still waiting the return of fortune but these days also were too good to last and the former favourite of two sovereigns fled if i heard the truth by night there was a time when he was counted a great man and millet but a dauber behold how the whirligig of time brings in his revenges to pity millet is a piece of arrogance if life be hard for such resolute and pious spirits it is harder still for us had we the wit to understand it but we may pity his unhappier rival who for no apparent merit was raised to opulence and momentary fame and through no apparent fault was suffered step by step to sink again to nothing no misfortune can exceed the bitterness of such backforemost progress even bravely supported as it was but to those also who were taken early from the easel a regret is due from all the young men of this period one stood out by the vigour of his promise he was in the age of fermentation enamoured of eccentricities il faut faire de la peinture nouvelle was his watchword but if time and experience had continued his education if he had been granted health to return from these excursions to the steady and the central i must believe that the name of hills had become famous  sirons inn that excellent artists barrack was managed upon easy principles at any hour of the night when you returned from wandering in the forest you went to the billiardroom and helped yourself to liquors or descended to the cellar and returned laden with beer or wine the sirons were all locked in slumber there was none to check your inroads only at the weeks end a computation was made the gross sum was divided and a varying share set down to every lodgers name under the rubric estrats upon the more longsuffering the larger tax was levied and your bill lengthened in a direct proportion to the easiness of your disposition at any hour of the morning again you could get your coffee or cold milk and set forth into the forest the doves had perhaps wakened you fluttering into your chamber and on the threshold of the inn you were met by the aroma of the forest close by were the great aisles the mossy boulders the interminable field of forest shadow there you were free to dream and wander and at noon and again at six oclock a good meal awaited you on sirons table the whole of your accommodation set aside that varying item of the estrats cost you five francs a day your bill was never offered you until you asked it and if you were out of lucks way you might depart for where you pleased and leave it pending     iv  theoretically the house was open to all comers practically it was a kind of club the guests protected themselves and in so doing they protected siron formal manners being laid aside essential courtesy was the more rigidly exacted the new arrival had to feel the pulse of the society and a breach of its undefined observances was promptly punished a man might be as plain as dull as slovenly as free of speech as he desired but to a touch of presumption or a word of hectoring these free barbizonians were as sensitive as a teaparty of maiden ladies i have seen people driven forth from barbizon it would be difficult to say in words what they had done but they deserved their fate they had shown themselves unworthy to enjoy these corporate freedoms they had pushed themselves they had made their head they wanted tact to appreciate the fine shades of barbizonian etiquette and once they were condemned the process of extrusion was ruthless in its cruelty after one evening with the formidable bodmer the bailly of our commonwealth the erring stranger was beheld no more he rose exceeding early the next day and the first coach conveyed him from the scene of his discomfiture these sentences of banishment were never in my knowledge delivered against an artist such would i believe have been illegal but the odd and pleasant fact is this that they were never needed painters sculptors writers singers i have seen all of these in barbizon and some were sulky and some blatant and inane but one and all entered at once into the spirit of the association this singular society is purely french a creature of french virtues and possibly of french defects it cannot be imitated by the english the roughness the impatience the more obvious selfishness and even the more ardent friendships of the anglosaxon speedily dismember such a commonwealth but this random gathering of young french painters with neither apparatus nor parade of government yet kept the life of the place upon a certain footing insensibly imposed their etiquette upon the docile and by caustic speech enforced their edicts against the unwelcome to think of it is to wonder the more at the strange failure of their race upon the larger theatre this inbred civilityto use the word in its completest meaningthis natural and facile adjustment of contending liberties seems all that is required to make a governable nation and a just and prosperous country  our society thus purged and guarded was full of high spirits of laughter and of the initiative of youth the few elder men who joined us were still young at heart and took the key from their companions we returned from long stations in the fortifying air our blood renewed by the sunshine our spirits refreshed by the silence of the forest the babel of loud voices sounded good we fell to eat and play like the natural man and in the high inn chamber panelled with indifferent pictures and lit by candles guttering in the night air the talk and laughter sounded far into the night it was a good place and a good life for any naturallyminded youth better yet for the student of painting and perhaps best of all for the student of letters he too was saturated in this atmosphere of style he was shut out from the disturbing currents of the world he might forget that there existed other and more pressing interests than that of art but in such a place it was hardly possible to write he could not drug his conscience like the painter by the production of listless studies he saw himself idle among many who were apparently and some who were really employed and what with the impulse of increasing health and the continual provocation of romantic scenes he became tormented with the desire to work he enjoyed a strenuous idleness full of visions hearty meals long sweltering walks mirth among companions and still floating like music through his brain foresights of great works that shakespeare might be proud to have conceived headless epics glorious torsos of dramas and words that were alive with import so in youth like moses from the mountain we have sights of that house beautiful of art which we shall never enter they are dreams and unsubstantial visions of style that repose upon no base of human meaning the last heartthrobs of that excited amateur who has to die in all of us before the artist can be born but they come to us in such a rainbow of glory that all subsequent achievement appears dull and earthly in comparison we were all artists almost all in the age of illusion cultivating an imaginary genius and walking to the strains of some deceiving ariel small wonder indeed if we were happy but art of whatever nature is a kind mistress and though these dreams of youth fall by their own baselessness others succeed graver and more substantial the symptoms change the amiable malady endures and still at an equal distance the house beautiful shines upon its hilltop     v  grez lies out of the forest down by the bright river it boasts a mill an ancient church a castle and a bridge of many sterlings and the bridge is a piece of public property anonymously famous beaming on the incurious dilettante from the walls of a hundred exhibitions i have seen it in the salon i have seen it in the academy i have seen it in the last french exposition excellently done by bloomer in a blackandwhite by mr a henley it once adorned this essay in the pages of the magazine of art longsuffering bridge and if you visit grez tomorrow you shall find another generation camped at the bottom of chevillons garden under their white umbrellas and doggedly painting it again  the bridge taken for granted grez is a less inspiring place than barbizon i give it the palm over cernay there is something ghastly in the great empty village square of cernay with the inn tables standing in one corner as though the stage were set for rustic opera and in the early morning all the painters breaking their fast upon white wine under the windows of the villagers it is vastly different to awake in grez to go down the green inngarden to find the river streaming through the bridge and to see the dawn begin across the poplared level the meals are laid in the cool arbour under fluttering leaves the splash of oars and bathers the bathing costumes out to dry the trim canoes beside the jetty tell of a society that has an eye to pleasure there is something to do at grez perhaps for that very reason i can recall no such enduring ardours no such glories of exhilaration as among the solemn groves and uneventful hours of barbizon this something to do is a great enemy to joy it is a way out of it you wreak your high spirits on some cutanddry employment and behold them gone but grez is a merry place after its kind pretty to see merry to inhabit the course of its pellucid river whether up or down is full of gentle attractions for the navigator islanded reedmazes where in autumn the red berries cluster the mirrored and inverted images of trees lilies and mills and the foam and thunder of weirs and of all noble sweeps of roadway none is nobler on a windy dusk than the highroad to nemours between its lines of talking poplar  but even grez is changed the old inn long shored and trussed and buttressed fell at length under the mere weight of years and the place as it was is but a fading image in the memory of former guests they indeed recall the ancient wooden stair they recall the rainy evening the wide hearth the blaze of the twig fire and the company that gathered round the pillar in the kitchen but the material fabric is now dust soon with the last of its inhabitants its very memory shall follow and they in their turn shall suffer the same law and both in name and lineament vanish from the world of men for remembrance of the old house sake as pepys once quaintly put it let me tell one story when the tide of invasion swept over france two foreign painters were left stranded and penniless in grez and there until the war was over the chevillons ungrudgingly harboured them it was difficult to obtain supplies but the two waifs were still welcome to the best sat down daily with the family to table and at the due intervals were supplied with clean napkins which they scrupled to employ madame chevillon observed the fact and reprimanded them but they stood firm eat they must but having no money they would soil no napkins     vi  nemours and moret for all they are so picturesque have been little visited by painters they are indeed too populous they have manners of their own and might resist the drastic process of colonisation montigny has been somewhat strangely neglected i never knew it inhabited but once when will h low installed himself there with a barrel of piquette and entertained his friends in a leafy trellis above the weir in sight of the green country and to the music of the falling water it was a most airy quaint and pleasant place of residence just too rustic to be stagey and from my memories of the place in general and that garden trellis in particularat morning visited by birds or at night when the dew fell and the stars were of the partyi am inclined to think perhaps too favourably of the future of montigny chaillyenbière has outlived all things and lies dustily slumbering in the plainthe cemetery of itself the great road remains to testify of its former bustle of postilions and carriage bells and like memorial tablets there still hang in the inn room the paintings of a former generation dead or decorated long ago in my time one man only greatly daring dwelt there from time to time he would walk over to barbizon like a shade revisiting the glimpses of the moon and after some communication with flesh and blood return to his austere hermitage but even he when i last revisited the forest had come to barbizon for good and closed the roll of the chaillyites it may revivebut i much doubt it achères and recloses still wait a pioneer bourron is out of the question being merely grez over again without the river the bridge or the beauty and of all the possible places on the western side marlotte alone remains to be discussed i scarcely know marlotte and very likely for that reason am not much in love with it it seems a glaring and unsightly hamlet the inn of mother antonie is unattractive and its more reputable rival though comfortable enough is commonplace marlotte has a name it is famous if i were the young painter i would leave it alone in its glory     vii  these are the words of an old stager and though time is a good conservative in forest places much may be untrue today many of us have passed arcadian days there and moved on but yet left a portion of our souls behind us buried in the woods i would not dig for these reliquiæ they are incommunicable treasures that will not enrich the finder and yet there may lie interred below great oaks or scattered along forest paths stores of youths dynamite and dear remembrances and as one generation passes on and renovates the field of tillage for the next i entertain a fancy that when the young men of today go forth into the forest they shall find the air still vitalised by the spirits of their predecessors and like those unheard melodies that are the sweetest of all the memory of our laughter shall still haunt the field of trees those merry voices that in woods call the wanderer farther those thrilling silences and whispers of the groves surely in fontainebleau they must be vocal of me and my companions we are not content to pass away entirely from the scenes of our delight we would leave if but in gratitude a pillar and a legend  one generation after another fall like honeybees upon this memorable forest rifle its sweets pack themselves with vital memories and when the theft is consummated depart again into life richer but poorer also the forest indeed they have possessed from that day forward it is theirs indissolubly and they will return to walk in it at night in the fondest of their dreams and use it for ever in their books and pictures yet when they made their packets and put up their notes and sketches something it should seem had been forgotten a projection of themselves shall appear to haunt unfriended these scenes of happiness a natural child of fancy begotten and forgotten unawares over the whole field of our wanderings such fetches are still travelling like indefatigable bagmen but the imps of fontainebleau as of all beloved spots are very long of life and memory is piously unwilling to forget their orphanage if anywhere about that wood you meet my airy bantling greet him with tenderness he was a pleasant lad though now abandoned and when it comes to your own turn to quit the forest may you leave behind you such another no antony or werther let us hope no tearful whipster but as becomes this not uncheerful and most active age in which we figure the child of happy hours  no art it may be said was ever perfect and not many noble that has not been mirthfully conceived and no man it may be added was ever anything but a wet blanket and a cross to his companions who boasted not a copious spirit of enjoyment whether as man or artist let the youth make haste to fontainebleau and once there let him address himself to the spirit of the place he will learn more from exercise than from studies although both are necessary and if he can get into his heart the gaiety and inspiration of the woods he will have gone far to undo the evil of his sketches a spirit once well strung up to the concertpitch of the primeval outofdoors will hardly dare to finish a study and magniloquently ticket it a picture the incommunicable thrill of things that is the tuningfork by which we test the flatness of our art here it is that nature teaches and condemns and still spurs up to further effort and new failure thus it is that she sets us blushing at our ignorant and tepid works and the more we find of these inspiring shocks the less shall we be apt to love the literal in our productions in all sciences and senses the letter kills and today when cackling human geese express their ignorant condemnation of all studio pictures it is a lesson most useful to be learnt let the young painter go to fontainebleau and while he stupefies himself with studies that teach him the mechanical side of his trade let him walk in the great air and be a servant of mirth and not pick and botanise but wait upon the moods of nature so he will learnor learn not to forgetthe poetry of life and earth which when he has acquired his track will save him from joyless reproduction     ii  a note on realism   style is the invariable mark of any master and for the student who does not aspire so high as to be numbered with the giants it is still the one quality in which he may improve himself at will passion wisdom creative force the power of mystery or colour are allotted in the hour of birth and can be neither learned nor simulated but the just and dexterous use of what qualities we have the proportion of one part to another and to the whole the elision of the useless the accentuation of the important and the preservation of a uniform character from end to endthese which taken together constitute technical perfection are to some degree within the reach of industry and intellectual courage what to put in and what to leave out whether some particular fact be organically necessary or purely ornamental whether if it be purely ornamental it may not weaken or obscure the general design and finally whether if we decide to use it we should do so grossly and notably or in some conventional disguise are questions of plastic style continually rearising and the sphinx that patrols the highways of executive art has no more unanswerable riddle to propound  in literature from which i must draw my instances the great change of the past century has been effected by the admission of detail it was inaugurated by the romantic scott and at length by the semiromantic balzac and his more or less wholly unromantic followers bound like a duty on the novelist for some time it signified and expressed a more ample contemplation of the conditions of mans life but it has recently at least in france fallen into a merely technical and decorative stage which it is perhaps still too harsh to call survival with a movement of alarm the wiser or more timid begin to fall a little back from these extremities they begin to aspire after a more naked narrative articulation after the succinct the dignified and the poetic and as a means to this after a general lightening of this baggage of detail after scott we beheld the starveling storyonce in the hands of voltaire as abstract as a parablebegin to be pampered upon facts the introduction of these details developed a particular ability of hand and that ability childishly indulged has led to the works that now amaze us on a railway journey a man of the unquestionable force of m zola spends himself on technical successes to afford a popular flavour and attract the mob he adds a steady current of what i may be allowed to call the rancid that is exciting to the moralist but what more particularly interests the artist is this tendency of the extreme of detail when followed as a principle to degenerate into mere feuxdejoie of literary tricking the other day even m daudet was to be heard babbling of audible colours and visible sounds  this odd suicide of one branch of the realists may serve to remind us of the fact which underlies a very dusty conflict of the critics all representative art which can be said to live is both realistic and ideal and the realism about which we quarrel is a matter purely of externals it is no especial cultus of nature and veracity but a mere whim of veering fashion that has made us turn our back upon the larger more various and more romantic art of yore a photographic exactitude in dialogue is now the exclusive fashion but even in the ablest hands it tells us no morei think it even tells us lessthan molière wielding his artificial medium has told to us and to all time of alceste or orgon dorine or chrysale the historical novel is forgotten yet truth to the conditions of mans nature and the conditions of mans life the truth of literary art is free of the ages it may be told us in a carpet comedy in a novel of adventure or a fairy tale the scene may be pitched in london on the seacoast of bohemia or away on the mountains of beulah and by an odd and luminous accident if there is any page of literature calculated to awake the envy of m zola it must be that troilus and cressida which shakespeare in a spasm of unmanly anger with the world grafted on the heroic story of the siege of troy  this question of realism let it then be clearly understood regards not in the least degree the fundamental truth but only the technical method of a work of art be as ideal or as abstract as you please you will be none the less veracious but if you be weak you run the risk of being tedious and inexpressive and if you be very strong and honest you may chance upon a masterpiece  a work of art is first cloudily conceived in the mind during the period of gestation it stands more clearly forward from these swaddling mists puts on expressive lineaments and becomes at length that most faultless but also alas that incommunicable product of the human mind a perfected design on the approach to execution all is changed the artist must now step down don his working clothes and become the artisan he now resolutely commits his airy conception his delicate ariel to the touch of matter he must decide almost in a breath the scale the style the spirit and the particularity of execution of his whole design  the engendering idea of some works is stylistic a technical preoccupation stands them instead of some robuster principle of life and with these the execution is but play for the stylistic problem is resolved beforehand and all large originality of treatment wilfully foregone such are the verses intricately designed which we have learnt to admire with a certain smiling admiration at the hands of mr lang and mr dobson such too are those canvases where dexterity or even breadth of plastic style takes the place of pictorial nobility of design so it may be remarked it was easier to begin to write esmond than vanity fair since in the first the style was dictated by the nature of the plan and thackeray a man probably of some indolence of mind enjoyed and got good profit of this economy of effort but the case is exceptional usually in all works of art that have been conceived from within outwards and generously nourished from the authors mind the moment in which he begins to execute is one of extreme perplexity and strain artists of indifferent energy and an imperfect devotion to their own ideal make this ungrateful effort once for all and having formed a style adhere to it through life but those of a higher order cannot rest content with a process which as they continue to employ it must infallibly degenerate towards the academic and the cutanddried every fresh work in which they embark is the signal for a fresh engagement of the whole forces of their mind and the changing views which accompany the growth of their experience are marked by still more sweeping alterations in the manner of their art so that criticism loves to dwell upon and distinguish the varying periods of a raphael a shakespeare or a beethoven  it is then first of all at this initial and decisive moment when execution is begun and thenceforth only in a less degree that the ideal and the real do indeed like good and evil angels contend for the direction of the work marble paint and language the pen the needle and the brush all have their grossnesses their ineffable impotences their hours if i may so express myself of insubordination it is the work and it is a great part of the delight of any artist to contend with these unruly tools and now by brute energy now by witty expedient to drive and coax them to effect his will given these means so laughably inadequate and given the interest the intensity and the multiplicity of the actual sensation whose effect he is to render with their aid the artist has one main and necessary resource which he must in every case and upon any theory employ he must that is suppress much and omit more he must omit what is tedious or irrelevant and suppress what is tedious and necessary but such facts as in regard to the main design subserve a variety of purposes he will perforce and eagerly retain and it is the mark of the very highest order of creative art to be woven exclusively of such there any fact that is registered is contrived a double or a treble debt to pay and is at once an ornament in its place and a pillar in the main design nothing would find room in such a picture that did not serve at once to complete the composition to accentuate the scheme of colour to distinguish the planes of distance and to strike the note of the selected sentiment nothing would be allowed in such a story that did not at the same time expedite the progress of the fable build up the characters and strike home the moral or the philosophical design but this is unattainable as a rule so far from building the fabric of our works exclusively with these we are thrown into a rapture if we think we can muster a dozen or a score of them to be the plums of our confection and hence in order that the canvas may be filled or the story proceed from point to point other details must be admitted they must be admitted alas upon a doubtful title many without marriage robes thus any work of art as it proceeds towards completion too ofteni had almost written alwaysloses in force and poignancy of main design our little air is swamped and dwarfed among hardly relevant orchestration our little passionate story drowns in a deep sea of descriptive eloquence or slipshod talk  but again we are rather more tempted to admit those particulars which we know we can describe and hence those most of all which having been described very often have grown to be conventionally treated in the practice of our art these we choose as the mason chooses the acanthus to adorn his capital because they come naturally to the accustomed hand the old stock incidents and accessories tricks of workmanship and schemes of composition all being admirably good or they would long have been forgotten haunt and tempt our fancy offer us readymade but not perfectly appropriate solutions for any problem that arises and wean us from the study of nature and the uncompromising practice of art to struggle to face nature to find fresh solutions and give expression to facts which have not yet been adequately or not yet elegantly expressed is to run a little upon the danger of extreme selflove difficulty sets a high price upon achievement and the artist may easily fall into the error of the french naturalists and consider any fact as welcome to admission if it be the ground of brilliant handiwork or again into the error of the modern landscapepainter who is apt to think that difficulty overcome and science well displayed can take the place of what is after all the one excuse and breath of artcharm a little further and he will regard charm in the light of an unworthy sacrifice to prettiness and the omission of a tedious passage as an infidelity to art  we have now the matter of this difference before us the idealist his eye singly fixed upon the greater outlines loves rather to fill up the interval with detail of the conventional order briefly touched soberly suppressed in tone courting neglect but the realist with a fine intemperance will not suffer the presence of anything so dead as a convention he shall have all fiery all hotpressed from nature all charactered and notable seizing the eye the style that befits either of these extremes once chosen brings with it its necessary disabilities and dangers the immediate danger of the realist is to sacrifice the beauty and significance of the whole to local dexterity or in the insane pursuit of completion to immolate his readers under facts but he comes in the last resort and as his energy declines to discard all design abjure all choice and with scientific thoroughness steadily to communicate matter which is not worth learning the danger of the idealist is of course to become merely null and lose all grip of fact particularity or passion  we talk of bad and good everything indeed is good which is conceived with honesty and executed with communicative ardour but though on neither side is dogmatism fitting and though in every case the artist must decide for himself and decide afresh and yet afresh for each succeeding work and new creation yet one thing may be generally said that we of the last quarter of the nineteenth century breathing as we do the intellectual atmosphere of our age are more apt to err upon the side of realism than to sin in quest of the ideal upon that theory it may be well to watch and correct our own decisions always holding back the hand from the least appearance of irrelevant dexterity and resolutely fixed to begin no work that is not philosophical passionate dignified happily mirthful or at the last and least romantic in design     iii  on some technical elements of style in literature   there is nothing more disenchanting to man than to be shown the springs and mechanism of any art all our arts and occupations lie wholly on the surface it is on the surface that we perceive their beauty fitness and significance and to pry below is to be appalled by their emptiness and shocked by the coarseness of the strings and pulleys in a similar way psychology itself when pushed to any nicety discovers an abhorrent baldness but rather from the fault of our analysis than from any poverty native to the mind and perhaps in æsthetics the reason is the same those disclosures which seem fatal to the dignity of art seem so perhaps only in the proportion of our ignorance and those conscious and unconscious artifices which it seems unworthy of the serious artist to employ were yet if we had the power to trace them to their springs indications of a delicacy of the sense finer than we conceive and hints of ancient harmonies in nature this ignorance at least is largely irremediable we shall never learn the affinities of beauty for they lie too deep in nature and too far back in the mysterious history of man the amateur in consequence will always grudgingly receive details of method which can be stated but can never wholly be explained nay on the principle laid down in hudibras that         still the less they understand   the more they admire the sleightofhand  many are conscious at each new disclosure of a diminution in the ardour of their pleasure i must therefore warn that wellknown character the general reader that i am here embarked upon a most distasteful business taking down the picture from the wall and looking on the back and like the inquiring child pulling the musical cart to pieces  1 choice of wordsthe art of literature stands apart from among its sisters because the material in which the literary artist works is the dialect of life hence on the one hand a strange freshness and immediacy of address to the public mind which is ready prepared to understand it but hence on the other a singular limitation the sister arts enjoy the use of a plastic and ductile material like the modellers clay literature alone is condemned to work in mosaic with finite and quite rigid words you have seen these blocks dear to the nursery this one a pillar that a pediment a third a window or a vase it is with blocks of just such arbitrary size and figure that the literary architect is condemned to design the palace of his art nor is this all for since these blocks or words are the acknowledged currency of our daily affairs there are here possible none of those suppressions by which other arts obtain relief continuity and vigour no hieroglyphic touch no smoothed impasto no inscrutable shadow as in painting no blank wall as in architecture but every word phrase sentence and paragraph must move in a logical progression and convey a definite conventional import  now the first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer or the talk of a brilliant conversationalist is the apt choice and contrast of the words employed it is indeed a strange art to take these blocks rudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar and by tact of application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions restore to them their primal energy wittily shift them to another issue or make of them a drum to rouse the passions but though this form of merit is without doubt the most sensible and seizing it is far from being equally present in all writers the effect of words in shakespeare their singular justice significance and poetic charm is different indeed from the effect of words in addison or fielding or to take an example nearer home the words in carlyle seem electrified into an energy of lineament like the faces of men furiously moved whilst the words in macaulay apt enough to convey his meaning harmonious enough in sound yet glide from the memory like undistinguished elements in a general effect but the first class of writers have no monopoly of literary merit there is a sense in which addison is superior to carlyle a sense in which cicero is better than tacitus in which voltaire excels montaigne it certainly lies not in the choice of words it lies not in the interest or value of the matter it lies not in force of intellect of poetry or of humour the three first are but infants to the three second and yet each in a particular point of literary art excels his superior in the whole what is that point  2 the webliterature although it stands apart by reason of the great destiny and general use of its medium in the affairs of men is yet an art like other arts of these we may distinguish two great classes those arts like sculpture painting acting which are representative or as used to be said very clumsily imitative and those like architecture music and the dance which are selfsufficient and merely presentative each class in right of this distinction obeys principles apart yet both may claim a common ground of existence and it may be said with sufficient justice that the motive and end of any art whatever is to make a pattern a pattern it may be of colours of sounds of changing attitudes geometrical figures or imitative lines but still a pattern that is the plane on which these sisters meet it is by this that they are arts and if it be well they should at times forget their childish origin addressing their intelligence to virile tasks and performing unconsciously that necessary function of their life to make a pattern it is still imperative that the pattern shall be made  music and literature the two temporal arts contrive their pattern of sounds in time or in other words of sounds and pauses communication may be made in broken words the business of life be carried on with substantives alone but that is not what we call literature and the true business of the literary artist is to plait or weave his meaning involving it around itself so that each sentence by successive phrases shall first come into a kind of knot and then after a moment of suspended meaning solve and clear itself in every properly constructed sentence there should be observed this knot or hitch so that however delicately we are led to foresee to expect and then to welcome the successive phrases the pleasure may be heightened by an element of surprise as very grossly in the common figure of the antithesis or with much greater subtlety where an antithesis is first suggested and then deftly evaded each phrase besides is to be comely in itself and between the implication and the evolution of the sentence there should be a satisfying equipoise of sound for nothing more often disappoints the ear than a sentence solemnly and sonorously prepared and hastily and weakly finished nor should the balance be too striking and exact for the one rule is to be infinitely various to interest to disappoint to surprise and yet still to gratify to be ever changing as it were the stitch and yet still to give the effect of an ingenious neatness  the conjurer juggles with two oranges and our pleasure in beholding him springs from this that neither is for an instant overlooked or sacrificed so with the writer his pattern which is to please the supersensual ear is yet addressed throughout and first of all to the demands of logic whatever be the obscurities whatever the intricacies of the argument the neatness of the fabric must not suffer or the artist has been proved unequal to his design and on the other hand no form of words must be selected no knot must be tied among the phrases unless knot and word be precisely what is wanted to forward and illuminate the argument for to fail in this is to swindle in the game the genius of prose rejects the cheville no less emphatically than the laws of verse and the cheville i should perhaps explain to some of my readers is any meaningless or very watered phrase employed to strike a balance in the sound pattern and argument live in each other and it is by the brevity clearness charm or emphasis of the second that we judge the strength and fitness of the first  style is synthetic and the artist seeking so to speak a peg to plait about takes up at once two or more elements or two or more views of the subject in hand combines implicates and contrasts them and while in one sense he was merely seeking an occasion for the necessary knot he will be found in the other to have greatly enriched the meaning or to have transacted the work of two sentences in the space of one in the change from the successive shallow statements of the old chronicler to the dense and luminous flow of highly synthetic narrative there is implied a vast amount of both philosophy and wit the philosophy we clearly see recognising in the synthetic writer a far more deep and stimulating view of life and a far keener sense of the generation and affinity of events the wit we might imagine to be lost but it is not so for it is just that wit these perpetual nice contrivances these difficulties overcome this double purpose attained these two oranges kept simultaneously dancing in the air that consciously or not afford the reader his delight nay and this wit so little recognised is the necessary organ of that philosophy which we so much admire that style is therefore the most perfect not as fools say which is the most natural for the most natural is the disjointed babble of the chronicler but which attains the highest degree of elegant and pregnant implication unobtrusively or if obtrusively then with the greatest gain to sense and vigour even the derangement of the phrases from their socalled natural order is luminous for the mind and it is by the means of such designed reversal that the elements of a judgment may be most pertinently marshalled or the stages of a complicated action most perspicuously bound into one  the web then or the pattern a web at once sensuous and logical an elegant and pregnant texture that is style that is the foundation of the art of literature books indeed continue to be read for the interest of the fact or fable in which this quality is poorly represented but still it will be there and on the other hand how many do we continue to peruse and reperuse with pleasure whose only merit is the elegance of texture i am tempted to mention cicero and since mr anthony trollope is dead i will it is a poor diet for the mind a very colourless and toothless criticism of life but we enjoy the pleasure of a most intricate and dexterous pattern every stitch a model at once of elegance and of good sense and the two oranges even if one of them be rotten kept dancing with inimitable grace  up to this moment i have had my eye mainly upon prose for though in verse also the implication of the logical texture is a crowning beauty yet in verse it may be dispensed with you would think that here was a deathblow to all i have been saying and far from that it is but a new illustration of the principle involved for if the versifier is not bound to weave a pattern of his own it is because another pattern has been formally imposed upon him by the laws of verse for that is the essence of a prosody verse may be rhythmical it may be merely alliterative it may like the french depend wholly on the quasi regular recurrence of the rhyme or like the hebrew it may consist in the strangely fanciful device of repeating the same idea it does not matter on what principle the law is based so it be a law it may be pure convention it may have no inherent beauty all that we have a right to ask of any prosody is that it shall lay down a pattern for the writer and that what it lays down shall be neither too easy nor too hard hence it comes that it is much easier for men of equal facility to write fairly pleasing verse than reasonably interesting prose for in prose the pattern itself has to be invented and the difficulties first created before they can be solved hence again there follows the peculiar greatness of the true versifier such as shakespeare milton and victor hugo whom i place beside them as versifier merely not as poet these not only knit and knot the logical texture of the style with all the dexterity and strength of prose they not only fill up the pattern of the verse with infinite variety and sober wit but they give us besides a rare and special pleasure by the art comparable to that of counterpoint with which they follow at the same time and now contrast and now combine the double pattern of the texture and the verse here the sounding line concludes a little further on the wellknit sentence and yet a little further and both will reach their solution on the same ringing syllable the best that can be offered by the best writer of prose is to show us the development of the idea and the stylistic pattern proceed hand in hand sometimes by an obvious and triumphant effort sometimes with a great air of ease and nature the writer of verse by virtue of conquering another difficulty delights us with a new series of triumphs he follows three purposes where his rival followed only two and the change is of precisely the same nature as that from melody to harmony or if you prefer to return to the juggler behold him now to the vastly increased enthusiasm of the spectators juggling with three oranges instead of two thus it is added difficulty added beauty and the pattern with every fresh element becoming more interesting in itself  yet it must not be thought that verse is simply an addition something is lost as well as something gained and there remains plainly traceable in comparing the best prose with the best verse a certain broad distinction of method in the web tight as the versifier may draw the knot of logic yet for the ear he still leaves the tissue of the sentence floating somewhat loose in prose the sentence turns upon a pivot nicely balanced and fits into itself with an obtrusive neatness like a puzzle the ear remarks and is singly gratified by this return and balance while in verse it is all diverted to the measure to find comparable passages is hard for either the versifier is hugely the superior of the rival or if he be not and still persist in his more delicate enterprise he falls to be as widely his inferior but let us select them from the pages of the same writer one who was ambidexter let us take for instance rumours prologue to the second part of henry iv a fine flourish of eloquence in shakespeares second manner and set it side by side with falstaffs praise of sherris act iv scene 1 or let us compare the beautiful prose spoken throughout by rosalind and orlando compare for example the first speech of all orlandos speech to adam with what passage it shall please you to selectthe seven ages from the same play or even such a stave of nobility as othellos farewell to war and still you will be able to perceive if you have any ear for that class of music a certain superior degree of organisation in the prose a compacter fitting of the parts a balance in the swing and the return as of a throbbing pendulum we must not in things temporal take from those who have little the little that they have the merits of prose are inferior but they are not the same it is a little kingdom but an independent  3 rhythm of the phrasesome way back i used a word which still awaits an application each phrase i said was to be comely but what is a comely phrase in all ideal and material points literature being a representative art must look for analogies to painting and the like but in what is technical and executive being a temporal art it must seek for them in music each phrase of each sentence like an air or a recitative in music should be so artfully compounded out of long and short out of accented and unaccented as to gratify the sensual ear and of this the ear is the sole judge it is impossible to lay down laws even in our accentual and rhythmic language no analysis can find the secret of the beauty of a verse how much less then of those phrases such as prose is built of which obey no law but to be lawless and yet to please the little that we know of verse and for my part i owe it all to my friend professor fleeming jenkin is however particularly interesting in the present connection we have been accustomed to describe the heroic line as five iambic feet and to be filled with pain and confusion whenever as by the conscientious schoolboy we have heard our own description put in practice    all nìght  the dreàd  less àn  gel ùn  pursùed18  goes the schoolboy but though we close our ears we cling to our definition in spite of its proved and naked insufficiency mr jenkin was not so easily pleased and readily discovered that the heroic line consists of four groups or if you prefer the phrase contains four pauses    all night  the dreadless  angel  unpursued  four groups each practically uttered as one word the first in this case an iamb the second an amphibrachys the third a trochee and the fourth an amphimacer and yet our schoolboy with no other liberty but that of inflicting pain had triumphantly scanned it as five iambs perceive now this fresh richness of intricacy in the web this fourth orange hitherto unremarked but still kept flying with the others what had seemed to be one thing it now appears is two and like some puzzle in arithmetic the verse is made at the same time to read in fives and to read in fours  but again four is not necessary we do not indeed find verses in six groups because there is not room for six in the ten syllables and we do not find verses of two because one of the main distinctions of verse from prose resides in the comparative shortness of the group but it is even common to find verses of three five is the one forbidden number because five is the number of the feet and if five were chosen the two patterns would coincide and that opposition which is the life of verse would instantly be lost we have here a clue to the effect of polysyllables above all in latin where they are so common and make so brave an architecture in the verse for the polysyllable is a group of natures making if but some roman would return from hades martial for choice and tell me by what conduct of the voice these thundering verses should be utteredaut lacedæmonium tarentum for a case in pointi feel as if i should enter at last into the full enjoyment of the best of human verses  but again the five feet are all iambic or supposed to be by the mere count of syllables the four groups cannot be all iambic as a question of elegance i doubt if any one of them requires to be so and i am certain that for choice no two of them should scan the same the singular beauty of the verse analysed above is due so far as analysis can carry us part indeed to the clever repetition of l d and n but part to this variety of scansion in the groups the groups which like the bar in music break up the verse for utterance fall uniambically and in declaiming a socalled iambic verse it may so happen that we never utter one iambic foot and yet to this neglect of the original beat there is a limit    athens the eye of greece mother of arts19  is with all its eccentricities a good heroic line for though it scarcely can be said to indicate the beat of the iamb it certainly suggests no other measure to the ear but begin    mother athens eye of greece  or merely mother athens and the game is up for the trochaic beat has been suggested the eccentric scansion of the groups is an adornment but as soon as the original beat has been forgotten they cease implicitly to be eccentric variety is what is sought but if we destroy the original mould one of the terms of this variety is lost and we fall back on sameness thus both as to the arithmetical measure of the verse and the degree of regularity in scansion we see the laws of prosody to have one common purpose to keep alive the opposition of two schemes simultaneously followed to keep them notably apart though still coincident and to balance them with such judicial nicety before the reader that neither shall be unperceived and neither signally prevail  the rule of rhythm in prose is not so intricate here too we write in groups or phrases as i prefer to call them for the prose phrase is greatly longer and is much more nonchalantly uttered than the group in verse so that not only is there a greater interval of continuous sound between the pauses but for that very reason word is linked more readily to word by a more summary enunciation still the phrase is the strict analogue of the group and successive phrases like successive groups must differ openly in length and rhythm the rule of scansion in verse is to suggest no measure but the one in hand in prose to suggest no measure at all prose must be rhythmical and it may be as much so as you will but it must not be metrical it may be anything but it must not be verse a single heroic line may very well pass and not disturb the somewhat larger stride of the prose style but one following another will produce an instant impression of poverty flatness and disenchantment the same lines delivered with the measured utterance of verse would perhaps seem rich in variety by the more summary enunciation proper to prose as to a more distant vision these niceties of difference are lost a whole verse is uttered as one phrase and the ear is soon wearied by a succession of groups identical in length the prose writer in fact since he is allowed to be so much less harmonious is condemned to a perpetually fresh variety of movement on a larger scale and must never disappoint the ear by the trot of an accepted metre and this obligation is the third orange with which he has to juggle the third quality which the prose writer must work into his pattern of words it may be thought perhaps that this is a quality of ease rather than a fresh difficulty but such is the inherently rhythmical strain of the english language that the bad writerand must i take for example that admired friend of my boyhood captain reidthe inexperienced writer as dickens in his earlier attempts to be impressive and the jaded writer as any one may see for himself all tend to fall at once into the production of bad blank verse and here it may be pertinently asked why bad and i suppose it might be enough to answer that no man ever made good verse by accident and that no verse can ever sound otherwise than trivial when uttered with the delivery of prose but we can go beyond such answers the weak side of verse is the regularity of the beat which in itself is decidedly less impressive than the movement of the nobler prose and it is just into this weak side and this alone that our careless writer falls a peculiar density and mass consequent on the nearness of the pauses is one of the chief good qualities of verse but this our accidental versifier still following after the swift gait and large gestures of prose does not so much as aspire to imitate lastly since he remains unconscious that he is making verse at all it can never occur to him to extract those effects of counterpoint and opposition which i have referred to as the final grace and justification of verse and i may add of blank verse in particular  4 contents of the phrasehere is a great deal of talk about rhythmand naturally for in our canorous language rhythm is always at the door but it must not be forgotten that in some languages this element is almost if not quite extinct and that in our own it is probably decaying the even speech of many educated americans sounds the note of danger i should see it go with something as bitter as despair but i should not be desperate as in verse no element not even rhythm is necessary so in prose also other sorts of beauty will arise and take the place and play the part of those that we outlive the beauty of the expected beat in verse the beauty in prose of its larger and more lawless melody patent as they are to english hearing are already silent in the ears of our next neighbours for in france the oratorical accent and the pattern of the web have almost or altogether succeeded to their places and the french prose writer would be astounded at the labours of his brother across the channel and how a good quarter of his toil above all invita minerva is to avoid writing verse so wonderfully far apart have races wandered in spirit and so hard it is to understand the literature next door  yet french prose is distinctly better than english and french verse above all while hugo lives it will not do to place upon one side what is more to our purpose a phrase or a verse in french is easily distinguishable as comely or uncomely there is then another element of comeliness hitherto overlooked in this analysis the contents of the phrase each phrase in literature is built of sounds as each phrase in music consists of notes one sound suggests echoes demands and harmonises with another and the art of rightly using these concordances is the final art in literature it used to be a piece of good advice to all young writers to avoid alliteration and the advice was sound in so far as it prevented daubing none the less for that was it abominable nonsense and the mere raving of those blindest of the blind who will not see the beauty of the contents of a phrase or of a sentence depends implicitly upon alliteration and upon assonance the vowel demands to be repeated the consonant demands to be repeated and both cry aloud to be perpetually varied you may follow the adventures of a letter through any passage that has particularly pleased you find it perhaps denied a while to tantalise the ear find it fired again at you in a whole broadside or find it pass into congenerous sounds one liquid or labial melting away into another and you will find another and much stranger circumstance literature is written by and for two senses a sort of internal ear quick to perceive unheard melodies and the eye which directs the pen and deciphers the printed phrase well even as there are rhymes for the eye so you will find that there are assonances and alliterations that where an author is running the open a deceived by the eye and our strange english spelling he will often show a tenderness for the flat a and that where he is running a particular consonant he will not improbably rejoice to write it down even when it is mute or bears a different value  here then we have a fresh patterna pattern to speak grossly of letterswhich makes the fourth preoccupation of the prose writer and the fifth of the versifier at times it is very delicate and hard to perceive and then perhaps most excellent and winning i say perhaps but at times again the elements of this literal melody stand more boldly forward and usurp the ear it becomes therefore somewhat a matter of conscience to select examples and as i cannot very well ask the reader to help me i shall do the next best by giving him the reason or the history of each selection the two first one in prose one in verse i chose without previous analysis simply as engaging passages that had long reechoed in my ear  i cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and unbreathed that never sallies out and sees her adversary but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for not without dust and heat20 down to virtue the current s and r are both announced and repeated unobtrusively and by way of a gracenote that almost inseparable group pvf is given entire21 the next phrase is a period of repose almost ugly in itself both s and r still audible and b given as the last fulfilment of pvf in the next four phrases from that never down to run for the mask is thrown off and but for a slight repetition of the f and v the whole matter turns almost too obtrusively on s and r first s coming to the front and then r in the concluding phrase all these favourite letters and even the flat a a timid preference for which is just perceptible are discarded at a blow and in a bundle and to make the break more obvious every word ends with a dental and all but one with t for which we have been cautiously prepared since the beginning the singular dignity of the first clause and this hammerstroke of the last go far to make the charm of this exquisite sentence but it is fair to own that s and r are used a little coarsely    in xanadu did kubla khan             kandl      a stately pleasure dome decree    kdlsr    where alph the sacred river ran     kandlsr    through caverns measureless to man  kanlsr      down to a sunless sea22        ndls  here i have put the analysis of the main group alongside the lines and the more it is looked at the more interesting it will seem but there are further niceties in lines two and four the current s is most delicately varied with z in line three the current flat a is twice varied with the open a already suggested in line two and both times where and sacred in conjunction with the current r in the same line f and v a harmony in themselves even when shorn of their comrade p are admirably contrasted and in line four there is a marked subsidiary m which again was announced in line two i stop from weariness for more might yet be said  my next example was recently quoted from shakespeare as an example of the poets colour sense now i do not think literature has anything to do with colour or poets anyway the better of such a sense and i instantly attacked this passage since purple was the word that had so pleased the writer of the article to see if there might not be some literary reason for its use it will be seen that i succeeded amply and i am bound to say i think the passage exceptional in shakespeareexceptional indeed in literature but it was not i who chose it    the barge she sat in like a burnished throne    burnt on the water the poop was beaten gold    purple the sails and so purfumèd that         per    the winds were lovesick with them23  it may be asked why i have put the f of perfumèd in capitals and i reply because this change from p to f is the completion of that from b to p already so adroitly carried out indeed the whole passage is a monument of curious ingenuity and it seems scarce worth while to indicate the subsidiary s l and w in the same article a second passage from shakespeare was quoted once again as an example of his colour sense    a mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops    i the bottom of a cowslip24  it is very curious very artificial and not worth while to analyse at length i leave it to the reader but before i turn my back on shakespeare i should like to quote a passage for my own pleasure and for a very model of every technical art    but in the wind and tempest of her frown   w p v f st ow25    distinction with a loud and powerful fan   w p f st ow l    puffing at all winnowes the light away    w p f l    and what hath mass and matter by itself     w f l m a    lies rich in virtue and unmingled26     v l m  from these delicate and choice writers i turned with some curiosity to a player of the big drummacaulay i had in hand the twovolume edition and i opened at the beginning of the second volume here was what i read     the violence of revolutions is generally proportioned to the degree    of the maladministration which has produced them it is therefore    not strange that the government of scotland having been during many    years greatly more corrupt than the government of england should    have fallen with a far heavier ruin the movement against the last    king of the house of stuart was in england conservative in scotland    destructive the english complained not of the law but of the    violation of the law  this was plainsailing enough it was our old friend pvf floated by the liquids in a body but as i read on and turned the page and still found pvf with his attendant liquids i confess my mind misgave me utterly this could be no trick of macaulays it must be the nature of the english tongue in a kind of despair i turned halfway through the volume and coming upon his lordship dealing with general cannon and fresh from claverhouse and killiekrankie here with elucidative spelling was my reward     meanwhile the disorders of kannons kamp went on inkreasing he    kalled a kouncil of war to konsider what kourse it would be advisable    to take but as soon as the kouncil had met a preliminary kuestion    was raised the army was almost eksklusively a highland army the    recent viktory had been won eksklusively by highland warriors great    chiefs who had brought siks or seven hundred fighting men into    the field did not think it fair that they should be outvoted    by gentlemen from ireland and from the low kountries who bore    indeed king jamess kommission and were kalled kolonels and    kaptains but who were kolonels without regiments and kaptains    without kompanies  a moment of fv in all this world of ks it was not the english language then that was an instrument of one string but macaulay that was an incomparable dauber  it was probably from this barbaric love of repeating the same sound rather than from any design of clearness that he acquired his irritating habit of repeating words i say the one rather than the other because such a trick of the ear is deeper seated and more original in man than any logical consideration few writers indeed are probably conscious of the length to which they push this melody of letters one writing very diligently and only concerned about the meaning of his words and the rhythm of his phrases was struck into amazement by the eager triumph with which he cancelled one expression to substitute another neither changed the sense both being monosyllables neither could affect the scansion and it was only by looking back on what he had already written that the mystery was solved the second word contained an open a and for nearly half a page he had been riding that vowel to the death  in practice i should add the ear is not always so exacting and ordinary writers in ordinary moments content themselves with avoiding what is harsh and here and there upon a rare occasion buttressing a phrase or linking two together with a patch of assonance or a momentary jingle of alliteration to understand how constant is this preoccupation of good writers even where its results are least obtrusive it is only necessary to turn to the bad there indeed you will find cacophony supreme the rattle of incongruous consonants only relieved by the jawbreaking hiatus and whole phrases not to be articulated by the powers of man  conclusionwe may now briefly enumerate the elements of style we have peculiar to the prose writer the task of keeping his phrases large rhythmical and pleasing to the ear without ever allowing them to fall into the strictly metrical peculiar to the versifier the task of combining and contrasting his double treble and quadruple pattern feet and groups logic and metreharmonious in diversity common to both the task of artfully combining the prime elements of language into phrases that shall be musical in the mouth the task of weaving their argument into a texture of committed phrases and of rounded periodsbut this particularly binding in the case of prose and again common to both the task of choosing apt explicit and communicative words we begin to see now what an intricate affair is any perfect passage how many faculties whether of taste or pure reason must be held upon the stretch to make it and why when it is made it should afford us so complete a pleasure from the arrangement of according letters which is altogether arabesque and sensual up to the architecture of the elegant and pregnant sentence which is a vigorous act of the pure intellect there is scarce a faculty in man but has been exercised we need not wonder then if perfect sentences are rare and perfect pages rarer   footnotes    18 milton    19 milton    20 milton    21 as pvf will

profession of letters   the profession of letters has been lately debated in the public prints and it has been debated to put the matter mildly from a point of view that was calculated to surprise highminded men and bring a general contempt on books and reading some time ago in particular a lively pleasant popular writer27 devoted an essay lively and pleasant like himself to a very encouraging view of the profession we may be glad that his experience is so cheering and we may hope that all others who deserve it shall be as handsomely rewarded but i do not think we need be at all glad to have this question so important to the public and ourselves debated solely on the ground of money the salary in any business under heaven is not the only nor indeed the first question that you should continue to exist is a matter for your own consideration but that your business should be first honest and second useful are points in which honour and morality are concerned if the writer to whom i refer succeeds in persuading a number of young persons to adopt this way of life with an eye set singly on the livelihood we must expect them in their works to follow profit only and we must expect in consequence if he will pardon me the epithets a slovenly base untrue and empty literature of that writer himself i am not speaking he is diligent clean and pleasing we all owe him periods of entertainment and he has achieved an amiable popularity which he has adequately deserved but the truth is he does not or did not when he first embraced it regard his profession from this purely mercenary side he went into it i shall venture to say if not with any noble design at least in the ardour of a first love and he enjoyed its practice long before he paused to calculate the wage the other day an author was complimented on a piece of work good in itself and exceptionally good for him and replied in terms unworthy of a commercial traveller that as the book was not briskly selling he did not give a copper farthing for its merit it must not be supposed that the person to whom this answer was addressed received it as a profession of faith he knew on the other hand that it was only a whiff of irritation just as we know when a respectable writer talks of literature as a way of life like shoemaking but not so useful that he is only debating one aspect of a question and is still clearly conscious of a dozen others more important in themselves and more central to the matter in hand but while those who treat literature in this pennywise and virtuefoolish spirit are themselves truly in possession of a better light it does not follow that the treatment is decent or improving whether for themselves or others to treat all subjects in the highest the most honourable and the pluckiest spirit consistent with the fact is the first duty of a writer if he be well paid as i am glad to hear he is this duty becomes the more urgent the neglect of it the more disgraceful and perhaps there is no subject on which a man should speak so gravely as that industry whatever it may be which is the occupation or delight of his life which is his tool to earn or serve with and which if it be unworthy stamps himself as a mere incubus of dumb and greedy bowels on the shoulders of labouring humanity on that subject alone even to force the note might lean to virtues side it is to be hoped that a numerous and enterprising generation of writers will follow and surpass the present one but it would be better if the stream were stayed and the roll of our old honest english books were closed than that esurient bookmakers should continue and debase a brave tradition and lower in their own eyes a famous race better that our serene temples were deserted than filled with trafficking and juggling priests  there are two just reasons for the choice of any way of life the first is inbred taste in the chooser the second some high utility in the industry selected literature like any other art is singularly interesting to the artist and in a degree peculiar to itself among the arts it is useful to mankind these are the sufficient justifications for any young man or woman who adopts it as the business of his life i shall not say much about the wages a writer can live by his writing if not so luxuriously as by other trades then less luxuriously the nature of the work he does all day will more affect his happiness than the quality of his dinner at night whatever be your calling and however much it brings you in the year you could still you know get more by cheating we all suffer ourselves to be too much concerned about a little poverty but such considerations should not move us in the choice of that which is to be the business and justification of so great a portion of our lives and like the missionary the patriot or the philosopher we should all choose that poor and brave career in which we can do the most and best for mankind now nature faithfully followed proves herself a careful mother a lad for some liking to the jingle of words betakes himself to letters for his life byandby when he learns more gravity he finds that he has chosen better than he knew that if he earns little he is earning it amply that if he receives a small wage he is in a position to do considerable services that it is in his power in some small measure to protect the oppressed and to defend the truth so kindly is the world arranged such great profit may arise from a small degree of human reliance on oneself and such in particular is the happy star of this trade of writing that it should combine pleasure and profit to both parties and be at once agreeable like fiddling and useful like good preaching  this is to speak of literature at its highest and with the four great elders who are still spared to our respect and admiration with carlyle ruskin browning and tennyson before us it would be cowardly to consider it at first in any lesser aspect but while we cannot follow these athletes while we may none of us perhaps be very vigorous very original or very wise i still contend that in the humblest sort of literary work we have it in our power either to do great harm or great good we may seek merely to please we may seek having no higher gift merely to gratify the idle ninedays curiosity of our contemporaries or we may essay however feebly to instruct in each of these we shall have to deal with that remarkable art of words which because it is the dialect of life comes home so easily and powerfully to the minds of men and since that is so we contribute in each of these branches to build up the sum of sentiments and appreciations which goes by the name of public opinion or public feeling the total of a nations reading in these days of daily papers greatly modifies the total of the nations speech and the speech and reading taken together form the efficient educational medium of youth a good man or woman may keep a youth some little while in clearer air but the contemporary atmosphere is allpowerful in the end on the average of mediocre characters the copious corinthian baseness of the american reporter or the parisian chroniqueur both so lightly readable must exercise an incalculable influence for ill they touch upon all subjects and on all with the same ungenerous hand they begin the consideration of all in young and unprepared minds in an unworthy spirit on all they supply some pungency for dull people to quote the mere body of this ugly matter overwhelms the rarer utterances of good men the sneering the selfish and the cowardly are scattered in broad sheets on every table while the antidote in small volumes lies unread upon the shelf i have spoken of the american and the french not because they are so much baser but so much more readable than the english their evil is done more effectively in america for the masses in french for the few that care to read but with us as with them the duties of literature are daily neglected truth daily perverted and suppressed and grave subjects daily degraded in the treatment the journalist is not reckoned an important officer yet judge of the good he might do the harm he does judge of it by one instance only that when we find two journals on the reverse sides of politics each on the same day openly garbling a piece of news for the interest of its own party we smile at the discovery no discovery now as over a good joke and pardonable stratagem lying so open is scarce lying it is true but one of the things that we profess to teach our young is a respect for truth and i cannot think this piece of education will be crowned with any great success so long as some of us practise and the rest openly approve of public falsehood  there are two duties incumbent upon any man who enters on the business of writing truth to the fact and a good spirit in the treatment in every department of literature though so low as hardly to deserve the name truth to the fact is of importance to the education and comfort of mankind and so hard to preserve that the faithful trying to do so will lend some dignity to the man who tries it our judgments are based upon two things first upon the original preferences of our soul but second upon the mass of testimony to the nature of god man and the universe which reaches us in divers manners from without for the most part these divers manners are reducible to one all that we learn of past times and much that we learn of our own reaching us through the medium of books or papers and even he who cannot read learning from the same source at secondhand and by the report of him who can thus the sum of the contemporary knowledge or ignorance of good and evil is in large measure the handiwork of those who write those who write have to see that each mans knowledge is as near as they can make it answerable to the facts of life that he shall not suppose himself an angel or a monster nor take this world for a hell nor be suffered to imagine that all rights are concentred in his own caste or country or all veracities in his own parochial creed each man should learn what is within him that he may strive to mend he must be taught what is without him that he may be kind to others it can never be wrong to tell him the truth for in his disputable state weaving as he goes his theory of life steering himself cheering or reproving others all facts are of the first importance to his conduct and even if a fact shall discourage or corrupt him it is still best that he should know it for it is in this world as it is and not in a world made easy by educational suppressions that he must win his way to shame or glory in one word it must always be foul to tell what is false and it can never be safe to suppress what is true the very fact that you omit may be the fact which somebody was wanting for one mans meat is another mans poison and i have known a person who was cheered by the perusal of candide every fact is a part of that great puzzle we must set together and none that comes directly in a writers path but has some nice relations unperceivable by him to the totality and bearing of the subject under hand yet there are certain classes of fact eternally more necessary than others and it is with these that literature must first bestir itself they are not hard to distinguish nature once more easily leading us for the necessary because the efficacious facts are those which are most interesting to the natural mind of man those which are coloured picturesque human and rooted in morality and those on the other hand which are clear indisputable and a part of science are alone vital in importance seizing by their interest or useful to communicate so far as the writer merely narrates he should principally tell of these he should tell of the kind and wholesome and beautiful elements of our life he should tell unsparingly of the evil and sorrow of the present to move us with instances he should tell of wise and good people in the past to excite us by example and of these he should tell soberly and truthfully not glossing faults that we may neither grow discouraged with ourselves nor exacting to our neighbours so the body of contemporary literature ephemeral and feeble in itself touches in the minds of men the springs of thought and kindness and supports them for those who will go at all are easily supported on their way to what is true and right and if in any degree it does so now how much more might it do so if the writers chose there is not a life in all the records of the past but properly studied might lend a hint and a help to some contemporary there is not a juncture in todays affairs but some useful word may yet be said of it even the reporter has an office and with clear eyes and honest language may unveil injustices and point the way to progress and for a last word in all narration there is only one way to be clever and that is to be exact to be vivid is a secondary quality which must presuppose the first for vividly to convey a wrong impression is only to make failure conspicuous  but a fact may be viewed on many sides it may be chronicled with rage tears laughter indifference or admiration and by each of these the story will be transformed to something else the newspapers that told of the return of our representatives from berlin even if they had not differed as to the facts would have sufficiently differed by their spirit so that the one description would have been a second ovation and the other a prolonged insult the subject makes but a trifling part of any piece of literature and the view of the writer is itself a fact more important because less disputable than the others now this spirit in which a subject is regarded important in all kinds of literary work becomes allimportant in works of fiction meditation or rhapsody for there it not only colours but itself chooses the facts not only modifies but shapes the work and hence over the far larger proportion of the field of literature the health or disease of the writers mind or momentary humour forms not only the leading feature of his work but is at bottom the only thing he can communicate to others in all works of art widely speaking it is first of all the authors attitude that is narrated though in the attitude there be implied a whole experience and a theory of life an author who has begged the question and reposes in some narrow faith cannot if he would express the whole or even many of the sides of this various existence for his own life being maim some of them are not admitted in his theory and were only dimly and unwillingly recognised in his experience hence the smallness the triteness and the inhumanity in works of merely sectarian religion and hence we find equal although unsimilar limitations in works inspired by the spirit of the flesh or the despicable taste for high society so that the first duty of any man who is to write is intellectual designedly or not he has so far set himself up for a leader of the minds of men and he must see that his own mind is kept supple charitable and bright everything but prejudice should find a voice through him he should see the good in all things where he has even a fear that he does not wholly understand there he should be wholly silent and he should recognise from the first that he has only one tool in his workshop and that tool is sympathy28  the second duty far harder to define is moral there are a thousand different humours in the mind and about each of them when it is uppermost some literature tends to be deposited is this to be allowed not certainly in every case and yet perhaps in more than rigorists would fancy it were to be desired that all literary work and chiefly works of art issued from sound human healthy and potent impulses whether grave or laughing humorous romantic or religious yet it cannot be denied that some valuable books are partially insane some mostly religious partially inhuman and very many tainted with morbidity and impotence we do not loathe a masterpiece although we gird against its blemishes we are not above all to look for faults but merits there is no book perfect even in design but there are many that will delight improve or encourage the reader on the one hand the hebrew psalms are the only religious poetry on earth yet they contain sallies that savour rankly of the man of blood on the other hand alfred de musset had a poisoned and a contorted nature i am only quoting that generous and frivolous giant old dumas when i accuse him of a bad heart yet when the impulse under which he wrote was purely creative he could give us works like carmosine or fantasio in which the last note of the romantic comedy seems to have been found again to touch and please us when flaubert wrote madame bovary i believe he thought chiefly of a somewhat morbid realism and behold the book turned in his hands into a masterpiece of appalling morality but the truth is when books are conceived under a great stress with a soul of ninefold power nine times heated and electrified by effort the conditions of our being are seized with such an ample grasp that even should the main design be trivial or base some truth and beauty cannot fail to be expressed out of the strong comes forth sweetness but an ill thing poorly done is an ill thing top and bottom and so this can be no encouragement to knockkneed feeblewristed scribes who must take their business conscientiously or be ashamed to practise it  man is imperfect yet in his literature he must express himself and his own views and preferences for to do anything else is to do a far more perilous thing than to risk being immoral it is to be sure of being untrue to ape a sentiment even a good one is to travesty a sentiment that will not be helpful to conceal a sentiment if you are sure you hold it is to take a liberty with truth there is probably no point of view possible to a sane man but contains some truth and in the true connection might be profitable to the race i am not afraid of the truth if any one could tell it me but i am afraid of parts of it impertinently uttered there is a time to dance and a time to mourn to be harsh as well as to be sentimental to be ascetic as well as to glorify the appetites and if a man were to combine all these extremes into his work each in its place and proportion that work would be the worlds masterpiece of morality as well as of art partiality is immorality for any book is wrong that gives a misleading picture of the world and life the trouble is that the weakling must be partial the work of one proving dank and depressing of another cheap and vulgar of a third epileptically sensual of a fourth sourly ascetic in literature as in conduct you can never hope to do exactly right all you can do is to make as sure as possible and for that there is but one rule nothing should be done in a hurry that can be done slowly it is no use to write a book and put it by for nine or even ninety years for in the writing you will have partly convinced yourself the delay must precede any beginning and if you meditate a work of art you should first long roll the subject under the tongue to make sure you like the flavour before you brew a volume that shall taste of it from end to end or if you propose to enter on the field of controversy you should first have thought upon the question under all conditions in health as well as in sickness in sorrow as well as in joy it is this nearness of examination necessary for any true and kind writing that makes the practice of the art a prolonged and noble education for the writer  there is plenty to do plenty to say or to say over again in the meantime any literary work which conveys faithful facts or pleasing impressions is a service to the public it is even a service to be thankfully proud of having rendered the slightest novels are a blessing to those in distress not chloroform itself a greater our fine old seacaptains life was justified when carlyle soothed his mind with the kings own or newton forster to please is to serve and so far from its being difficult to instruct while you amuse it is difficult to do the one thoroughly without the other some part of the writer or his life will crop out in even a vapid book and to read a novel that was conceived with any force is to multiply experience and to exercise the sympathies every article every piece of verse every essay every entrefilet is destined to pass however swiftly through the minds of some portion of the public and to colour however transiently their thoughts when any subject falls to be discussed some scribbler on a paper has the invaluable opportunity of beginning its discussion in a dignified and human spirit and if there were enough who did so in our public press neither the public nor the parliament would find it in their minds to drop to meaner thoughts the writer has the chance to stumble by the way on something pleasing something interesting something encouraging were it only to a single reader he will be unfortunate indeed if he suit no one he has the chance besides to stumble on something that a dull person shall be able to comprehend and for a dull person to have read anything and for that once comprehended it makes a marking epoch in his education  here then is work worth doing and worth trying to do well and so if i were minded to welcome any great accession to our trade it should not be from any reason of a higher wage but because it was a trade which was useful in a very great and in a very high degree which every honest tradesman could make more serviceable to mankind in his single strength which was difficult to do well and possible to do better every year which called for scrupulous thought on the part of all who practised it and hence became a perpetual education to their nobler natures and which pay it as you please in the large majority of the best cases will still be underpaid for surely at this time of day in the nineteenth century there is nothing that an honest man should fear more timorously than getting and spending more than he deserves   footnotes    27 mr james payn    28 a footnote at least is due to the admirable example set before     all young writers in the width of literary sympathy displayed by mr     swinburne he runs forth to welcome merit whether in dickens or     trollope whether in villon milton or pope this is in criticism     the attitude we should all seek to preserve not only in that but     in every branch of literary work     v  books which have influenced me   the editor29 has somewhat insidiously laid a trap for his correspondents the question put appearing at first so innocent truly cutting so deep it is not indeed until after some reconnaissance and review that the writer awakes to find himself engaged upon something in the nature of autobiography or perhaps worse upon a chapter in the life of that little beautiful brother whom we once all had and whom we have all lost and mourned the man we ought to have been the man we hoped to be but when word has been passed even to an editor it should if possible be kept and if sometimes i am wise and say too little and sometimes weak and say too much the blame must lie at the door of the person who entrapped me  the most influential books and the truest in their influence are works of fiction they do not pin the reader to a dogma which he must afterwards discover to be inexact they do not teach him a lesson which he must afterwards unlearn they repeat they rearrange they clarify the lessons of life they disengage us from ourselves they constrain us to the acquaintance of others and they show us the web of experience not as we can see it for ourselves but with a singular changethat monstrous consuming ego of ours being for the nonce struck out to be so they must be reasonably true to the human comedy and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction but the course of our education is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters shakespeare has served me best few living friends have had upon me an influence so strong for good as hamlet or rosalind the last character already well beloved in the reading i had the good fortune to see i must think in an impressionable hour played by mrs scott siddons nothing has ever more moved more delighted more refreshed me nor has the influence quite passed away kents brief speech over the dying lear had a great effect upon my mind and was the burthen of my reflections for long so profoundly so touchingly generous did it appear in sense so overpowering in expression perhaps my dearest and best friend outside of shakespeare is dartagnanthe elderly dartagnan of the vicomte de bragelonne i know not a more human soul nor in his way a finer i shall be very sorry for the man who is so much of a pedant in morals that he cannot learn from the captain of musketeers lastly i must name the pilgrims progress a book that breathes of every beautiful and valuable emotion  but of works of art little can be said their influence is profound and silent like the influence of nature they mould by contact we drink them up like water and are bettered yet know not how it is in books more specifically didactic that we can follow out the effect and distinguish and weigh and compare a book which has been very influential upon me fell early into my hands and so may stand first though i think its influence was only sensible later on and perhaps still keeps growing for it is a book not easily outlived the essais of montaigne that temperate and genial picture of life is a great gift to place in the hands of persons of today they will find in these smiling pages a magazine of heroism and wisdom all of an antique strain they will have their linen decencies and excited orthodoxies fluttered and will if they have any gift of reading perceive that these have not been fluttered without some excuse and ground of reason and again if they have any gift of reading they will end by seeing that this old gentleman was in a dozen ways a finer fellow and held in a dozen ways a nobler view of life than they or their contemporaries  the next book in order of time to influence me was the new testament and in particular the gospel according to st matthew i believe it would startle and move any one if they could make a certain effort of imagination and read it freshly like a book not droningly and dully like a portion of the bible any one would then be able to see in it those truths which we are all courteously supposed to know and all modestly refrain from applying but upon this subject it is perhaps better to be silent  i come next to whitmans leaves of grass a book of singular service a book which tumbled the world upside down for me blew into space a thousand cobwebs of genteel and ethical illusion and having thus shaken my tabernacle of lies set me back again upon a strong foundation of all the original and manly virtues but it is once more only a book for those who have the gift of reading i will be very franki believe it is so with all good books except perhaps fiction the average man lives and must live so wholly in convention that gunpowder charges of the truth are more apt to discompose than to invigorate his creed either he cries out upon blasphemy and indecency and crouches the closer round that little idol of parttruths and partconveniences which is the contemporary deity or he is convinced by what is new forgets what is old and becomes truly blasphemous and indecent himself new truth is only useful to supplement the old rough truth is only wanted to expand not to destroy our civil and often elegant conventions he who cannot judge had better stick to fiction and the daily papers there he will get little harm and in the first at least some good  close upon the back of my discovery of whitman i came under the influence of herbert spencer no more persuasive rabbi exists and few better how much of his vast structure will bear the touch of time how much is clay and how much brass it were too curious to inquire but his words if dry are always manly and honest there dwells in his pages a spirit of highly abstract joy plucked naked like an algebraic symbol but still joyful and the reader will find there a caputmortuum of piety with little indeed of its loveliness but with most of its essentials and these two qualities make him a wholesome as his intellectual vigour makes him a bracing writer i should be much of a hound if i lost my gratitude to herbert spencer  goethes life by lewes had a great importance for me when it first fell into my handsa strange instance of the partiality of mans good and mans evil i know no one whom i less admire than goethe he seems a very epitome of the sins of genius breaking open the doors of private life and wantonly wounding friends in that crowning offence of werther and in his own character a mere penandink napoleon conscious of the rights and duties of superior talents as a spanish inquisitor was conscious of the rights and duties of his office and yet in his fine devotion to his art in his honest and serviceable friendship for schiller what lessons are contained biography usually so false to its office does here for once perform for us some of the work of fiction reminding us that is of the truly mingled tissue of mans nature and how huge faults and shining virtues cohabit and persevere in the same character history serves us well to this effect but in the originals not in the pages of the popular epitomiser who is bound by the very nature of his task to make us feel the difference of epochs instead of the essential identity of man and even in the originals only to those who can recognise their own human virtues and defects in strange forms often inverted and under strange names often interchanged martial is a poet of no good repute and it gives a man new thoughts to read his works dispassionately and find in this unseemly jesters serious passages the image of a kind wise and selfrespecting gentleman it is customary i suppose in reading martial to leave out these pleasant verses i never heard of them at least until i found them for myself and this partiality is one among a thousand things that help to build up our distorted and hysterical conception of the great roman empire  this brings us by a natural transition to a very noble bookthe meditations of marcus aurelius the dispassionate gravity the noble forgetfulness of self the tenderness of others that are there expressed and were practised on so great a scale in the life of its writer make this book a book quite by itself no one can read it and not be moved yet it scarcely or rarely appeals to the feelingsthose very mobile those not very trusty parts of man its address lies further back its lesson comes more deeply home when you have read you carry away with you a memory of the man himself it is as though you had touched a loyal hand looked into brave eyes and made a noble friend there is another bond on you thenceforward binding you to life and to the love of virtue  wordsworth should perhaps come next every one has been influenced by wordsworth and it is hard to tell precisely how a certain innocence a rugged austerity of joy a sight of the stars the silence that is in the lonely hills something of the cold thrill of dawn cling to his work and give it a particular address to what is best in us i do not know that you learn a lesson you need notmill did notagree with any one of his beliefs and yet the spell is cast such are the best teachers a dogma learned is only a new errorthe old one was perhaps as good but a spirit communicated is a perpetual possession these best teachers climb beyond teaching to the plane of art it is themselves and what is best in themselves that they communicate  i should never forgive myself if i forgot the egoist it is art if you like but it belongs purely to didactic art and from all the novels i have read and i have read thousands stands in a place by itself here is a nathan for the modern david here is a book to send the blood into mens faces satire the angry picture of human faults is not great art we can all be angry with our neighbour what we want is to be shown not his defects of which we are too conscious but his merits to which we are too blind and the egoist is a satire so much must be allowed but it is a satire of a singular quality which tells you nothing of that obvious mote which is engaged from first to last with that invisible beam it is yourself that is hunted down these are your own faults that are dragged into the day and numbered with lingering relish with cruel cunning and precision a young friend of mr merediths as i have the story came to him in an agony this is too bad of you he cried willoughby is me no my dear fellow said the author he is all of us i have read the egoist five or six times myself and i mean to read it again for i am like the young friend of the anecdotei think willoughby an unmanly but a very serviceable exposure of myself  i suppose when i am done i shall find that i have forgotten much that was most influential as i see already i have forgotten thoreau and hazlitt whose paper on the spirit of obligations was a turningpoint in my life and penn whose little book of aphorisms had a brief but strong effect on me and mitfords tales of old japan wherein i learned for the first time the proper attitude of any rational man to his countrys lawsa secret found and kept in the asiatic islands that i should commemorate all is more than i can hope or the editor could ask it will be more to the point after having said so much upon improving books to say a word or two about the improvable reader the gift of reading as i have called it is not very common nor very generally understood it consists first of all in a vast intellectual endowmenta free grace i find i must call itby which a man rises to understand that he is not punctually right nor those from whom he differs absolutely wrong he may hold dogmas he may hold them passionately and he may know that others hold them but coldly or hold them differently or hold them not at all well if he has the gift of reading these others will be full of meat for him they will see the other side of propositions and the other side of virtues he need not change his dogma for that but he may change his reading of that dogma and he must supplement and correct his deductions from it a human truth which is always very much a lie hides as much of life as it displays it is men who hold another truth or as it seems to us perhaps a dangerous lie who can extend our restricted field of knowledge and rouse our drowsy consciences something that seems quite new or that seems insolently false or very dangerous is the test of a reader if he tries to see what it means what truth excuses it he has the gift and let him read if he is merely hurt or offended or exclaims upon his authors folly he had better take to the daily papers he will never be a reader  and here with the aptest illustrative force after i have laid down my parttruth i must step in with its opposite for after all we are vessels of a very limited content not all men can read all books it is only in a chosen few that any man will find his appointed food and the fittest lessons are the most palatable and make themselves welcome to the mind a writer learns this early and it is his chief support he goes on unafraid laying down the law and he is sure at heart that most of what he says is demonstrably false and much of a mingled strain and some hurtful and very little good for service but he is sure besides that when his words fall into the hands of any genuine reader they will be weighed and winnowed and only that which suits will be assimilated and when they fall into the hands of one who cannot intelligently read they come there quite silent and inarticulate falling upon deaf ears and his secret is kept as if he had not written   footnote    29 of the british weekly     vi  the day after tomorrow   history is much decried it is a tissue of errors we are told no doubt correctly and rival historians expose each others blunders with gratification yet the worst historian has a clearer view of the period he studies than the best of us can hope to form of that in which we live the obscurest epoch is today and that for a thousand reasons of inchoate tendency conflicting report and sheer mass and multiplicity of experience but chiefly perhaps by reason of an insidious shifting of landmarks parties and ideas continually move but not by measurable marches on a stable course the political soil itself steals forth by imperceptible degrees like a travelling glacier carrying on its bosom not only political parties but their flagposts and cantonments so that what appears to be an eternal city founded on hills is but a flying island of laputa it is for this reason in particular that we are all becoming socialists without knowing it by which i would not in the least refer to the acute case of mr hyndman and his hornblowing supporters sounding their trumps of a sunday within the walls of our individualist jerichobut to the stealthy change that has come over the spirit of englishmen and english legislation a little while ago and we were still for liberty crowd a few more thousands on the bench of government we seemed to cry keep her head direct on liberty and we cannot help but come to port this is over laisser faire declines in favour our legislation grows authoritative grows philanthropical bristles with new duties and new penalties and casts a spawn of inspectors who now begin notebook in hand to darken the face of england it may be right or wrong we are not trying that but one thing it is beyond doubt it is socialism in action and the strange thing is that we scarcely know it  liberty has served us a long while and it may be time to seek new altars like all other principles she has been proved to be selfexclusive in the long run she has taken wages besides like all other virtues and dutifully served mammon so that many things we were accustomed to admire as the benefits of freedom and common to all were truly benefits of wealth and took their value from our neighbours poverty a few shocks of logic a few disclosures in the journalistic phrase of what the freedom of manufacturers landlords or shipowners may imply for operatives tenants or seamen and we not unnaturally begin to turn to that other pole of hope beneficent tyranny freedom to be desirable involves kindness wisdom and all the virtues of the free but the free man as we have seen him in action has been as of yore only the master of many helots and the slaves are still illfed illclad illtaught illhoused insolently treated and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of famine so much in other mens affairs we have begun to see clearly we have begun to despair of virtue in these other men and from our seat in parliament begin to discharge upon them thick as arrows the host of our inspectors the landlord has long shaken his head over the manufacturer those who do business on land have lost all trust in the virtues of the shipowner the professions look askance upon the retail traders and have even started their cooperative stores to ruin them and from out the smokewreaths of birmingham a finger has begun to write upon the wall the condemnation of the landlord thus piece by piece do we condemn each other and yet not perceive the conclusion that our whole estate is somewhat damnable thus piece by piece each acting against his neighbour each sawing away the branch on which some other interest is seated do we apply in detail our socialistic remedies and yet not perceive that we are all labouring together to bring in socialism at large a tendency so stupid and so selfish is like to prove invincible and if socialism be at all a practicable rule of life there is every chance that our grandchildren will see the day and taste the pleasures of existence in something far liker an antheap than any previous human polity and this not in the least because of the voice of mr hyndman or the horns of his followers but by the mere glacier movement of the political soil bearing forward on its bosom apparently undisturbed the proud camps of whig and tory if mr hyndman were a man of keen humour which is far from my conception of his character he might rest from his troubling and look on the walls of jericho begin already to crumble and dissolve that great servile war the armageddon of money and numbers to which we looked forward when young becomes more and more unlikely and we may rather look to see a peaceable and blindfold evolution the work of dull men immersed in political tactics and dead to political results  the principal scene of this comedy lies of course in the house of commons it is there besides that the details of this new evolution if it proceed will fall to be decided so that the state of parliament is not only diagnostic of the present but fatefully prophetic of the future well we all know what parliament is and we are all ashamed of it we may pardon it some faults indeed on the ground of irish obstructiona bitter trial which it supports with notable good humour but the excuse is merely local it cannot apply to similar bodies in america and france and what are we to say of these president clevelands letter may serve as a picture of the one a glance at almost any paper will convince us of the weakness of the other decay appears to have seized on the organ of popular government in every land and this just at the moment when we begin to bring to it as to an oracle of justice the whole skein of our private affairs to be unravelled and ask it like a new messiah to take upon itself our frailties and play for us the part that should be played by our own virtues for that in few words is the case we cannot trust ourselves to behave with decency we cannot trust our consciences and the remedy proposed is to elect a round number of our neighbours pretty much at random and say to these be ye our conscience make laws so wise and continue from year to year to administer them so wisely that they shall save us from ourselves and make us righteous and happy world without end amen and who can look twice at the british parliament and then seriously bring it such a task i am not advancing this as an argument against socialism once again nothing is further from my mind there are great truths in socialism or no one not even mr hyndman would be found to hold it and if it came and did onetenth part of what it offers i for one should make it welcome but if it is to come we may as well have some notion of what it will be like and the first thing to grasp is that our new polity will be designed and administered to put it courteously with something short of inspiration it will be made or will grow in a human parliament and the one thing that will not very hugely change is human nature the anarchists think otherwise from which it is only plain that they have not carried to the study of history the lamp of human sympathy  given then our new polity with its new waggonload of laws what headmarks must we look for in the life we chafe a good deal at that excellent thing the incometax because it brings into our affairs the prying fingers and exposes us to the tart words of the official the official in all degrees is already something of a terror to many of us i would not willingly have to do with even a policeconstable in any other spirit than that of kindness i still remember in my dreams the eyeglass of a certain attaché at a certain embassyan eyeglass that was a standing indignity to all on whom it looked and my next most disagreeable remembrance is of a bracing republican postman in the city of san francisco i lived in that city among working folk and what my neighbours accepted at the postmans handsnay what i took from him myselfit is still distasteful to recall the bourgeois residing in the upper parts of society has but few opportunities of tasting this peculiar bowl but about the incometax as i have said or perhaps about a patent or in the halls of an embassy at the hands of my friend of the eyeglass he occasionally sets his lips to it and he may thus imagine if he has that faculty of imagination without which most faculties are void how it tastes to his poorer neighbours who must drain it to the dregs in every contact with authority with their employer with the police with the school board officer in the hospital or in the workhouse they have equally the occasion to appreciate the lighthearted civility of the man in office and as an experimentalist in several outoftheway provinces of life i may say it has but to be felt to be appreciated well this golden age of which we are speaking will be the golden age of officials in all our concerns it will be their beloved duty to meddle with what tact with what obliging words analogy will aid us to imagine it is likely these gentlemen will be periodically elected they will therefore have their turn of being underneath which does not always sweeten mens conditions the laws they will have to administer will be no clearer than those we know today and the body which is to regulate their administration no wiser than the british parliament so that upon all hands we may look for a form of servitude most galling to the bloodservitude to many and changing masters and for all the slights that accompany the rule of jackinoffice and if the socialistic programme be carried out with the least fulness we shall have lost a thing in most respects not much to be regretted but as a moderator of oppression a thing nearly invaluablethe newspaper for the independent journal is a creature of capital and competition it stands and falls with millionaires and railway bonds and all the abuses and glories of today and as soon as the state has fairly taken its bent to authority and philanthropy and laid the least touch on private property the days of the independent journal are numbered state railways may be good things and so may state bakeries but a state newspaper will never be a very trenchant critic of the state officials  but again these officials would have no sinecure crime would perhaps be less for some of the motives of crime we may suppose would pass away but if socialism were carried out with any fulness there would be more contraventions we see already new sins springing up like mustardschool board sins factory sins merchant shipping act sinsnone of which i would be thought to except against in particular but all of which taken together show us that socialism can be a hard master even in the beginning if it go on to such heights as we hear proposed and lauded if it come actually to its ideal of the antheap ruled with iron justice the number of new contraventions will be out of all proportion multiplied take the case of work alone man is an idle animal he is at least as intelligent as the ant but generations of advisers have in vain recommended him the ants example of those who are found truly indefatigable in business some are misers some are the practisers of delightful industries like gardening some are students artists inventors or discoverers men lured forward by successive hopes and the rest are those who live by games of skill or hazardfinanciers billiardplayers gamblers and the like but in unloved toils even under the prick of necessity no man is continually sedulous once eliminate the fear of starvation once eliminate or bound the hope of riches and we shall see plenty of skulking and malingering society will then be something not wholly unlike a cotton plantation in the old days with cheerful careless demoralised slaves with elected overseers and instead of the planter a chaotic popular assembly if the blood be purposeful and the soil strong such a plantation may succeed and be indeed a busy antheap with full granaries and long hours of leisure but even then i think the whip will be in the overseers hands and not in vain for when it comes to be a question of each man doing his own share or the rest doing more prettiness of sentiment will be forgotten to dock the skulkers food is not enough many will rather eat haws and starve on petty pilferings than put their shoulder to the wheel for one hour daily for such as these then the whip will be in the overseers hand and his own sense of justice and the superintendence of a chaotic popular assembly will be the only checks on its employment now you may be an industrious man and a good citizen and yet not love nor yet be loved by dr fell the inspector it is admitted by private soldiers that the disfavour of a sergeant is an evil not to be combated offend the sergeant they say and in a brief while you will either be disgraced or have deserted and the sergeant can no longer appeal to the lash but if these things go on we shall see or our sons shall see what it is to have offended an inspector  this for the unfortunate but with the fortunate also even those whom the inspector loves it may not be altogether well it is concluded that in such a state of society supposing it to be financially sound the level of comfort will be high it does not follow there are strange depths of idleness in man a tooeasilygot sufficiency as in the case of the sagoeaters often quenching the desire for all besides and it is possible that the men of the richest antheaps may sink even into squalor but suppose they do not suppose our tricksy instrument of human nature when we play upon it this new tune should respond kindly suppose no one to be damped and none exasperated by the new conditions the whole enterprise to be financially sounda vaulting suppositionand all the inhabitants to dwell together in a golden mean of comfort we have yet to ask ourselves if this be what man desire or if it be what man will even deign to accept for a continuance it is certain that man loves to eat it is not certain that he loves that only or that best he is supposed to love comfort it is not a love at least that he is faithful to he is supposed to love happiness it is my contention that he rather loves excitement danger enterprise hope the novel the aleatory are dearer to man than regular meals he does not think so when he is hungry but he thinks so again as soon as he is fed and on the hypothesis of a successful antheap he would never go hungry it would be always after dinner in that society as in the land of the lotoseaters it was always afternoon and food which when we have it not seems allimportant drops in our esteem as soon as we have it to a mere prerequisite of living  that for which man lives is not the same thing for all individuals nor in all ages yet it has a common base what he seeks and what he must have is that which will seize and hold his attention regular meals and weatherproof lodgings will not do this long play in its wide sense as the artificial induction of sensation including all games and all arts will indeed go far to keep him conscious of himself but in the end he wearies for realities study or experiment to some rare natures is the unbroken pastime of a life these are enviable natures people shut in the house by sickness often bitterly envy them but the commoner man cannot continue to exist upon such altitudes his feet itch for physical adventure his blood boils for physical dangers pleasures and triumphs his fancy the looker after new things cannot continue to look for them in books and crucibles but must seek them on the breathing stage of life pinches buffets the glow of hope the shock of disappointment furious contention with obstacles these are the true elixir for all vital spirits these are what they seek alike in their romantic enterprises and their unromantic dissipations when they are taken in some pinch closer than the common they cry catch me here again and sure enough you catch them there againperhaps before the week is out it is as old as robinson crusoe as old as man our race has not been strained for all these ages through that sieve of dangers that we call natural selection to sit down with patience in the tedium of safety the voices of its fathers call it forth already in our society as it exists the bourgeois is too much cottoned about for any zest in living he sits in his parlour out of reach of any danger often out of reach of any vicissitude but one of health and there he yawns if the people in the next villa took potshots at him he might be killed indeed but so long as he escaped he would find his blood oxygenated and his views of the world brighter if mr mallock on his way to the publishers should have his skirts pinned to a wall by a javelin it would not occur to himat least for several hoursto ask if life were worth living and if such peril were a daily matter he would ask it never more he would have other things to think about he would be living indeednot lying in a box with cotton safe but immeasurably dull the aleatory whether it touch life or fortune or renownwhether we explore africa or only toss for halfpencethat is what i conceive men to love best and that is what we are seeking to exclude from mens existences of all forms of the aleatory that which most commonly attends our working menthe danger of misery from want of workis the least inspiriting it does not whip the blood it does not evoke the glory of contest it is tragic but it is passive and yet in so far as it is aleatory and a peril sensibly touching them it does truly season the mens lives of those who fail i do not speakdespair should be sacred but to those who even modestly succeed the changes of their life bring interest a job found a shilling saved a dainty earned all these are wells of pleasure springing afresh for the successful poor and it is not from these but from the villadweller that we hear complaints of the unworthiness of life much then as the average of the proletariat would gain in this new state of life they would also lose a certain something which would not be missed in the beginning but would be missed progressively and progressively lamented soon there would be a looking back there would be tales of the old world humming in young mens ears tales of the tramp and the pedlar and the hopeful emigrant and in the stallfed life of the successful antheapwith its regular meals regular duties regular pleasures an even course of life and fear excludedthe vicissitudes delights and havens of today will seem of epic breadth this may seem a shallow observation but the springs by which men are moved lie much on the surface bread i believe has always been considered first but the circus comes close upon its heels bread we suppose to be given amply the cry for circuses will be the louder and if the life of our descendants be such as we have conceived there are two beloved pleasures on which they will be likely to fall back the pleasures of intrigue and of sedition  in all this i have supposed the antheap to be financially sound i am no economist only a writer of fiction but even as such i know one thing that bears on the economic questioni know the imperfection of mans faculty for business the anarchists who count some rugged elements of commonsense among what seem to me their tragic errors have said upon this matter all that i could wish to say and condemned beforehand great economical polities so far it is obvious that they are right they may be right also in predicting a period of communal independence and they may even be right in thinking that desirable but the rise of communes is none the less the end of economic equality just when we were told it was beginning communes will not be all equal in extent nor in quality of soil nor in growth of population nor will the surplus produce of all be equally marketable it will be the old story of competing interests only with a new unit and as it appears to me a new inevitable danger for the merchant and the manufacturer in this new world will be a sovereign commune it is a sovereign power that will see its crops undersold and its manufactures worsted in the market and all the more dangerous that the sovereign power should be small great powers are slow to stir national affronts even with the aid of newspapers filter slowly into popular consciousness national losses are so unequally shared that one part of the population will be counting its gains while another sits by a cold hearth but in the sovereign commune all will be centralised and sensitive when jealousy springs up when let us say the commune of poole has overreached the commune of dorchester irritation will run like quicksilver throughout the body politic each man in dorchester will have to suffer directly in his diet and his dress even the secretary who drafts the official correspondence will sit down to his task embittered as a man who has dined ill and may expect to dine worse and thus a business difference between communes will take on much the same colour as a dispute between diggers in the lawless west and will lead as directly to the arbitrament of blows so that the establishment of the communal system will not only reintroduce all the injustices and heartburnings of economic inequality but will in all human likelihood inaugurate a world of hedgerow warfare dorchester will march on poole sherborne on dorchester wimborne on both the waggons will be fired on as they follow the highway the trains wrecked on the lines the ploughman will go armed into the field of tillage and if we have not a return of ballad literature the local press at least will celebrate in a high vein the victory of cerne abbas or the reverse of toller porcorum at least this will not be dull when i was younger i could have welcomed such a world with relief but it is the newold with a vengeance and irresistibly suggests the growth of military powers and the foundation of new empires     vii  letter to a young gentleman who proposes to embrace the career of art   with the agreeable frankness of youth you address me on a point of some practical importance to yourself and it is even conceivable of some gravity to the world should you or should you not become an artist it is one which you must decide entirely for yourself all that i can do is to bring under your notice some of the materials of that decision and i will begin as i shall probably conclude also by assuring you that all depends on the vocation  to know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age youth is wholly experimental the essence and charm of that unquiet and delightful epoch is ignorance of self as well as ignorance of life these two unknowns the young man brings together again and again now in the airiest touch now with a bitter hug now with exquisite pleasure now with cutting pain but never with indifference to which he is a total stranger and never with that near kinsman of indifference contentment if he be a youth of dainty senses or a brain easily heated the interest of this series of experiments grows upon him out of all proportion to the pleasure he receives it is not beauty that he loves nor pleasure that he seeks though he may think so his design and his sufficient reward is to verify his own existence and taste the variety of human fate to him before the razoredge of curiosity is dulled all that is not actual living and the hot chase of experience wears a face of a disgusting dryness difficult to recall in later days or if there be any exceptionand here destiny steps init is in those moments when wearied or surfeited of the primary activity of the senses he calls up before memory the image of transacted pains and pleasures thus it is that such an one shies from all cutanddry professions and inclines insensibly toward that career of art which consists only in the tasting and recording of experience  this which is not so much a vocation for art as an impatience of all other honest trades frequently exists alone and so existing it will pass gently away in the course of years emphatically it is not to be regarded it is not a vocation but a temptation and when your father the other day so fiercely and in my view so properly discouraged your ambition he was recalling not improbably some similar passage in his own experience for the temptation is perhaps nearly as common as the vocation is rare but again we have vocations which are imperfect we have men whose minds are bound up not so much in any art as in the general ars artium and common base of all creative work who will now dip into painting and now study counterpoint and anon will be inditing a sonnet all these with equal interest all often with genuine knowledge and of this temper when it stands alone i find it difficult to speak but i should counsel such an one to take to letters for in literature which drags with so wide a net all his information may be found some day useful and if he should go on as he has begun and turn at last into the critic he will have learned to use the necessary tools lastly we come to those vocations which are at once decisive and precise to the men who are born with the love of pigments the passion of drawing the gift of music or the impulse to create with words just as other and perhaps the same men are born with the love of hunting or the sea or horses or the turninglathe these are predestined if a man love the labour of any trade apart from any question of success or fame the gods have called him he may have the general vocation too he may have a taste for all the arts and i think he often has but the mark of his calling is this laborious partiality for one this inextinguishable zest in its technical successes and perhaps above all a certain candour of mind to take his very trifling enterprise with a gravity that would befit the cares of empire and to think the smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any expense of time and industry the book the statue the sonata must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the unflagging spirit of children at their play is it worth doingwhen it shall have occurred to any artist to ask himself that question it is implicitly answered in the negative it does not occur to the child as he plays at being a pirate on the diningroom sofa nor to the hunter as he pursues his quarry and the candour of the one and the ardour of the other should be united in the bosom of the artist  if you recognise in yourself some such decisive taste there is no room for hesitation follow your bent and observe lest i should too much discourage you that the disposition does not usually burn so brightly at the first or rather not so constantly habit and practice sharpen gifts the necessity of toil grows less disgusting grows even welcome in the course of years a small taste if it be only genuine waxes with indulgence into an exclusive passion enough just now if you can look back over a fair interval and see that your chosen art has a little more than held its own among the thronging interests of youth time will do the rest if devotion help it and soon your every thought will be engrossed in that beloved occupation  but even with devotion you may remind me even with unfaltering and delighted industry many thousand artists spend their lives if the result be regarded utterly in vain a thousand artists and never one work of art but the vast mass of mankind are incapable of doing anything reasonably well art among the rest the worthless artist would not improbably have been a quite incompetent baker and the artist even if he does not amuse the public amuses himself so that there will always be one man the happier for his vigils this is the practical side of art its inexpugnable fortress for the true practitioner the direct returnsthe wages of the tradeare small but the indirectthe wages of the lifeare incalculably great no other business offers a man his daily bread upon such joyful terms the soldier and the explorer have moments of a worthier excitement but they are purchased by cruel hardships and periods of tedium that beggar language in the life of the artist there need be no hour without its pleasure i take the author with whose career i am best acquainted and it is true he works in a rebellious material and that the act of writing is cramped and trying both to the eyes and the temper but remark him in his study when matter crowds upon him and words are not wantingin what a continual series of small successes time flows by with what a sense of power as of one moving mountains he marshals his petty characters with what pleasures both of the ear and eye he sees his airy structure growing on the page and how he labours in a craft to which the whole material of his life is tributary and which opens a door to all his tastes his loves his hatreds and his convictions so that what he writes is only what he longed to utter he may have enjoyed many things in this big tragic playground of the world but what shall he have enjoyed more fully than a morning of successful work suppose it illpaid the wonder is it should be paid at all other men pay and pay dearly for pleasures less desirable  nor will the practice of art afford you pleasure only it affords besides an admirable training for the artist works entirely upon honour the public knows little or nothing of those merits in the quest of which you are condemned to spend the bulk of your endeavours merits of design the merit of firsthand energy the merit of a certain cheap accomplishment which a man of the artistic temper easily acquiresthese they can recognise and these they value but to those more exquisite refinements of proficiency and finish which the artist so ardently desires and so keenly feels for which in the vigorous words of balzac he must toil like a miner buried in a landslip for which day after day he recasts and revises and rejectsthe gross mass of the public must be ever blind to those lost pains suppose you attain the highest pitch of merit posterity may possibly do justice suppose as is so probable you fail by even a hairs breadth of the highest rest certain they shall never be observed under the shadow of this cold thought alone in his studio the artist must preserve from day to day his constancy to the ideal it is this which makes his life noble it is by this that the practice of his craft strengthens and matures his character it is for this that even the serious countenance of the great emperor was turned approvingly if only for a moment on the followers of apollo and that sternly gentle voice bade the artist cherish his art  and here there fall two warnings to be made first if you are to continue to be a law to yourself you must beware of the first signs of laziness this idealism in honesty can only be supported by perpetual effort the standard is easily lowered the artist who says it will do is on the downward path three or four potboilers are enough at times above all at wrong times to falsify a talent and by the practice of journalism a man runs the risk of becoming wedded to cheap finish this is the danger on the one side there is not less upon the other the consciousness of how much the artist is and must be a law to himself debauches the small heads perceiving recondite merits very hard to attain making or swallowing artistic formulæ or perhaps falling in love with some particular proficiency of his own many artists forget the end of all art to please it is doubtless tempting to exclaim against the ignorant bourgeois yet it should not be forgotten it is he who is to pay us and that surely on the face of it for services that he shall desire to have performed here also if properly considered there is a question of transcendental honesty to give the public what they do not want and yet expect to be supported we have there a strange pretension and yet not uncommon above all with painters the first duty in this world is for a man to pay his way when that is quite accomplished he may plunge into what eccentricity he likes but emphatically not till then till then he must pay assiduous court to the bourgeois who carries the purse and if in the course of these capitulations he shall falsify his talent it can never have been a strong one and he will have preserved a better thing than talentcharacter or if he be of a mind so independent that he cannot stoop to this necessity one course is yet open he can desist from art and follow some more manly way of life  i speak of a more manly way of life it is a point on which i must be frank to live by a pleasure is not a high calling it involves patronage however veiled it numbers the artist however ambitious along with dancing girls and billiardmarkers the french have a romantic evasion for one employment and call its practitioners the daughters of joy the artist is of the same family he is of the sons of joy chose his trade to please himself gains his livelihood by pleasing others and has parted with something of the sterner dignity of man journals but a little while ago declaimed against the tennyson peerage and this son of joy was blamed for condescension when he followed the example of lord lawrence and lord cairns and lord clyde the poet was more happily inspired with a better modesty he accepted the honour and anonymous journalists have not yet if i am to believe them recovered the vicarious disgrace to their profession when it comes to their turn these gentlemen can do themselves more justice and i shall be glad to think of it for to my barbarian eyesight even lord tennyson looks somewhat out of place in that assembly there should be no honours for the artist he has already in the practice of his art more than his share of the rewards of life the honours are preempted for other trades less agreeable and perhaps more useful  but the devil in these trades of pleasing is to fail to please in ordinary occupations a man offers to do a certain thing or to produce a certain article with a merely conventional accomplishment a design in which we may almost say it is difficult to fail but the artist steps forth out of the crowd and proposes to delight an impudent design in which it is impossible to fail without odious circumstances the poor daughter of joy carrying her smiles and finery quite unregarded through the crowd makes a figure which it is impossible to recall without a wounding pity she is the type of the unsuccessful artist the actor the dancer and the singer must appear like her in person and drain publicly the cup of failure but though the rest of us escape this crowning bitterness of the pillory we all court in essence the same humiliation we all profess to be able to delight and how few of us are we all pledge ourselves to be able to continue to delight and the day will come to each and even to the most admired when the ardour shall have declined and the cunning shall be lost and he shall sit by his deserted booth ashamed then shall he see himself condemned to do work for which he blushes to take payment then as if his lot were not already cruel he must lie exposed to the gibes of the wreckers of the press who earn a little bitter bread by the condemnation of trash which they have not read and the praise of excellence which they cannot understand  and observe that this seems almost the necessary end at least of writers les blancs et les bleus for instance is of an order of merit very different from le vicomte de bragelonne and if any gentleman can bear to spy upon the nakedness of castle dangerous his name i think is ham let it be enough for the rest of us to read of it not without tears in the pages of lockhart thus in old age when occupation and comfort are most needful the writer must lay aside at once his pastime and his breadwinner the painter indeed if he succeed at all in engaging the attention of the public gains great sums and can stand to his easel until a great age without dishonourable failure the writer has the double misfortune to be illpaid while he can work and to be incapable of working when he is old it is thus a way of life which conducts directly to a false position  for the writer in spite of notorious examples to the contrary must look to be illpaid tennyson and montépin make handsome livelihoods but we cannot all hope to be tennyson and we do not all perhaps desire to be montépin if you adopt an art to be your trade weed your mind at the outset of all desire of money what you may decently expect if you have some talent and much industry is such an income as a clerk will earn with a tenth or perhaps a twentieth of your nervous output nor have you the right to look for more in the wages of the life not in the wages of the trade lies your reward the work is here the wages it will be seen i have little sympathy with the common lamentations of the artist class perhaps they do not remember the hire of the field labourer or do they think no parallel will lie perhaps they have never observed what is the retiring allowance of a field officer or do they suppose their contributions to the arts of pleasing more important than the services of a colonel perhaps they forget on how little millet was content to live or do they think because they have less genius they stand excused from the display of equal virtues but upon one point there should be no dubiety if a man be not frugal he has no business in the arts if he be not frugal he steers directly for that last tragic scene of le vieux saltimbanque if he be not frugal he will find it hard to continue to be honest some day when the butcher is knocking at the door he may be tempted he may be obliged to turn out and sell a slovenly piece of work if the obligation shall have arisen through no wantonness of his own he is even to be commended for words cannot describe how far more necessary it is that a man should support his family than that he should attain toor preservedistinction in the arts but if the pressure comes through his own fault he has stolen and stolen under trust and stolen which is the worst of all in such a way that no law can reach him  and now you may perhaps ask me whetherif the débutant artist is to have no thought of money and if as is implied he is to expect no honours from the statehe may not at least look forward to the delights of popularity praise you will tell me is a savoury dish and in so far as you may mean the countenance of other artists you would put your finger on one of the most essential and enduring pleasures of the career of art but in so far as you should have an eye to the commendations of the public or the notice of the newspapers be sure you would but be cherishing a dream it is true that in certain esoteric journals the author for instance is duly criticised and that he is often praised a great deal more than he deserves sometimes for qualities which he prided himself on eschewing and sometimes by ladies and gentlemen who have denied themselves the privilege of reading his work but if a man be sensitive to this wild praise we must suppose him equally alive to that which often accompanies and always follows itwild ridicule a man may have done well for years and then he may fail he will hear of his failure or he may have done well for years and still do well but the critics may have tired of praising him or there may have sprung up some new idol of the instant some dust a little gilt to whom they now prefer to offer sacrifice here is the obverse and the reverse of that empty and ugly thing called popularity will any man suppose it worth the gaining     viii  pulvis et umbra   we look for some reward of our endeavours and are disappointed not success not happiness not even peace of conscience crowns our ineffectual efforts to do well our frailties are invincible our virtues barren the battle goes sore against us to the going down of the sun the canting moralist tells us of right and wrong and we look abroad even on the face of our small earth and find them change with every climate and no country where some action is not honoured for a virtue and none where it is not branded for a vice and we look in our experience and find no vital congruity in the wisest rules but at the best a municipal fitness it is not strange if we are tempted to despair of good we ask too much our religions and moralities have been trimmed to flatter us till they are all emasculate and sentimentalised and only please and weaken truth is of a rougher strain in the harsh face of life faith can read a bracing gospel the human race is a thing more ancient than the ten commandments and the bones and revolutions of the kosmos in whose joints we are but moss and fungus more ancient still     i  of the kosmos in the last resort science reports many doubtful things and all of them appalling there seems no substance to this solid globe on which we stamp nothing but symbols and ratios symbols and ratios carry us and bring us forth and beat us down gravity that swings the incommensurable suns and worlds through space is but a figment varying inversely as the squares of distances and the suns and worlds themselves imponderable figures of abstraction nh3 and h2o consideration dares not dwell upon this view that way madness lies science carries us into zones of speculation where there is no habitable city for the mind of man  but take the kosmos with a grosser faith as our senses give it us we behold space sown with rotatory islands suns and worlds and the shards and wrecks of systems some like the sun still blazing some rotting like the earth others like the moon stable in desolation all of these we take to be made of something we call matter a thing which no analysis can help us to conceive to whose incredible properties no familiarity can reconcile our minds this stuff when not purified by the lustration of fire rots uncleanly into something we call life seized through all its atoms with a pediculous malady swelling in tumours that become independent sometimes even by an abhorrent prodigy locomotory one splitting into millions millions cohering into one as the malady proceeds through varying stages this vital putrescence of the dust used as we are to it yet strikes us with occasional disgust and the profusion of worms in a piece of ancient turf or the air of a marsh darkened with insects will sometimes check our breathing so that we aspire for cleaner places but none is clean the moving sand is infected with lice the pure spring where it bursts out of the mountain is a mere issue of worms even in the hard rock the crystal is forming  in two main shapes this eruption covers the countenance of the earth the animal and the vegetable one in some degree the inversion of the other the second rooted to the spot the first coming detached out of its natal mud and scurrying abroad with the myriad feet of insects or towering into the heavens on the wings of birds a thing so inconceivable that if it be well considered the heart stops to what passes with the anchored vermin we have little clue doubtless they have their joys and sorrows their delights and killing agonies it appears not how but of the locomotory to which we ourselves belong we can tell more these share with us a thousand miracles the miracles of sight of hearing of the projection of sound things that bridge space the miracles of memory and reason by which the present is conceived and when it is gone its image kept living in the brains of man and brute the miracle of reproduction with its imperious desires and staggering consequences and to put the last touch upon this mountain mass of the revolting and the inconceivable all these prey upon each other lives tearing other lives in pieces cramming them inside themselves and by that summary process growing fat the vegetarian the whale perhaps the tree not less than the lion of the desert for the vegetarian is only the eater of the dumb  meanwhile our rotary island loaded with predatory life and more drenched with blood both animal and vegetable than ever mutinied ship scuds through space with unimaginable speed and turns alternate cheeks to the reverberation of a blazing world ninety million miles away     ii  what a monstrous spectre is this man the disease of the agglutinated dust lifting alternate feet or lying drugged with slumber killing feeding growing bringing forth small copies of himself grown upon with hair like grass fitted with eyes that move and glitter in his face a thing to set children screamingand yet looked at nearlier known as his fellows know him how surprising are his attributes poor soul here for so little cast among so many hardships filled with desires so incommensurate and so inconsistent savagely surrounded savagely descended irremediably condemned to prey upon his fellow lives who should have blamed him had he been of a piece with his destiny and a being merely barbarous and we look and behold him instead filled with imperfect virtues infinitely childish often admirably valiant often touchingly kind sitting down amidst his momentary life to debate of right and wrong and the attributes of the deity rising up to do battle for an egg or die for an idea singling out his friends and his mate with cordial affection bringing forth in pain rearing with longsuffering solicitude his young to touch the heart of his mystery we find in him one thought strange to the point of lunacy the thought of duty the thought of something owing to himself to his neighbour to his god an ideal of decency to which he would rise if it were possible a limit of shame below which if it be possible he will not stoop the design in most men is one of conformity here and there in picked natures it transcends itself and soars on the other side arming martyrs with independence but in all in their degrees it is a bosom thoughtnot in man alone for we trace it in dogs and cats whom we know fairly well and doubtless some similar point of honour sways the elephant the oyster and the louse of whom we know so littlebut in man at least it sways with so complete an empire that merely selfish things come second even with the selfish that appetites are starved fears are conquered pains supported that almost the dullest shrinks from the reproof of a glance although it were a childs and all but the most cowardly stand amid the risks of war and the more noble having strongly conceived an act as due to their ideal affront and embrace death strange enough if with their singular origin and perverted practice they think they are to be rewarded in some future life stranger still if they are persuaded of the contrary and think this blow which they solicit will strike them senseless for eternity i shall be reminded what a tragedy of misconception and misconduct man at large presents of organised injustice cowardly violence and treacherous crime and of the damning imperfections of the best they cannot be too darkly drawn man is indeed marked for failure in his efforts to do right but where the best consistently miscarry how tenfold more remarkable that all should continue to strive and surely we should find it both touching and inspiriting that in a field from which success is banished our race should not cease to labour  if the first view of this creature stalking in his rotatory isle be a thing to shake the courage of the stoutest on this nearer sight he startles us with an admiring wonder it matters not where we look under what climate we observe him in what stage of society in what depth of ignorance burthened with what erroneous morality by campfires in assiniboia the snow powdering his shoulders the wind plucking his blanket as he sits passing the ceremonial calumet and uttering his grave opinions like a roman senator in ships at sea a man inured to hardship and vile pleasures his brightest hope a fiddle in a tavern and a bedizened trull who sells herself to rob him and he for all that simple innocent cheerful kindly like a child constant to toil brave to drown for others in the slums of cities moving among indifferent millions to mechanical employments without hope of change in the future with scarce a pleasure in the present and yet true to his virtues honest up to his lights kind to his neighbours tempted perhaps in vain by the bright ginpalace perhaps longsuffering with the drunken wife that ruins him in india a woman this time kneeling with broken cries and streaming tears as she drowns her child in the sacred river in the brothel the discard of society living mainly on strong drink fed with affronts a fool a thief the comrade of thieves and even here keeping the point of honour and the touch of pity often repaying the worlds scorn with service often standing firm upon a scruple and at a certain cost rejecting richeseverywhere some virtue cherished or affected everywhere some decency of thought and carriage everywhere the ensign of mans ineffectual goodnessah if i could show you this if i could show you these men and women all the world over in every stage of history under every abuse of error under every circumstance of failure without hope without help without thanks still obscurely fighting the lost fight of virtue still clinging in the brothel or on the scaffold to some rag of honour the poor jewel of their souls they may seek to escape and yet they cannot it is not alone their privilege and glory but their doom they are condemned to some nobility all their lives long the desire of good is at their heels the implacable hunter  of all earths meteors here at least is the most strange and consoling that this ennobled lemur this haircrowned bubble of the dust this inheritor of a few years and sorrows should yet deny himself his rare delights and add to his frequent pains and live for an ideal however misconceived nor can we stop with man a new doctrine received with screams a little while ago by canting moralists and still not properly worked into the body of our thoughts lights us a step farther into the heart of this rough but noble universe for nowadays the pride of man denies in vain his kinship with the original dust he stands no longer like a thing apart close at his heels we see the dog prince of another genus and in him too we see dumbly testified the same cultus of an unattainable ideal the same constancy in failure does it stop with the dog we look at our feet where the ground is blackened with the swarming ant a creature so small so far from us in the hierarchy of brutes that we can scarce trace and scarce comprehend his doings and here also in his ordered polities and rigorous justice we see confessed the law of duty and the fact of individual sin does it stop then with the ant rather this desire of welldoing and this doom of frailty run through all the grades of life rather is this earth from the frosty top of everest to the next margin of the internal fire one stage of ineffectual virtues and one temple of pious tears and perseverance the whole creation groaneth and travaileth together it is the common and the godlike law of life the browsers the biters the barkers the hairy coats of field and forest the squirrel in the oak the thousandfooted creeper in the dust as they share with us the gift of life share with us the love of an ideal strive like uslike us are tempted to grow weary of the struggleto do well like us receive at times unmerited refreshment visitings of support returns of courage and are condemned like us to be crucified between that double law of the members and the will are they like us i wonder in the timid hope of some reward some sugar with the drug do they too stand aghast at unrewarded virtues at the sufferings of those whom in our partiality we take to be just and the prosperity of such as in our blindness we call wicked it may be and yet god knows what they should look for even while they look even while they repent the foot of man treads them by thousands in the dust the yelping hounds burst upon their trail the bullet speeds the knives are heating in the den of the vivisectionist or the dew falls and the generation of a day is blotted out for these are creatures compared with whom our weakness is strength our ignorance wisdom our brief span eternity  and as we dwell we living things in our isle of terror and under the imminent hand of death god forbid it should be man the erected the reasoner the wise in his own eyesgod forbid it should be man that wearies in welldoing that despairs of unrewarded effort or utters the language of complaint let it be enough for faith that the whole creation groans in mortal frailty strives with unconquerable constancy surely not all in vain     ix  a christmas sermon   by the time this paper appears i shall have been talking for twelve months30 and it is thought i should take my leave in a formal and seasonable manner valedictory eloquence is rare and deathbed sayings have not often hit the mark of the occasion charles second wit and sceptic a man whose life had been one long lesson in human incredulity an easygoing comrade a manoeuvring kingremembered and embodied all his wit and scepticism along with more than his usual good humour in the famous i am afraid gentlemen i am an unconscionable time adying     i  an unconscionable time adyingthere is the picture i am afraid gentlemen of your life and of mine the sands run out and the hours are numbered and imputed and the days go by and when the last of these finds us we have been a long time dying and what else the very length is something if we reach that hour of separation undishonoured and to have lived at all is doubtless in the soldierly expression to have served there is a tale in tacitus of how the veterans mutinied in the german wilderness of how they mobbed germanicus clamouring to go home and of how seizing their generals hand these old warworn exiles passed his finger along their toothless gums sunt lacrymæ rerum this was the most eloquent of the songs of simeon and when a man has lived to a fair age he bears his marks of service he may have never been remarked upon the breach at the head of the army at least he shall have lost his teeth on the camp bread  the idealism of serious people in this age of ours is of a noble character it never seems to them that they have served enough they have a fine impatience of their virtues it were perhaps more modest to be singly thankful that we are no worse it is not only our enemies those desperate charactersit is we ourselves who know not what we dothence springs the glimmering hope that perhaps we do better than we think that to scramble through this random business with hands reasonably clean to have played the part of a man or woman with some reasonable fulness to have often resisted the diabolic and at the end to be still resisting it is for the poor human soldier to have done right well to ask to see some fruit of our endeavour is but a transcendental way of serving for reward and what we take to be contempt of self is only greed of hire  and again if we require so much of ourselves shall we not require much of others if we do not genially judge our own deficiencies is it not to be feared we shall be even stern to the trespasses of others and he who looking back upon his own life can see no more than that he has been unconscionably long adying will he not be tempted to think his neighbour unconscionably long of getting hanged it is probable that nearly all who think of conduct at all think of it too much it is certain we all think too much of sin we are not damned for doing wrong but for not doing right christ would never hear of negative morality thou shall was ever his word with which he superseded thou shall not to make our idea of morality centre on forbidden acts is to defile the imagination and to introduce into our judgments of our fellowmen a secret element of gusto if a thing is wrong for us we should not dwell upon the thought of it or we shall soon dwell upon it with inverted pleasure if we cannot drive it from our mindsone thing of two either our creed is in the wrong and we must more indulgently remodel it or else if our morality be in the right we are criminal lunatics and should place our persons in restraint a mark of such unwholesomely divided minds is the passion for interference with others the fox without the tail was of this breed but had if his biographer is to be trusted a certain antique civility now out of date a man may have a flaw a weakness that unfits him for the duties of life that spoils his temper that threatens his integrity or that betrays him into cruelty it has to be conquered but it must never be suffered to engross his thoughts the true duties lie all upon the further side and must be attended to with a whole mind so soon as this preliminary clearing of the decks has been effected in order that he may be kind and honest it may be needful he should become a total abstainer let him become so then and the next day let him forget the circumstance trying to be kind and honest will require all his thoughts a mortified appetite is never a wise companion in so far as he has had to mortify an appetite he will still be the worse man and of such an one a great deal of cheerfulness will be required in judging life and a great deal of humility in judging others  it may be argued again that dissatisfaction with our lifes endeavour springs in some degree from dulness we require higher tasks because we do not recognise the height of those we have trying to be kind and honest seems an affair too simple and too inconsequential for gentlemen of our heroic mould we had rather set ourselves to something bold arduous and conclusive we had rather found a schism or suppress a heresy cut off a hand or mortify an appetite but the task before us which is to coendure with our existence is rather one of microscopic fineness and the heroism required is that of patience there is no cutting of the gordian knots of life each must be smilingly unravelled  to be honest to be kindto earn a little and to spend a little less to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered to keep a few friends but these without capitulationabove all on the same grim condition to keep friends with himselfhere is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy he has an ambitious soul who would ask more he has a hopeful spirit who should look in such an enterprise to be successful there is indeed one element in human destiny that not blindness itself can controvert whatever else we are intended to do we are not intended to succeed failure is the fate allotted it is so in every art and study it is so above all in the continent art of living well here is a pleasant thought for the years end or for the end of life only selfdeception will be satisfied and there need be no despair for the despairer     ii  but christmas is not only the milemark of another year moving us to thoughts of selfexamination it is a season from all its associations whether domestic or religious suggesting thoughts of joy a man dissatisfied with his endeavours is a man tempted to sadness and in the midst of the winter when his life runs lowest and he is reminded of the empty chairs of his beloved it is well he should be condemned to this fashion of the smiling face noble disappointment noble selfdenial are not to be admired not even to be pardoned if they bring bitterness it is one thing to enter the kingdom of heaven maim another to maim yourself and stay without and the kingdom of heaven is of the childlike of those who are easy to please who love and who give pleasure mighty men of their hands the smiters and the builders and the judges have lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this lovely character and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns the shame were indelible if we should lose it gentleness and cheerfulness these come before all morality they are the perfect duties and it is the trouble with moral men that they have neither one nor other it was the moral man the pharisee whom christ could not away with if your morals make you dreary depend upon it they are wrong i do not say give them up for they may be all you have but conceal them like a vice lest they should spoil the lives of better and simpler people  a strange temptation attends upon man to keep his eye on pleasures even when he will not share in them to aim all his morals against them this very year a lady singular iconoclast proclaimed a crusade against dolls and the racy sermon against lust is a feature of the age i venture to call such moralists insincere at any excess or perversion of a natural appetite their lyre sounds of itself with relishing denunciations but for all displays of the truly diabolicenvy malice the mean lie the mean silence the calumnious truth the backbiter the petty tyrant the peevish poisoner of family lifetheir standard is quite different these are wrong they will admit yet somehow not so wrong there is no zeal in their assault on them no secret element of gusto warms up the sermon it is for things not wrong in themselves that they reserve the choicest of their indignation a man may naturally disclaim all moral kinship with the reverend mr zola or the hobgoblin old lady of the dolls for these are gross and naked instances and yet in each of us some similar element resides the sight of a pleasure in which we cannot or else will not share moves us to a particular impatience it may be because we are envious or because we are sad or because we dislike noise and rompingbeing so refined or becausebeing so philosophicwe have an overweighing sense of lifes gravity at least as we go on in years we are all tempted to frown upon our neighbours pleasures people are nowadays so fond of resisting temptations here is one to be resisted they are fond of selfdenial here is a propensity that cannot be too peremptorily denied there is an idea abroad among moral people that they should make their neighbours good one person i have to make good myself but my duty to my neighbour is much more nearly expressed by saying that i have to make him happyif i may     iii  happiness and goodness according to canting moralists stand in the relation of effect and cause there was never anything less proved or less probable our happiness is never in our own hands we inherit our constitution we stand buffet among friend and enemies we may be so built as to feel a sneer or an aspersion with unusual keenness and so circumstanced as to be unusually exposed to them we may have nerves very sensitive to pain and be afflicted with a disease very painful virtue will not help us and it is not meant to help us it is not even its own reward except for the selfcentred andi had almost saidthe unamiable no man can pacify his conscience if quiet be what he want he shall do better to let that organ perish from disuse and to avoid the penalties of the law and the minor capitis diminutio of social ostracism is an affair of wisdomof cunning if you willand not of virtue  in his own life then a man is not to expect happiness only to profit by it gladly when it shall arise he is on duty here he knows not how or why and does not need to know he knows not for what hire and must not ask somehow or other though he does not know what goodness is he must try to be good somehow or other though he cannot tell what will do it he must try to give happiness to others and no doubt there comes in here a frequent clash of duties how far is he to make his neighbour happy how far must he respect that smiling face so easy to cloud so hard to brighten again and how far on the other side is he bound to be his brothers keeper and the prophet of his own morality how far must he resent evil  the difficulty is that we have little guidance christs sayings on the point being hard to reconcile with each other and the most of them hard to accept but the truth of his teaching would seem to be this in our own person and fortune we should be ready to accept and to pardon all it is our cheek we are to turn our coat that we are to give away to the man who has taken our cloak but when anothers face is buffeted perhaps a little of the lion will become us best that we are to suffer others to be injured and stand by is not conceivable and surely not desirable revenge says bacon is a kind of wild justice its judgments at least are delivered by an insane judge and in our own quarrel we can see nothing truly and do nothing wisely but in the quarrel of our neighbour let us be more bold one persons happiness is as sacred as anothers when we cannot defend both let us defend one with a stout heart it is only in so far as we are doing this that we have any right to interfere the defence of b is our only ground of action against a a has as good a right to go to the devil as we to go to glory and neither knows what he does  the truth is that all these interventions and denunciations and militant mongerings of moral halftruths though they be sometimes needful though they are often enjoyable do yet belong to an inferior grade of duties illtemper and envy and revenge find here an arsenal of pious disguises this is the playground of inverted lusts with a little more patience and a little less temper a gentler and wiser method might be found in almost every case and the knot that we cut by some fine heady quarrelscene in private life or in public affairs by some denunciatory act against what we are pleased to call our neighbours vices might yet have been unwoven by the hand of sympathy     iv  to look back upon the past year and see how little we have striven and to what small purpose and how often we have been cowardly and hung back or temerarious and rushed unwisely in and how every day and all day long we have transgressed the law of kindnessit may seem a paradox but in the bitterness of these discoveries a certain consolation resides life is not designed to minister to a mans vanity he goes upon his long business most of the time with a hanging head and all the time like a blind child full of rewards and pleasures as it isso that to see the day break or the moon rise or to meet a friend or to hear the dinnercall when he is hungry fills him with surprising joysthis world is yet for him no abiding city friendships fall through health fails weariness assails him year after year he must thumb the hardly varying record of his own weakness and folly it is a friendly process of detachment when the time comes that he should go there need be few illusions left about himself here lies one who meant well tried a little failed muchsurely that may be his epitaph of which he need not be ashamed nor will he complain at the summons which calls a defeated soldier from the field defeated ay if he were paul or marcus aureliusbut if there is still one inch of fight in his old spirit undishonoured the faith which sustained him in his lifelong blindness and lifelong disappointment will scarce even be required in this last formality of laying down his arms give him a march with his old bones there out of the glorious suncoloured earth out of the day and the dust and the ecstasythere goes another faithful failure  from a recent book of verse where there is more than one such beautiful and manly poem i take this memorial piece it says better than i can what i love to think let it be our parting word    a late lark twitters from the quiet skies    and from the west    where the sun his days work ended    lingers as in content    there falls on the old grey city    an influence luminous and serene    a shining peace    the smoke ascends    in a rosyandgolden haze the spires    shine and are changed in the valley    shadows rise the lark sings on the sun    closing his benediction    sinks and the darkening air    thrills with a sense of the triumphing night    night with her train of stars    and her great gift of sleep    so be my passing    my task accomplished and the long day done    my wages taken and in my heart    some late lark

henley d nutt 1888     x  father damien  an open letter to the reverend dr hyde of honolulu        sydney february 25 1890  sirit may probably occur to you that we have met and visited and conversed on my side with interest you may remember that you have done me several courtesies for which i was prepared to be grateful but there are duties which come before gratitude and offences which justly divide friends far more acquaintances your letter to the reverend h b gage is a document which in my sight if you had filled me with bread when i was starving if you had sat up to nurse my father when he lay adying would yet absolve me from the bonds of gratitude you know enough doubtless of the process of canonisation to be aware that a hundred years after the death of damien there will appear a man charged with the painful office of the devils advocate after that noble brother of mine and of all frail clay shall have lain a century at rest one shall accuse one defend him the circumstance is unusual that the devils advocate should be a volunteer should be a member of a sect immediately rival and should make haste to take upon himself his ugly office ere the bones are cold unusual and of a taste which i shall leave my readers free to qualify unusual and to me inspiring if i have at all learned the trade of using words to convey truth and to arouse emotion you have at last furnished me with a subject for it is in the interest of all mankind and the cause of public decency in every quarter of the world not only that damien should be righted but that you and your letter should be displayed at length in their true colours to the public eye  to do this properly i must begin by quoting you at large i shall then proceed to criticise your utterance from several points of view divine and human in the course of which i shall attempt to draw again and with more specification the character of the dead saint whom it has pleased you to vilify so much being done i shall say farewell to you for ever       honolulu august 2 1889     rev h b gage     dear brotherin answer to your inquiries about father damien i    can only reply that we who knew the man are surprised at the    extravagant newspaper laudations as if he was a most saintly    philanthropist the simple truth is he was a coarse dirty man    headstrong and bigoted he was not sent to molokai but went there    without orders did not stay at the leper settlement before he    became one himself but circulated freely over the whole island    less than half the island is devoted to the lepers and he came    often to honolulu he had no hand in the reforms and improvements    inaugurated which were the work of our board of health as occasion    required and means were provided he was not a pure man in his    relations with women and the leprosy of which he died should be    attributed to his vices and carelessness others have done much for    the lepers our own ministers the government physicians and so    forth but never with the catholic idea of meriting eternal    lifeyours etc       c m hyde32  to deal fitly with a letter so extraordinary i must draw at the outset on my private knowledge of the signatory and his sect it may offend others scarcely you who have been so busy to collect so bold to publish gossip on your rivals and this is perhaps the moment when i may best explain to you the character of what you are to read i conceive you as a man quite beyond and below the reticences of civility with what measure you mete with that shall it be measured you again with you at last i rejoice to feel the button off the foil and to plunge home and if in aught that i shall say i should offend others your colleagues whom i respect and remember with affection i can but offer them my regret i am not free i am inspired by the consideration of interests far more large and such pain as can be inflicted by anything from me must be indeed trifling when compared with the pain with which they read your letter it is not the hangman but the criminal that brings dishonour on the house  you belong sir to a secti believe my sect and that in which my ancestors labouredwhich has enjoyed and partly failed to utilise an exceptional advantage in the islands of hawaii the first missionaries came they found the land already selfpurged of its old and bloody faith they were embraced almost on their arrival with enthusiasm what troubles they supported came far more from whites than from hawaiians and to these last they stood in a rough figure in the shoes of god this is not the place to enter into the degree or causes of their failure such as it is one element alone is pertinent and must here be plainly dealt with in the course of their evangelical calling theyor too many of themgrew rich it may be news to you that the houses of missionaries are a cause of mocking on the streets of honolulu it will at least be news to you that when i returned your civil visit the driver of my cab commented on the size the taste and the comfort of your home it would have been news certainly to myself had any one told me that afternoon that i should live to drag such matter into print but you see sir how you degrade better men to your own level and it is needful that those who are to judge betwixt you and me betwixt damien and the devils advocate should understand your letter to have been penned in a house which could raise and that very justly the envy and the comments of the passersby i think to employ a phrase of yours which i admire it should be attributed to you that you have never visited the scene of damiens life and death if you had and had recalled it and looked about your pleasant rooms even your pen perhaps would have been stayed  your sect and remember as far as any sect avows me it is mine has not done ill in a worldly sense in the hawaiian kingdom when calamity befell their innocent parishioners when leprosy descended and took root in the eight islands a quid pro quo was to be looked for to that prosperous mission and to you as one of its adornments god had sent at last an opportunity i know i am touching here upon a nerve acutely sensitive i know that others of your colleagues look back on the inertia of your church and the intrusive and decisive heroism of damien with something almost to be called remorse i am sure it is so with yourself i am persuaded your letter was inspired by a certain envy not essentially ignoble and the one human trait to be espied in that performance you were thinking of the lost chance the past day of that which should have been conceived and was not of the service due and not rendered time was said the voice in your ear in your pleasant room as you sat raging and writing and if the words written were base beyond parallel the rage i am happy to repeatit is the only compliment i shall pay youthe rage was almost virtuous but sir when we have failed and another has succeeded when we have stood by and another has stepped in when we sit and grow bulky in our charming mansions and a plain uncouth peasant steps into the battle under the eyes of god and succours the afflicted and consoles the dying and is himself afflicted in his turn and dies upon the field of honourthe battle cannot be retrieved as your unhappy irritation has suggested it is a lost battle and lost for ever one thing remained to you in your defeatsome rags of common honour and these you have made haste to cast away  common honour not the honour of having done anything right but the honour of not having done aught conspicuously foul the honour of the inert that was what remained to you we are not all expected to be damiens a man may conceive his duty more narrowly he may love his comforts better and none will cast a stone at him for that but will a gentleman of your reverend profession allow me an example from the fields of gallantry when two gentlemen compete for the favour of a lady and the one succeeds and the other is rejected and as will sometimes happen matter damaging to the successful rivals credit reaches the ear of the defeated it is held by plain men of no pretensions that his mouth is in the circumstance almost necessarily closed your church and damiens were in hawaii upon a rivalry to do well to help to edify to set divine examples you having in one huge instance failed and damien succeeded i marvel it should not have occurred to you that you were doomed to silence that when you had been outstripped in that high rivalry and sat inglorious in the midst of your wellbeing in your pleasant roomand damien crowned with glories and horrors toiled and rotted in that pigsty of his under the cliffs of kalawaoyou the elect who would not were the last man on earth to collect and propagate gossip on the volunteer who would and did  i think i see youfor i try to see you in the flesh as i write these sentencesi think i see you leap at the word pigsty a hyperbolical expression at the best he had no hand in the reforms he was a coarse dirty man these were your own words and you may think it possible that i am come to support you with fresh evidence in a sense it is even so damien has been too much depicted with a conventional halo and conventional features so drawn by men who perhaps had not the eye to remark or the pen to express the individual or who perhaps were only blinded and silenced by generous admiration such as i partly envy for myselfsuch as you if your soul were enlightened would envy on your bended knees it is the least defect of such a method of portraiture that it makes the path easy for the devils advocate and leaves for the misuse of the slanderer a considerable field of truth for the truth that is suppressed by friends is the readiest weapon of the enemy the world in your despite may perhaps owe you something if your letter be the means of substituting once for all a credible likeness for a wax abstraction for if that world at all remember you on the day when damien of molokai shall be named saint it will be in virtue of one work your letter to the reverend h b gage  you may ask on what authority i speak it was my inclement destiny to become acquainted not with damien but with dr hyde when i visited the lazaretto damien was already in his resting grave but such information as i have i gathered on the spot in conversation with those who knew him well and long some indeed who revered his memory but others who had sparred and wrangled with him who beheld him with no halo who perhaps regarded him with small respect and through whose unprepared and scarcely partial communications the plain human features of the man shone on me convincingly these gave me what knowledge i possess and i learnt it in that scene where it could be most completely and sensitively understoodkalawao which you have never visited about which you have never so much as endeavoured to inform yourself for brief as your letter is you have found the means to stumble into that confession less than onehalf of the island you say is devoted to the lepers molokaimolokai ahina the grey lofty and most desolate islandalong all its northern side plunges a front of precipice into a sea of unusual profundity this range of cliff is from east to west the true end and frontier of the island only in one spot there projects into the ocean a certain triangular and rugged down grassy stony windy and rising in the midst into a hill with a dead crater the whole bearing to the cliff that overhangs it somewhat the same relation as a bracket to a wall with this hint you will now be able to pick out the leper station on a map you will be able to judge how much of molokai is thus cut off between the surf and precipice whether less than a half or less than a quarter or a fifth or a tenthor say a twentieth and the next time you burst into print you will be in a position to share with us the issue of your calculations  i imagine you to be one of those persons who talk with cheerfulness of that place which oxen and wainropes could not drag you to behold you who do not even know its situation on the map probably denounce sensational descriptions stretching your limbs the while in your pleasant parlour on beretania street when i was pulled ashore there one early morning there sat with me in the boat two sisters bidding farewell in humble imitation of damien to the lights and joys of human life one of these wept silently i could not withhold myself from joining her had you been there it is my belief that nature would have triumphed even in you and as the boat drew but a little nearer and you beheld the stairs crowded with abominable deformations of our common manhood and saw yourself landing in the midst of such a population as only now and then surrounds us in the horror of a nightmarewhat a haggard eye you would have rolled over your reluctant shoulder towards the house on beretania street had you gone on had you found every fourth face a blot upon the landscape had you visited the hospital and seen the buttends of human beings lying there almost unrecognisable but still breathing still thinking still remembering you would have understood that life in the lazaretto is an ordeal from which the nerves of a mans spirit shrink even as his eye quails under the brightness of the sun you would have felt it was even today a pitiful place to visit and a hell to dwell in it is not the fear of possible infection that seems a little thing when compared with the pain the pity and the disgust of the visitors surroundings and the atmosphere of affliction disease and physical disgrace in which he breathes i do not think i am a man more than usually timid but i never recall the days and nights i spent upon that island promontory eight days and seven nights without heartfelt thankfulness that i am somewhere else i find in my diary that i speak of my stay as a grinding experience i have once jotted in the margin harrowing is the word and when the mokolii bore me at last towards the outer world i kept repeating to myself with a new conception of their pregnancy those simple words of the song    tis the most distressful country that ever yet was seen  and observe that which i saw and suffered from was a settlement purged bettered beautified the new village built the hospital and the bishophome excellently arranged the sisters the doctor and the missionaries all indefatigable in their noble tasks it was a different place when damien came there and made his great renunciation and slept that first night under a tree amidst his rotting brethren alone with pestilence and looking forward with what courage with what pitiful sinkings of dread god only knows to a lifetime of dressing sores and stumps  you will say perhaps i am too sensitive that sights as painful abound in cancer hospitals and are confronted daily by doctors and nurses i have long learned to admire and envy the doctors and the nurses but there is no cancer hospital so large and populous as kalawao and kalaupapa and in such a matter every fresh case like every inch of length in the pipe of an organ deepens the note of the impression for what daunts the onlooker is that monstrous sum of human suffering by which he stands surrounded lastly no doctor or nurse is called upon to enter once for all the doors of that gehenna they do not say farewell they need not abandon hope on its sad threshold they but go for a time to their high calling and can look forward as they go to relief to recreation and to rest but damien shutto with his own hand the doors of his own sepulchre  i shall now extract three passages from my diary at kalawao  a damien is dead and already somewhat ungratefully remembered in the field of his labours and sufferings he was a good man but very officious says one another tells me he had fallen as other priests so easily do into something of the ways and habits of thought of a kanaka but he had the wit to recognise the fact and the good sense to laugh at over it a plain man it seems he was i cannot find he was a popular  b after ragsdales death ragsdale was a famous luna or overseer of the unruly settlement there followed a brief term of office by father damien which served only to publish the weakness of that noble man he was rough in his ways and he had no control authority was relaxed damiens life was threatened and he was soon eager to resign  c of damien i begin to have an idea he seems to have been a man of the peasant class certainly of the peasant type shrewd ignorant and bigoted yet with an open mind and capable of receiving and digesting a reproof if it were bluntly administered superbly generous in the least thing as well as in the greatest and as ready to give his last shirt although not without human grumbling as he had been to sacrifice his life essentially indiscreet and officious which made him a troublesome colleague domineering in all his ways which made him incurably unpopular with the kanakas but yet destitute of real authority so that his boys laughed at him and he must carry out his wishes by the means of bribes he learned to have a mania for doctoring and set up the kanakas against the remedies of his regular rivals perhaps if anything matter at all in the treatment of such a disease the worst thing that he did and certainly the easiest the best and worst of the man appear very plainly in his dealings with mr chapmans money he had originally laid it out intended to lay it out entirely for the benefit of catholics and even so not wisely but after a long plain talk he admitted his error fully and revised the list the sad state of the boys home is in part the result of his lack of control in part of his own slovenly ways and false ideas of hygiene brother officials used to call it damiens chinatown well they would say your chinatown keeps growing and he would laugh with perfect goodnature and adhere to his errors with perfect obstinacy so much i have gathered of truth about this plain noble human brother and father of ours his imperfections are the traits of his face by which we know him for our fellow his martyrdom and his example nothing can lessen or annul and only a person here on the spot can properly appreciate their greatness  i have set down these private passages as you perceive without correction thanks to you the public has them in their bluntness they are almost a list of the mans faults for it is rather these that i was seeking with his virtues with the heroic profile of his life i and the world were already sufficiently acquainted i was besides a little suspicious of catholic testimony in no ill sense but merely because damiens admirers and disciples were the least likely to be critical i know you will be more suspicious still and the facts set down above were one and all collected from the lips of protestants who had opposed the father in his life yet i am strangely deceived or they build up the image of a man with all his weaknesses essentially heroic and alive with rugged honesty generosity and mirth  take it for what it is rough private jottings of the worst sides of damiens character collected from the lips of those who had laboured with and in your own phrase knew the manthough i question whether damien would have said that he knew you take it and observe with wonder how well you were served by your gossips how ill by your intelligence and sympathy in how many points of fact we are at one and how widely our appreciations vary there is something wrong here either with you or me it is possible for instance that you who seem to have so many ears in kalawao had heard of the affair of mr chapmans money and were singly struck by damiens intended wrongdoing i was struck with that also and set it fairly down but i was struck much more by the fact that he had the honesty of mind to be convinced i may here tell you that it was a long business that one of his colleagues sat with him late into the night multiplying arguments and accusations that the father listened as usual with perfect goodnature and perfect obstinacy but at the last when he was persuadedyes said he i am very much obliged to you you have done me a service it would have been a theft there are many not catholics merely who require their heroes and saints to be infallible to these the story will be painful not to the true lovers patrons and servants of mankind  and i take it this is a type of our division that you are one of those who have an eye for faults and failures that you take a pleasure to find and publish them and that having found them you make haste to forget the overvailing virtues and the real success which had alone introduced them to your knowledge it is a dangerous frame of mind that you may understand how dangerous and into what a situation it has already brought you we will if you please go handinhand through the different phrases of your letter and candidly examine each from the point of view of its truth its appositeness and its charity   damien was coarse  it is very possible you make us sorry for the lepers who had only a coarse old peasant for their friend and father but you who were so refined why were you not there to cheer them with the lights of culture or may i remind you that we have some reason to doubt if john the baptist were genteel and in the case of peter on whose career you doubtless dwell approvingly in the pulpit no doubt at all he was a coarse headstrong fisherman yet even in our protestant bibles peter is called saint   damien was dirty  he was think of the poor lepers annoyed with this dirty comrade but the clean dr hyde was at his food in a fine house   damien was headstrong  i believe you are right again and i thank god for his strong head and heart   damien was bigoted  i am not fond of bigots myself because they are not fond of me but what is meant by bigotry that we should regard it as a blemish in a priest damien believed his own religion with the simplicity of a peasant or a child as i would i could suppose that you do for this i wonder at him some way off and had that been his only character should have avoided him in life but the point of interest in damien which has caused him to be so much talked about and made him at last the subject of your pen and mine was that in him his bigotry his intense and narrow faith wrought potently for good and strengthened him to be one of the worlds heroes and exemplars   damien was not sent to molokai but went there without orders  is this a misreading or do you really mean the words for blame i have heard christ in the pulpits of our church held up for imitation on the ground that his sacrifice was voluntary does dr hyde think otherwise   damien did not stay at the settlement etc  it is true he was allowed many indulgences am i to understand that you blame the father for profiting by these or the officers for granting them in either case it is a mighty spartan standard to issue from the house on beretania street and i am convinced you will find yourself with few supporters   damien had no hand in the reforms etc  i think even you will admit that i have already been frank in my description of the man i am defending but before i take you up upon this head i will be franker still and tell you that perhaps nowhere in the world can a man taste a more pleasurable sense of contrast than when he passes from damiens chinatown at kalawao to the beautiful bishophome at kalaupapa at this point in my desire to make all fair for you i will break my rule and adduce catholic testimony here is a passage from my diary about my visit to the chinatown from which you will see how it is even now regarded by its own officials we went round all the dormitories refectories etcdark and dingy enough with a superficial cleanliness which he mr dutton the lay brother did not seek to defend it is almost decent said he the sisters will make that all right when we get them here and yet i gathered it was already better since damien was dead and far better than when he was there alone and had his own not always excellent way i have now come far enough to meet you on a common ground of fact and i tell you that to a mind not prejudiced by jealousy all the reforms of the lazaretto and even those which he most vigorously opposed are properly the work of damien they are the evidence of his success they are what his heroism provoked from the reluctant and the careless many were before him in the field mr meyer for instance of whose faithful work we hear too little there have been many since and some had more worldly wisdom though none had more devotion than our saint before his day even you will confess they had effected little it was his part by one striking act of martyrdom to direct all mens eyes on that distressful country at a blow and with the price of his life he made the place illustrious and public and that if you will consider largely was the one reform needful pregnant of all that should succeed it brought money it brought best individual addition of them all the sisters it brought supervision for public opinion and public interest landed with the man at kalawao if ever any man brought reforms and died to bring them it was he there is not a clean cup or towel in the bishophome but dirty damien washed it   damien was not a pure man in his relations with women etc  how do you know that is this the nature of the conversation in that house on beretania street which the cabman envied driving pastracy details of the misconduct of the poor peasant priest toiling under the cliffs of molokai  many have visited the station before me they seem not to have heard the rumour when i was there i heard many shocking tales for my informants were men speaking with the plainness of the laity and i heard plenty of complaints of damien why was this never mentioned and how came it to you in the retirement of your clerical parlour  but i must not even seem to deceive you this scandal when i read it in your letter was not new to me i had heard it once before and i must tell you how there came to samoa a man from honolulu he in a publichouse on the beach volunteered the statement that damien had contracted the disease from having connection with the female lepers and i find a joy in telling you how the report was welcomed in a publichouse a man sprang to his feet i am not at liberty to give his name but from what i heard i doubt if you would care to have him to dinner in beretania street you miserable little  here is a word i dare not print it would so shock your ears you miserable little  he cried if the story were a thousand times true cant you see you are a million times a lower  for daring to repeat it i wish it could be told of you that when the report reached you in your house perhaps after family worship you had found in your soul enough holy anger to receive it with the same expressions ay even with that one which i dare not print it would not need to have been blotted away like uncle tobys oath by the tears of the recording angel it would have been counted to you for your brightest righteousness but you have deliberately chosen the part of the man from honolulu and you have played it with improvements of your own the man from honolulumiserable leering creaturecommunicated the tale to a rude knot of beachcombing drinkers in a publichouse where i will so far agree with your temperance opinions man is not always at his noblest and the man from honolulu had himself been drinkingdrinking we may charitably fancy to excess it was to your dear brother the reverend h b gage that you chose to communicate the sickening story and the blue ribbon which adorns your portly bosom forbids me to allow you the extenuating plea that you were drunk when it was done your dear brothera brother indeedmade haste to deliver up your letter as a means of grace perhaps to the religious papers where after many months i found and read and wondered at it and whence i have now reproduced it for the wonder of others and you and your dear brother have by this cycle of operations built up a contrast very edifying to examine in detail the man whom you would not care to have to dinner on the one side on the other the reverend dr hyde and the reverend h b gage the apia barroom the honolulu manse  but i fear you scarce appreciate how you appear to your fellowmen and to bring it home to you i will suppose your story to be true i will supposeand god forgive me for supposing itthat damien faltered and stumbled in his narrow path of duty i will suppose that in the horror of his isolation perhaps in the fever of incipient disease he who was doing so much more than he had sworn failed in the letter of his priestly oathhe who was so much a better man than either you or me who did what we have never dreamed of daringhe too tasted of our common frailty o iago the pity of it the least tender should be moved to tears the most incredulous to prayer and all that you could do was to pen your letter to the reverend h b gage  is it growing at all clear to you what a picture you have drawn of your own heart i will try yet once again to make it clearer you had a father suppose this tale were about him and some informant brought it to you proof in hand i am not making too high an estimate of your emotional nature when i suppose you would regret the circumstance that you would feel the tale of frailty the more keenly since it shamed the author of your days and that the last thing you would do would be to publish it in the religious press well the man who tried to do what damien did is my father and the father of the man in the apia bar and the father of all who love goodness and he was your father too if god had given you grace to see it   footnote    32 from the sydney presbyterian october 26 1889     xi  my first booktreasure island   it was far indeed from being my first book for i am not a novelist alone but i am well aware that my paymaster the great public regards what else i have written with indifference if not aversion if it call upon me at all it calls on me in the familiar and indelible character and when i am asked to talk of my first book no question in the world but what is meant is my first novel  sooner or later somehow anyhow i was bound to write a novel it seems vain to ask why men are born with various manias from my earliest childhood it was mine to make a plaything of imaginary series of events and as soon as i was able to write i became a good friend to the papermakers reams upon reams must have gone to the making of rathillet the pentland rising33 the kings pardon otherwise park whitehead edward daven a country dance and a vendetta in the west and it is consolatory to remember that these reams are now all ashes and have been received again into the soil i have named but a few of my illfated efforts only such indeed as came to a fair bulk ere they were desisted from and even so they cover a long vista of years rathillet was attempted before fifteen the vendetta at twentynine and the succession of defeats lasted unbroken till i was thirtyone by that time i had written little books and little essays and short stories and had got patted on the back and paid for themthough not enough to live upon i had quite a reputation i was the successful man i passed my days in toil the futility of which would sometimes make my cheek to burnthat i should spend a mans energy upon this business and yet could not earn a livelihood and still there shone ahead of me an unattained ideal although i had attempted the thing with vigour not less than ten or twelve times i had not yet written a novel allall my pretty oneshad gone for a little and then stopped inexorably like a schoolboys watch i might be compared to a cricketer of many years standing who should never have made a run anybody can write a short storya bad one i meanwho has industry and paper and time enough but not every one may hope to write even a bad novel it is the length that kills the accepted novelist may take his novel up and put it down spend days upon it in vain and write not any more than he makes haste to blot not so the beginner human nature has certain rights instinctthe instinct of selfpreservationforbids that any man cheered and supported by the consciousness of no previous victory should endure the miseries of unsuccessful literary toil beyond a period to be measured in weeks there must be something for hope to feed upon the beginner must have a slant of wind a lucky vein must be running he must be in one of those hours when the words come and the phrases balance of themselveseven to begin and having begun what a dread looking forward is that until the book shall be accomplished for so long a time the slant is to continue unchanged the vein to keep running for so long a time you must keep at command the same quality of style for so long a time your puppets are to be always vital always consistent always vigorous i remember i used to look in those days upon every threevolume novel with a sort of veneration as a featnot possibly of literaturebut at least of physical and moral endurance and the courage of ajax  in the fated year i came to live with my father and mother at kinnaird above pitlochry then i walked on the red moors and by the side of the golden burn the rude pure air of our mountains inspirited if it did not inspire us and my wife and i projected a joint volume of bogey stories for which she wrote the shadow on the bed and i turned out thrawn janet and a first draft of the merry men i love my native air but it does not love me and the end of this delightful period was a cold a flyblister and a migration by strathardle and glenshee to the castleton of braemar there it blew a good deal and rained in a proportion my native air was more unkind than mans ingratitude and i must consent to pass a good deal of my time between four walls in a house lugubriously known as the late miss mcgregors cottage and now admire the finger of predestination there was a schoolboy in the late miss mcgregors cottage home from the holidays and much in want of something craggy to break his mind upon he had no thought of literature it was the art of raphael that received his fleeting suffrages and with the aid of pen and ink and a shilling box of watercolours he had soon turned one of the rooms into a picturegallery my more immediate duty towards the gallery was to be showman but i would sometimes unbend a little join the artist so to speak at the easel and pass the afternoon with him in a generous emulation making coloured drawings on one of these occasions i made the map of an island it was elaborately and i thought beautifully coloured the shape of it took my fancy beyond expression it contained harbours that pleased me like sonnets and with the unconsciousness of the predestined i ticketed my performance treasure island i am told there are people who do not care for maps and find it hard to believe the names the shapes of the woodlands the courses of the roads and rivers the prehistoric footsteps of man still distinctly traceable up hill and down dale the mills and the ruins the ponds and the ferries perhaps the standing stone or the druidic circle on the heath here is an inexhaustible fund of interest for any man with eyes to see or twopenceworth of imagination to understand with no child but must remember laying his head in the grass staring into the infinitesimal forest and seeing it grow populous with fairy armies somewhat in this way as i paused upon my map of treasure island the future character of the book began to appear there visibly among imaginary woods and their brown faces and bright weapons peeped out upon me from unexpected quarters as they passed to and fro fighting and hunting treasure on these few square inches of a flat projection the next thing i knew i had some papers before me and was writing out a list of chapters how often have i done so and the thing gone on further but there seemed elements of success about this enterprise it was to be a story for boys no need of psychology or fine writing and i had a boy at hand to be a touchstone women were excluded i was unable to handle a brig which the hispaniola should have been but i thought i could make shift to sail her as a schooner without public shame and then i had an idea for john silver from which i promised myself funds of entertainment to take an admired friend of mine whom the reader very likely knows and admires as much as i do to deprive him of all his finer qualities and higher graces of temperament to leave him with nothing but his strength his courage his quickness and his magnificent geniality and to try to express these in terms of the culture of a raw tarpaulin such psychical surgery is i think a common way of making character perhaps it is indeed the only way we can put in the quaint figure that spoke a hundred words with us yesterday by the wayside but do we know him our friend with his infinite variety and flexibility we knowbut can we put him in upon the first we must engraft secondary and imaginary qualities possibly all wrong from the second knife in hand we must cut away and deduct the needless arborescence of his nature but the trunk and the few branches that remain we may at least be fairly sure of  on a chill september morning by the cheek of a brisk fire and the rain drumming on the window i began the sea cook for that was the original title i have begun and finished a number of other books but i cannot remember to have sat down to one of them with more complacency it is not to be wondered at for stolen waters are proverbially sweet i am now upon a painful chapter no doubt the parrot once belonged to robinson crusoe no doubt the skeleton is conveyed from poe i think little of these they are trifles and details and no man can hope to have a monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds the stockade i am told is from masterman ready it may be i care not a jot these useful writers had fulfilled the poets saying departing they had left behind them footprints on the sands of time footprints which perhaps anotherand i was the other it is my debt to washington irving that exercises my conscience and justly so for i believe plagiarism was rarely carried further i chanced to pick up the tales of a traveller some years ago with a view to an anthology of prose narrative and the book flew up and struck me billy bones his chest the company in the parlour the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chaptersall were there all were the property of washington irving but i had no guess of it then as i sat writing by the fireside in what seemed the springtides of a somewhat pedestrian inspiration nor yet day by day after lunch as i read aloud my mornings work to the family it seemed to me original as sin it seemed to belong to me like my right eye i had counted on one boy i found i had two in my audience my father caught fire at once with all the romance and childishness of his original nature his own stories that every night of his life he put himself to sleep with dealt perpetually with ships roadside inns robbers old sailors and commercial travellers before the era of steam he never finished one of these romances the lucky man did not require to finish them but in treasure island he recognised something kindred to his own imagination it was his kind of picturesque and he not only heard with delight the daily chapter but set himself acting to collaborate when the time came for billy boness chest to be ransacked he must have passed the better part of a day preparing on the back of a legal envelope an inventory of its contents which i exactly followed and the name of flints old shipthe walruswas given at his particular request and now who should come dropping in ex machinâ but dr japp like the disguised prince who is to bring down the curtain upon peace and happiness in the last act for he carried in his pocket not a horn or a talisman but a publisher even the ruthlessness of a united family recoiled before the extreme measure of inflicting on our guest the mutilated members of the sea cook at the same time we would by no means stop our readings and accordingly the tale was begun again at the beginning and solemnly redelivered for the benefit of dr japp from that moment on i have thought highly of his critical faculty for when he left us he carried away the manuscript in his portmanteau to submit to his friend since then my own mr henderson who accepted it for his periodical young folks  here then was everything to keep me up sympathy help and now a positive engagement i had chosen besides a very easy style compare it with the almost contemporary merry men one reader may prefer the one style one the othertis an affair of character perhaps of mood but no expert can fail to see that the one is much more difficult and the other much easier to maintain it seems as though a fullgrown experienced man of letters might engage to turn out treasure island at so many pages a day and keep his pipe alight but alas this was not my case fifteen days i stuck to it and turned out fifteen chapters and then in the early paragraphs of the sixteenth ignominiously lost hold my mouth was empty there was not one word of treasure island in my bosom and here were the proofs of the beginning already waiting me at the hand and spear then i corrected them living for the most part alone walking on the heath at weybridge in dewy autumn mornings a good deal pleased with what i had done and more appalled than i can depict to you in words at what remained for me to do i was thirtyone i was the head of a family i had lost my health i had never yet paid my way never yet made £200 a year my father had quite recently bought back and cancelled a book that was judged a failure was this to be another and last fiasco i was indeed very close on despair but i shut my mouth hard and during the journey to davos where i was to pass the winter had the resolution to think of other things and bury myself in the novels of m du boisgobey arrived at my destination down i sat one morning to the unfinished tale and behold it flowed from me like smalltalk and in a second tide of delighted industry and again at the rate of a chapter a day i finished treasure island it had to be transcribed almost exactly my wife was ill the schoolboy remained alone of the faithful and john addington symonds to whom i timidly mentioned what i was engaged on looked on me askance he was at that time very eager i should write on the characters of theophrastus so far out may be the judgments of the wisest men but symonds to be sure was scarce the confidant to go to for sympathy on a boys story he was largeminded a full man if there was one but the very name of my enterprise would suggest to him only capitulations of sincerity and solecisms of style well he was not far wrong  treasure islandit was mr henderson who deleted the first title the sea cookappeared duly in the story paper where it figured in the ignoble midst without woodcuts and attracted not the least attention i did not care i liked the tale myself for much the same reason as my father liked the beginning it was my kind of picturesque i was not a little proud of john silver also and to this day rather admire that smooth and formidable adventurer what was infinitely more exhilarating i had passed a landmark i had finished a tale and written the end upon my manuscript as i had not done since the pentland rising when i was a boy of sixteen not yet at college in truth it was so by a set of lucky accidents had not dr japp come on his visit had not the tale flowed from me with singular ease it must have been laid aside like its predecessors and found a circuitous and unlamented way to the fire purists may suggest it would have been better so i am not of that mind the tale seems to have given much pleasure and it brought or was the means of bringing fire and food and wine to a deserving family in which i took an interest i need scarcely say i mean my own  but the adventures of treasure island are not yet quite at an end i had written it up to the map the map was the chief part of my plot for instance i had called an islet skeleton island not knowing what i meant seeking only for the immediate picturesque and it was to justify this name that i broke into the gallery of mr poe and stole flints pointer and in the same way it was because i had made two harbours that the hispaniola was sent on her wanderings with israel hands the time came when it was decided to republish and i sent in my manuscript and the map along with it to messrs cassell the proofs came they were corrected but i heard nothing of the map i wrote and asked was told it had never been received and sat aghast it is one thing to draw a map at random set a scale in one corner of it at a venture and write up a story to the measurements it is quite another to have to examine a whole book make an inventory of all the allusions contained in it and with a pair of compasses painfully design a map to suit the data i did it and the map was drawn again in my fathers office with embellishments of blowing whales and sailing ships and my father himself brought into service a knack he had of various writing and elaborately forged the signature of captain flint and the sailing directions of billy bones but somehow it was never treasure island to me  i have said the map was the most of the plot i might almost say it was the whole a few reminiscences of poe defoe and washington irving a copy of johnsons buccaneers the name of the dead mans chest from kingsleys at last some recollections of canoeing on the high seas and the map itself with its infinite eloquent suggestion made up the whole of my materials it is perhaps not often that a map figures so largely in a tale yet it is always important the author must know his countryside whether real or imaginary like his hand the distances the points of the compass the place of the suns rising the behaviour of the moon should all be beyond cavil and how troublesome the moon is i have come to grief over the moon in prince otto and so soon as that was pointed out to me adopted a precaution which i recommend to other meni never write now without an almanac with an almanac and the map of the country and the plan of every house either actually plotted on paper or already and immediately apprehended in the mind a man may hope to avoid some of the grossest possible blunders with the map before him he will scarce allow the sun to set in the east as it does in the antiquary with the almanac at hand he will scarce allow two horsemen journeying on the most urgent affair to employ six days from three of the monday morning till late in the saturday night upon a journey of say ninety or a hundred miles and before the week is out and still on the same nags to cover fifty in one day as may be read at length in the inimitable novel of rob roy and it is certainly well though far from necessary to avoid such croppers but it is my contentionmy superstition if you likethat who is faithful to his map and consults it and draws from it his inspiration daily and hourly gains positive support and not mere negative immunity from accident the tale has a root there it grows in that soil it has a spine of its own behind the words better if the country be real and he has walked every foot of it and knows every milestone but even with imaginary places he will do well in the beginning to provide a map as he studies it relations will appear that he had not thought upon he will discover obvious though unsuspected shortcuts and footprints for his messengers and even when a map is not all the plot as it was in treasure island it will be found to be a mine of suggestion   footnote    33 ne pas confondre not the slim green pamphlet with the imprint     of andrew elliot for which as i see with amazement from the     booklists the gentlemen of england are willing to pay fancy     prices but its predecessor a bulky historical romance without a     spark of merit and now deleted from the worldr l s     xii  the genesis of the master of ballantrae   i was walking one night in the verandah of a small house in which i lived outside the hamlet of saranac it was winter the night was very dark the air extraordinary clear and cold and sweet with the purity of forests from a good way below the river was to be heard contending with ice and boulders a few lights appeared scattered unevenly among the darkness but so far away as not to lessen the sense of isolation for the making of a story here were fine conditions i was besides moved with the spirit of emulation for i had just finished my third or fourth perusal of the phantom ship come said i to my engine let us make a tale a story of many years and countries of the sea and the land savagery and civilisation a story that shall have the same large features and may be treated in the same summary elliptic method as the book you have been reading and admiring i was here brought up with a reflection exceedingly just in itself but which as the sequel shows i failed to profit by i saw that marryat not less than homer milton and virgil profited by the choice of a familiar and legendary subject so that he prepared his readers on the very titlepage and this set me cudgelling my brains if by any chance i could hit upon some similar belief to be the centrepiece of my own meditated fiction in the course of this vain search there cropped up in my memory a singular case of a buried and resuscitated fakir which i had been often told by an uncle of mine then lately dead inspectorgeneral john balfour  on such a fine frosty night with no wind and the thermometer below zero the brain works with much vivacity and the next moment i had seen the circumstance transplanted from india and the tropics to the adirondack wilderness and the stringent cold of the canadian border here then almost before i had begun my story i had two countries two of the ends of the earth involved and thus though the notion of the resuscitated man failed entirely on the score of general acceptation or even as i have since found acceptability it fitted at once with my design of a tale of many lands and this decided me to consider further of its possibilities the man who should thus be buried was the first question a good man whose return to life would be hailed by the reader and the other characters with gladness this trenched upon the christian picture and was dismissed if the idea then was to be of any use at all for me i had to create a kind of evil genius to his friends and family take him through many disappearances and make this final restoration from the pit of death in the icy american wilderness the last and the grimmest of the series i need not tell my brothers of the craft that i was now in the most interesting moment of an authors life the hours that followed that night upon the balcony and the following nights and days whether walking abroad or lying wakeful in my bed were hours of unadulterated joy my mother who was then living with me alone perhaps had less enjoyment for in the absence of my wife who is my usual helper in these times of parturition i must spur her up at all seasons to hear me relate and try to clarify my unformed fancies  and while i was groping for the fable and the character required behold i found them lying ready and nine years old in my memory pease porridge hot pease porridge cold pease porridge in the pot nine years old was there ever a more complete justification of the rule of horace here thinking of quite other things i had stumbled on the solution or perhaps i should rather say in stagewright phrase the curtain or final tableau of a story conceived long before on the moors between pitlochry and strathardle conceived in highland rain in the blend of the smell of heather and bogplants and with a mind full of the athole correspondence and the memories of the dumlicide justice so long ago so far away it was that i had first evoked the faces and the mutual tragic situation of the men of durrisdeer  my story was now worldwide enough scotland india and america being all obligatory scenes but of these india was strange to me except in books i had never known any living indian save a parsee a member of my club in london equally civilised and to all seeing equally occidental with myself it was plain thus far that i should have to get into india and out of it again upon a foot of fairy lightness and i believe this first suggested to me the idea of the chevalier burke for a narrator it was at first intended that he should be scottish and i was then filled with fears that he might prove only the degraded shadow of my own alan breck presently however it began to occur to me it would be like my master to curry favour with the princes irishmen and that an irish refugee would have a particular reason to find himself in india with his countryman the unfortunate lally irish therefore i decided he should be and then all of a sudden i was aware of a tall shadow across my path the shadow of barry lyndon no man in lord foppingtons phrase of a nice morality could go very deep with my master in the original idea of this story conceived in scotland this companion had been besides intended to be worse than the bad elder son with whom as it was then meant he was to visit scotland if i took an irishman and a very bad irishman in the midst of the eighteenth century how was i to evade barry lyndon the wretch besieged me offering his services he gave me excellent references he proved that he was highly fitted for the work i had to do he or my own evil heart suggested it was easy to disguise his ancient livery with a little lace and a few frogs and buttons so that thackeray himself should hardly recognise him and then of a sudden there came to me memories of a young irishman with whom i was once intimate and had spent long nights walking and talking with upon a very desolate coast in a bleak autumn i recalled him as a youth of an extraordinary moral simplicityalmost vacancy plastic to any influence the creature of his admirations and putting such a youth in fancy into the career of a soldier of fortune it occurred to me that he would serve my turn as well as mr lyndon and in place of entering into competition with the master would afford a slight though a distinct relief i know not if i have done him well though his moral dissertations always highly entertained me but i own i have been surprised to find that he reminded some critics of barry lyndon after all     xiii  random memories rosa quo locorum    i   through what little channels by what hints and premonitions the consciousness of the mans art dawns first upon the child it should be not only interesting but instructive to inquire a matter of curiosity today it will become the ground of science tomorrow from the mind of childhood there is more history and more philosophy to be fished up than from all the printed volumes in a library the child is conscious of an interest not in literature but in life a taste for the precise the adroit or the comely in the use of words comes late but long before that he has enjoyed in books a delightful dress rehearsal of experience he is first conscious of this materiali had almost said this practicalpreoccupation it does not follow that it really came the first i have some old fogged negatives in my collection that would seem to imply a prior stage the lord is gone up with a shout and god with the sound of a trumpetmemorial version i know not where to find the textrings still in my ear from my first childhood and perhaps with something of my nurses accent there was possibly some sort of image written in my mind by these loud words but i believe the words themselves were what i cherished i had about the same time and under the same influencethat of my dear nursea favourite author it is possible the reader has not heard of himthe rev robert murray mcheyne my nurse and i admired his name exceedingly so that i must have been taught the love of beautiful sounds before i was breeched and i remember two specimens of his muse until this day    behind the hills of naphtali      the sun went slowly down    leaving on mountain tower and tree      a tinge of golden brown  there is imagery here and i set it on one side the otherit is but a versenot only contains no image but is quite unintelligible even to my comparatively instructed mind and i know not even how to spell the outlandish vocable that charmed me in my childhood    jehovah tschidkenu is nothing to her 34  i may say without flippancy that he was nothing to me either since i had no ray of a guess of what he was about yet the verse from then to now a longer interval than the life of a generation has continued to haunt me  i have said that i should set a passage distinguished by obvious and pleasing imagery however faint for the child thinks much in images words are very live to him phrases that imply a picture eloquent beyond their value rummaging in the dusty pigeonholes of memory i came once upon a graphic version of the famous psalm the lord is my shepherd and from the places employed in its illustration which are all in the immediate neighbourhood of a house then occupied by my father i am able to date it before the seventh year of my age although it was probably earlier in fact the pastures green were represented by a certain suburban stubblefield where i had once walked with my nurse under an autumnal sunset on the banks of the water of leith the place is long ago built up no pastures now no stubblefields only a maze of little streets and smoking chimneys and shrill children here in the fleecy person of a sheep i seemed to myself to follow something unseen unrealised and yet benignant and close by the sheep in which i was incarnatedas if for greater securityrustled the skirts of my nurse deaths dark vale was a certain archway in the warriston cemetery a formidable yet beloved spot for children love to be afraidin measure as they love all experience of vitality here i beheld myself some paces ahead seeing myself i mean from behind utterly alone in that uncanny passage on the one side of me a rude knobby shepherds staff such as cheers the heart of the cockney tourist on the other a rod like a billiard cue appeared to accompany my progress the staff sturdily upright the billiard cue inclined confidentially like one whispering towards my ear i was awarei will never tell you howthat the presence of these articles afforded me encouragement the third and last of my pictures illustrated the words    my table thou hast furnishèd      in presence of my foes    my head thou dost with oil anoint      and my cup overflows  and this was perhaps the most interesting of the series i saw myself seated in a kind of open stone summerhouse at table over my shoulder a hairy bearded and robed presence anointed me from an authentic shoehorn the summerhouse was part of the green court of a ruin and from the far side of the court black and white imps discharged against me ineffectual arrows the picture appears arbitrary but i can trace every detail to its source as mr brock analysed the dream of alan armadale the summerhouse and court were muddled together out of billings antiquities of scotland the imps conveyed from bagsters pilgrims progress the bearded and robed figure from any one of a thousand bible pictures and the shoehorn was plagiarised from an old illustrated bible where it figured in the hand of samuel anointing saul and had been pointed out to me as a jest by my father it was shown me for a jest remark but the serious spirit of infancy adopted it in earnest children are all classics a bottle would have seemed an intermediary too trivialthat divine refreshment of whose meaning i had no guess and i seized on the idea of that mystic shoehorn with delight even as a little later i should have written flagon chalice hanaper beaker or any word that might have appealed to me at the moment as least contaminate with mean associations in this string of pictures i believe the gist of the psalm to have consisted i believe it had no more to say to me and the result was consolatory i would go to sleep dwelling with restfulness upon these images they passed before me besides to an appropriate music for i had already singled out from that rude psalm the one lovely verse which dwells in the minds of all not growing old not disgraced by its association with long sunday tasks a scarce conscious joy in childhood in age a companion thought    in pastures green thou leadest me        the quiet waters by  the remainder of my childish recollections are all of the matter of what was read to me and not of any manner in the words if these pleased me it was unconsciously i listened for news of the great vacant world upon whose edge i stood i listened for delightful plots that i might reenact in play and romantic scenes and circumstances that i might call up before me with closed eyes when i was tired of scotland and home and that weary prison of the sickchamber in which i lay so long in durance robinson crusoe some of the books of that cheerful ingenious romantic soul mayne reid and a work rather gruesome and bloody for a child but very picturesque called paul blake these are the three strongest impressions i remember the swiss family robinson came next longo intervallo at these i played conjured up their scenes and delighted to hear them rehearsed unto seventy times seven i am not sure but what paul blake came after i could read it seems connected with a visit to the country and an experience unforgettable the day had been warm h and i had played together charmingly all day in a sandy wilderness across the road then came the evening with a great flash of colour and a heavenly sweetness in the air somehow my playmate had vanished or is out of the story as the sagas say but i was sent into the village on an errand and taking a book of fairy tales went down alone through a firwood reading as i walked how often since then has it befallen me to be happy even so but that was the first time the shock of that pleasure i have never since forgot and if my mind serves me to the last i never shall for it was then that i knew i loved reading     ii  to pass from hearing literature to reading it is to take a great and dangerous step with not a few i think a large proportion of their pleasure then comes to an end the malady of not marking overtakes them they read thenceforward by the eye alone and hear never again the chime of fair words or the march of the stately period non ragioniam of these but to all the step is dangerous it involves coming of age it is even a kind of second weaning in the past all was at the choice of others they chose they digested they read aloud for us and sang to their own tune the books of childhood in the future we are to approach the silent inexpressive type alone like pioneers and the choice of what we are to read is in our own hands thenceforward for instance in the passages already adduced i detect and applaud the ear of my old nurse they were of her choice and she imposed them on my infancy reading the works of others as a poet would scarce dare to read his own gloating on the rhythm dwelling with delight on assonances and alliterations i know very well my mother must have been all the while trying to educate my taste upon more secular authors but the vigour and the continual opportunities of my nurse triumphed and after a long search i can find in these earliest volumes of my autobiography no mention of anything but nursery rhymes the bible and mr mcheyne  i suppose all children agree in looking back with delight on their school readers we might not now find so much pathos in bingen on the rhine a soldier of the legion lay dying in algiers or in the soldiers funeral in the declamation of which i was held to have surpassed myself roberts voice said the master on this memorable occasion is not strong but impressive an opinion which i was fool enough to carry home to my father who roasted me for years in consequence i am sure one should not be so deliciously tickled by the humorous pieces    what crusty cries will in a taking    who would not be crusty with half a years baking  i think this quip would leave us cold the isles of greece seem rather tawdry too but on the address to the ocean or on the dying gladiator time has writ no wrinkle    tis the morn but dim and dark    whither flies the silent lark  does the reader recall the moment when his eye first fell upon these lines in the fourth reader and surprised with joy impatient as the wind he plunged into the sequel and there was another piece this time in prose which none can have forgotten many like me must have searched dickens with zeal to find it again and in its proper context and have perhaps been conscious of some inconsiderable measure of disappointment that it was only tom pinch who drove in such a pomp of poetry to london  but in the reader we are still under guides what a boy turns out for himself as he rummages the bookshelves is the real test and pleasure my fathers library was a spot of some austerity the proceedings of learned societies some latin divinity cyclopædias physical science and above all optics held the chief place upon the shelves and it was only in holes and corners that anything really legible existed as by accident the parents assistant rob roy waverley and guy mannering the voyages of captain woods rogers fullers and bunyans holy wars the reflections of robinson crusoe the female bluebeard g sands mare au diablehow came it in that grave assembly ainsworths tower of london and four old volumes of punchthese were the chief exceptions in these latter which made for years the chief of my diet i very early fell in love almost as soon as i could spell with the snob papers i knew them almost by heart particularly the visit to the pontos and i remember my surprise when i found long afterwards that they were famous and signed with a famous name to me as i read and admired them they were the works of mr punch time and again i tried to read rob roy with whom of course i was acquainted from the tales of a grandfather time and again the early part with rashleigh and think of it the adorable diana choked me off and i shall never forget the pleasure and surprise with which lying on the floor one summer evening i struck of a sudden into the first scene with andrew fairservice the worthy dr lightfootmistrysted with a boglea wheen green trashjenny lass i think i hae her from that day to this the phrases have been unforgotten i read on i need scarce say i came to glasgow i bided tryst on glasgow bridge i met rob roy and the bailie in the tolbooth all with transporting pleasure and then the clouds gathered once more about my path and i dozed and skipped until i stumbled half asleep into the clachan of aberfoyle and the voices of iverach and galbraith recalled me to myself with that scene and the defeat of captain thornton the book concluded helen and her sons shocked even the little schoolboy of nine or ten with their unreality i read no more or i did not grasp what i was reading and years elapsed before i consciously met diana and her father among the hills or saw rashleigh dying in the chair when i think of that novel and that evening i am impatient with all others they seem but shadows and impostors they cannot satisfy the appetite which this awakened and i dare be known to think it the best of sir walters by nearly as much as sir walter is the best of novelists perhaps mr lang is right and our first friends in the land of fiction are always the most real and yet i had read before this guy mannering and some of waverley with no such delighted sense of truth and humour and i read immediately after the greater part of the waverley novels and was never moved again in the same way or to the same degree one circumstance is suspicious my critical estimate of the waverley novels has scarce changed at all since i was ten rob roy guy mannering and redgauntlet first then a little lower the fortunes of nigel then after a huge gulf ivanhoe and anne of geierstein the rest nowhere such was the verdict of the boy since then the antiquary st ronans well kenilworth and the heart of midlothian have gone up in the scale perhaps ivanhoe and anne of geierstein have gone a trifle down diana vernon has been added to my admirations in that enchanted world of rob roy i think more of the letters in redgauntlet and peter peebles that dreadful piece of realism i can now read about with equanimity interest and i had almost said pleasure while to the childish critic he often caused unmixed distress but the rest is the same i could not finish the pirate when i was a child i have never finished it yet peveril of the peak dropped half way through from my schoolboy hands and though i have since waded to an end in a kind of wager with myself the exercise was quite without enjoyment there is something disquieting in these considerations i still think the visit to pontos the best part of the book of snobs does that mean that i was right when i was a child or does it mean that i have never grown since then that the child is not the mans father but the man and that i came into the world with all my faculties complete and have only learned sinsyne to be more tolerant of boredom   footnote    34 jehovah tsidkenu translated in the authorised version as the     lord our righteousness jeremiah xxiii 6 and xxxiii 16     xiv  reflections and remarks on human life   i justice and justification1 it is the business of this life to make excuses for others but none for ourselves we should be clearly persuaded of our own misconduct for that is the part of knowledge in which we are most apt to be defective 2 even justice is no right of a mans own but a thing like the kings tribute which shall never be his but which he should strive to see rendered to another none was ever just to me none ever will be you may reasonably aspire to be chief minister or sovereign pontiff but not to be justly regarded in your own character and acts you know too much to be satisfied for justice is but an earthly currency paid to appearances you may see another superficially righted but be sure he has got too little or too much and in your own case rest content with what is paid you it is more just than you suppose that your virtues are misunderstood is a price you pay to keep your meannesses concealed 3 when you seek to justify yourself to others you may be sure you will plead falsely if you fail you have the shame of the failure if you succeed you will have made too much of it and be unjustly esteemed upon the other side 4 you have perhaps only one friend in the world in whose esteem it is worth while for you to right yourself justification to indifferent persons is at best an impertinent intrusion let them think what they please they will be the more likely to forgive you in the end 5 it is a question hard to be resolved whether you should at any time criminate another to defend yourself i have done it many times and always had a troubled conscience for my pains   ii parent and child1 the love of parents for their children is of all natural affections the most illstarred it is not a love for the person since it begins before the person has come into the world and founds on an imaginary character and looks thus it is foredoomed to disappointment and because the parent either looks for too much or at least for something inappropriate at his offsprings hands it is too often insufficiently repaid the natural bond besides is stronger from parent to child than from child to parent and it is the side which confers benefits not which receives them that thinks most of a relation 2 what do we owe our parents no man can owe love none can owe obedience we owe i think chiefly pity for we are the pledge of their dear and joyful union we have been the solicitude of their days and the anxiety of their nights we have made them though by no will of ours to carry the burthen of our sins sorrows and physical infirmities and too many of us grow up at length to disappoint the purpose of their lives and requite their care and piety with cruel pangs 3 mater dolorosa it is the particular cross of parents that when the child grows up and becomes himself instead of that pale ideal they had preconceived they must accuse their own harshness or indulgence for this natural result they have all been like the duck and hatched swans eggs or the other way about yet they tell themselves with miserable penitence that the blame lies with them and had they sat more closely the swan would have been a duck and homekeeping in spite of all 4 a good son who can fulfil what is expected of him has done his work in life he has to redeem the sins of many and restore the worlds confidence in children   iii dialogue on character and destiny between two puppetsat the end of chapter xxxiii count spada and the general of the jesuits were left alone in the pavilion while the course of the story was turned upon the doings of the virtuous hero profiting by this moment of privacy the jesuit turned with a very warning countenance upon the peer  have a care my lord said he raising a finger you are already no favourite with the author and for my part i begin to perceive from a thousand evidences that the narrative is drawing near a close yet a chapter or two at most and you will be overtaken by some sudden and appalling judgment  i despise your womanish presentiments replied spada and count firmly upon another volume i see a variety of reasons why my life should be prolonged to within a few pages of the end indeed i permit myself to expect resurrection in a sequel or second part you will scarce suggest that there can be any end to the newspaper and you will certainly never convince me that the author who cannot be entirely without sense would have been at so great pains with my intelligence gallant exterior and happy and natural speech merely to kick me hither and thither for two or three paltry chapters and then drop me at the end like a dumb personage i know you priests are often infidels in secret pray do you believe in an author at all  many do not i am aware replied the general softly even in the last chapter we encountered one the selfrighteous david hume who goes so far as to doubt the existence of the newspaper in which our adventures are now appearing but it would neither become my cloth nor do credit to my great experience were i to meddle with these dangerous opinions my alarm for you is not metaphysical it is moral in its origin you must be aware my poor friend that you are a very bad characterthe worst indeed that i have met with in these pages the author hates you count and difficult as it may be to connect the idea of immortalityor in plain terms of a sequelwith the paper and printers ink of which your humanity is made it is yet more difficult to foresee anything but punishment and pain for one who is justly hateful in the eyes of his creator  you take for granted many things that i shall not easily be persuaded to allow replied the villain do you really so far deceive yourself in your imagination as to fancy that the author is a friend to good read read the book in which you figure and you will soon disown such crude vulgarities lelio is a good character yet only two chapters ago we left him in a fine predicament his old servant was a model of the virtues yet did he not miserably perish in that ambuscade upon the road to poitiers and as for the family of the bankrupt merchant how is it possible for greater moral qualities to be alive with more irremediable misfortunes and yet you continue to misrepresent an author to yourself as a deity devoted to virtue and inimical to vice pray if you have no pride in your own intellectual credit for yourself spare at least the sensibilities of your associates  the purposes of the serial story answered the priest are doubtless for some wise reason hidden from those who act in it to this limitation we must bow but i ask every character to observe narrowly his own personal relations to the author there if nowhere else we may glean some hint of his superior designs now i am myself a mingled personage liable to doubts to scruples and to sudden revulsions of feeling i reason continually about life and frequently the result of my reasoning is to condemn or even to change my action i am now convinced for example that i did wrong in joining in your plot against the innocent and most unfortunate lelio i told you so you will remember in the chapter which has just been concluded and though i do not know whether you perceived the ardour and fluency with which i expressed myself i am still confident in my own heart that i spoke at that moment not only with the warm approval but under the direct inspiration of the author of the tale i know spada i tell you i know that he loved me as i uttered these words and yet at other periods of my career i have been conscious of his indifference and dislike you must not seek to reason me from this conviction for it is supplied me from higher authority than that of reason and is indeed a part of my experience it may be an illusion that i drove last night from saumur it may be an illusion that we are now in the garden chamber of the château it may be an illusion that i am conversing with count spada you may be an illusion count yourself but of three things i will remain eternally persuaded that the author exists not only in the newspaper but in my own heart that he loves me when i do well and that he hates and despises me when i do otherwise  i too believe in the author returned the count i believe likewise in a sequel written in finer style and probably cast in a still higher rank of society than the present story although i am not convinced that we shall then be conscious of our preexistence here so much of your argument is therefore beside the mark for to a certain point i am as orthodox as yourself but where you begin to draw general conclusions from your own private experience i must beg pointedly and finally to differ you will not have forgotten i believe my daring and singlehanded butchery of the five secret witnesses nor the sleight of mind and dexterity of language with which i separated lelio from the merchants family these were not virtuous actions and yet how am i to tell you i was conscious of a troubled joy a glee a hellish gusto in my authors bosom which seemed to renew my vigour with every sentence and which has indeed made the first of these passages accepted for a model of spirited narrative description and the second for a masterpiece of wickedness and wit what result then can be drawn from two experiences so contrary as yours and mine for my part i lay it down as a principle no author can be moral in a merely human sense and to pursue the argument higher how can you for one instant suppose the existence of freewill in puppets situated as we are in the thick of a novel which we do not even understand and how without freewill upon our parts can you justify blame or approval on that of the author we are in his hands by a stroke of the pen to speak reverently he made us what we are by a stroke of the pen he can utterly undo and transmute what he has made in the very next chapter my dear general you may be shown up for an impostor or i be stricken down in the tears of penitence and hurried into the retirement of a monastery  you use an argument old as mankind and difficult of answer said the priest i cannot justify the freewill of which i am usually conscious nor will i ever seek to deny that this consciousness is interrupted sometimes events mount upon me with such swiftness and pressure that my choice is overwhelmed and even to myself i seem to obey a will external to my own and again i am sometimes so paralysed and impotent between alternatives that i am tempted to imagine a hesitation on the part of my author but i contend upon the other hand for a limited freewill in the sphere of consciousness and as it is in and by my consciousness that i exist to myself i will not go on to inquire whether that freewill is valid as against the author the newspaper or even the readers of the story and i contend further for a sort of empire or independence of our own characters when once created which the author cannot or at least does not choose to violate hence lelio was conceived upright honest courageous and headlong to that first idea all his acts and speeches must of necessity continue to answer and the same though with such different defects and qualities applies to you count spada and to myself we must act up to our characters it is these characters that the author loves or despises it is on account of them that we must suffer or triumph whether in this work or in a sequel such is my belief  it is pure calvinistic election my dear sir and by your leave a very heretical position for a churchman to support replied the count nor can i see how it removes the difficulty i was not consulted as to my character i might have chosen to be lelio i might have chosen to be yourself i might even have preferred to figure in a different romance or not to enter into the world of literature at all and am i to be blamed or hated because some one else wilfully and inhumanely made me what i am and has continued ever since to encourage me in what are called my vices you may say what you please my dear sir but if that is the case i had rather be a telegram from the seat of war than a reasonable and conscious character in a romance nay and i have a perfect right to repudiate loathe curse and utterly condemn the ruffian who calls himself the author  you have as you say a perfect right replied the jesuit and i am convinced that it will not affect him in the least  he shall have one slave the fewer for me added the count i discard my allegiance once for all  as you please concluded the other but at least be ready for i perceive we are about to enter on the scene  and indeed just at that moment chapter xxxiv being completed chapter xxxv the counts chastisement began to appear in the columns of the newspaper   iv solitude and society1 a little society is needful to show a man his failings for if he lives entirely by himself he has no occasion to fall and like a soldier in time of peace becomes both weak and vain but a little solitude must be used or we grow content with current virtues and forget the ideal in society we lose scrupulous brightness of honour in solitude we lose the courage necessary to face our own imperfections 2 as a question of pleasure after a man has reached a certain age i can hardly perceive much room to choose between them each is in a way delightful and each will please best after an experience of the other 3 but solitude for its own sake should surely never be preferred we are bound by the strongest obligations to busy ourselves amid the world of men if it be only to crack jokes the finest trait in the character of st paul was his readiness to be damned for the salvation of anybody else and surely we should all endure a little weariness to make one face look brighter or one hour go more pleasantly in this mixed world 4 it is our business here to speak for it is by the tongue that we multiply ourselves most influentially to speak kindly wisely and pleasantly is the first of duties the easiest of duties and the duty that is most blessed in its performance for it is natural it whiles away life it spreads intelligence and it increases the acquaintance of man with man 5 it is besides a good investment for while all other pleasures decay and even the delight in nature grandfather william is still bent to gossip 6 solitude is the climax of the negative virtues when we go to bed after a solitary day we can tell ourselves that we have not been unkind nor dishonest nor untruthful and the negative virtues are agreeable to that dangerous faculty we call the conscience that they should ever be admitted for a part of virtue is what i cannot explain i do not care two straws for all the nots 7 the positive virtues are imperfect they are even ugly in their imperfection for mans acts by the necessity of his being are coarse and mingled the kindest in the course of a day of active kindnesses will say some things rudely and do some things cruelly the most honourable perhaps trembles at his nearness to a doubtful act 8 hence the solitary recoils from the practice of life shocked by its unsightlinesses but if i could only retain that superfine and guiding delicacy of the sense that grows in solitude and still combine with it that courage of performance which is never abashed by any failure but steadily pursues its right and human design in a scene of imperfection i might hope to strike in the longrun a conduct more tender to others and less humiliating to myself   v selfishness and egoisman unconscious easy selfish person shocks less and is more easily loved than one who is laboriously and egotistically unselfish there is at least no fuss about the first but the other parades his sacrifices and so sells his favours too dear selfishness is calm a force of nature you might say the trees were selfish but egoism is a piece of vanity it must always take you into its confidence it is uneasy troublesome seeking it can do good but not handsomely it is uglier because less dignified than selfishness itself but here i perhaps exaggerate to myself because i am the one more than the other and feel it like a hook in my mouth at every step i take do what i will this seems to spoil all   vi right and wrongit is the mark of a good action that it appears inevitable in the retrospect we should have been cutthroats to do otherwise and theres an end we ought to know distinctly that we are damned for what we do wrong but when we have done right we have only been gentlemen after all there is nothing to make a work about   vii discipline of conscience1 never allow your mind to dwell on your own misconduct that is ruin the conscience has morbid sensibilities it must be employed but not indulged like the imagination or the stomach 2 let each stab suffice for the occasion to play with this spiritual pain turns to penance and a person easily learns to feel good by dallying with the consciousness of having done wrong 3 shut your eyes hard against the recollection of your sins do not be afraid you will not be able to forget them 4 you will always do wrong you must try to get used to that my son it is a small matter to make a work about when all the world is in the same case i meant when i was a young man to write a great poem and now i am cobbling little prose articles and in excellent good spirits i thank you so too i meant to lead a life that should keep mounting from the first and though i have been repeatedly down again below sealevel and am scarce higher than when i started i am as keen as ever for that enterprise our business in this world is not to succeed but to continue to fail in good spirits 5 there is but one test of a good life that the man shall continue to grow more difficult about his own behaviour that is to be good there is no other virtue attainable the virtues we admire in the saint and the hero are the fruits of a happy constitution you for your part must not think you will ever be a good man for these are born and not made you will have your own reward if you keep on growing better than you werehow do i say if you do not keep on growing worse 6 a man is one thing and must be exercised in all his faculties whatever side of you is neglected whether it is the muscles or the taste for art or the desire for virtue that which is cultivated will suffer in proportion  was greatly tempted i remember to do a very dishonest act in order that he might pursue his studies in art when he consulted me i advised him not putting it that way for once because his art would suffer 7 it might be fancied that if we could only study all sides of our being in an exact proportion we should attain wisdom but in truth a chief part of education is to exercise one set of faculties à outranceone since we have not the time so to practise all thus the dilettante misses the kernel of the matter and the man who has wrung forth the secret of one part of life knows more about the others than he who has tepidly circumnavigated all 8 thus one must be your profession the rest can only be your delights and virtue had better be kept for the latter for it enters into all but none enters by necessity into it you will learn a great deal of virtue by studying any art but nothing of any art in the study of virtue 9 the study of conduct has to do with grave problems not every action should be higgled over one of the leading virtues therein is to let oneself alone but if you make it your chief employment you are sure to meddle too much this is the great error of those who are called pious although the war of virtue be unending except with life hostilities are frequently suspended and the troops go into winter quarters but the pious will not profit by these times of truce where their conscience can perceive no sin they will find a sin in that very innocency and so they pervert to their annoyance those seasons which god gives to us for repose and a reward 10 the nearest approximation to sense in all this matter lies with the quakers there must be no willworship how much more no willrepentance the damnable consequence of set seasons even for prayer is to have a man continually posturing to himself till his conscience is taught as many tricks as a pet monkey and the gravest expressions are left with a perverted meaning 11 for my part i should try to secure some part of every day for meditation above all in the early morning and the open air but how that time was to be improved i should leave to circumstance and the inspiration of the hour nor if i spent it in whistling or numbering my footsteps should i consider it misspent for that i should have given my conscience a fair field when it has anything to say i know too well it can speak daggers therefore for this time my hard taskmaster has given me a holyday and i may go in again rejoicing to my breakfast and the human business of the day   viii gratitude to god1 to the gratitude that becomes us in this life i can set no limit though we steer after a fashion yet we must sail according to the winds and currents after what i have done what might i not have done that i have still the courage to attempt my life that i am not now overladen with dishonours to whom do i owe it but to the gentle ordering of circumstances in the great design more has not been done to me than i can bear i have been marvellously restrained and helped not unto us o lord 2 i cannot forgive god for the suffering of others when i look abroad upon his world and behold its cruel destinies i turn from him with disaffection nor do i conceive that he will blame me for the impulse but when i consider my own fates i grow conscious of his gentle dealing i see him chastise with helpful blows i feel his stripes to be caresses and this knowledge is my comfort that reconciles me to the world 3 all those whom i now pity with indignation are perhaps not less fatherly dealt with than myself i do right to be angry yet they perhaps if they lay aside heat and temper and reflect with patience on their lot may find everywhere in their worst trials the same proofs of a divine affection 4 while we have little to try us we are angry with little small annoyances do not bear their justification on their faces but when we are overtaken by a great sorrow or perplexity the greatness of our concern sobers us so that we see more clearly and think with more consideration i speak for myself nothing grave has yet befallen me but i have been able to reconcile my mind to its occurrence and see in it from my own little and partial point of view an evidence of a tender and protecting god even the misconduct into which i have been led has been blessed to my improvement if i did not sin and that so glaringly that my conscience is convicted on the spot i do not know what i should become but i feel sure i should grow worse the man of very regular conduct is too often a prig if he be not worsea rabbi i for my part want to be startled out of my conceits i want to be put to shame in my own eyes i want to feel the bridle in my mouth and be continually reminded of my own weakness and the omnipotence of circumstances 5 if i from my spyhole looking with purblind eyes upon the least part of a fraction of the universe yet perceive in my own destiny some broken evidences of a plan and some signals of an overruling goodness shall i then be so mad as to complain that all cannot be deciphered shall i not rather wonder with infinite and grateful surprise that in so vast a scheme i seem to have been able to read however little and that that little was encouraging to faith   ix blamewhat comes from without and what from within how much of conduct proceeds from the spirit or how much from circumstances what is the part of choice and what the part of the selection offered where personal character begins or where if anywhere it escapes at all from the authority of nature these are questions of curiosity and eternally indifferent to right and wrong our theory of blame is utterly sophisticated and untrue to mans experience we are as much ashamed of a pimpled face that came to us by natural descent as by one that we have earned by our excesses and rightly so since the two cases in so much as they unfit us for the easier sort of pleasing and put an obstacle in the path of love are exactly equal in their consequence we look aside from the true question we cannot blame others at all we can only punish them and ourselves we blame indifferently for a deliberate crime a thoughtless brusquerie or an act done without volition in an ecstasy of madness we blame ourselves from two considerations first because another has suffered and second because in so far as we have again done wrong we can look forward with the less confidence to what remains of our career shall we repent this failure it is there that the consciousness of sin most cruelly affects us it is in view of this that a man cries out in exaggeration that his heart is desperately wicked and deceitful above all things we all tacitly subscribe this judgment woe unto him by whom offences shall come we accept palliations for our neighbours we dare not in sight of our own soul accept them for ourselves we may not be to blame we may be conscious of no free will in the matter of a possession on the other hand or an irresistible tyranny of circumstanceyet we know in another sense we are to blame for all our right to live to eat to share in mankinds pleasures lies precisely in this that we must be persuaded we can on the whole live rather beneficially than hurtfully to others remove this persuasion and the man has lost his right that persuasion is our dearest jewel to which we must sacrifice the life itself to which it entitles us for it is better to be dead than degraded   x marriage1 no considerate man can approach marriage without deep concern i he will think who have made hitherto so poor a business of my own life am now about to embrace the responsibility of anothers henceforth there shall be two to suffer from my faults and that other is the one whom i most desire to shield from suffering in view of our impotence and folly it seems an act of presumption to involve anothers destiny with ours we should hesitate to assume command of an army or a tradingsmack shall we not hesitate to become surety for the life and happiness now and henceforward of our dearest friend to be nobodys enemy but ones own although it is never possible to any can least of all be possible to one who is married 2 i would not so much fear to give hostages to fortune if fortune ruled only in material things but fortune as we call those minor and more inscrutable workings of providence rules also in the sphere of conduct i am not so blind but that i know i might be a murderer or even a traitor tomorrow and now as if i were not already too feelingly alive to my misdeeds i must choose out the one person whom i most desire to please and make her the daily witness of my failures i must give a part in all my dishonours to the one person who can feel them more keenly than myself 3 in all our daring magnanimous human way of life i find nothing more bold than this to go into battle is but a small thing by comparison it is the last act of committal after that there is no way left not even suicide but to be a good man 4 she will help you let us pray and yet she is in the same case she too has daily made shipwreck of her own happiness and worth it is with a courage no less irrational than yours that she also ventures on this new experiment of life two who have failed severally now join their fortunes with a wavering hope 5 but it is from the boldness of the enterprise that help springs to take home to your hearth that living witness whose blame will most affect you to eat to sleep to live with your most admiring and thence most exacting judge is not this to domesticate the living god each becomes a conscience to the other legible like a clock upon the chimneypiece each offers to his mate a figure of the consequence of human acts and while i may still continue by my inconsiderate or violent life to spread farreaching havoc throughout mans confederacy i can do so no more at least in ignorance and levity one face shall wince before me in the flesh i have taken home the sorrows i create to my own hearth and bed and though i continue to sin it must be now with open eyes   xi idleness and industryi remember a time when i was very idle and lived and profited by that humour i have no idea why i ceased to be so yet i scarce believe i have the power to return to it it is a change of age i made consciously a thousand little efforts but the determination from which these arose came to me while i slept and in the way of growth i have had a thousand skirmishes to keep myself at work upon particular mornings and sometimes the affair was hot but of that great change of campaign which decided all this part of my life and turned me from one whose business was to shirk into one whose business was to strive and persevereit seems as though all that had been done by some one else the life of goethe affected me so did that of balzac and some very noble remarks by the latter in a pretty bad book the cousine bette i daresay i could trace some other influences in the change all i mean is i was never conscious of a struggle nor registered a vow nor seemingly had anything personally to do with the matter i came about like a wellhandled ship there stood at the wheel that unknown steersman whom we call god   xii couragecourage is the principal virtue for all the others presuppose it if you are afraid you may do anything courage is to be cultivated and some of the negative virtues may be sacrificed in the cultivation   xiii results of actionthe result is the reward of actions not the test the result is a child born if it be beautiful and healthy well if clubfooted or crookback perhaps well also we cannot direct        1878     xv  the ideal house   two things are necessary in any neighbourhood where we propose to spend a life a desert and some living water  there are many parts of the earths face which offer the necessary combination of a certain wildness with a kindly variety a great prospect is desirable but the want may be otherwise supplied even greatness can be found on the small scale for the mind and the eye measure differently bold rocks near hand are more inspiriting than distant alps and the thick fern upon a surrey heath makes a fine forest for the imagination and the dotted yew trees noble mountains a scottish moor with birches and firs grouped here and there upon a knoll or one of those rocky seaside deserts of provence overgrown with rosemary and thyme and smoking with aroma are places where the mind is never weary forests being more enclosed are not at first sight so attractive but they exercise a spell they must however be diversified with either heath or rock and are hardly to be considered perfect without conifers even sandhills with their intricate plan and their gulls and rabbits will stand well for the necessary desert  the house must be within hail of either a little river or the sea a great river is more fit for poetry than to adorn a neighbourhood its sweep of waters increases the scale of the scenery and the distance of one notable object from another and a lively burn gives us in the space of a few yards a greater variety of promontory and islet of cascade shallow goil and boiling pool with answerable changes both of song and colour than a navigable stream in many hundred miles the fish too make a more considerable feature of the brookside and the trout plumping in the shadow takes the ear a stream should besides be narrow enough to cross or the burn hard by a bridge or we are at once shut out of eden the quantity of water need be of no concern for the mind sets the scale and can enjoy a niagara fall of thirty inches let us approve the singer of    shallow rivers by whose falls    melodious birds sing madrigals  if the sea is to be our ornamental water choose an open seaboard with a heavy beat of surf one much broken in outline with small havens and dwarf headlands if possible a few islets and as a first necessity rocks reaching out into deep water such a rock on a calm day is a better station than the top of teneriffe or chimborazo in short both for the desert and the water the conjunction of many near and bold details is bold scenery for the imagination and keeps the mind alive  given these two prime luxuries the nature of the country where we are to live is i had almost said indifferent after that inside the garden we can construct a country of our own several old trees a considerable variety of level several wellgrown hedges to divide our garden into provinces a good extent of old wellset turf and thickets of shrubs and evergreens to be cut into and cleared at the new owners pleasure are the qualities to be sought for in your chosen land nothing is more delightful than a succession of small lawns opening one out of the other through tall hedges these have all the charm of the old bowlinggreen repeated do not require the labour of many trimmers and afford a series of changes you must have much lawn against the early summer so as to have a great field of daisies the years morning frost as you must have a wood of lilacs to enjoy to the full the period of their blossoming hawthorn is another of the springs ingredients but it is even best to have a rough public lane at one side of your enclosure which at the right season shall become an avenue of bloom and odour the old flowers are the best and should grow carelessly in corners indeed the ideal fortune is to find an old garden once very richly cared for since sunk into neglect and to tend not repair that neglect it will thus have a smack of nature and wildness which skilful dispositions cannot overtake the gardener should be an idler and have a gross partiality to the kitchen plots an eager or toilful gardener misbecomes the garden landscape a tasteful gardener will be ever meddling will keep the borders raw and take the bloom off nature close adjoining if you are in the south an oliveyard if in the north a swarded appleorchard reaching to the stream completes your miniature domain but this is perhaps best entered through a door in the high fruitwall so that you close the door behind you on your sunny plots your hedges and evergreen jungle when you go down to watch the apples falling in the pool it is a golden maxim to cultivate the garden for the nose and the eyes will take care of themselves nor must the ear be forgotten without birds a garden is a prisonyard there is a garden near marseilles on a steep hillside walking by which upon a sunny morning your ear will suddenly be ravished with a burst of small and very cheerful singing some score of cages being set out there to sun the occupants this is a heavenly surprise to any passerby but the price paid to keep so many ardent and winged creatures from their liberty will make the luxury too dear for any thoughtful pleasurelover there is only one sort of bird that i can tolerate caged though even then i think it hard and that is what is called in france the becdargent i once had two of these pigmies in captivity and in the quiet bare house upon a silent street where i was then living their song which was not much louder than a bees but airily musical kept me in a perpetual good humour i put the cage upon my table when i worked carried it with me when i went for meals and kept it by my head at night the first thing in the morning these maestrini would pipe up but these even if you can pardon their imprisonment are for the house in the garden the wild birds must plant a colony a chorus of the lesser warblers that should be almost deafening a blackbird in the lilacs a nightingale down the lane so that you must stroll to hear it and yet a little farther treetops populous with rooks  your house should not command much outlook it should be set deep and green though upon rising ground or if possible crowning a knoll for the sake of drainage yet it must be open to the east or you will miss the sunrise sunset occurring so much later you can go up a few steps and look the other way a house of more than two stories is a mere barrack indeed the ideal is of one story raised upon cellars if the rooms are large the house may be small a single room lofty spacious and lightsome is more palatial than a castleful of cabinets and cupboards yet size in a house and some extent and intricacy of corridor is certainly delightful to the flesh the reception room should be if possible a place of many recesses which are petty retiring places for conference but it must have one long wall with a divan for a day spent upon a divan among a world of cushions is as full of diversion as to travel the eatingroom in the french mode should be ad hoc unfurnished but with a buffet the table necessary chairs one or two of canalettos etchings and a tile fireplace for the winter in neither of these public places should there be anything beyond a shelf or two of books but the passages may be one library from end to end and the stair if there be one lined with volumes in old leather very brightly carpeted and leading halfway up and by way of landing to a windowed recess with a fireplace this window almost alone in the house should command a handsome prospect husband and wife must each possess a studio on the womans sanctuary i hesitate to dwell and turn to the mans the walls are shelved waisthigh for books and the top thus forms a continuous table running round the wall above are prints a large map of the neighbourhood a corot and a claude or two the room is very spacious and the five tables and two chairs are but as islands one table is for actual work one close by for references in use one very large for mss or proofs that wait their turn one kept clear for an occasion and the fifth is the map table groaning under a collection of largescale maps and charts of all books these are the least wearisome to read and the richest in matter the course of roads and rivers the contour lines and the forests in the mapsthe reefs soundings anchors sailing marks and little pilotpictures in the chartsand in both the beadroll of names make them of all printed matter the most fit to stimulate and satisfy the fancy the chair in which you write is very low and easy and backed into a corner at one elbow the fire twinkles close at the other if you are a little inhumane your cage of silverbills are twittering into song  joined along by a passage you may reach the great sunny glassroofed and tiled gymnasium at the far end of which lined with bright marble is your plunge and swimming bath fitted with a capacious boiler  the whole loft of the house from end to end makes one undivided chamber here are set forth tables on which to model imaginary or actual countries in putty or plaster with tools and hardy pigments a carpenters bench and a spared corner for photography while at the far end a space is kept clear for playing soldiers two boxes contain the two armies of some five hundred horse and foot two others the ammunition of each side and a fifth the footrules and the three colours of chalk with which you lay down or after a days play refresh the outlines of the country red or white for the two kinds of road according as they are suitable or not for the passage of ordnance and blue for the course of the obstructing rivers here i foresee that you may pass much happy time against a good adversary a game may well continue for a month for with armies so considerable three moves will occupy an hour it will be found to set an excellent edge on this diversion if one of the players shall every day or so write a report of the operations in the character of army correspondent  i have left to the last the little room for winter evenings this should be furnished in warm positive colours and sofas and floor thick with rich furs the hearth where you burn wood of aromatic quality on silver dogs tiled round about with bible pictures the seats deep and easy a single titian in a gold frame a white bust or so upon a bracket a rack for the journals of the week a table for the books of the year and close in a corner the three shelves full of eternal books that never weary shakespeare molière montaigne lamb

calendar        1884     lay morals      the following chapters of a projected treatise on ethics were    drafted at edinburgh in the spring of 1879 they are unrevised and    must not be taken as representing either as to matter or form their    authors final thoughts but they contain much that is essentially    characteristic of his mind     lay morals  chapter i   the problem of education is twofold first to know and then to utter every one who lives any semblance of an inner life thinks more nobly and profoundly than he speaks and the best of teachers can impart only broken images of the truth which they perceive speech which goes from one to another between two natures and what is worse between two experiences is doubly relative the speaker buries his meaning it is for the hearer to dig it up again and all speech written or spoken is in a dead language until it finds a willing and prepared hearer such moreover is the complexity of life that when we condescend upon details in our advice we may be sure we condescend on error and the best of education is to throw out some magnanimous hints no man was ever so poor that he could express all he has in him by words looks or actions his true knowledge is eternally incommunicable for it is a knowledge of himself and his best wisdom comes to him by no process of the mind but in a supreme selfdictation which keeps varying from hour to hour in its dictates with the variation of events and circumstances  a few men of picked nature full of faith courage and contempt for others try earnestly to set forth as much as they can grasp of this inner law but the vast majority when they come to advise the young must be content to retail certain doctrines which have been already retailed to them in their own youth every generation has to educate another which it has brought upon the stage people who readily accept the responsibility of parentship having very different matters in their eye are apt to feel rueful when their responsibility falls due what are they to tell the child about life and conduct subjects on which they have themselves so few and such confused opinions indeed i do not know the least said perhaps the soonest mended and yet the child keeps asking and the parent must find some words to say in his own defence where does he find them and what are they when found  as a matter of experience and in nine hundred and ninetynine cases out of a thousand he will instil into his wideeyed brat three bad things the terror of public opinion and flowing from that as a fountain the desire of wealth and applause besides these or what might be deduced as corollaries from these he will teach not much else of any effective value some dim notions of divinity perhaps and bookkeeping and how to walk through a quadrille  but you may tell me the young people are taught to be christians it may be want of penetration but i have not yet been able to perceive it as an honest man whatever we teach and be it good or evil it is not the doctrine of christ what he taught and in this he is like all other teachers worthy of the name was not a code of rules but a ruling spirit not truths but a spirit of truth not views but a view what he showed us was an attitude of mind towards the many considerations on which conduct is built each man stands in a certain relation he takes life on a certain principle he has a compass in his spirit which points in a certain direction it is the attitude the relation the point of the compass that is the whole body and gist of what he has to teach us in this the details are comprehended out of this the specific precepts issue and by this and this only can they be explained and applied and thus to learn aright from any teacher we must first of all like a historical artist think ourselves into sympathy with his position and in the technical phrase create his character a historian confronted with some ambiguous politician or an actor charged with a part have but one preoccupation they must search all round and upon every side and grope for some central conception which is to explain and justify the most extreme details until that is found the politician is an enigma or perhaps a quack and the part a tissue of fustian sentiment and big words but once that is found all enters into a plan a human nature appears the politician or the stageking is understood from point to point from end to end this is a degree of trouble which will be gladly taken by a very humble artist but not even the terror of eternal fire can teach a business man to bend his imagination to such athletic efforts yet without this all is vain until we understand the whole we shall understand none of the parts and otherwise we have no more than broken images and scattered words the meaning remains buried and the language in which our prophet speaks to us is a dead language in our ears  take a few of christs sayings and compare them with our current doctrines  ye cannot he says serve god and mammon cannot and our whole system is to teach us how we can  the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light are they i had been led to understand the reverse that the christian merchant for example prospered exceedingly in his affairs that honesty was the best policy that an author of repute had written a conclusive treatise how to make the best of both worlds of both worlds indeed which am i to believe thenchrist or the author of repute  take no thought for the morrow ask the successful merchant interrogate your own heart and you will have to admit that this is not only a silly but an immoral position all we believe all we hope all we honour in ourselves or our contemporaries stands condemned in this one sentence or if you take the other view condemns the sentence as unwise and inhumane we are not then of the same mind that was in christ we disagree with christ either christ meant nothing or else he or we must be in the wrong well says thoreau speaking of some texts from the new testament and finding a strange echo of another style which the reader may recognise let but one of these sentences be rightly read from any pulpit in the land and there would not be left one stone of that meetinghouse upon another  it may be objected that these are what are called hard sayings and that a man or an education may be very sufficiently christian although it leave some of these sayings upon one side but this is a very gross delusion although truth is difficult to state it is both easy and agreeable to receive and the mind runs out to meet it ere the phrase be done the universe in relation to what any man can say of it is plain patent and staringly comprehensible in itself it is a great and travailing ocean unsounded unvoyageable an eternal mystery to man or let us say it is a monstrous and impassable mountain one side of which and a few near slopes and foothills we can dimly study with these mortal eyes but what any man can say of it even in his highest utterance must have relation to this little and plain corner which is no less visible to us than to him we are looking on the same map it will go hard if we cannot follow the demonstration the longest and most abstruse flight of a philosopher becomes clear and shallow in the flash of a moment when we suddenly perceive the aspect and drift of his intention the longest argument is but a finger pointed once we get our own finger rightly parallel and we see what the man meant whether it be a new star or an old streetlamp and briefly if a saying is hard to understand it is because we are thinking of something else  but to be a true disciple is to think of the same things as our prophet and to think of different things in the same order to be of the same mind with another is to see all things in the same perspective it is not to agree in a few indifferent matters near at hand and not much debated it is to follow him in his farthest flights to see the force of his hyperboles to stand so exactly in the centre of his vision that whatever he may express your eyes will light at once on the original that whatever he may see to declare your mind will at once accept you do not belong to the school of any philosopher because you agree with him that theft is on the whole objectionable or that the sun is overhead at noon it is by the hard sayings that discipleship is tested we are all agreed about the middling and indifferent parts of knowledge and morality even the most soaring spirits too often take them tamely upon trust but the man the philosopher or the moralist does not stand upon these chance adhesions and the purpose of any system looks towards those extreme points where it steps valiantly beyond tradition and returns with some covert hint of things outside then only can you be certain that the words are not words of course nor mere echoes of the past then only are you sure that if he be indicating anything at all it is a star and not a streetlamp then only do you touch the heart of the mystery since it was for these that the author wrote his book  now every now and then and indeed surprisingly often christ finds a word that transcends all commonplace morality every now and then he quits the beaten track to pioneer the unexpressed and throws out a pregnant and magnanimous hyperbole for it is only by some bold poetry of thought that men can be strung up above the level of everyday conceptions to take a broader look upon experience or accept some higher principle of conduct to a man who is of the same mind that was in christ who stands at some centre not too far from his and looks at the world and conduct from some not dissimilar or at least not opposing attitudeor shortly to a man who is of christs philosophyevery such saying should come home with a thrill of joy and corroboration he should feel each one below his feet as another sure foundation in the flux of time and chance each should be another proof that in the torrent of the years and generations where doctrines and great armaments and empires are swept away and swallowed he stands immovable holding by the eternal stars but alas at this juncture of the ages it is not so with us on each and every such occasion our whole fellowship of christians falls back in disapproving wonder and implicitly denies the saying christians the farce is impudently broad let us stand up in the sight of heaven and confess the ethics that we hold are those of benjamin franklin honesty is the best policy is perhaps a hard saying it is certainly one by which a wise man of these days will not too curiously direct his steps but i think it shows a glimmer of meaning to even our most dimmed intelligences i think we perceive a principle behind it i think without hyperbole we are of the same mind that was in benjamin franklin     chapter ii   but i may be told we teach the ten commandments where a world of morals lies condensed the very pith and epitome of all ethics and religion and a young man with these precepts engraved upon his mind must follow after profit with some conscience and christianity of method a man cannot go very far astray who neither dishonours his parents nor kills nor commits adultery nor steals nor bears false witness for these things rightly thought out cover a vast field of duty  alas what is a precept it is at best an illustration it is case law at the best which can be learned by precept the letter is not only dead but killing the spirit which underlies and cannot be uttered alone is true and helpful this is trite to sickness but familiarity has a cunning disenchantment in a day or two she can steal all beauty from the mountain tops and the most startling words begin to fall dead upon the ear after several repetitions if you see a thing too often you no longer see it if you hear a thing too often you no longer hear it our attention requires to be surprised and to carry a fort by assault or to gain a thoughtful hearing from the ruck of mankind are feats of about equal difficulty and must be tried by not dissimilar means the whole bible has thus lost its message for the common run of hearers it has become mere words of course and the parson may bawl himself scarlet and beat the pulpit like a thing possessed but his hearers will continue to nod they are strangely at peace they know all he has to say ring the old bell as you choose it is still the old bell and it cannot startle their composure and so with this byword about the letter and the spirit it is quite true no doubt but it has no meaning in the world to any man of us alas it has just this meaning and neither more nor less that while the spirit is true the letter is eternally false  the shadow of a great oak lies abroad upon the ground at noon perfect clear and stable like the earth but let a man set himself to mark out the boundary with cords and pegs and were he never so nimble and never so exact what with the multiplicity of the leaves and the progression of the shadow as it flees before the travelling sun long ere he has made the circuit the whole figure will have changed life may be compared not to a single tree but to a great and complicated forest circumstance is more swiftly changing than a shadow language much more inexact than the tools of a surveyor from day to day the trees fall and are renewed the very essences are fleeting as we look and the whole world of leaves is swinging tempesttossed among the winds of time look now for your shadows o man of formulæ is this a place for you have you fitted the spirit to a single case alas in the cycle of the ages when shall such another be proposed for the judgment of man now when the sun shines and the winds blow the wood is filled with an innumerable multitude of shadows tumultuously tossed and changing and at every gust the whole carpet leaps and becomes new can you or your heart say more  look back now for a moment on your own brief experience of life and although you lived it feelingly in your own person and had every step of conduct burned in by pains and joys upon your memory tell me what definite lesson does experience hand on from youth to manhood or from both to age the settled tenor which first strikes the eye is but the shadow of a delusion this is gone that never truly was and you yourself are altered beyond recognition times and men and circumstances change about your changing character with a speed of which no earthly hurricane affords an image what was the best yesterday is it still the best in this changed theatre of a tomorrow will your own past truly guide you in your own violent and unexpected future and if this be questionable with what humble with what hopeless eyes should we not watch other men driving beside us on their unknown careers seeing with unlike eyes impelled by different gales doing and suffering in another sphere of things  and as the authentic clue to such a labyrinth and change of scene do you offer me these two score words these five bald prohibitions for the moral precepts are no more than five the first four deal rather with matters of observance than of conduct the tenth thou shall not covet stands upon another basis and shall be spoken of ere long the jews to whom they were first given in the course of years began to find these precepts insufficient and made an addition of no less than six hundred and fifty others they hoped to make a pocketbook of reference on morals which should stand to life in some such relation say as hoyle stands in to the scientific game of whist the comparison is just and condemns the design for those who play by rule will never be more than tolerable players and you and i would like to play our game in life to the noblest and the most divine advantage yet if the jews took a petty and huckstering view of conduct what view do we take ourselves who callously leave youth to go forth into the enchanted forest full of spells and dire chimeras with no guidance more complete than is afforded by these five precepts  honour thy father and thy mother yes but does that mean to obey and if so how long and how far thou shall not kill yet the very intention and purport of the prohibition may be best fulfilled by killing thou shall not commit adultery but some of the ugliest adulteries are committed in the bed of marriage and under the sanction of religion and law thou shalt not bear false witness how by speech or by silence also or even by a smile thou shalt not steal ah that indeed but what is to steal  to steal it is another word to be construed and who is to be our guide the police will give us one construction leaving the world only that least minimum of meaning without which society would fall in pieces but surely we must take some higher sense than this surely we hope more than a bare subsistence for mankind surely we wish mankind to prosper and go on from strength to strength and ourselves to live rightly in the eye of some more exacting potentate than a policeman the approval or the disapproval of the police must be eternally indifferent to a man who is both valorous and good there is extreme discomfort but no shame in the condemnation of the law the law represents that modicum of morality which can be squeezed out of the ruck of mankind but what is that to me who aim higher and seek to be my own more stringent judge i observe with pleasure that no brave man has ever given a rush for such considerations the japanese have a nobler and more sentimental feeling for this social bond into which we all are born when we come into the world and whose comforts and protection we all indifferently share throughout our livesbut even to them no more than to our western saints and heroes does the law of the state supersede the higher law of duty without hesitation and without remorse they transgress the stiffest enactments rather than abstain from doing right but the accidental superior duty being thus fulfilled they at once return in allegiance to the common duty of all citizens and hasten to denounce themselves and value at an equal rate their just crime and their equally just submission to its punishment  the evading of the police will not long satisfy an active conscience or a thoughtful head but to show you how one or the other may trouble a man and what a vast extent of frontier is left unridden by this invaluable eighth commandment let me tell you a few pages out of a young mans life  he was a friend of mine a young man like others generous flighty as variable as youth itself but always with some high motives and on the search for higher thoughts of life i should tell you at once that he thoroughly agrees with the eighth commandment but he got hold of some unsettling works the new testament among others and this loosened his views of life and led him into many perplexities as he was the son of a man in a certain position and well off my friend had enjoyed from the first the advantages of education nay he had been kept alive through a sickly childhood by constant watchfulness comforts and change of air for all of which he was indebted to his fathers wealth  at college he met other lads more diligent than himself who followed the plough in summertime to pay their college fees in winter and this inequality struck him with some force he was at that age of a conversible temper and insatiably curious in the aspects of life and he spent much of his time scraping acquaintance with all classes of man and womankind in this way he came upon many depressed ambitions and many intelligences stunted for want of opportunity and this also struck him he began to perceive that life was a handicap upon strange wrongsided principles and not as he had been told a fair and equal race he began to tremble that he himself had been unjustly favoured when he saw all the avenues of wealth and power and comfort closed against so many of his superiors and equals and held unwearyingly open before so idle so desultory and so dissolute a being as himself there sat a youth beside him on the college benches who had only one shirt to his back and at intervals sufficiently far apart must stay at home to have it washed it was my friends principle to stay away as often as he dared for i fear he was no friend to learning but there was something that came home to him sharply in this fellow who had to give over study till his shirt was washed and the scores of others who had never an opportunity at all if one of these could take his place he thought and the thought tore away a bandage from his eyes he was eaten by the shame of his discoveries and despised himself as an unworthy favourite and a creature of the backstairs of fortune he could no longer see without confusion one of these brave young fellows battling uphill against adversity had he not filched that fellows birthright at best was he not coldly profiting by the injustice of society and greedily devouring stolen goods the money indeed belonged to his father who had worked and thought and given up his liberty to earn it but by what justice could the money belong to my friend who had as yet done nothing but help to squander it a more sturdy honesty joined to a more even and impartial temperament would have drawn from these considerations a new force of industry that this equivocal position might be brought as swiftly as possible to an end and some good services to mankind justify the appropriation of expense it was not so with my friend who was only unsettled and discouraged and filled full of that trumpeting anger with which young men regard injustices in the first blush of youth although in a few years they will tamely acquiesce in their existence and knowingly profit by their complications yet all this while he suffered many indignant pangs and once when he put on his boots like any other unripe donkey to run away from home it was his best consolation that he was now at a single plunge to free himself from the responsibility of this wealth that was not his and to battle equally against his fellows in the warfare of life  some time after this falling into illhealth he was sent at great expense to a more favourable climate and then i think his perplexities were thickest when he thought of all the other young men of singular promise upright good the prop of families who must remain at home to die and with all their possibilities be lost to life and mankind and how he by one more unmerited favour was chosen out from all these others to survive he felt as if there were no life no labour no devotion of soul and body that could repay and justify these partialities a religious lady to whom he communicated these reflections could see no force in them whatever it was gods will said she but he knew it was by gods will that joan of arc was burnt at rouen which cleared neither bedford nor bishop cauchon and again by gods will that christ was crucified outside jerusalem which excused neither the rancour of the priests nor the timidity of pilate he knew moreover that although the possibility of this favour he was now enjoying issued from his circumstances its acceptance was the act of his own will and he had accepted it greedily longing for rest and sunshine and hence this allegation of gods providence did little to relieve his scruples i promise you he had a very troubled mind and i would not laugh if i were you though while he was thus making mountains out of what you think molehills he were still as perhaps he was contentedly practising many other things that to you seem black as hell every man is his own judge and mountainguide through life there is an old story of a mote and a beam apparently not true but worthy perhaps of some consideration i should if i were you give some consideration to these scruples of his and if i were he i should do the like by yours for it is not unlikely that there may be something under both in the meantime you must hear how my invalid acted like many invalids he supposed that he would die now should he die he saw no means of repaying this huge loan which by the hands of his father mankind had advanced him for his sickness in that case it would be lost money so he determined that the advance should be as small as possible and so long as he continued to doubt his recovery lived in an upper room and grudged himself all but necessaries but so soon as he began to perceive a change for the better he felt justified in spending more freely to speed and brighten his return to health and trusted in the future to lend a help to mankind as mankind out of its treasury had lent a help to him  i do not say but that my friend was a little too curious and partial in his view nor thought too much of himself and too little of his parents but i do say that here are some scruples which tormented my friend in his youth and still perhaps at odd times give him a prick in the midst of his enjoyments and which after all have some foundation in justice and point in their confused way to some honourable honesty within the reach of man and at least is not this an unusual gloss upon the eighth commandment and what sort of comfort guidance or illumination did that precept afford my friend throughout these contentions thou shall not steal with all my heart but am i stealing  the truly quaint materialism of our view of life disables us from pursuing any transaction to an end you can make no one understand that his bargain is anything more than a bargain whereas in point of fact it is a link in the policy of mankind and either a good or an evil to the world we have a sort of blindness which prevents us from seeing anything but sovereigns if one man agrees to give another so many shillings for so many hours work and then wilfully gives him a certain proportion of the price in bad money and only the remainder in good we can see with half an eye that this man is a thief but if the other spends a certain proportion of the hours in smoking a pipe of tobacco and a certain other proportion in looking at the sky or the clock or trying to recall an air or in meditation on his own past adventures and only the remainder in downright work such as he is paid to do is he because the theft is one of time and not of moneyis he any the less a thief the one gave a bad shilling the other an imperfect hour but both broke the bargain and each is a thief in piecework which is what most of us do the case is none the less plain for being even less material if you forge a bad knife you have wasted some of mankinds iron and then with unrivalled cynicism you pocket some of mankinds money for your trouble is there any man so blind who cannot see that this is theft again if you carelessly cultivate a farm you have been playing fast and loose with mankinds resources against hunger there will be less bread in consequence and for lack of that bread somebody will die next winter a grim consideration and you must not hope to shuffle out of blame because you got less money for your less quantity of bread for although a theft be partly punished it is none the less a theft for that you took the farm against competitors there were others ready to shoulder the responsibility and be answerable for the tale of loaves but it was you who took it by the act you came under a tacit bargain with mankind to cultivate that farm with your best endeavour you were under no superintendence you were on parole and you have broke your bargain and to all who look closely and yourself among the rest if you have moral eyesight you are a thief or take the case of men of letters every piece of work which is not as good as you can make it which you have palmed off imperfect meagrely thought niggardly in execution upon mankind who is your paymaster on parole and in a sense your pupil every hasty or slovenly or untrue performance should rise up against you in the court of your own heart and condemn you for a thief have you a salary if you trifle with your health and so render yourself less capable for duty and still touch and still greedily pocket the emolumentwhat are you but a thief have you double accounts do you by any timehonoured juggle deceit or ambiguous process gain more from those who deal with you than if you were bargaining and dealing face to face in front of godwhat are you but a thief lastly if you fill an office or produce an article which in your heart of hearts you think a delusion and a fraud upon mankind and still draw your salary and go through the sham manoeuvres of this office or still book your profits and keep on flooding the world with these injurious goodsthough you were old and bald and the first at church and a baronet what are you but a thief these may seem hard words and mere curiosities of the intellect in an age when the spirit of honesty is so sparingly cultivated that all business is conducted upon lies and socalled customs of the trade that not a man bestows two thoughts on the utility or honourableness of his pursuit i would say less if i thought less but looking to my own reason and the right of things i can only avow that i am a thief myself and that i passionately suspect my neighbours of the same guilt  where did you hear that it was easy to be honest do you find that in your bible easy it is easy to be an ass and follow the multitude like a blind besotted bull in a stampede and that i am well aware is what you and mrs grundy mean by being honest but it will not bear the stress of time nor the scrutiny of conscience even before the lowest of all tribunalsbefore a court of law whose business it is not to keep men right or within a thousand miles of right but to withhold them from going so tragically wrong that they will pull down the whole jointed fabric of society by their misdeedseven before a court of law as we begin to see in these last days our easy view of following at each others tails alike to good and evil is beginning to be reproved and punished and declared no honesty at all but open theft and swindling and simpletons who have gone on through life with a quiet conscience may learn suddenly from the lips of a judge that the custom of the trade may be a custom of the devil you thought it was easy to be honest did you think it was easy to be just and kind and truthful did you think the whole duty of aspiring man was as simple as a hornpipe and you could walk through life like a gentleman and a hero with no more concern than it takes to go to church or to address a circular and yet all this time you had the eighth commandment and what makes it richer you would not have broken it for the world  the truth is that these commandments by themselves are of little use in private judgment if compression is what you want you have their whole spirit compressed into the golden rule and yet there expressed with more significance since the law is there spiritually and not materially stated and in truth four out of these ten commands from the sixth to the ninth are rather legal than ethical the policecourt is their proper home a magistrate cannot tell whether you love your neighbour as yourself but he can tell more or less whether you have murdered or stolen or committed adultery or held up your hand and testified to that which was not and these things for rough practical tests are as good as can be found and perhaps therefore the best condensation of the jewish moral law is in the maxims of the priests neminem lædere and suum cuique tribunere but all this granted it becomes only the more plain that they are inadequate in the sphere of personal morality that while they tell the magistrate roughly when to punish they can never direct an anxious sinner what to do  only polonius or the like solemn sort of ass can offer us a succinct proverb by way of advice and not burst out blushing in our faces we grant them one and all and for all that they are worth it is something above and beyond that we desire christ was in general a great enemy to such a way of teaching we rarely find him meddling with any of these plump commands but it was to open them out and lift his hearers from the letter to the spirit for morals are a personal affair in the war of righteousness every man fights for his own hand all the six hundred precepts of the mishna cannot shake my private judgment my magistracy of myself is an indefeasible charge and my decisions absolute for the time and case the moralist is not a judge of appeal but an advocate who pleads at my tribunal he has to show not the law but that the law applies can he convince me then he gains the cause and thus you find christ giving various counsels to varying people and often jealously careful to avoid definite precept is he asked for example to divide a heritage he refuses and the best advice that he will offer is but a paraphrase of that tenth commandment which figures so strangely among the rest take heed and beware of covetousness if you complain that this is vague i have failed to carry you along with me in my argument for no definite precept can be more than an illustration though its truth were resplendent like the sun and it was announced from heaven by the voice of god and life is so intricate and changing that perhaps not twenty times or perhaps not twice in the ages shall we find that nice consent of circumstances to which alone it can apply     chapter iii   although the world and life have in a sense become commonplace to our experience it is but in an external torpor the true sentiment slumbers within us and we have but to reflect on ourselves or our surroundings to rekindle our astonishment no length of habit can blunt our first surprise of the world i have but little to say in this connection a few strokes shall suffice we inhabit a dead ember swimming wide in the blank of space dizzily spinning as it swims and lighted up from several million miles away by a more horrible hellfire than was ever conceived by the theological imagination yet the dead ember is a green commodious dwellingplace and the reverberation of this hellfire ripens flower and fruit and mildly warms us on summer eves upon the lawn far off on all hands other dead embers other flaming suns wheel and race in the apparent void the nearest is out of call the farthest so far that the heart sickens in the effort to conceive the distance shipwrecked seamen on the deep though they bestride but the truncheon of a boom are safe and near at home compared with mankind on its bullet even to us who have known no other it seems a strange if not an appalling place of residence  but far stranger is the resident man a creature compact of wonders that after centuries of custom is still wonderful to himself he inhabits a body which he is continually outliving discarding and renewing food and sleep by an unknown alchemy restore his spirits and the freshness of his countenance hair grows on him like grass his eyes his brain his sinews thirst for action he joys to see and touch and hear to partake the sun and wind to sit down and intently ponder on his astonishing attributes and situation to rise up and run to perform the strange and revolting round of physical functions the sight of a flower the note of a bird will often move him deeply yet he looks unconcerned on the impassable distances and portentous bonfires of the universe he comprehends he designs he tames nature rides the sea ploughs climbs the air in a balloon makes vast inquiries begins interminable labours joins himself into federations and populous cities spends his days to deliver the ends of the earth or to benefit unborn posterity and yet knows himself for a piece of unsurpassed fragility and the creature of a few days his sight which conducts him which takes notice of the farthest stars which is miraculous in every way and a thing defying explanation or belief is yet lodged in a piece of jelly and can be extinguished with a touch his heart which all through life so indomitably so athletically labours is but a capsule and may be stopped with a pin his whole body for all its savage energies its leaping and its winged desires may yet be tamed and conquered by a draught of air or a sprinkling of cold dew what he calls death which is the seeming arrest of everything and the ruin and hateful transformation of the visible body lies in wait for him outwardly in a thousand accidents and grows up in secret diseases from within he is still learning to be a man when his faculties are already beginning to decline he has not yet understood himself or his position before he inevitably dies and yet this mad chimerical creature can take no thought of his last end lives as though he were eternal plunges with his vulnerable body into the shock of war and daily affronts death with unconcern he cannot take a step without pain or pleasure his life is a tissue of sensations which he distinguishes as they seem to come more directly from himself or his surroundings he is conscious of himself as a joyer or a sufferer as that which craves chooses and is satisfied conscious of his surroundings as it were of an inexhaustible purveyor the source of aspects inspirations wonders cruel knocks and transporting caresses thus he goes on his way stumbling among delights and agonies  matter is a farfetched theory and materialism is without a root in man to him everything is important in the degree to which it moves him the telegraph wires and posts the electricity speeding from clerk to clerk the clerks the glad or sorrowful import of the message and the paper on which it is finally brought to him at home are all equally facts all equally exist for man a word or a thought can wound him as acutely as a knife of steel if he thinks he is loved he will rise up and glory to himself although he be in a distant land and short of necessary bread does he think he is not lovedhe may have the woman at his beck and there is not a joy for him in all the world indeed if we are to make any account of this figment of reason the distinction between material and immaterial we shall conclude that the life of each man as an individual is immaterial although the continuation and prospects of mankind as a race turn upon material conditions the physical business of each mans body is transacted for him like a sybarite he has attentive valets in his own viscera he breathes he sweats he digests without an effort or so much as a consenting volition for the most part he even eats not with a wakeful consciousness but as it were between two thoughts his life is centred among other and more important considerations touch him in his honour or his love creatures of the imagination which attach him to mankind or to an individual man or woman cross him in his piety which connects his soul with heaven and he turns from his food he loathes his breath and with a magnanimous emotion cuts the knots of his existence and frees himself at a blow from the web of pains and pleasures  it follows that man is twofold at least that he is not a rounded and autonomous empire but that in the same body with him there dwell other powers tributary but independent if i now behold one walking in a garden curiously coloured and illuminated by the sun digesting his food with elaborate chemistry breathing circulating blood directing himself by the sight of his eyes accommodating his body by a thousand delicate balancings to the wind and the uneven surface of the path and all the time perhaps with his mind engaged about america or the dogstar or the attributes of godwhat am i to say or how am i to describe the thing i see is that truly a man in the rigorous meaning of the word or is it not a man and something else what then are we to count the centrebit and axle of a being so variously compounded it is a question much debated some read his history in a certain intricacy of nerve and the success of successive digestions others find him an exiled piece of heaven blown upon and determined by the breath of god and both schools of theorists will scream like scalded children at a word of doubt yet either of these views however plausible is beside the question either may be right and i care not i ask a more particular answer and to a more immediate point what is the man there is something that was before hunger and that remains behind after a meal it may or may not be engaged in any given act or passion but when it is it changes heightens and sanctifies thus it is not engaged in lust where satisfaction ends the chapter and it is engaged in love where no satisfaction can blunt the edge of the desire and where age sickness or alienation may deface what was desirable without diminishing the sentiment this something which is the man is a permanence which abides through the vicissitudes of passion now overwhelmed and now triumphant now unconscious of itself in the immediate distress of appetite or pain now rising unclouded above all so to the man his own central self fades and grows clear again amid the tumult of the senses like a revolving pharos in the night it is forgotten it is hid it seems for ever and yet in the next calm hour he shall behold himself once more shining and unmoved among changes and storm  mankind in the sense of the creeping mass that is born and eats that generates and dies is but the aggregate of the outer and lower sides of man this inner consciousness this lantern alternately obscured and shining to and by which the individual exists and must order his conduct is something special to himself and not common to the race his joys delight his sorrows wound him according as this is interested or indifferent in the affair according as they arise in an imperial war or in a broil conducted by the tributary chieftains of the mind he may lose all and this not suffer he may lose what is materially a trifle and this leap in his bosom with a cruel pang i do not speak of it to hardened theorists the living man knows keenly what it is i mean  perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and more divine than the things which cause the various effects and as it were pull thee by the strings what is that now in thy mind is it fear or suspicion or desire or anything of that kind thus far marcus aurelius in one of the most notable passages in any book here is a question worthy to be answered what is in thy mind what is the utterance of your inmost self when in a quiet hour it can be heard intelligibly it is something beyond the compass of your thinking inasmuch as it is yourself but is it not of a higher spirit than you had dreamed betweenwhiles and erect above all base considerations this soul seems hardly touched with our infirmities we can find in it certainly no fear suspicion or desire we are only consciousand that as though we read it in the eyes of some one elseof a great and unqualified readiness a readiness to what to pass over and look beyond the objects of desire and fear for something else and this something else this something which is apart from desire and fear to which all the kingdoms of the world and the immediate death of the body are alike indifferent and beside the point and which yet regards conductby what name are we to call it it may be the love of god or it may be an inherited and certainly well concealed instinct to preserve self and propagate the race i am not for the moment averse to either theory but it will save time to call it righteousness by so doing i intend no subterfuge to beg a question i am indeed ready and more than willing to accept the rigid consequence and lay aside as far as the treachery of the reason will permit all former meanings attached to the word righteousness what is right is that for which a mans central self is ever ready to sacrifice immediate or distant interests what is wrong is what the central self discards or rejects as incompatible with the fixed design of righteousness  to make this admission is to lay aside all hope of definition that which is right upon this theory is intimately dictated to each man by himself but can never be rigorously set forth in language and never above all imposed upon another the conscience has then a vision like that of the eyes which is incommunicable and for the most part illuminates none but its possessor when many people perceive the same or any cognate facts they agree upon a word as symbol and hence we have such words as tree star love honour or death hence also we have this word right which like the others we all understand most of us understand differently and none can express succinctly otherwise yet even on the straitest view we can make some steps towards comprehension of our own superior thoughts for it is an incredible and most bewildering fact that a man through life is on variable terms with himself he is aware of tiffs and reconciliations the intimacy is at times almost suspended at times it is renewed again with joy as we said before his inner self or soul appears to him by successive revelations and is frequently obscured it is from a study of these alternations that we can alone hope to discover even dimly what seems right and what seems wrong to this veiled prophet of ourself   all that is in the man in the larger sense what we call impression as well as what we call intuition so far as my argument looks we must accept it is not wrong to desire food or exercise or beautiful surroundings or the love of sex or interest which is the food of the mind all these are craved all these should be craved to none of these in itself does the soul demur where there comes an undeniable want we recognise a demand of nature yet we know that these natural demands may be superseded for the demands which are common to mankind make but a shadowy consideration in comparison to the demands of the individual soul food is almost the first prerequisite and yet a high character will go without food to the ruin and death of the body rather than gain it in a manner which the spirit disavows pascal laid aside mathematics origen doctored his body with a knife every day some one is thus mortifying his dearest interests and desires and in christs words entering maim into the kingdom of heaven this is to supersede the lesser and less harmonious affections by renunciation and though by this ascetic path we may get to heaven we cannot get thither a whole and perfect man but there is another way to supersede them by reconciliation in which the soul and all the faculties and senses pursue a common route and share in one desire thus man is tormented by a very imperious physical desire it spoils his rest it is not to be denied the doctors will tell you not i how it is a physical need like the want of food or slumber in the satisfaction of this desire as it first appears the soul sparingly takes part nay it oft unsparingly regrets and disapproves the satisfaction but let the man learn to love a woman as far as he is capable of love and for this random affection of the body there is substituted a steady determination a consent of all his powers and faculties which supersedes adopts and commands the other the desire survives strengthened perhaps but taught obedience and changed in scope and character life is no longer a tale of betrayals and regrets for the man now lives as a whole his consciousness now moves on uninterrupted like a river through all the extremes and ups and downs of passion he remains approvingly conscious of himself  now to me this seems a type of that rightness which the soul demands it demands that we shall not live alternately with our opposing tendencies in continual seesaw of passion and disgust but seek some path on which the tendencies shall no longer oppose but serve each other to a common end it demands that we shall not pursue broken ends but great and comprehensive purposes in which soul and body may unite like notes in a harmonious chord that were indeed a way of peace and pleasure that were indeed a heaven upon earth it does not demand however or to speak in measure it does not demand of me that i should starve my appetites for no purpose under heaven but as a purpose in itself or in a weak despair pluck out the eye that i have not yet learned to guide and enjoy with wisdom the soul demands unity of purpose not the dismemberment of man it seeks to roll up all his strength and sweetness all his passion and wisdom into one and make of him a perfect man exulting in perfection to conclude ascetically is to give up and not to solve the problem the ascetic and the creeping hog although they are at different poles have equally failed in life the one has sacrificed his crew the other brings back his seamen in a cockboat and has lost the ship i believe there are not many seacaptains who would plume themselves on either result as a success  but if it is righteousness thus to fuse together our divisive impulses and march with one mind through life there is plainly one thing more unrighteous than all others and one declension which is irretrievable and draws on the rest and this is to lose consciousness of oneself in the best of times it is but by flashes when our whole nature is clear strong and conscious and events conspire to leave us free that we enjoy communion with our soul at the worst we are so fallen and passive that we may say shortly we have none an arctic torpor seizes upon men although built of nerves and set adrift in a stimulating world they develop a tendency to go bodily to sleep consciousness becomes engrossed among the reflex and mechanical parts of life and soon loses both the will and power to look higher considerations in the face this is ruin this is the last failure in life this is temporal damnation damnation on the spot and without the form of judgment what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose himself  it is to keep a man awake to keep him alive to his own soul and its fixed design of righteousness that the better part of moral and religious education is directed not only that of words and doctors but the sharp ferule of calamity under which we are all gods scholars till we die if as teachers we are to say anything to the purpose we must say what will remind the pupil of his soul we must speak that souls dialect we must talk of life and conduct as his soul would have him think of them if from some conformity between us and the pupil or perhaps among all men we do in truth speak in such a dialect and express such views beyond question we shall touch in him a spring beyond question he will recognise the dialect as one that he himself has spoken in his better hours beyond question he will cry i had forgotten but now i remember i too have eyes and i had forgot to use them i too have a soul of my own arrogantly upright and to that i will listen and conform in short say to him anything that he has once thought or been upon the point of thinking or show him any view of life that he has once clearly seen or been upon the point of clearly seeing and you have done your part and may leave him to complete the education for himself  now the view taught at the present time seems to me to want greatness and the dialect in which alone it can be intelligibly uttered is not the dialect of my soul it is a sort of postponement of life nothing quite is but something different is to be we are to keep our eyes upon the indirect from the cradle to the grave we are to regulate our conduct not by desire but by a politic eye upon the future and to value acts as they will bring us money or good opinion as they will bring us in one word profit we must be what is called respectable and offend no one by our carriage it will not do to make oneself conspicuouswho knows even in virtue says the christian parent and we must be what is called prudent and make money not only because it is pleasant to have money but because that also is a part of respectability and we cannot hope to be received in society without decent possessions received in society as if that were the kingdom of heaven there is dear mr soandsolook at himso much respectedso much looked up toquite the christian merchant and we must cut our conduct as strictly as possible after the pattern of mr soandso and lay our whole lives to make money and be strictly decent besides these holy injunctions which form by far the greater part of a youths training in our christian homes there are at least two other doctrines we are to live just now as well as we can but scrape at last into heaven where we shall be good we are to worry through the week in a lay disreputable way but to make matters square live a different life on sunday  the train of thought we have been following gives us a key to all these positions without stepping aside to justify them on their own ground it is because we have been disgusted fifty times with physical squalls and fifty times torn between conflicting impulses that we teach people this indirect and tactical procedure in life and to judge by remote consequences instead of the immediate face of things the very desire to act as our own souls would have us coupled with a pathetic disbelief in ourselves moves us to follow the example of others perhaps who knows they may be on the right track and the more our patterns are in number the better seems the chance until if we be acting in concert with a whole civilised nation there are surely a majority of chances that we must be acting right and again how true it is that we can never behave as we wish in this tormented sphere and can only aspire to different and more favourable circumstances in order to stand out and be ourselves wholly and rightly and yet once more if in the hurry and pressure of affairs and passions you tend to nod and become drowsy here are twentyfour hours of sunday set apart for you to hold counsel with your soul and look around you on the possibilities of life  this is not of course all that is to be or even should be said for these doctrines only in the course of this chapter the reader and i have agreed upon a few catchwords and been looking at morals on a certain system it was a pity to lose an opportunity of testing the catchwords and seeing whether by this system as well as by others current doctrines could show any probable justification if the doctrines had come too badly out of the trial it would have condemned the system our sight of the world is very narrow the mind but a pedestrian instrument theres nothing new under the sun as solomon says except the man himself and though that changes the aspect of everything else yet he must see the same things as other people only from a different side  and now having admitted so much let us turn to criticism  if you teach a man to keep his eyes upon what others think of him unthinkingly to lead the life and hold the principles of the majority of his contemporaries you must discredit in his eyes the one authoritative voice of his own soul he may be a docile citizen he will never be a man it is ours on the other hand to disregard this babble and chattering of other men better and worse than we are and to walk straight before us by what light we have they may be right but so before heaven are we they may know but we know also and by that knowledge we must stand or fall there is such a thing as loyalty to a mans own better self and from those who have not that god help me how am i to look for loyalty to others the most dull the most imbecile at a certain moment turn round at a certain point will hear no further argument but stand unflinching by their own dumb irrational sense of right it is not only by steel or fire but through contempt and blame that the martyr fulfils the calling of his dear soul be glad if you are not tried by such extremities but although all the world ranged themselves in one line to tell you this is wrong be you your own faithful vassal and the ambassador of godthrow down the glove and answer this is right do you think you are only declaring yourself perhaps in some dim way like a child who delivers a message not fully understood you are opening wider the straits of prejudice and preparing mankind for some truer and more spiritual grasp of truth perhaps as you stand forth for your own judgment you are covering a thousand weak ones with your body perhaps by this declaration alone you have avoided the guilt of false witness against humanity and the little ones unborn it is good i believe to be respectable but much nobler to respect oneself and utter the voice of god god if there be any god speaks daily in a new language by the tongues of men the thoughts and habits of each fresh generation and each newcoined spirit throw another light upon the universe and contain another commentary on the printed bibles every scruple every true dissent every glimpse of something new is a letter of gods alphabet and though there is a grave responsibility for all who speak is there none for those who unrighteously keep silence and conform is not that also to conceal and cloak gods counsel and how should we regard the man of science who suppressed all facts that would not tally with the orthodoxy of the hour  wrong you are as surely wrong as the sun rose this morning round the revolving shoulder of the world not truth but truthfulness is the good of your endeavour for when will men receive that first part and prerequisite of truth that by the order of things by the greatness of the universe by the darkness and partiality of mans experience by the inviolate secrecy of god kept close in his most open revelations every man is and to the end of the ages must be wrong wrong to the universe wrong to mankind wrong to god and yet in another sense and that plainer and nearer every man of men who wishes truly must be right he is right to himself and in the measure of his sagacity and candour that let him do in all sincerity and zeal not sparing a thought for contrary opinions that for what it is worth let him proclaim be not afraid although he be wrong so also is the dead stuffed dagon he insults for the voice of god whatever it is is not that stammering inept tradition which the people holds these truths survive in travesty swamped in a world of spiritual darkness and confusion and what a few comprehend and faithfully hold the many in their dead jargon repeat degrade and misinterpret  so far of respectability what the covenanters used to call rank conformity the deadliest gag and wet blanket that can be laid on men and now of profit and this doctrine is perhaps the more redoubtable because it harms all sorts of men not only the heroic and selfreliant but the obedient cowlike squadrons a man by this doctrine looks to consequences at the second or third or fiftieth turn he chooses his end and for that with wily turns and through a great sea of tedium steers this mortal bark there may be political wisdom in such a view but i am persuaded there can spring no great moral zeal to look thus obliquely upon life is the very recipe for moral slumber our intention and endeavour should be directed not on some vague end of money or applause which shall come to us by a ricochet in a month or a year or twenty years but on the act itself not on the approval of others but on the rightness of that act at every instant at every step in life the point has to be decided our soul has to be saved heaven has to be gained or lost at every step our spirits must applaud at every step we must set down the foot and sound the trumpet this have i done we must say right or wrong this have i done in unfeigned honour of intention as to myself and god the profit of every act should be this that it was right for us to do it any other profit than that if it involved a kingdom or the woman i love ought if i were gods upright soldier to leave me untempted  it is the mark of what we call a righteous decision that it is made directly and for its own sake the whole man mind and body having come to an agreement tyrannically dictates conduct there are two dispositions eternally opposed that in which we recognise that one thing is wrong and another right and that in which not seeing any clear distinction we fall back on the consideration of consequences the truth is by the scope of our present teaching nothing is thought very wrong and nothing very right except a few actions which have the disadvantage of being disrespectable when found out the more serious part of men inclining to think all things rather wrong the more jovial to suppose them right enough for practical purposes i will engage my head they do not find that view in their own hearts they have taken it up in a dark despair they are but troubled sleepers talking in their sleep the soul or my soul at least thinks very distinctly upon many points of right and wrong and often differs flatly with what is held out as the thought of corporate humanity in the code of society or the code of law am i to suppose myself a monster i have only to read books the christian gospels for example to think myself a monster no longer and instead i think the mass of people are merely speaking in their sleep  it is a commonplace enshrined if i mistake not even in school copybooks that honour is to be sought and not fame i ask no other admission we are to seek honour upright walking with our own conscience every hour of the day and not fame the consequence the faroff reverberation of our footsteps the walk not the rumour of the walk is what concerns righteousness better disrespectable honour than dishonourable fame better useless or seemingly hurtful honour than dishonour ruling empires and filling the mouths of thousands for the man must walk by what he sees and leave the issue with god who made him and taught him by the fortune of his life you would not dishonour yourself for money which is at least tangible would you do it then for a doubtful forecast in politics or another persons theory in morals  so intricate is the scheme of our affairs that no man can calculate the bearing of his own behaviour even on those immediately around him how much less upon the world at large or on succeeding generations to walk by external prudence and the rule of consequences would require not a man but god all that we know to guide us in this changing labyrinth is our soul with its fixed design of righteousness and a few old precepts which commend themselves to that the precepts are vague when we endeavour to apply them consequences are more entangled than a wisp of string and their confusion is unrestingly in change we must hold to what we know and walk by it we must walk by faith indeed and not by knowledge  you do not love another because he is wealthy or wise or eminently respectable you love him because you love him that is love and any other only a derision and grimace it should be the same with all our actions if we were to conceive a perfect man it should be one who was never torn between conflicting impulses but who on the absolute consent of all his parts and faculties submitted in every action of his life to a selfdictation as absolute and unreasoned as that which bids him love one woman and be true to her till death but we should not conceive him as sagacious ascetical playing off his appetites against each other turning the wing of public respectable immorality instead of riding it directly down or advancing toward his end through a thousand sinister compromises and considerations the one man might be wily might be adroit might be wise might be respectable might be gloriously useful it is the other man who would be good  the soul asks honour and not fame to be upright not to be successful to be good not prosperous to be essentially not outwardly respectable does your soul ask profit does it ask money does it ask the approval of the indifferent herd i believe not for my own part i want but little money i hope and i do not want to be decent at all but to be good     chapter iv   we have spoken of that supreme selfdictation which keeps varying from hour to hour in its dictates with the variation of events and circumstances now for us that is ultimate it may be founded on some reasonable process but it is not a process which we can follow or comprehend and moreover the dictation is not continuous or not continuous except in very lively and wellliving natures and betweenwhiles we must brush along without it practice is a more intricate and desperate business than the toughest theorising life is an affair of cavalry where rapid judgment and prompt action are alone possible and right as a matter of fact there is no one so upright but he is influenced by the worlds chatter and no one so headlong but he requires to consider consequences and to keep an eye on profit for the soul adopts all affections and appetites without exception and cares only to combine them for some common purpose which shall interest all now respect for the opinion of others the study of consequences and the desire of power and comfort are all undeniably factors in the nature of man and the more undeniably since we find that in our current doctrines they have swallowed up the others and are thought to conclude in themselves all the worthy parts of man these then must also be suffered to affect conduct in the practical domain much or little according as they are forcibly or feebly present to the mind of each  now a mans view of the universe is mostly a view of the civilised society in which he lives other men and women are so much more grossly and so much more intimately palpable to his perceptions that they stand between him and all the rest they are larger to his eye than the sun he hears them more plainly than thunder with them by them and for them he must live and die and hence the laws that affect his intercourse with his fellowmen although merely customary and the creatures of a generation are more clearly and continually before his mind than those which bind him into the eternal system of things support him in his upright progress on this whirling ball or keep up the fire of his bodily life and hence it is that money stands in the first rank of considerations and so powerfully affects the choice for our society is built with money for mortar money is present in every joint of circumstance it might be named the social atmosphere since in society it is by that alone men continue to live and only through that or chance that they can reach or affect one another money gives us food shelter and privacy it permits us to be clean in person opens for us the doors of the theatre gains us books for study or pleasure enables us to help the distresses of others and puts us above necessity so that we can choose the best in life if we love it enables us to meet and live with the loved one or even to prolong her health and life if we have scruples it gives us an opportunity to be honest if we have any bright designs here is what will smooth the way to their accomplishment penury is the worst slavery and will soon lead to death  but money is only a means it presupposes a man to use it the rich can go where he pleases but perhaps please himself nowhere he can buy a library or visit the whole world but perhaps has neither patience to read nor intelligence to see the table may be loaded and the appetite wanting the purse may be full and the heart empty he may have gained the world and lost himself and with all his wealth around him in a great house and spacious and beautiful demesne he may live as blank a life as any tattered ditcher without an appetite without an aspiration void of appreciation bankrupt of desire and hope there in his great house let him sit and look upon his fingers it is perhaps a more fortunate destiny to have a taste for collecting shells than to be born a millionaire although neither is to be despised it is always better policy to learn an interest than to make a thousand pounds for the money will soon be spent or perhaps you may feel no joy in spending it but the interest remains imperishable and ever new to become a botanist a geologist a social philosopher an antiquary or an artist is to enlarge ones possessions in the universe by an incalculably higher degree and by a far surer sort of property than to purchase a farm of many acres you had perhaps two thousand a year before the transaction perhaps you have two thousand five hundred after it that represents your gain in the one case but in the other you have thrown down a barrier which concealed significance and beauty the blind man has learned to see the prisoner has opened up a window in his cell and beholds enchanting prospects he will never again be a prisoner as he was he can watch clouds and changing seasons ships on the river travellers on the road and the stars at night happy prisoner his eyes have broken gaol and again he who has learned to love an art or science has wisely laid up riches against the day of riches if prosperity come he will not enter poor into his inheritance he will not slumber and forget himself in the lap of money or spend his hours in counting idle treasures but be up and briskly doing he will have the true alchemic touch which is not that of midas but which transmutes dead money into living delight and satisfaction Être et pas avoirto be not to possessthat is the problem of life to be wealthy a rich nature is the first requisite and money but the second to be of a quick and healthy blood to share in all honourable curiosities to be rich in admiration and free from envy to rejoice greatly in the good of others to love with such generosity of heart that your love is still a dear possession in absence or unkindnessthese are the gifts of fortune which money cannot buy and without which money can buy nothing for what can a man possess or what can he enjoy except himself if he enlarge his nature it is then that he enlarges his estates if his nature be happy and valiant he will enjoy the universe as if it were his park and orchard  but money is not only to be spent it has also to be earned it is not merely a convenience or a necessary in social life but it is the coin in which mankind pays his wages to the individual man and from this side the question of money has a very different scope and application for no man can be honest who does not work service for service if the farmer buys corn and the labourer ploughs and reaps and the baker sweats in his hot bakery plainly you who eat must do something in your turn it is not enough to take off your hat or to thank god upon your knees for the admirable constitution of society and your own convenient situation in its upper and more ornamental stories neither is it enough to buy the loaf with a sixpence for then you are only changing the point of the inquiry and you must first have bought the sixpence service for service how have you bought your sixpences a man of spirit desires certainty in a thing of such a nature he must see to it that there is some reciprocity between him and mankind that he pays his expenditure in service that he has not a lions share in profit and a drones in labour and is not a sleeping partner and mere costly incubus on the great mercantile concern of mankind  services differ so widely with different gifts and some are so inappreciable to external tests that this is not only a matter for the private conscience but one which even there must be leniently and trustfully considered for remember how many serve mankind who do no more than meditate and how many are precious to their friends for no more than a sweet and joyous temper to perform the function of a man of letters it is not necessary to write nay it is perhaps better to be a living book so long as we love we serve so long as we are loved by others i would almost say that we are indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend the true services of life are inestimable in money and are never paid kind words and caresses high and wise thoughts humane designs tender behaviour to the weak and suffering and all the charities of mans existence are neither bought nor sold  yet the dearest and readiest if not the most just criterion of a mans services is the wage that mankind pays him or briefly what he earns there at least there can be no ambiguity st paul is fully and freely entitled to his earnings as a tentmaker and socrates fully and freely entitled to his earnings as a sculptor although the true business of each was not only something different but something which remained unpaid a man cannot forget that he is not superintended and serves mankind on parole he would like when challenged by his own conscience to reply i have done so much work and no less with my own hands and brain and taken so much profit and no more for my own personal delight and though st paul if he had possessed a private fortune would probably have scorned to waste his time in making tents yet of all sacrifices to public opinion none can be more easily pardoned than that by which a man already spiritually useful to the world should restrict the field of his chief usefulness to perform services more apparent and possess a livelihood that neither stupidity nor malice could call in question like all sacrifices to public opinion and mere external decency this would certainly be wrong for the soul should rest contented with its own approval and indissuadably pursue its own calling yet so grave and delicate is the question that a man may well hesitate before he decides it for himself he may well fear that he sets too high a valuation on his own endeavours after good he may well condescend upon a humbler duty where others than himself shall judge the service and proportion the wage  and yet it is to this very responsibility that the rich are born they can shuffle off the duty on no other they are their own paymasters on parole and must pay themselves fair wages and no more for i suppose that in the course of ages and through reform and civil war and invasion mankind was pursuing some other and more general design than to set one or two englishmen of the nineteenth century beyond the reach of needs and duties society was scarce put together and defended with so much eloquence and blood for the convenience of two or three millionaires and a few hundred other persons of wealth and position it is plain that if mankind thus acted and suffered during all these generations they hoped some benefit some ease some wellbeing for themselves and their descendants that if they supported law and order it was to secure fairplay for all that if they denied themselves in the present they must have had some designs upon the future now a great hereditary fortune is a miracle of mans wisdom and mankinds forbearance it has not only been amassed and handed down it has been suffered to be amassed and handed down and surely in such a consideration as this its possessor should find only a new spur to activity and honour that with all this power of service he should not prove unserviceable and that this mass of treasure should return in benefits upon the race if he had twenty or thirty or a hundred thousand at his bankers or if all yorkshire or all california were his to manage or to sell he would still be morally penniless and have the world to begin like whittington until he had found some way of serving mankind his wage is physically in his own hand but in honour that wage must still be earned he is only steward on parole of what is called his fortune he must honourably perform his stewardship he must estimate his own services and allow himself a salary in proportion for that will be one among his functions and while he will then be free to spend that salary great or little on his own private pleasures the rest of his fortune he but holds and disposes under trust for mankind it is not his because he has not earned it it cannot be his because his services have already been paid but year by year it is his to distribute whether to help individuals whose birthright and outfit have been swallowed up in his or to further public works and institutions  at this rate short of inspiration it seems hardly possible to be both rich and honest and the millionaire is under a far more continuous temptation to thieve than the labourer who gets his shilling daily for despicable toils are you surprised it is even so and you repeat it every sunday in your churches it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god i have heard this and similar texts ingeniously explained away and brushed from the path of the aspiring christian by the tender greatheart of the parish one excellent clergyman told us that the eye of a needle meant a low oriental postern through which camels could not pass till they were unloadedwhich is very likely just and then went on bravely confounding the kingdom of god with heaven the future paradise to show that of course no rich person could expect to carry his riches beyond the gravewhich of course he could not and never did various greedy sinners of the congregation drank in the comfortable doctrine with relief it was worth the while having come to church that sunday morning all was plain the bible as usual meant nothing in particular it was merely an obscure and figurative schoolcopybook and if a man were only respectable he was a man after gods own heart  alas i fear not and though this matter of a mans services is one for his own conscience there are some cases in which it is difficult to restrain the mind from judging thus i shall be very easily persuaded that a man has earned his daily bread and if he has but a friend or two to whom his company is delightful at heart i am more than persuaded at once but it will be very hard to persuade me that any one has earned an income of a hundred thousand what he is to his friends he still would be if he were made penniless tomorrow for as to the courtiers of luxury and power i will neither consider them friends nor indeed consider them at all what he does for mankind there are most likely hundreds who would do the same as effectually for the race and as pleasurably to themselves for the merest fraction of this monstrous wage why it is paid i am therefore unable to conceive and as the man pays it himself out of funds in his detention i have a certain backwardness to think him honest  at least we have gained a very obvious point that what a man spends upon himself he shall have earned by services to the race thence flows a principle for the outset of life which is a little different from that taught in the present day i am addressing the middle and the upper classes those who have already been fostered and prepared for life at some expense those who have some choice before them and can pick professions and above all those who are what is called independent and need do nothing unless pushed by honour or ambition in this particular the poor are happy among them when a lad comes to his strength he must take the work that offers and can take it with an easy conscience but in the richer classes the question is complicated by the number of opportunities and a variety of considerations here then this principle of ours comes in helpfully the young man has to seek not a road to wealth but an opportunity of service not money but honest work if he has some strong propensity some calling of nature some overweening interest in any special field of industry inquiry or art he will do right to obey the impulse and that for two reasons the first external because there he will render the best services the second personal because a demand of his own nature is to him without appeal whenever it can be satisfied with the consent of his other faculties and appetites if he has no such elective taste by the very principle on which he chooses any pursuit at all he must choose the most honest and serviceable and not the most highly remunerated we have here an external problem not from or to ourself but flowing from the constitution of society and we have our own soul with its fixed design of righteousness all that can be done is to present the problem in proper terms and leave it to the soul of the individual now the problem to the poor is one of necessity to earn wherewithal to live they must find remunerative labour but the problem to the rich is one of honour having the wherewithal they must find serviceable labour each has to earn his daily bread the one because he has not yet got it to eat the other who has already eaten it because he has not yet earned it  of course what is true of bread is true of luxuries and comforts whether for the body or the mind but the consideration of luxuries leads us to a new aspect of the whole question and to a second proposition no less true and maybe no less startling than the last  at the present day we of the easier classes are in a state of surfeit and disgrace after meat plethora has filled us with indifference and we are covered from head to foot with the callosities of habitual opulence born into what is called a certain rank we live as the saying is up to our station we squander without enjoyment because our fathers squandered we eat of the best not from delicacy but from brazen habit we do not keenly enjoy or eagerly desire the presence of a luxury we are unaccustomed to its absence and not only do we squander money from habit but still more pitifully waste it in ostentation i can think of no more melancholy disgrace for a creature who professes either reason or pleasure for his guide than to spend the smallest fraction of his income upon that which he does not desire and to keep a carriage in which you do not wish to drive or a butler of whom you are afraid is a pathetic kind of folly money being a means of happiness should make both parties happy when it changes hands rightly disposed it should be twice blessed in its employment and buyer and seller should alike have their twenty shillings worth of profit out of every pound benjamin franklin went through life an altered man because he once paid too dearly for a penny whistle my concern springs usually from a deeper source to wit from having bought a whistle when i did not want one i find i regret this or would regret it if i gave myself the time not only on personal but on moral and philanthropical considerations for first in a world where money is wanting to buy books for eager students and food and medicine for pining children and where a large majority are starved in their most immediate desires it is surely base stupid and cruel to squander money when i am pushed by no appetite and enjoy no return of genuine satisfaction my philanthropy is wide enough in scope to include myself and when i have made myself happy i have at least one good argument that i have acted rightly but where that is not so and i have bought and not enjoyed my mouth is closed and i conceive that i have robbed the poor and second anything i buy or use which i do not sincerely want or cannot vividly enjoy disturbs the balance of supply and demand and contributes to remove industrious hands from the production of what is useful or pleasurable and to keep them busy upon ropes of sand and things that are a weariness to the flesh that extravagance is truly sinful and a very silly sin to boot in which we impoverish mankind and ourselves it is another question for each mans heart he knows if he can enjoy what he buys and uses if he cannot he is a dog in the manger nay if he cannot i contend he is a thief for nothing really belongs to a man which he cannot use proprietor is connected with propriety and that only is the mans which is proper to his wants and faculties  a youth in choosing a career must not be alarmed by poverty want is a sore thing but poverty does not imply want it remains to be seen whether with half his present income or a third he cannot in the most generous sense live as fully as at present he is a fool who objects to luxuries but he is also a fool who does not protest against the waste of luxuries on those who do not desire and cannot enjoy them it remains to be seen by each man who would live a true life to himself and not a merely specious life to society how many luxuries he truly wants and to how many he merely submits as to a social propriety and all these last he will immediately forswear let him do this and he will be surprised to find how little money it requires to keep him in complete contentment and activity of mind and senses life at any level among the easy classes is conceived upon a principle of rivalry where each man and each household must ape the tastes and emulate the display of others one is delicate in eating another in wine a third in furniture or works of art or dress and i who care nothing for any of these refinements who am perhaps a plain athletic creature and love exercise beef beer flannel shirts and a camp bed am yet called upon to assimilate all these other tastes and make these foreign occasions of expenditure my own it may be cynical i am sure i shall be told it is selfish but i will spend my money as i please and for my own intimate personal gratification and should count myself a nincompoop indeed to lay out the colour of a halfpenny on any fancied social decency or duty i shall not wear gloves unless my hands are cold or unless i am born with a delight in them dress is my own affair and that of one other in the world that in fact and for an obvious reason of any woman who shall chance to be in love with me i shall lodge where i have a mind if i do not ask society to live with me they must be silent and even if i do they have no further right but to refuse the invitation  there is a kind of idea abroad that a man must live up to his station that his house his table and his toilette shall be in a ratio of equivalence and equally imposing to the world if this is in the bible the passage has eluded my inquiries if it is not in the bible it is nowhere but in the heart of the fool throw aside this fancy see what you want and spend upon that distinguish what you do not care about and spend nothing upon that there are not many people who can differentiate wines above a certain and that not at all a high price are you sure you are one of these are you sure you prefer cigars at sixpence each to pipes at some fraction of a farthing are you sure you wish to keep a gig do you care about where you sleep or are you not as much at your ease in a cheap lodging as in an elizabethan manorhouse do you enjoy fine clothes it is not possible to answer these questions without a trial and there is nothing more obvious to my mind than that a man who has not experienced some ups and downs and been forced to live more cheaply than in his fathers house has still his education to begin let the experiment be made and he will find to his surprise that he has been eating beyond his appetite up to that hour that the cheap lodging the cheap tobacco the rough country clothes the plain table have not only no power to damp his spirits but perhaps give him as keen pleasure in the using as the dainties that he took betwixt sleep and waking in his former callous and somnambulous submission to wealth  the true bohemian a creature lost to view under the imaginary bohemians of literature is exactly described by such a principle of life the bohemian of the novel who drinks more than is good for him and prefers anything to work and wears strange clothes is for the most part a respectable bohemian respectable in disrespectability living for the outside and an adventurer but the man i mean lives wholly to himself does what he wishes and not what is thought proper buys what he wants for himself and not what is thought proper works at what he believes he can do well and not what will bring him in money or favour you may be the most respectable of men and yet a true bohemian and the test is this a bohemian for as poor as he may be is always openhanded to his friends he knows what he can do with money and how he can do without it a far rarer and more useful knowledge he has had less and continued to live in some contentment and hence he cares not to keep more and shares his sovereign or his shilling with a friend the poor if they are generous are bohemian in virtue of their birth do you know where beggars go not to the great houses where people sit dazed among their thousands but to the doors of poor men who have seen the world and it was the widow who had only two mites who cast half her fortune into the treasury  but a young man who elects to save on dress or on lodging or who in any way falls out of the level of expenditure which is common to his level in society falls out of society altogether i suppose the young man to have chosen his career on honourable principles he finds his talents and instincts can be best contented in a certain pursuit in a certain industry he is sure that he is serving mankind with a healthy and becoming service and he is not sure that he would be doing so or doing so equally well in any other industry within his reach then that is his true sphere in life not the one in which he was born to his father but the one which is proper to his talents and instincts and suppose he does fall out of society is that a cause of sorrow is your heart so dead that you prefer the recognition of many to the love of a few do you think society loves you put it to the proof decline in material expenditure and you will find they care no more for you than for the khan of tartary you will lose no friends if you had any you will keep them only those who were friends to your coat and equipage will disappear the smiling faces will disappear as by enchantment but the kind hearts will remain steadfastly kind are you so lost are you so dead are you so little sure of your own soul and your own footing upon solid fact that you prefer before goodness and happiness the countenance of sundry dinersout who will flee from you at a report of ruin who will drop you with insult at a shadow of disgrace who do not know you and do not care to know you but by sight and whom you in your turn neither know nor care to know in a more human manner is it not the principle of society openly avowed that friendship must not interfere with business which being paraphrased means simply that a consideration of money goes before any consideration of affection known to this coldblooded gang that they have not even the honour of thieves and will rook their nearest and dearest as readily as a stranger i hope i would go as far as most to serve a friend but i declare openly i would not put on my hat to do a pleasure to society i may starve my appetites and control my temper for the sake of those i love but society shall take me as i choose to be or go without me neither they nor i will lose for where there is no love it is both laborious and unprofitable to associate  but it is obvious that if it is only right for a man to spend money on that which he can truly and thoroughly enjoy the doctrine applies with equal force to the rich and to the poor to the man who has amassed many thousands as well as to the youth precariously beginning life and it may be asked is not this merely preparing misers who are not the best of company but the principle was this that which a man has not fairly earned and further that which he cannot fully enjoy does not belong to him but is a part of mankinds treasure which he holds as steward on parole to mankind then it must be made profitable and how this should be done is once more a problem which each man must solve for himself and about which none has a right to judge him yet there are a few considerations which are very obvious and may here be stated mankind is not only the whole in general but every one in particular every man or woman is one of mankinds dear possessions to his or her just brain and kind heart and active hands mankind intrusts some of its hopes for the future he or she is a possible wellspring of good acts and source of blessings to the race this money which you do not need which in a rigid sense you do not want may therefore be returned not only in public benefactions to the race but in private kindnesses your wife your children your friends stand nearest to you and should be helped the first there at least there can be little imposture for you know their necessities of your own knowledge and consider if all the world did as you did and according to their means extended help in the circle of their affections there would be no more crying want in times of plenty and no more cold mechanical charity given with a doubt and received with confusion would not this simple rule make a new world out of the old and cruel one which we inhabit    after two more sentences the fragment breaks off     prayers  written for family use at vailima     prayers  written for family use at vailima     for success

for us this place of ease and hope accept and inflame our gratitude help us to repay in service one to another the debt of thine unmerited benefits and mercies so that when the period of our stewardship draws to a conclusion when the windows begin to be darkened when the bond of the family is to be loosed there shall be no bitterness of remorse in our farewells  help us to look back on the long way that thou hast brought us on the long days in which we have been served not according to our deserts but our desires on the pit and the miry clay the blackness of despair the horror of misconduct from which our feet have been plucked out for our sins forgiven or prevented for our shame unpublished we bless and thank thee o god help us yet again and ever so order events so strengthen our frailty as that day by day we shall come before thee with this song of gratitude and in the end we be dismissed with honour in their weakness and their fear the vessels of thy handiwork so pray to
