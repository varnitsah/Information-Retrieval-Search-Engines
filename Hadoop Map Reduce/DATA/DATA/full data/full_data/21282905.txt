21282905	hunter quatermains story  by h rider haggard   sir henry curtis as everybody acquainted with him knows is one of the most hospitable men on earth it was in the course of the enjoyment of his hospitality at his place in yorkshire the other day that i heard the hunting story which i am now about to transcribe many of those who read it will no doubt have heard some of the strange rumours that are flying about to the effect that sir henry curtis and his friend captain good rn recently found a vast treasure of diamonds out in the heart of africa supposed to have been hidden by the egyptians or king solomon or some other antique people i first saw the matter alluded to in a paragraph in one of the society papers the day before i started for yorkshire to pay my visit to curtis and arrived needless to say burning with curiosity for there is something very fascinating to the mind in the idea of hidden treasure when i reached the hall i at once asked curtis about it and he did not deny the truth of the story but on my pressing him to tell it he would not nor would captain good who was also staying in the house  you would not believe me if i did sir henry said with one of the hearty laughs which seem to come right out of his great lungs you must wait till hunter quatermain comes he will arrive here from africa tonight and i am not going to say a word about the matter or good either until he turns up quatermain was with us all through he has known about the business for years and years and if it had not been for him we should not have been here today i am going to meet him presently  i could not get a word more out of him nor could anybody else though we were all dying of curiosity especially some of the ladies i shall never forget how they looked in the drawingroom before dinner when captain good produced a great rough diamond weighing fifty carats or more and told them that he had many larger than that if ever i saw curiosity and envy printed on fair faces i saw them then  it was just at this moment that the door was opened and mr allan quatermain announced whereupon good put the diamond into his pocket and sprang at a little man who limped shyly into the room convoyed by sir henry curtis himself  here he is good safe and sound said sir henry gleefully ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to one of the oldest hunters and the very best shot in africa who has killed more elephants and lions than any other man alive  everybody turned and stared politely at the curiouslooking little lame man and though his size was insignificant he was quite worth staring at he had short grizzled hair which stood about an inch above his head like the bristles of a brush gentle brown eyes that seemed to notice everything and a withered face tanned to the colour of mahogany from exposure to the weather he spoke too when he returned goods enthusiastic greeting with a curious little accent which made his speech noticeable  it so happened that i sat next to mr allan quatermain at dinner and of course did my best to draw him but he was not to be drawn he admitted that he had recently been a long journey into the interior of africa with sir henry curtis and captain good and that they had found treasure and then politely turned the subject and began to ask me questions about england where he had never been beforethat is since he came to years of discretion of course i did not find this very interesting and so cast about for some means to bring the conversation round again  now we were dining in an oakpanelled vestibule and on the wall opposite to me were fixed two gigantic elephant tusks and under them a pair of buffalo horns very rough and knotted showing that they came off an old bull and having the tip of one horn split and chipped i noticed that hunter quatermains eyes kept glancing at these trophies and took an occasion to ask him if he knew anything about them  i ought to he answered with a little laugh the elephant to which those tusks belonged tore one of our party right in two about eighteen months ago and as for the buffalo horns they were nearly my death and were the end of a servant of mine to whom i was much attached i gave them to sir henry when he left natal some months ago and mr quatermain sighed and turned to answer a question from the lady whom he had taken down to dinner and who needless to say was also employed in trying to pump him about the diamonds  indeed all round the table there was a simmer of scarcely suppressed excitement which when the servants had left the room could no longer be restrained  now mr quatermain said the lady next him we have been kept in an agony of suspense by sir henry and captain good who have persistently refused to tell us a word of this story about the hidden treasure till you came and we simply can bear it no longer so please begin at once  yes said everybody go on please  hunter quatermain glanced round the table apprehensively he did not seem to appreciate finding himself the object of so much curiosity  ladies and gentlemen he said at last with a shake of his grizzled head i am very sorry to disappoint you but i cannot do it it is this way at the request of sir henry and captain good i have written down a true and plain account of king solomons mines and how we found them so you will soon be able to learn all about that wonderful adventure for yourselves but until then i will say nothing about it not from any wish to disappoint your curiosity or to make myself important but simply because the whole story partakes so much of the marvellous that i am afraid to tell it in a piecemeal hasty fashion for fear i should be set down as one of those common fellows of whom there are so many in my profession who are not ashamed to narrate things they have not seen and even to tell wonderful stories about wild animals they have never killed and i think that my companions in adventure sir henry curtis and captain good will bear me out in what i say  yes quatermain i think you are quite right said sir henry precisely the same considerations have forced good and myself to hold our tongues we did not wish to be bracketed withwell with other famous travellers  there was a murmur of disappointment at these announcements  i believe you are all hoaxing us said the young lady next mr quatermain rather sharply  believe me answered the old hunter with a quaint courtesy and a little bow of his grizzled head though i have lived all my life in the wilderness and amongst savages i have neither the heart nor the want of manners to wish to deceive one so lovely  whereat the young lady who was pretty looked appeased  this is very dreadful i broke in we ask for bread and you give us a stone mr quatermain the least that you can do is to tell us the story of the tusks opposite and the buffalo horns underneath we wont let you off with less  i am but a poor storyteller put in the old hunter but if you will forgive my want of skill i shall be happy to tell you not the story of the tusks for that is part of the history of our journey to king solomons mines but that of the buffalo horns beneath them which is now ten years old  bravo quatermain said sir henry we shall all be delighted fire away fill up your glass first  the little man did as he was bid took a sip of claret and beganabout ten years ago i was hunting up in the far interior of africa at a place called gatgarra not a great way from the chobe river i had with me four native servants namely a driver and voorlooper or leader who were natives of matabeleland a hottentot named hans who had once been the slave of a transvaal boer and a zulu hunter who for five years had accompanied me upon my trips and whose name was mashune now near gatgarra i found a fine piece of healthy parklike country where the grass was very good considering the time of year and here i made a little camp or headquarter settlement from whence i went expeditions on all sides in search of game especially elephant my luck however was bad i got but little ivory i was therefore very glad when some natives brought me news that a large herd of elephants were feeding in a valley about thirty miles away at first i thought of trekking down to the valley waggon and all but gave up the idea on hearing that it was infested with the deadly tsetse fly which is certain death to all animals except men donkeys and wild game so i reluctantly determined to leave the waggon in the charge of the matabele leader and driver and to start on a trip into the thorn country accompanied only by the hottentot hans and mashune  accordingly on the following morning we started and on the evening of the next day reached the spot where the elephants were reported to be but here again we were met by ill luck that the elephants had been there was evident enough for their spoor was plentiful and so were other traces of their presence in the shape of mimosa trees torn out of the ground and placed topsyturvy on their flat crowns in order to enable the great beasts to feed on their sweet roots but the elephants themselves were conspicuous by their absence they had elected to move on this being so there was only one thing to do and that was to move after them which we did and a pretty hunt they led us for a fortnight or more we dodged about after those elephants coming up with them on two occasions and a splendid herd they wereonly however to lose them again at length we came up with them a third time and i managed to shoot one bull and then they started off again where it was useless to try and follow them after this i gave it up in disgust and we made the best of our way back to the camp not in the sweetest of tempers carrying the tusks of the elephant i had shot  it was on the afternoon of the fifth day of our tramp that we reached the little koppie overlooking the spot where the waggon stood and i confess that i climbed it with a pleasurable sense of homecoming for his waggon is the hunters home as much as his house is that of the civilized person i reached the top of the koppie and looked in the direction where the friendly white tent of the waggon should be but there was no waggon only a black burnt plain stretching away as far as the eye could reach i rubbed my eyes looked again and made out on the spot of the camp not my waggon but some charred beams of wood half wild with grief and anxiety followed by hans and mashune i ran at full speed down the slope of the koppie and across the space of plain below to the spring of water where my camp had been i was soon there only to find that my worst suspicions were confirmed  the waggon and all its contents including my spare guns and ammunition had been destroyed by a grass fire  now before i started i had left orders with the driver to burn off the grass round the camp in order to guard against accidents of this nature and here was the reward of my folly a very proper illustration of the necessity especially where natives are concerned of doing a thing ones self if one wants it done at all evidently the lazy rascals had not burnt round the waggon most probably indeed they had themselves carelessly fired the tall and resinous tambouki grass near by the wind had driven the flames on to the waggon tent and there was quickly an end of the matter as for the driver and leader i know not what became of them probably fearing my anger they bolted taking the oxen with them i have never seen them from that hour to this  i sat down on the black veldt by the spring and gazed at the charred axles and disselboom of my waggon and i can assure you ladies and gentlemen i felt inclined to weep as for mashune and hans they cursed away vigorously one in zulu and the other in dutch ours was a pretty position we were nearly 300 miles away from bamangwato the capital of khamas country which was the nearest spot where we could get any help and our ammunition spare guns clothing food and everything else were all totally destroyed i had just what i stood in which was a flannel shirt a pair of veldtschoons or shoes of raw hide my eightbore rifle and a few cartridges hans and mashune had also each a martini rifle and some cartridges not many and it was with this equipment that we had to undertake a journey of 300 miles through a desolate and almost uninhabited region i can assure you that i have rarely been in a worse position and i have been in some queer ones however these things are the natural incidents of a hunters life and the only thing to do was to make the best of them  accordingly after passing a comfortless night by the remains of my waggon we started next morning on our long journey towards civilization now if i were to set to work to tell you all the troubles and incidents of that dreadful journey i should keep you listening here till midnight so i will with your permission pass on to the particular adventure of which the pair of buffalo horns opposite are the melancholy memento  we had been travelling for about a month living and getting along as best we could when one evening we camped some forty miles from bamangwato by this time we were indeed in a melancholy plight footsore half starved and utterly worn out and in addition i was suffering from a sharp attack of fever which half blinded me and made me weak as a babe our ammunition too was exhausted i had only one cartridge left for my eightbore rifle and hans and mashune who were armed with martini henrys had three between them it was about an hour from sundown when we halted and lit a firefor luckily we had still a few matches it was a charming spot to camp i remember just off the game track we were following was a little hollow fringed about with flatcrowned mimosa trees and at the bottom of the hollow a spring of clear water welled up out of the earth and formed a pool round the edges of which grew an abundance of watercresses of an exactly similar kind to those which were handed round the table just now now we had no food of any kind left having that morning devoured the last remains of a little oribé antelope which i had shot two days previously accordingly hans who was a better shot than mashune took two of the three remaining martini cartridges and started out to see if he could not kill a buck for supper i was too weak to go myself  meanwhile mashune employed himself in dragging together some dead boughs from the mimosa trees to make a sort of skerm or shelter for us to sleep in about forty yards from the edge of the pool of water we had been greatly troubled with lions in the course of our long tramp and only on the previous night have very nearly been attacked by them which made me nervous especially in my weak state just as we had finished the skerm or rather something which did duty for one mashune and i heard a shot apparently fired about a mile away  hark to it sung out mashune in zulu more i fancy by way of keeping his spirits up than for any other reasonfor he was a sort of black mark tapley and very cheerful under difficulties hark to the wonderful sound with which the maboona the boers shook our fathers to the ground at the battle of the blood river we are hungry now my father our stomachs are small and withered up like a dried oxs paunch but they will soon be full of good meat hans is a hottentot and an umfagozan that is a low fellow but he shoots straightah he certainly shoots straight be of a good heart my father there will soon be meat upon the fire and we shall rise up men  and so he went on talking nonsense till i told him to stop because he made my head ache with his empty words  shortly after we heard the shot the sun sank in his red splendour and there fell upon earth and sky the great hush of the african wilderness the lions were not up as yet they would probably wait for the moon and the birds and beasts were all at rest i cannot describe the intensity of the quiet of the night to me in my weak state and fretting as i was over the nonreturn of the hottentot hans it seemed almost ominousas though nature were brooding over some tragedy which was being enacted in her sight  it was quietquiet as death and lonely as the grave  mashune i said at last where is hans my heart is heavy for him  nay my father i know not mayhap he is weary and sleeps or mayhap he has lost his way  mashune art thou a boy to talk folly to me i answered tell me in all the years thou hast hunted by my side didst thou ever know a hottentot to lose his path or to sleep upon the way to camp  nay macumazahn that ladies is my native name and means the man who gets up by night or who is always awake i know not where he is  but though we talked thus we neither of us liked to hint at what was in both our minds namely that misfortunate had overtaken the poor hottentot  mashune i said at last go down to the water and bring me of those green herbs that grow there i am hungered and must eat something  nay my father surely the ghosts are there they come out of the water at night and sit upon the banks to dry themselves an isanusi told it me        isanusi witchfinder  mashune was i think one of the bravest men i ever knew in the daytime but he had a more than civilized dread of the supernatural  must i go myself thou fool i said sternly  nay macumazahn if thy heart yearns for strange things like a sick woman i go even if the ghosts devour me  and accordingly he went and soon returned with a large bundle of watercresses of which i ate greedily  art thou not hungry i asked the great zulu presently as he sat eyeing me eating  never was i hungrier my father  then eat and i pointed to the watercresses  nay macumazahn i cannot eat those herbs  if thou dost not eat thou wilt starve eat mashune  he stared at the watercresses doubtfully for a while and at last seized a handful and crammed them into his mouth crying out as he did so oh why was i born that i should live to feed on green weeds like an ox surely if my mother could have known it she would have killed me when i was born and so he went on lamenting between each fistful of watercresses till all were finished when he declared that he was full indeed of stuff but it lay very cold on his stomach like snow upon a mountain at any other time i should have laughed for it must be admitted he had a ludicrous way of putting things zulus do not like green food  just after mashune had finished his watercress we heard the loud woof woof of a lion who was evidently promenading much nearer to our little skerm than was pleasant indeed on looking into the darkness and listening intently i could hear his snoring breath and catch the light of his great yellow eyes we shouted loudly and mashune threw some sticks on the fire to frighten him which apparently had the desired effect for we saw no more of him for a while  just after we had had this fright from the lion the moon rose in her fullest splendour throwing a robe of silver light over all the earth i have rarely seen a more beautiful moonrise i remember that sitting in the skerm i could with ease read faint pencil notes in my pocketbook as soon as the moon was up game began to trek down to the water just below us i could from where i sat see all sorts of them passing along a little ridge that ran to our right on their way to the drinking place indeed one bucka large elandcame within twenty yards of the skerm and stood at gaze staring at it suspiciously his beautiful head and twisted horns standing out clearly against the sky i had i recollect every mind to have a pull at him on the chance of providing ourselves with a good supply of beef but remembering that we had but two cartridges left and the extreme uncertainty of a shot by moonlight i at length decided to refrain the eland presently moved on to the water and a minute or two afterwards there arose a great sound of splashing followed by the quick fall of galloping hoofs  whats that mashune i asked  that dam lion buck smell him replied the zulu in english of which he had a very superficial knowledge  scarcely were the words out of his mouth before we heard a sort of whine over the other side of the pool which was instantly answered by a loud coughing roar close to us  by jove i said there are two of them they have lost the buck we must look out they dont catch us and again we made up the fire and shouted with the result that the lions moved off  mashune i said do you watch till the moon gets over that tree when it will be the middle of the night then wake me watch well now or the lions will be picking those worthless bones of yours before you are three hours older i must rest a little or i shall die  koos chief answered the zulu sleep my father sleep in peace my eyes shall be open as the stars and like the stars watch over you  although i was so weak i could not at once follow his advice to begin with my head ached with fever and i was torn with anxiety as to the fate of the hottentot hans and indeed as to our own fate left with sore feet empty stomachs and two cartridges to find our way to bamangwato forty miles off then the mere sensation of knowing that there are one or more hungry lions prowling round you somewhere in the dark is disquieting however well one may be used to it and by keeping the attention on the stretch tends to prevent one from sleeping in addition to all these troubles too i was i remember seized with a dreadful longing for a pipe of tobacco whereas under the circumstances i might as well have longed for the moon  at last however i fell into an uneasy sleep as full of bad dreams as a prickly pear is of points one of which i recollect was that i was setting my naked foot upon a cobra which rose upon its tail and hissed my name macumazahn into my ear indeed the cobra hissed with such persistency that at last i roused myself  macumazahn nanzia nanzia there there whispered mashunes voice into my drowsy ears raising myself i opened my eyes and i saw mashune kneeling by my side and pointing towards the water following the line of his outstretched hand my eyes fell upon a sight that made me jump old hunter as i was even in those days about twenty paces from the little skerm was a large antheap and on the summit of the antheap her four feet rather close together so as to find standing space stood the massive form of a big lioness her head was towards the skerm and in the bright moonlight i saw her lower it and lick her paws  mashune thrust the martini rifle into my hands whispering that it was loaded i lifted it and covered the lioness but found that even in that light i could not make out the foresight of the martini as it would be madness to fire without doing so for the result would probably be that i should wound the lioness if indeed i did not miss her altogether i lowered the rifle and hastily tearing a fragment of paper from one of the leaves of my pocketbook which i had been consulting just before i went to sleep i proceeded to fix it on to the front sight but all this took a little time and before the paper was satisfactorily arranged mashune again gripped me by the arm and pointed to a dark heap under the shade of a small mimosa tree which grew not more than ten paces from the skerm  well what is it i whispered i can see nothing  it is another lion he answered  nonsense thy heart is dead with fear thou seest double and i bent forward over the edge of the surrounding fence and stared at the heap  even as i said the words the dark mass rose and stalked out into the moonlight it was a magnificent blackmaned lion one of the largest i had ever seen when he had gone two or three steps he caught sight of me halted and stood there gazing straight towards ushe was so close that i could see the firelight reflected in his wicked greenish eyes  shoot shoot said mashune the devil is cominghe is going to spring  i raised the rifle and got the bit of paper on the foresight straight on to a little path of white hair just where the throat is set into the chest and shoulders as i did so the lion glanced back over his shoulder as according to my experience a lion nearly always does before he springs then he dropped his body a little and i saw his big paws spread out upon the ground as he put his weight on them to gather purchase in haste i pressed the trigger of the martini and not a moment too soon for as i did so he was in the act of springing the report of the rifle rang out sharp and clear on the intense silence of the night and in another second the great brute had landed on his head within four feet of us and rolling over and over towards us was sending the bushes which composed our little fence flying with convulsive strokes of his great paws we sprang out of the other side of the skerm and he rolled on to it and into it and then right through the fire next he raised himself and sat upon his haunches like a great dog and began to roar heavens how he roared i never heard anything like it before or since he kept filling his lungs with air and then emitting it in the most heartshaking volumes of sound suddenly in the middle of one of the loudest roars he rolled over on to his side and lay still and i knew that he was dead a lion generally dies upon his side  with a sigh of relief i looked up towards his mate upon the antheap she was standing there apparently petrified with astonishment looking over her shoulder and lashing her tail but to our intense joy when the dying beast ceased roaring she turned and with one enormous bound vanished into the night  then we advanced cautiously towards the prostrate brute mashune droning an improvised zulu song as he went about how macumazahn the hunter of hunters whose eyes are open by night as well as by day put his hand down the lions stomach when it came to devour him and pulled out his heart by the roots c c by way of expressing his satisfaction in his hyperbolical zulu way at the turn events had taken  there was no need for caution the lion was as dead as though he had already been stuffed with straw the martini bullet had entered within an inch of the white spot i had aimed at and travelled right through him passing out at the right buttock near the root of the tail the martini has wonderful driving power though the shock it gives to the system is comparatively speaking slight owing to the smallness of the hole it makes but fortunately the lion is an easy beast to kill  i passed the rest of that night in a profound slumber my head reposing upon the deceased lions flank a position that had i thought a beautiful touch of irony about it though the smell of his singed hair was disagreeable when i woke again the faint primrose lights of dawn were flushing in the eastern sky for a moment i could not understand the chill sense of anxiety that lay like a lump of ice at my heart till the feel and smell of the skin of the dead lion beneath my head recalled the circumstances in which we were placed i rose and eagerly looked round to see if i could discover any signs of hans who if he had escaped accident would surely return to us at dawn but there were none then hope grew faint and i felt that it was not well with the poor fellow setting mashune to build up the fire i hastily removed the hide from the flank of the lion which was indeed a splendid beast and cutting off some lumps of flesh we toasted and ate them greedily lions flesh strange as it may seem is very good eating and tastes more like veal than anything else  by the time we had finished our muchneeded meal the sun was getting up and after a drink of water and a wash at the pool we started to try and find hans leaving the dead lion to the tender mercies of the hyænas both mashune and myself were by constant practice pretty good hands at tracking and we had not much difficulty in following the hottentots spoor faint as it was we had gone on in this way for halfanhour or so and were perhaps a mile or more from the site of our campingplace when we discovered the spoor of a solitary bull buffalo mixed up with the spoor of hans and were able from various indications to make out that he had been tracking the buffalo at length we reached a little glade in which there grew a stunted old mimosa thorn with a peculiar and overhanging formation of root under which a porcupine or an antbear or some such animal had hollowed out a widelipped hole about ten or fifteen paces from this thorntree there was a thick patch of bush  see macumazahn see said mashune excitedly as we drew near the thorn the buffalo has charged him look here he stood to fire at him see how firmly he planted his feet upon the earth there is the mark of his crooked toe hans had one bent toe look here the bull came like a boulder down the hill his hoofs turning up the earth like a hoe hans had hit him he bled as he came there are the blood spots it is all written down there my fatherthere upon the earth  yes i said yes but where is hans  even as i said it mashune clutched my arm and pointed to the stunted thorn just by us even now gentlemen it makes me feel sick when i think of what i saw  for fixed in a stout fork of the tree some eight feet from the ground was hans himself or rather his dead body evidently tossed there by the furious buffalo one leg was twisted round the fork probably in a dying convulsion in the side just beneath the ribs was a great hole from which the entrails protruded but this was not all the other leg hung down to within five feet of the ground the skin and most of the flesh were gone from it for a moment we stood aghast and gazed at this horrifying sight then i understood what had happened the buffalo with that devilish cruelty which distinguishes the animal had after his enemy was dead stood underneath his body and licked the flesh off the pendant leg with his filelike tongue i had heard of such a thing before but had always treated the stories as hunters yarns but i had no doubt about it now poor hans skeleton foot and ankle were an ample proof  we stood aghast under the tree and stared and stared at this awful sight when suddenly our cogitations were interrupted in a painful manner the thick bush about fifteen paces off burst asunder with a crashing sound and uttering a series of ferocious piglike grunts the bull buffalo himself came charging out straight at us even as he came i saw the blood mark on his side where poor hans bullet had struck him and also as is often the case with particularly savage buffaloes that his flanks had recently been terribly torn in an encounter with a lion  on he came his head well up a buffalo does not generally lower his head till he does so to strike those great black hornsas i look at them before me gentlemen i seem to see them come charging at me as i did ten years ago silhouetted against the green bush behindon on  with a shout mashune bolted off sideways towards the bush i had instinctively lifted my eightbore which i had in my hand it would have been useless to fire at the buffalos head for the dense horns must have turned the bullet but as mashune bolted the bull slewed a little with the momentary idea of following him and as this gave me a ghost of a chance i let drive my only cartridge at his shoulder the bullet struck the shoulderblade and smashed it up and then travelled on under the skin into his flank but it did not stop him though for a second he staggered  throwing myself on to the ground with the energy of despair i rolled under the shelter of the projecting root of the thorn crushing myself as far into the mouth of the antbear hole as i could in a single instant the buffalo was after me kneeling down on his uninjured kneefor one leg that of which i had broken the shoulder was swinging helplessly to and frohe set to work to try and hook me out of the hole with his crooked horn at first he struck at me furiously and it was one of the blows against the base of the tree which splintered the tip of the horn in the way that you see then he grew more cunning and pushed his head as far under the root as possible made long semicircular sweeps at me grunting furiously and blowing saliva and hot steamy breath all over me i was just out of reach of the horn though every stroke by widening the hole and making more room for his head brought it closer to me but every now and again i received heavy blows in the ribs from his muzzle feeling that i was being knocked silly i made an effort and seizing his rough tongue which was hanging from his jaws i twisted it with all my force the great brute bellowed with pain and fury and jerked himself backwards so strongly that he dragged me some inches further from the mouth of the hole and again made a sweep at me catching me this time round the shoulderjoint in the hook of his horn  i felt that it was all up now and began to holloa  he has got me i shouted in mortal terror gwasa mashune gwasa stab mashune stab  one hoist of the great head and out of the hole i came like a periwinkle out of his shell but even as i did so i caught sight of mashunes stalwart form advancing with his bangwan or broad stabbing assegai raised above his head in another quarter of a second i had fallen from the horn and heard the blow of the spear followed by the indescribable sound of steel shearing its way through flesh i had fallen on my back and looking up i saw that the gallant mashune had driven the assegai a foot or more into the carcass of the buffalo and was turning to fly  alas it was too late bellowing madly and spouting blood from mouth and nostrils the devilish brute was on him and had thrown him up like a feather and then gored him twice as he lay i struggled up with some wild idea of affording help but before i had gone a step the buffalo gave one long sighing bellow and rolled over dead by the side of his victim  mashune was still living but a single glance at him told me that his hour had come the buffalos horn had driven a great hole in his right lung and inflicted other injuries  i knelt down beside him in the uttermost distress and took his hand  is he dead macumazahn he whispered my eyes are blind i cannot see  yes he is dead  did the black devil hurt thee macumazahn  no my poor fellow i am not much hurt  ow i am glad  then came a long silence broken only by the sound of the air whistling through the hole in his lung as he breathed  macumazahn art thou there i cannot feel thee  i am here mashune  i die macumazahnthe world flies round and round i goi go out into the dark surely my father at times in days to comethou wilt think of mashune who stood by thy sidewhen thou killest elephants as we usedas we used  they were his last words his brave spirit passed with him i dragged his body to the hole under the tree and pushed it in placing his broad assegai by him according to the custom of his people that he might not go defenceless on his long journey and then ladiesi am not ashamed to confessi stood alone there before it and wept like a woman
