have only been so far modified here as is necessary for purposes of volume publication they aim at being suggestive rather than exhaustive i shall be satisfied if i have provoked thought without following out each train to a logical conclusion most of the essays are just what they pretend to becrystallisations into writing of ideas suggested in familiar conversation  g a  hind head march 1894

postprandial philosophy     i  the struggle for life among languages   a distinguished positivist friend of mine who is in most matters a practical man of the world astonished me greatly the other day at venice by the grave remark that italian was destined to be the language of the future i found on inquiry he had inherited the notion direct from auguste comte who justified it on the purely sentimental and unpractical ground that the tongue of dante had never yet been associated with any great national defeat or disgrace the idea surprised me not a little because it displays such a profound misconception of what language is and why people use it the speech of the world will not be decided on mere grounds of sentiment the tongue that survives will not survive because it is so admirably adapted for the manufacture of rhymes or epigrams stern need compels frenchmen and germans in congress assembled and looking about them for a means of intercommunication might indeed agree to accept italian then and there as an international compromise but congresses dont make or unmake the habits of everyday life and the growth or spread of a language is a thing as much beyond our deliberate human control as the rise or fall of the barometer  my friends remark however set me thinking and watching what are really the languages now gaining and spreading over the civilised world it set me speculating what will be the outcome of this gain and spread in another half century and the results are these vastly the most growing and absorbing of all languages at the present moment is the english which is almost everywhere swallowing up the overflow of german scandinavian dutch and russian next to it probably in point of vitality comes spanish which is swallowing up the overflow of french italian and the other latin races third perhaps ranks russian destined to become in time the spoken tongue of a vast tract in northern and central asia among noneuropean languages three seem to be gaining fast chinese malay arabic of the doomed tongues on the other hand the most hopeless is french which is losing all round while italian german and dutch are either quite at a standstill or slightly retrograding the world is now round by the middle of the twentieth century in all probability english will be its dominant speech and the englishspeaking peoples a heterogeneous conglomerate of all nationalities will control between them the destinies of mankind spanish will be the language of half the populous southern hemisphere russian will spread over a moiety of asia chinese malay arabic will divide among themselves the less civilised parts of africa and the east but french german and italian will be insignificant and dwindling european dialects as numerically unimportant as flemish or danish in our own day  and why not because shakespeare wrote in english but because the english language has already got a firm hold of all those portions of the earths surface which are most absorbing the overflow of european populations germans and scandinavians and russians emigrate by the thousand now to all parts of the united states and the northwest of canada in the first generation they may still retain their ancestral speech but their children have all to learn english in australia and new zealand the same thing is happening in south africa dutch had got a footing it is true but it is fast losing it the newcomers learn english and though the elder boers stick with boer conservatism to their native tongue young piet and young paul find it pays them better to know and speak the language of commercethe language of cape town of kimberley of the future the reason is the same throughout whenever two tongues come to be spoken in the same area one of them is sure to be more useful in business than the other every frenchcanadian who wishes to do things on a large scale is obliged to speak english so is the creole in louisiana so earlier were the knickerbocker dutch in new york once let english get in and it beats all competing languages fairly out of the field in a couple of generations  like influences favour spanish in south america and elsewhere english has annexed most of north america australia south africa the pacific spanish has annexed south america central america the philippines cuba and a few other places for the most part these areas are less suited than the englishspeaking districts for colonisation by north europeans but they absorb a large number of italians and other mediterranean races who all learn spanish in the second generation as to the other dominant languages the points in their favour are different conquest and administrative needs are spreading russian over the steppes of asia the arab merchant and the growth of mahommedanism are importing arabic far into the heart of africa the chinaman is carrying his own monosyllables with him to california australia singapore these tongues in future will divide the world between them  the german who leaves germany becomes an angloamerican the italian who leaves italy becomes a spanishamerican  there is another and still more striking way of looking at the rapid increase of english no other language will carry you through so many ports in the world it suffices for london liverpool glasgow belfast southampton cardiff for new york boston montreal charleston new orleans san francisco for sydney melbourne auckland hong kong yokohama honolulu for calcutta bombay madras kurrachi singapore colombo cape town mauritius spanish with cadiz barcelona havana callao valparaiso cannot touch that record nor can french with marseilles bordeaux havre algiers antwerp tahiti the most commercially useful language in the world thus widely diffused in so many great mercantile and shipping centres is certain to win in the struggle for existence among the tongues of the future  the old mediterranean civilisation teaches us a useful lesson in this respect two languages dominated the mediterranean basin the east spoke greek not because plato and Æschylus spoke greek but because greek was the tongue of the great commercial centresof athens syracuse alexandria antioch byzantium the west spoke latin not because catullus and virgil spoke latin but because latin was the administrative tongue the tongue of rome of italy and later of gaul of spain of the great towns in dacia pannonia britain whoever wanted to do anything on the big scale then had to speak greek or latin so much so that the native languages of gaul and spain died utterly out and latin dialects are now the spoken tongue in all southern europe in our own time again educated hindoos from different parts of india have to use english as a means of intercommunication and native merchants must write their business correspondence with distant houses in english to put an extreme contrast in the last century french was spoken by far more people than english at the present day french is only just keeping up its numbers in france is losing in canada and the united states is not advancing to any extent in africa english is spoken by a hundred million people in europe and america is overrunning africa has annexed australasia and the pacific isles has ousted or is ousting dutch at the cape french in louisiana even spanish itself in florida california new mexico in egyptian mud villages the aspiring copt who once learnt french now learns english in scandinavia our tongue gains ground daily everywhere in the world it takes the lead among the european languages and by the middle of the next century will no doubt be spoken over half the globe by a cosmopolitan mass of five hundred million people  and all on purely darwinian principles it is the best adapted tongue and therefore it survives in the struggle for existence it is the easiest to learn at least orally it has got rid of the effete rubbish of genders simplified immensely its declensions and conjugations thrown overboard most of the nonsensical ballast we know as grammar it is only weighted now by its grotesque and ridiculous spellingone of the absurdest among all the absurd english attempts at compromise the pressure of the newer speakers will compel it to make jetsam of that lumber also and then the tongue of shelley and newton will march onward unopposed to the conquest of humanity  i pen these remarks i hope without prejudice patriotism is a vulgar vice of which i have never been guilty     ii  in the matter of aristocracy   aristocracies as a rule all the world over consist and have always consisted of barbaric conquerors or their descendants who remain to the last on the average of instances at a lower grade of civilisation and morals than the democracy they live among  i know this view is to some extent opposed to the common ideas of people at large and especially of that particular european people which dearly loves a lord as to the relative position of aristocracies and democracies in the sliding scale of human development there is a common though wholly unfounded belief knocking about the world that the aristocrat is better in intelligence in culture in arts in manners than the ordinary plebeian the fact is being like all barbarians a boastful creature he has gone on so long asserting his own profound superiority by birth to the world around hima superiority as of fine porcelain to common claythat the world around him has at last actually begun to accept him at his own valuation most english people in particular think that a lord is born a better judge of pictures and wines and books and deportment than the human average of us but history shows us the exact opposite it is a plain historical fact provable by simple enumeration that almost all the aristocracies the world has ever known have taken their rise in the conquest of civilised and cultivated races by barbaric invaders and that the barbaric invaders have seldom or never learned the practical arts and handicrafts which are the civilising element in the life of the conquered people around them  to begin with the aristocracies best known to most of us the noble families of modern and mediæval europe sprang as a whole from the teutonic invasion of the roman empire in italy it was the lombards and the goths who formed the bulk of the great ruling families all the wellknown aristocratic names of mediæval italy are without exception teutonic in gaul it was the rude frank who gave the aristocratic element to the mixed nationality while it was the civilised and cultivated romanoceltic provincial who became by fate the mere roturier the great revolution it has been well said was ethnically speaking nothing more than the revolt of the celtic against the teutonic fraction and one might add also the revolt of the civilised romanised serf against the barbaric seigneur in spain the hidalgo is just the hi dal go the son of the goth the descendant of those rude visigothic conquerors who broke down the old civilisation of iberian and romanised hispania and so on throughout all over europe if you care to look close you will find the aristocrat was the son of the intrusive barbarian the democrat was the son of the old civilised and educated autochthonous people  it is just the same elsewhere wherever we turn take greece for example its most aristocratic state was undoubtedly sparta where a handful of essentially barbaric dorians held in check a much larger and helotised population of higher original civilisation take the east the persian was a wild mountain adventurer who imposed himself as an aristocrat upon the far more cultivated babylonian assyrian and egyptian the same sort of thing had happened earlier in time in babylonia and assyria themselves where barbaric conquerors had similarly imposed themselves upon the first known historical civilisations take india under the moguls once more the aristocracy of the time consisted of the rude mahommedan tartar who lorded it over the ancient enchorial culture of rajpoot and brahmin take china the same thing over againa tartar horde imposing its savage rule over the most ancient civilised people of asia take england its aristocracy at different times has consisted of the various barbaric invaders first the anglosaxon if i must use that hateful and misleading worda pirate from sleswick then the dane another pirate from denmark direct then the norman a yet younger danish pirate with a thin veneer of early french culture who came over from normandy to better himself after just two generations of christian apprenticeship go where you will it matters not where you look from the aztec in mexico to the turk at constantinople or the arab in north africa the aristocrat belongs invariably to a lower race than the civilised people whom he has conquered and subjugated  that may be true perhaps you object as to the remote historical origin of aristocracies but surely the aristocrat of later generations has acquired all the science all the art all the polish of the people he lives amongst he is the flower of their civilisation dont you believe it there isnt a word of truth in it from first to last the aristocrat remains what matthew arnold so justly called him a barbarian i often wonder indeed whether arnold himself really recognised the literal and actual truth of his own brilliant generalisation for the aristocratic ideas and the aristocratic pursuits remain to the very end essentially barbaric the gentleman never soils his highborn hands with dirty work in other words he holds himself severely aloof from the trades and handicrafts which constitute civilisation the arts that train and educate hand eye and brain he ignorantly despises in the early middle ages he did not even condescend to read and write those inferior accomplishments being badges of serfdom if you look close at the occupations of a gentleman in the present day you will find they are all of purely barbaric character they descend to us direct from the semisavage invaders who overthrew the structure of the roman empire and replaced its civilised organisation by the military and barbaric system of feudalism the gentleman is above all things a fighter a hunter a fisherhe preserves the three simplest and commonest barbaric functions he is not a practiser of any civilised or civilising arta craftsman a maker a worker in metal in stone in textile fabrics in pottery these are the things that constitute civilisation but the aristocrat does none of them in the famous words of one who now loves to mix with english gentlemen he toils not neither does he spin the things he may do are to fight by sea and land like his ancestor the goth and his ancestor the viking to slay pheasant and partridge like his predatory forefathers to fish for salmon in the highlands to hunt the fox to sail the yacht to scour the earth in search of great gamelions elephants buffalo his one task is to killeither his kind or his quarry  observe too the essentially barbaric nature of the gentlemans homehis trappings his distinctive marks his surroundings his titles he lives by choice in the wildest country like his skinclad ancestors demanding only that there be game and foxes and fish for his delectation he loves the moors the wolds the fens the braes the highlands not as the painter the naturalist or the searcher after beauty of scenery loves themfor the sake of their wild life their heather and bracken their fresh keen air their boundless horizonbut for the sake of the thoroughly barbarous existence he and his dogs and his gillies can lead in them the fact is neither he nor his ancestors have ever been really civilised barbarians in the midst of an industrial community they have lived their own life of slaying and playing untouched by the culture of the world below them knights in the middle ages squires in the eighteenth century they have never received a tincture of the civilising arts and crafts and industries they have fought and fished and hunted in uninterrupted succession since the days when wild in woods the noble savage ran to the days when they pay extravagant rents for scottish grouse moors their very titles are barbaric and militaryknight and earl and marquis and duke early crystallised names for leaders in war or protectors of the frontier their crests and coats of arms are but the totems of their savage predecessors afterwards utilised by mediæval blacksmiths as distinguishing marks for the summit of a helmet they decorate their halls with savage trophies of the chase like the zulu or the red indian they hang up captured arms and looted chinese jars from the summer palace in their semicivilised drawingrooms they love to be surrounded by grooms and gamekeepers and other barbaric retainers they pass their lives in the midst of serfs their views about the position and rights of womenespecially the women of the lower ordersare frankly african they share the sentiments of achilles as to the individuality of chryseis and briseis  such is the actual aristocrat as we now behold him thus living his own barbarous life in the midst of a civilised community of workers and artists and thinkers and craftsmen with whom he seldom mingles and with whom he has nothing in common this chartered relic of worse days preserves from first to last many painful traits of the low moral and social ideas of his ancestors from which he has never varied he represents most of all in the modern world the surviving savage his love of gewgaws of titles of uniform of dress of feathers of decorations of highland kilts and stars and garters is but one external symbol of his lower grade of mental and moral status all over europe the truly civilised classes have gone on progressing by the practice of peaceful arts from generation to generation but the aristocrat has stood still at the same halfsavage level a hunter and fighter an orgiastic roysterer a killer of wild boars and wearer of absurd mediæval costumes too childish for the civilised and cultivated commoner  government by aristocrats is thus government by the mentally and morally inferior and yeta bill for giving at last some scant measure of selfgovernment to persecuted ireland has to run the gauntlet in our nineteenthcentury england of an irresponsible house of hereditary barbarians     iii  science in education   i mean what i say science in education not education in science  it is the last of these that all the scientific men of england have so long been fighting for and a very good thing it is in its way and i hope they may get as much as they want of it but compared to the importance of science in education education in science is a matter of very small national moment  the difference between the two is by no means a case of tweedledum and tweedledee education in science means the systematic teaching of science so as to train up boys to be scientific men now scientific men are exceedingly useful members of a community and so are engineers and bakers and blacksmiths and artists and chimneysweeps but we cant all be bakers and we cant all be painters in watercolours there is a dim west country legend to the effect that the inhabitants of the scilly isles eke out a precarious livelihood by taking in one anothers washing as a matter of practical political economy such a source of income is worse than precariousits frankly impossible it takes all sorts to make a world a community entirely composed of scientific men would fail to feed itself clothe itself house itself and keep itself supplied with amusing light literature in one word education in science produces specialists and specialists though most useful and valuable persons in their proper place are no more the staple of a civilised community than enginedrivers or balletdancers  what the world at large really needs and will one day get is not this but due recognition of the true value of science in education we dont all want to be made into firstclass anatomists like owen still less into firstclass practical surgeons like sir henry thompson but what we do all want is a competent general knowledge amongst other things of anatomy at large and especially of human anatomy of physiology at large and especially of human physiology we dont all want to be analytical chemists but what we do all want is to know as much about oxygen and carbon as will enable us to understand the commonest phenomena of combustion of chemical combination of animal or vegetable life we dont all want to be zoologists and botanists of the type who put their names after critical species but what we do all want to know is as much about plants and animals as will enable us to walk through life intelligently and to understand the meaning of the things that surround us we want in one word a general acquaintance with the results rather than with the methods of science  in short says the specialist with his familiar sneer you want a smattering  well yes dear sir smelfungus if it gives you pleasure to put it sojust that a smattering an allround smattering but remember that in this matter the man of science is always influenced by ideas derived from his own pursuits as specialist he is for ever thinking what sort of education will produce more specialists in future and as a rule he is thinking what sort of education will produce men capable in future of advancing science now to advance science to discover new snails or invent new ethyl compounds is not and cannot be the main object of the mass of humanity what the mass wants is just unspecialised knowledgethe kind of knowledge that enables men to get comfortably and creditably and profitably through life to meet emergencies as they rise to know their way through the world to use their faculties in all circumstances to the best advantage and for this purpose what is wanted is not the methods but the results of science  one science and one only is rationally taught in our schools at present i mean geography and the example of geography is so eminently useful for illustrating the difference i am trying to point out that i will venture to dwell upon it for a moment in passing it is good for us all to know that the world is round without its being necessary for every one of us to follow in detail the intricate reasoning by which that result has been arrived at it is good for us all to know the position of new york and rio and calcutta on the map without its being necessary for us to understand far less to work out for ourselves the observations and calculations which fixed their latitude and longitude knowledge of the map is a good thing in itself though it is a very different thing indeed from the technical knowledge which enables a man to make a chart of an unknown region or to explore and survey it furthermore it is a form of knowledge far more generally useful a fair acquaintance with the results embodied in the atlas in the gazetteer in baedeker and in bradshaw is much oftener useful to us on our way through the world than a special acquaintance with the methods of mapmaking it would be absurd to say that because a man is not going to be a stanley or a nansen therefore it is no good for him to learn geography it would be absurd to say that unless he learned geography in accordance with its methods instead of its results he could have but a smattering and that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing a little knowledge of the position of new york is indeed a dangerous thing if a man uses it to navigate a cunard vessel across the atlantic but the absence of the smattering is a much more dangerous and fatal thing if the man wishes to do business with the argentine and the transvaal or to enter into practical relations of any sort with anybody outside his own parish the results of geography are useful and valuable in themselves quite apart from the methods employed in obtaining them  it is just the same with all the other sciences there is nothing occult or mysterious about them no just cause or impediment exists why we should insist on being ignorant of the orbits of the planets because we cannot ourselves make the calculations for determining them no reason why we should insist on being ignorant of the classification of plants and animals because we dont feel able ourselves to embark on anatomical researches which would justify us in coming to original conclusions about them i know the mass of scientific opinion has always gone the other way but then scientific opinion means only the opinion of men of science who are themselves specialists and who think most of the education needed to make men specialists not of the education needed to fit them for the general exigencies and emergencies of life we dont want authorities on the cucurbitaceæ but wellinformed citizens professor huxley is not our best guide in these matters but mr herbert spencer who long ago in his book on education sketched out a radical programme of instruction in that knowledge which is of most worth such as no country no college no school in europe has ever yet been bold enough to put into practice  what common sense really demands then is education in the main results of all the sciencesa knowledge of what is known not necessarily a knowledge of each successive step by which men came to know it at present of course in all our schools in england there is no systematic teaching of knowledge at all what replaces it is a teaching of the facts of language and for the most part of useless facts or even of exploded fictions our public schools especially by which phrase we never mean real public schools like the board schools at all but merely schools for the upper and the middle classes are in their existing stage primarily great gymnasiumsvery good things too in their way against which i have not a word of blame and secondarily places for imparting a sham and imperfect knowledge of some few philological facts about two extinct languages pupils get a smattering of homer and cicero that is literally all the equipment for life that the cleverest and most industrious boys can ever take away from them the sillier or idler dont take away even that as to the mental training argument so often trotted out it is childish enough not to be worth answering which is most practically useful to us in lifeknowledge of latin grammar or knowledge of ourselves and the world we live in physical social moral that is the question  the truth is schoolmastering in britain has become a vast vested interest in the hands of men who have nothing to teach us they try to bolster up their vicious system by such artificial arguments as the mental training fallacy forced to admit the utter uselessness of the pretended knowledge they impart they fall back upon the plea of its supposed occult value as intellectual discipline they say in effectthis sawdust we offer you contains no food we know but then see how it strengthens the jaws to chew it besides look at our results the typical john bull pigheaded ignorant brutal are we really such immense successes ourselves that we must needs perpetuate the mould that warped us  the one fatal charge brought against the public school system is that after all it turns out english gentlemen     iv  the theory of scapegoats   alas how easily things go wrong says dr george macdonald and all the world over when things do go wrong the natural and instinctive desire of the human animal isto find a scapegoat when the great french nation in the lump embarks its capital in a hopeless scheme for cutting a canal through the isthmus of panama and then finds out too late that nature has imposed insuperable barriers to its completion on the projected scalewhat does the great french nation do in its collective wisdom but turn round at once to rend the directors it cries a mazas just as in 71 it cried bazaine à la lanterne i dont mean to say the directors dont deserve all they have got or ever will get and perhaps more also i dont mean to deny corruption extraordinary in many high places as a rule the worst that anybody alleges about anything is only a part of what might easily be alleged if we were all in the secret which of us indeed would scape whipping but what i do mean is that we should never have heard of reinach or herz of the corruption and peculation at all if things had gone well it is the crash that brought them out the nation wants a scapegoat aint nobody to be whopped for this ere asked mr sam weller on a critical occasion the question embodies the universal impulse of humanity  tracing the feeling back to its origin it seems due to this minds of the lower order can never see anything go wrong without experiencing a certain sense of resentment and resentment by its very nature desires to vent itself upon some living and sentient creature by preference a fellow human being when the child running too fast falls and hurts itself it gets instantly angry naughty ground to hurt baby says the nurse baby hit it and hurt it and baby promptly hits it back with vicious little fist feeling every desire to revenge itself byandby when baby grows older and learns that the ground cant feel to speak of he wants to put the blame upon somebody else in order to have an object to expend his rage upon you pushed me down he says to his playmate and straightway proceeds to punch his playmates head for itnot because he really believes the playmate did it but because he feels he must have some outlet for his resentment when once resentment is roused it will expend its force on anything that turns up handy as the man who has quarrelled with his wife about a question of a bonnet will kick his dog for trying to follow him to the club as he leaves her  the mob enraged at the death of cæsar meets cinna the poet in the streets of rome your name sir inquires the third citizen truly my name is cinna says the unsuspecting author tear him to pieces cries the mob hes a conspirator i am cinna the poet pleads the unhappy man i am not cinna the conspirator but the mob does not heed such delicate distinctions at such a moment tear him for his bad verses it cries impartially tear him for his bad verses  whatever sort of misfortune falls upon persons of the lower order of intelligence is always met in the same spirit especially is this the case with the deaths of relatives fools who have lost a friend invariably blame somebody for his fatal illness to hear many people talk you would suppose they were unaware of the familiar proposition that all men are mortal including women you might imagine they thought an ordinary human constitution was calculated to survive nine hundred and ninetynine years unless some evildisposed person or persons took the trouble beforehand to waylay and destroy it my poor father was eightyseven when he died and he would have been alive still if it werent for that nasty mrs jones she put him into a pair of damp sheets or my husband would never have caught the cold that killed him if that horrid man brown hadnt kept him waiting so long in the carriage at the street corner the doctor has to bear the brunt of most such complaints indeed it is calculated by an eminent statistician who desires his name to remain unpublished that eightythree per cent of the deaths in great britain might easily have been averted if the patient had only been treated in various distinct ways by all the members of his family and if that foolish dr squills hadnt so grossly mistaken and mistreated his malady  the fact is the death is regarded as a misfortune and somebody must be blamed for it heaven has provided scapegoats the doctor and the hostile female members of the family are always therelaid on as it were for the express purpose  with us in modern europe resentment in such cases seldom goes further than vague verbal outbursts of temper we accuse mrs jones of misdemeanours with damp sheets but we dont get so far as to accuse her of tricks with strychnine in the middle ages however the pursuit of the scapegoat ran a vast deal further when any great one dieda black prince or a dauphinit was always assumed on all hands that he must have been poisoned true poisoning may then have been a trifle more frequent certainly the means of detecting it were far less advanced than in the days of tidy and lauder brunton still people must often have died natural deaths even in the middle agesthough nobody believed it all the world began to speculate what jane shore could have poisoned them a little earlier again it was not the poisoner that was looked for but his predecessor the sorcerer whoever fell ill somebody had bewitched him were the cattle diseased then search for the evil eye did the cows yield no milk some neighbour doubtless knew the reason only too well and could be forced to confess it by liberal use of the thumbscrew and the duckingstool no misfortune was regarded as due to natural causes for in their philosophy there were no such things as natural causes at all whatever illluck came somebody had contrived it so you had always your scapegoat ready to hand to punish the athenians indeed kept a small collection of public scapegoats always in stock waiting to be sacrificed at a moments notice  more even than that go one step further back and you will find that man in his early stages has no conception of such a thing as natural death in any form he doesnt really know that the human organism is wound up like a clock to run at best for so many years or months or hours and that even if nothing unexpected happens to cut short its course prematurely it can only run out its allotted period within his own experience almost all the deaths that occur are violent deaths and have been brought about by human agency or by the attacks of wild beasts there you have a cause with whose action and operation the savage is personally familiar and it is the only one he believes in even old age is in his eyes no direct cause of death for when his relations grow old he considerately clubs them to put them out of their misery when therefore he sees his neighbour struck down before his face by some invisible power and writhing with pain as though unseen snakes and tigers were rending him what should he naturally conclude save that demon or witch or wizard is at work and if he cares about the matter at all what should he do save endeavour to find the culprit out and inflict condign punishment in savage states whenever anything untoward happens to the king or chief it is the business of the witchfinder to disclose the wrongdoer and sooner or later you may be sure somebody gets whopped for it whopping in dahomey means wholesale decapitation  now is it not a direct survival from this primitive state of mind that entails upon us all the desire to find a scapegoat our ancestors really believed there was always somebody to blameman witch or spiritif only you could find him and though we ourselves have mostly got beyond that stage yet the habit it engendered in our race remains ingrained in the nervous system so that none but a few of the naturally highest and most civilised dispositions have really outgrown it most people still think there is somebody to blame for every human misfortune who fills the butchers shops with large blue flies asked the poet of the regency he set it down to the corsican ogre for the tory englishmen of the present day it is mr gladstone who is most often and most popularly envisaged as the author of all evil for the pope it is the freemasons there are just a few men here and there in the world who can see that when misfortunes come circumstances or nature or hardest of all we ourselves have brought them the common human instinct is still to get into a rage and look round to discover whether theres any other fellow standing about unobserved whose head we can safely undertake to punch for it  its all the fault of those confounded paid agitators     v  american duchesses   every american woman is by birth a duchess  there you see i have taken you in when you saw the heading american duchesses you thought i was going to purvey some piquant scandal about highplaced ladies and you straightway began to read my essay that shows i rightly interpreted your human nature theres a deal of human nature flying about unrecognised yet when i said duchesses i actually meant it for the american woman is the only real aristocrat now living in america  these remarks are forced upon me by a brilliant afternoon on the promenade des anglais all nice is there in its cosmopolitan butterfly variety flaunting itself in the sun in the very ugly dresses now in fashion i dont know why but the mode of the moment consists in making everything as exaggerated as possible and sedulously hiding the natural contours of the human figure but let that pass the day is too fine for a man to be critical the band is playing mascagnis last in the jardin public the carriages are drawn up beside the palms and judastrees that fringe the paillon the sousofficiers are strolling along the wall with their red caps stuck jauntily just a trifle on one side as though to mow down nursemaids were the one legitimate occupation of the brav militaire and among them all proud tall disdainful glide the american duchesses cold critical hightoned yet ready to strike up should opportunity serve appropriate acquaintance with their natural equals the dukes of europe  and the american dukesthere arent any but these ladies husbands and fathers and brothersoh theyre business men working hard for the duchesses in wall street or on change in chicago and thats why i say quite seriously the american woman is the only real aristocrat now living in america everybody who has seen much of americans must have noticed for himself how really superior american women are on the average to the men of their kind i dont mean merely that they are better dressed and better groomed and better got up and better mannered than their brothers i mean that they have a real superiority in the things worth havingthe things that are more excellentin education culture knowledge taste good feeling and the reason is not far to seek they represent the only leisured class in america they are the one set of people from maine to california who have time to read to think to travel to look at good pictures to hear good music to mix with society that can improve and elevate them they have read daudet they have seen the vatican the women thus form a natural aristocracythe only aristocracy the country possesses  i am aware that in saying this i take my life in my hands i shall be prepared to defend myself from the infuriated westerner with the usual argument which i shall carry about loaded in all its chambers in my righthand pocket i am also aware that less infuriated easterners choosing their own more familiar weapon will inundate my leisure with sardonic inquiries whether i dont consider oliver wendell holmes or charles eliot norton thus named in full the equal in culture of the average american woman well i frankly admit these cases and thousands like them indeed i have had the good fortune to number among my personal acquaintances many american gentlemen whose chivalrous breeding would have been conspicuous if you will believe it even at marlborough house i will also allow that in new york in boston and less abundantly in other big towns of america men of leisure men of culture and men of thought are to be found as wideminded and as gentlenatured as this race of ours makes them but that doesnt alter the general fact that taking them in the lump american men stand a step or two lower in the scale of humanity than american women one need hardly ask why it is because the men are almost all immersed and absorbed in business while the women are fine ladies who stop at home and read and see and interest themselves widely in numberless directions  the consequence is that nowhere as a rule does the gulf between the sexes yawn so wide as in america one can often observe it in the brothers and sisters of the same family and it runs in the opposite direction from the gulf in europe with us as a rule the men are better educated and more likely to have read and seen and thought widely than the women in america the men are generally so steeped in affairs as to be materialised and encysted they take for the most part a hardheaded solidsilver view of everything and are but little influenced by abstract conceptions their horizon is bounded by the rim of the dollar nay owing to the eager desire to get a good start by beginning life early their education itself is generally cut short at a younger age than their sisters so that even at the outset the girls have often a decided superiority in knowledge and culture amanda reads paul bourget and john oliver hobbes she has some slight tincture of latin greek and german while cyrus knows nothing but english and arithmetic the quotations for prime pork and the state of the market for futures add to this that the women are more sensitive more delicate more naturally refined as well as unspoilt by the trading spirit and you get the real reasons for the marked and in some ways unusual superiority of the american woman  that i think in large part explains the fascination which american women undoubtedly exercise over a considerable class of european men in the european man the american woman often recognises for the first time the male of her species unaccustomed at home to as general a level of culture and feeling as she finds among the educated gentlemen of europe she likes their society and makes her preference felt by them now man is a vain animal you are a man yourself and must recognise at once the truth of the proposition as soon as he sees a woman likes him he instantly returns the compliment with interest in point of fact he usually falls in love with her of course i admit the large number of concomitant circumstances which disturb the problem i admit on the one hand the tempting shekels of the californian heiress and on the other hand the glamour and halo that still surround the british coronet nevertheless after making all deductions for these disturbing factors i submit there remains a residual phenomenon thus best interpreted if anybody denies it i would ask him one questionhow does it come that so many englishmen frenchmen and italians marry american women while so few englishwomen french women or italian women marry american men surely the american men have also the shekels surely it is something even in oregon or montana to have inspired an honourable passion in a lady elizabeth or a dowager countess i think the true explanation is that our men are attracted by american women but our women are not equally attracted by american men and that the quality of the articles has something to do with it  the american duchess i take it comes over to europe and desires incontinently to drag the european duke at the wheels of her chariot and the european duke is fascinated in turn partly by this very fact partly by the undeniable freshness brightness and delicate culture of the american woman for there is no burking the truth that in many respects the american woman carries about her a peculiar charm ungranted as yet to her european sisters it is the charm of freedom of ease of a certain external and skindeep emancipationan emancipation which goes but a little way down yet adds a quaint and piquant grace of manner what she conspicuously lacks on the other hand is essential femininity by which i dont mean womanlinessof that she has enough and to sparebut the wholesome physical and instinctive qualities which go to make up a sound and wellequipped wife and mother the lack of these underlying muliebral qualities more than counterbalances to not a few europeans the undoubted vivacity originality and freshness of the american woman she is a dainty bit of porcelain unsuited for use a delicate exotic blossom for drawingroom decoration where many would prefer robust fruitbearing faculties  i dropped into the opera house here at nice the other night and found they were playing carmenwhich is always interesting well you may perhaps remember that when that creature of passion the gipsy heroine wishes to gain or retain a mans affections she throws a rose at him and then he cannot resist her that is mérimées symbolism art is full of these sacrifices of realism to reticence outside the opera it is not with roses that women enslave us but the american duchess relies entirely upon the use of the rose and that is just where she fails to interest so many of us in europe  and now i think its almost time for me to go and hunt up the material arguments for that rusty sixshooter     vi  is england played out   britain is now the centre of civilisation will it always be so is our commercial supremacy decaying or not have we begun to reach the period of inevitable decline or is decline indeed inevitable at all might a nation go on being great for ever if so are we that nation if not have we yet arrived at the moment when retrogression becomes a foregone conclusion these are momentous questions dare i try under the mimosas on the terrace to resolve them  most people have talked of late as though the palmy days of england were fairly over the down grade lies now before us but then so far as i can judge most people have talked so ever since the morning when hengist and horsa limited landed from their three keels in the isle of thanet gildas is the oldest historian of these islands and his work consists entirely of a good old tory lament in the ashmeadbartlett strain upon the degeneracy of the times and the proximate ruin of the british people gildas wrote some fourteen hundred years ago or thereaboutsand the country is not yet quite visibly ruined on the contrary it seems to the impartial eye a more eligible place of residence today than in the stirring times of the saxon invasion hence for the last two or three centuries i have learned to discount these recurrent jeremiads of toryism and to judge the question of our decadence or progress by a more rational standard  there is only one such rational standard and that is to discover the causes and conditions of our commercial prosperity and then to inquire whether those causes and conditions are being largely altered or modified by the evolution of new phases if they are england must begin to decline if they are not her day is not yet come home rule she will survive even the eight hours bogey we may presume will not finally dispose of her  now the centre of civilisation is not a fixed point it has varied from time to time and may yet vary in the very earliest historical period there was hardly such a thing as a centre of civilisation at all there were civilisations in egypt assyria babylonia etruria discrete civilisations of the river valleys mostly which scarcely came into contact with one another in their first beginnings any more than our own came into contact once with the civilisations of china of japan of peru of mexico as yet there was no worldcommerce no mutual communication of empire with empire it was in the Ægean and the eastern basin of the mediterranean that navigation first reached the point where great commercial ports and free intercourse became possible the phoenicians and later the greeks were the pioneers of the new era tyre athens miletus rhodes occupied the centre of the nascent world and bound together assyria babylonia egypt asia minor greece sicily and italy in one mercantile system a little later hellas itself enlarged so as to include syracuse byzantium alexandria cyrene cumae neapolis massilia the inland sea became a greek lake but as navigation thus slowly widened to the western mediterranean basin the centre of commerce had to shift perforce from hellas to the midpoint of the new area two powerful trading towns occupied such a midpoint in the mediterraneanrome and carthage and they were driven to fight out the supremacy of the world the world as it then existed between them with the roman empire the circle extended so as to take in the atlantic coasts gaul spain and britain which then however lay not at the centre but on the circumference of civilisation during the middle ages when navigation began to embrace the great open sea as well as the mediterranean a double centre sprang up the italian republics venice florence genoa pisa were still the chief carriers but the towns of flanders bruges ghent and antwerp began to compete with them and the atlantic states france england the low countries rose into importance by and by as time goes on the discoveries of columbus and of vasco di gama open out new tracks suddenly commerce is revolutionised france england spain become nearer to america and india than italy so italy declines while the atlantic states usurp the first place as the centres of civilisation  our own age brings fresh seas into the circle once more it is no longer the atlantic the mediterranean or the indian ocean that alone count the pacific also begins to be considered china japan the cape chili peru the argentine california british columbia australia new zealand all of them are parts of the system of today civilisation is worldwide  has this change of area altered the central position of england not at all save to strengthen it if you look at the hemisphere of greatest land you will see that england occupies its exact middle insular herself and therefore all made up of ports she is nearer all ports in the world than any other country is or ever can be i dont say that this insures for her perpetual dominion such as virgil prophesied for the roman empire but i do say it makes her a hard country to beat in commercial competition it accounts for liverpool london glasgow newcastle it even accounts in a way for manchester birmingham leeds and sheffield england now stands at the mathematical centre of the practical world and unless some big thing occurs to displace her she must continue to stand there it takes a great deal to upset the balance of an entire planet  is anything now displacing her well there is the fact that railways are making landcarriage today more important relatively to watercarriage than at any previous period that may perhaps in time shift the centre of the world from an island like england to the middle of a great land area like chicago or moscow and no doubt if ever the centre shifts at all it will shift towards western america or rather the prairie region but just at present what are the greatest commercial towns of the world all ports to a man and the day when it will be otherwise if ever seems still far distant look at the newest countries what are their great focal points every one of them ports melbourne and sydney rio buenos ayres and valparaiso cape town san francisco bombay calcutta yokohama chicago itself the most vital and the quickest grower among modern towns owes half its importance to the fact that there watercarriage down the great lakes begins though it owes the other half i admit to the converse fact that all the great transcontinental railways have to bend south at that point to avoid lake michigan still on the whole i think as long as conditions remain what they are the commercial supremacy of england is in no immediate danger it is these great permanent geographical factors that make or mar a country not eight hours bills or petty social reconstructions said the lord mayor of london to petulant king james when he proposed to remove the court to oxford may it please your majesty not to take away the thames also  but our competitors we are being driven out of our markets oh yes if thats all you mean i dont suppose we shall always be able in everything to keep up our exclusive position our neighbours who bar the advantage of insularity which means a coast and a port always close at hand seem nearly as well situated as we are for access to the worldmarkets are beginning to wake up and take a slice of the cake from us germany is manufacturing belgium is smelting antwerp is exporting america is occupying her own markets but thats a very different thing indeed from national decadence we may have to compete a little harder with our rivals thats all the boom may be over but the thames remains the geographical facts are still unaltered and notice that all the time while theres been this vague talk about bad timesincometax has been steadily increasing london has been steadily growing every outer and visible sign of commercial prosperity has been steadily spreading have our wateringplaces shrunk have our buildings been getting smaller and less luxurious if antwerp has grown how about hull and cardiff well perhaps the past is all right but consider the future eight hours are going to drive capital out of the country rubbish im not a political economist thank god i never sank quite so low as that and im not speaking for or against eight hours im only discounting some verbose nonsense but i know enough to see that the capital of a country can no more be exported than the land or the houses can you drive away the london and northwestern railway can you drive away the factories of manchester the mines of the black country the canals the buildings the machinery the docks the plant the apparatus impossible on the very face of it most of the capital of a country is fixed in its soil and cant be uprooted people fall into this error about driving away capital because they know you can sell particular railway shares or a particular factory and leave the country with the proceeds provided somebody else is willing to buy but you cant sell all the railways and all the factories in a lump and clear out with the capital no no england stands where she does because god put her there and until he invents a new order of things which may of course happen any dayas for example if aerial navigation came in she must continue in spite of minor changes to maintain in the main her present position  but a truce to these frivolities the little italian boy next door calls me to play ball with him with a green lemon from the garden vengo luigi vengo i return at once to the realities of life and dismiss such shadows     vii  the game and the rules   a sportive friend of mine a mighty golfer is fond of saying you radicals want to play the game without the rules to which i am accustomed mildly to retort not at all but we think the rules unfair and so we want to see them altered  now life is a very peculiar game which differs in many important respects even from compulsory football the rugby scrimmage is mere childs play by the side of it theres no possibility of shirking it a medical certificate wont get you off whether you like it or not play you must in your appointed order we are all unwilling competitors nobody asks our naked little souls beforehand whether they would prefer to be born into the game or to remain unfleshed in the limbo of nonexistence willy nilly every one of us is thrust into the world by an irresponsible act of two previous players and once there we must play out the set as best we may to the bitter end however little we like it or the rules that order it  that it must be admitted makes a grave distinction from the very outset between the game of human life and any other game with which we are commonly acquainted it also makes it imperative upon the framers of the rules so to frame them that no one player shall have an unfair or unjust advantage over any of the others and since the penalty of bad play or bad success in the match is death misery starvation it behoves the rulemakers to be more scrupulously particular as to fairness and equity than in any other game like cricket or tennis it behoves them to see that all start fair and that no hapless beginner is unduly handicapped to compel men to take part in a match for dear life whether they wish it or not and then to insist that some of them shall wield bats and some mere broomsticks irrespective of height weight age or bodily infirmity is surely not fair it justifies the committee in calling for a revision  but things are far worse than even that in the game as actually played in europe what shall we say of rules which decide dogmatically that one set of players are hereditarily entitled to be always batting while another set less lucky have to field for ever and to be fined or imprisoned for not catching what shall we say of rules which give one group a perpetual right to free lunch in the tent while the remainder have to pick up what they can for themselves by gleaning among the stubble how justify the principle in accordance with which the captain on one side has an exclusive claim to the common ground of the club and may charge every player exactly what he likes for the right to play upon itespecially when the choice lies between playing on such terms or being cast into the void yourself and your family and then to think that the ground thus tabooed by one particular member may be all sutherlandshire or still worse all westminster decidedly these rules call for instant revision and the unprivileged players must be submissive indeed who consent to put up with them  friends and fellowmembers let us cry with one voice the links for the players  once more just look at the singular rule in our own all england club by which certain assorted members possess a hereditary right to veto all decisions of the elective committee merely because they happen to be their fathers sons and the club long ago very foolishly permitted the like privilege to their ancestors that is an irrational interference with the liberty of the players which hardly anybody nowadays ventures to defend in principle and which is only upheld in some halfhearted way save in the case of that fossil anachronism the duke of argyll by supposed arguments of convenience it wont last long now there is talk in the committee of mending or ending it it shows the longsuffering nature of the poor blind players at this compulsory game of national football that they should ever for one moment permit so monstrous an assumptionpermit the idea that one single player may wield a substantive voice and vote to outweigh tens of thousands of his fellowmembers  these questions of procedure however are after all small matters it is the real hardships of the game that most need to be tackled why should one player be born into the sport with a prescriptive right to fill some easy place in the field while another has to fag on from morning to night in the most uninteresting and fatiguing position why should pâté de foie gras and champagnecup in the tent be so unequally distributed why should those who have made fewest runs and done no fielding be admitted to partake of these luxuries free of charge while those who have borne the brunt of the fight those who have suffered from the heat of the day those who have contributed most to the honour of the victory are turned loose unfed to do as they can for themselves by hook or by crook somehow these are the questions some of us players are now beginning to ask ourselves and we dont find them efficiently answered by the bald statement that we want to play the game without the rules and that we ought to be precious glad the legislators of the club havent made them a hundred times harder against us  no no the rules themselves must be altered time was indeed when people used to think they were made and ordained by divine authority cum privilegio was the motto of the captains but we know very well now that every club settles its own standing orders and that it can alter and modify them as fundamentally as it pleases lots of funny old saws are still uttered upon this subjectthere must always be rich and poor you cant interfere with economical laws if you were to divide up everything tomorrow at the end of a fortnight youd find the same differences and inequalities as ever the lastnamed argument i believe it considers itself by courtesy an argument is one which no selfrespecting radical should so much as deign to answer nobody that i ever heard of for one moment proposed to divide up everything or for that matter anything and the imputation that somebody did or does is a proof either of intentional malevolence or of crass stupidity neither should be encouraged and you encourage them by pretending to take them seriously it is the initial injustices of the game that we radicals object tothe injustices which prevent us from all starting fair and having our even chance of picking up a livelihood we dont want to divide up everythinga most futile proceeding but we do want to untie the legs and release the arms of the handicapped players to drop metaphor at last it is the conditions we complain about alter the conditions and there would be no need for division summary or gradual the game would work itself out spontaneously without your intervention  the injustice of the existing set of rules simply appals the radical yet oddly enough this injustice itself appeals rather to the comparative lookeron than to the heavilyhandicapped players in person they poor creatures dragging their log in patience have grown so accustomed to regarding the world as another mans oyster that they put up uncomplainingly for the most part with the most patent inequalities perhaps tis their want of imagination that makes them unable to conceive any other state of things as even possiblelike the dog who accepts kicking as the natural fate of doghood at any rate you will find if you look about you that the chief reformers are not as a rule the illused classes themselves but the sensitive and thinking souls who hate and loathe the injustice with which others are treated most of the best radicals i have known were men of gentle birth and breeding not all others just as earnest just as eager just as chivalrous sprang from the masses yet the gentlyreared preponderate it is a common tory taunt to say that the battle is one between the haves and the havenots that is by no means true it is between the selfish haves on one side and the unselfish haves who wish to see something done for the havenots on the other as for the poor havenots themselves they are mostly inarticulate indeed the tory almost admits as much when he alters his tone and describes the sympathising and active few as paid agitators  for myself however i am a born conservative i hate to see any old custom or practice changed unless indeed it is either foolish or wickedlike most existing ones     viii  the rÔle of prophet   one great english thinker and artist once tried the rash experiment of being true to himselfof saying out boldly without fear or reserve the highest and noblest and best that was in him he gave us the most exquisite lyrics in the english language he moulded the thought of our first youth as no other poet has ever yet moulded it he became the spiritual father of the richest souls in two succeeding generations of englishmen and what reward did he get for it he was expelled from his university he was hounded out of his country he was deprived of his own children he was denied the common appeal to the law and courts of justice he was drowned an exile in a distant sea and burned in solitude on a foreign shore and after his death he was vilified and calumniated by wretched pennyaliners or worse insult still apologised for with halfhearted shrugs by lukewarm advocates the purest in life and the most unselfish in purpose of all mankind he was persecuted alive with the utmost rancour of hate and pursued when dead with the vilest shafts of malignity he never even knew in his scattered grave the good he was to do to later groups of thinkers  it was a noble example of course but not you will admit an alluring one for others to follow  be true to yourself say the copybook moralists and you may be sure the result will at last be justified no doubt but in how many centuries and what sort of life will you lead yourself meanwhile for your allotted space of threescore years and ten unless haply hanged or burned or imprisoned before it what the copybook moralists mean is merely thisthat sooner or later your principles will triumph which may or may not be the case according to the nature of the principles but even suppose they do are you to ignore yourself in the interimyou a human being with emotions sensations domestic affections and in the majority of instances wife and children on whom to expend them why should it be calmly taken for granted by the world that if you have some new and true thing to tell humanity which humanity of course will toss back in your face with contumely and violence you are bound to blurt it out with childish unreserve regardless of consequences to yourself and to those who depend upon you why demand of genius or exceptional ability a gratuitous sacrifice which you would deprecate as wrong and unjust to others in the ordinary citizen for the genius too is a man and has his feelings  the fact is society considers that in certain instances it has a right to expect the thinker will martyrise himself on its account while it stands serenely by and heaps faggots on the pile with every mark of contempt and loathing but society is mistaken no man is bound to martyrise himself in a great many cases a man is bound to do the exact opposite he has given hostages to fortune and his first duty is to the hostages we ask you for bread his children may well say and you give us a noble moral lesson we ask you for clothing and you supply us with a beautiful poetical fancy this is not according to bargain wife and children have a first mortgage on a mans activities society has only a right to contingent remainders  a great many sensible men who had truths of deep import to deliver to the world must have recognised these facts in all times and places and must have held their tongues accordingly instead of speaking out the truths that were in them they must have kept their peace or have confined themselves severely to the ordinary platitudes of their age and nation why ruin yourself by announcing what you feel and believe when all the reward you will get for it in the end will be social ostracism if not even the rack the stake or the pillory the shelleys and rousseaus theres no holding of course they will run right into it but the goethesoh no they keep their secret indeed i hold it as probable that the vast majority of men far in advance of their times have always held their tongues consistently save for mere common babble on lord chesterfields principle that wise men never say  the rôle of prophet is thus a thankless and difficult one nor is it quite certainly of real use to the community for the prophet is generally too much ahead of his times he discounts the future at a ruinous rate and he takes the consequences if you happen ever to have read the old testament you must have noticed that the prophets had generally a hard time of it  the leader is a very different stamp of person he stands well abreast of his contemporaries and just half a pace in front of them and he has power to persuade even the inertia of humanity into taking that one halfstep in advance he himself has already made bold to adventure his post is honoured respected remunerated but the prophet gets no thanks and perhaps does mankind no benefit he sees too quick and there can be very little good indeed in so seeing if one of us had been an astronomer and had discovered the laws of kepler newton and laplace in the thirteenth century i think he would have been wise to keep the discovery to himself for a few hundred years or so otherwise he would have been burned for his trouble galileo long after tried part of the experiment a decade or so too soon and got no good by it but in moral and social matters the danger is far graver i would say to every aspiring youth who sees some political or economical or ethical truth quite clearly keep it dark dont mention it nobody will listen to you and you who are probably a person of superior insight and higher moral aims than the mass will only destroy your own influence for good by premature declarations the world will very likely come round of itself to your views in the end but if you tell them too soon you will suffer for it in person and will very likely do nothing to help on the revolution in thought that you contemplate for thought that is too abruptly ahead of the mass never influences humanity  but sometimes the truth will out in spite of one ah yes thats the worst of it do as i say not as i do if possible repress it  it is a noble and beautiful thing to be a martyr especially if you are a martyr in the cause of truth and not as is often the case of some debasing and degrading superstition but nobody has a right to demand of you that you should be a martyr and some people have often a right to demand that you should resolutely refuse the martyrs crown on the ground that you have contracted prior obligations inconsistent with the purely personal luxury of martyrdom tis a luxury for a few it befits only the bachelor the unattached and the economically spareworthy  these be pessimistic pronouncements you say well no not exactly for after all we must never shut our eyes to the actual and in the world as it is meliorism not optimism is the true opposite of pessimism optimist and pessimist are both alike in a sense seeing they are both conservative they sit down contentedthe first with the smug contentment that says alls well i have enough why this fuss about others the second with the contentment of blank despair that says alls hopeless alls wrong why try uselessly to mend it the meliorist attitude on the contrary is rather to say much is wrong much painful what can we do to improve it and from this point of view there is something we can all do to make martyrdom less inevitable in the end for the man who has a thought a discovery an idea to tell us such men are rare and their thought when they produce it is sure to be unpalatable for if it were otherwise it would be thought of our own typefamiliar banal commonplace unoriginal it would encounter no resistance as it thrilled on its way through our brain from established errors what the genius and the prophet are there for is just thatto make us listen to unwelcome truths to compel us to hear to drive awkward facts straight home with sledgehammer force to the unwilling hearts and brains of us not what you want to hear or what i want to hear is good and useful for us but what we dont want to hear what we cant bear to think what we hate to believe what we fight tooth and nail against the man who makes us listen to that is the seer and the prophet he comes upon us like shelley or whitman or ibsen and plumps down horrid truths that half surprise half disgust us he shakes us out of our lethargy to such give ear though they say what shocks you weigh well their hateful ideas avoid the vulgar vice of sneering and carping at them learn to examine their nude thought without shrinking and examine it all the more carefully when it most repels you naked verity is an acquired taste it is never beautiful at first sight to the unaccustomed vision remember that no question is finally settled that no question is wholly above consideration that what you cherish as holiest is most probably wrong and that in social and moral matters especially where men have been longest ruled by pure superstitions new and startling forms of thought have the highest a priori probability in their favour dismiss your idols give every opinion its fair chance of successespecially when it seems to you both wicked and ridiculous recollecting that it is better to let five hundred crude guesses run loose about the world unclad than to crush one fledgling truth in its callow condition to the greeks foolishness to the jews a stumblingblock if you cant be one of the prophets yourself you can at least abstain from helping to stone them  dear me these reflections today are anything but postprandial the gnocchi and the olives must certainly have disagreed with me but perhaps it may some of it be wrote sarcastic i have heard tell there is a thing called irony     ix  the romance of the clash of races   the world has expanded faster in the last thirty years than in any previous age since the spacious days of great elizabeth and with its expansion of course our ideas have widened i believe europe is now in the midst of just such an outburst of thought and invention as that which followed the discovery of america and of the new route to india by the cape of good hope but i dont want to insist too strongly upon that point because i know a great many of my contemporaries are deeply hurt by the base and spiteful suggestion that they and their fellows are really quite as good as any fish that ever came out of the sea before them i only desire now to call attention for a moment to one curious result entailed by this widening of the world upon our literary productivitya result which though obvious enough when one comes to look at it seems to me hitherto to have strangely escaped deliberate notice  in one word the point of which i speak is the comparative cosmopolitanisation of letters and especially the introduction into literary art of the phenomena due to the clash of races  this clash itself is the one picturesque and novel feature of our otherwise somewhat prosaic and machinemade epoch and therefore it has been eagerly seized upon with one accord by all the chief purveyors of recent literature and especially of fiction they have espied in it with technical instinct the best chance for obtaining that fresh interest which is essential to the success of a work of art we were all getting somewhat tired it must be confessed of the old places and the old themes the insipid loves of anthony trollopes blameless young people were beginning to pall upon us the jaded palate of the angloceltic race pined for something hot with a touch of fresh spice in it it demanded curried fowl and jamaica peppers hence on the one hand the sudden vogue of the novelists of the younger countriestolstoi and tourgenieff ibsen and bjornson mary wilkins and howellswho transplanted us at once into fresh scenes new people hence on the other hand the tendency on the part of our own latest writersthe stevensons the hall caines the marion crawfords the rider haggardsto go far afield among the lower races or the later civilisations for the themes of their romances  alas alas i see breakers before me must i pause for a moment in the flowing current of a paragraph to explain as in an aside that i include marion crawford of set purpose among our own late writers while i count mary wilkins and howells as transatlantic aliens experience teaches me that i must else shall i have that annoying animalcule the microscopic critic coming down upon me in print with his petty objection that mr crawford is an american go to oh blind one and whistler also i suppose and sargent and perhaps ashmead bartlett what have you read sarracinesca and not learnt that its author is european to the core twas for such as you that the irishman invented his brilliant retort and if i was born in a stable would i be a horse  not merely however do our younger writers go into strange and novel places for the scenes of their stories the important point to notice in the present connection is that consciously or unconsciously to themselves they have perceived the mighty influence of this clash of races and have chosen the relations of the civilised people with their savage

the question of the peoples naturally envisages itself to his mind in true gallic fashion in the mariage de loti and in madame chrysanthème he sees it through a halo of vague sexual sentimentalism in england it was rider haggard from the cape who first set the mode visibly and nothing is more noteworthy in all his work than the fact that the interest mainly centres in the picturesque juxtaposition

long myself with the interested eye of a dealer engaged in the trade and therefore anxious to keep pace with every changing breath of popular favour and i notice a constant increase from year to year in the number of short stories in magazines and newspapers dealing with the romance of the inferior races i notice also that such stories are increasingly successful with the public this shows that whether the public knows it or not itself the question of race is interesting it more and more it is gradually growing to understand the magnitude of the change that has come over civilisation by the inclusion of asia africa and australasia within its circle even the queen is learning hindustani  there is a famous passage in greens short history of the english people which describes in part that strange outburst of national expansion under elizabeth when raleigh drake and frobisher scoured the distant seas and when at home england became a nest of singing birds with shakespeare spenser

rome of augustus the florence of lorenzo the england of elizabeth dont throw away your birthright by ignoring the fact live up to your privileges gaze around you and know be a conscious partaker in one of the great ages of humanity     x  the monopolist instincts   in the first of these afterdinner causeries i ventured humbly to remark that patriotism was a vulgar vice of which i had never been guilty that innocent indiscretion of mine aroused at the moment some unfavourable comment i confess i was sorry for it but i passed it by at the time lest i should speak too hastily and lose my temper i recur to the subject now at the hour of the cigarette when man can discourse most genially of his bitterest enemy and monopoly is mine its very name is hateful  i dont often say what i think at least not much of it i dont often get the chance and besides being a timid and a modest man im afraid to but just this once im going to try it on object to my opinions as you will but still let me express them strikebut hear me  has it ever occurred to you that one object of reading is to learn things you never thought of before and would never think of now unless you were told them  patriotism is one of the monopolist instincts and the monopolist instincts are the greatest enemies of the social life in humanity they are what we have got in the end to outlive the test of a mans place in the scale of being is how far he has outlived them they are surviving relics of the ape and tiger but we must let the ape and tiger die we must begin to be human  i will take patriotism first because it is the most specious of them all and has still a selfsatisfied way of masquerading as a virtue but after all what is patriotism my country right or wrong and just because it is my country it is nothing more than a wider form of selfishness often enough indeed it is even a narrow one it means my business interests against the business interests of other people and let the taxes of my fellowcitizens pay to support them at other times it is pure jingoism it means my country against other countries my army and navy against other fighters my right to annex unoccupied territory over the equal right of all other people my power to oppress all weaker nationalities all inferior races it never means anything good for if a cause is just like irelands or once italys then tis the good mans duty to espouse it with warmth be it his own or anothers and if a cause be bad then tis the good mans duty to oppose it tooth and nail irrespective of your patriotism true a good man will feel more sensitively anxious that justice should be done by the particular state of which he happens himself to be a member than by any other because he is partly responsible for the corporate action but then people who feel deeply this joint moral responsibility of all the citizens are not praised as patriots but reviled as unpatriotic to urge that our own country should strive with all its might to be better higher purer nobler juster than other countries around itthe only kind of patriotism worth a brass farthing in a righteous mans eyesis accounted by most men both wicked and foolish  patriotism then is the collective or national form of the monopolist instincts and like all those instincts it is a relic of savagery which the man of the future is now engaged in outliving  property is the next form that on the very face of it is a viler and more sordid one for patriotism at least can lay claim to some expansiveness beyond mere individual interest whereas property stops dead short at the narrowest limits it is not us against the world but me against my fellowcitizens it is the final result of the industrial war in its most hideous avatar look how it scars the fair face of our england with its antisocial noticeboards trespassers will be prosecuted it says in effect this is my land god made it but i have acquired it and tabooed it the grass on it grows green but only for me the mountains rise beautiful no foot of man save mine and my gamekeepers shall tread them the waterfalls gleam fresh and cool in the glen avaunt there you nonpossessors you shall never see them all this is my own and i choose to monopolise it  or is it the capitalist i will add field to field he says in despite of his own scripture i will join railway to railway i will juggle into my own hands all the instruments for the production of wealth that i can lay hold of and i will use them for myself against the producer and the consumer i will enrich myself by corners on the necessaries of life i will make food dear for the poor that i myself may roll in needless luxury i will monopolise whatever i can seize and the people may eat straw that temper too humanity must outlive and those who cant outlive it of themselves or be warned in time must be taught by stern lessons that their race has outstripped them  as for slavery tis now gone that was the vilest of them all it was the naked assertion of the monopolist platform you live not for yourself but wholly and solely for me i disregard your life entirely and use you as my chattel it died at last of the moral indignation of humanity it died when a southern court of socalled justice formulated in plain words the underlying principle of its hateful creed a black man has no rights which a white man is bound to respect that finally finished it we no longer allow every man to wallop his own nigger and though the last relics of it die hard in queensland south africa demerara we have at least the satisfaction of knowing that one monopolist instinct out of the group is pretty well bred out of us  except as regards women there it lingers still the man says even now to himselfthis woman is mine if she ventures to have a heart or a will of her own woe betide her i have tabooed her for life let any other man touch her let her look at any other manandknife revolver or law court they shall both of them answer for it there you have in all its natural ugliness another monopolist instinctthe deepestseated of all the vilest the most barbaric she is not yours she is her own unhand her the turk takes his offending slave sews her up in a sack and flings her into the bosphorus the christian englishman drags her shame before an open court and divorces her with contumely her shame i say in the common phrase because though to me it is no shame that any human being should follow the dictates of his or her own heart it is a shame to the woman in the eyes of the world and a life of disgrace she must live thenceforward all this is monopoly and essentially slavery as man lives down the ape and tiger stage he will learn to say rather be mine while you can but the day you cease to feel you can be mine willingly dont disgrace your own body by yielding it up where your soul feels loathing dont consent to be the mother of children by a father you despise or dislike or are tired of let us kiss and part go where you will and my good will go with you till the man can say that with a sincere heart why to borrow a phrase from george meredith he may have passed seraglio point but he hasnt rounded cape turk yet  you find that a hard saying do you you kick against freedom for wife or daughter well yes no doubt you are still a monopolist but believe me the earnest and solemn expression of a profound belief never yet did harm to any one i look forward to the time when women shall be as free in every way as men not by levelling down but by levelling up not as some would have us think by enslaving the men but by elevating emancipating unshackling the women  there is a charming little ditty in louis stevensons childs garden of verse which always seems to me to sum up admirably the monopolist attitude here it is look well at it    when i am grown to mans estate   i shall be very proud and great   and tell the other girls and boys   not to meddle with my toys  that is the way of the monopolist it catches him in the very act he says to all the world hands off my property dont walk on my grass dont trespass in my park beware of my gunboats no trifling with my women i am the king of the castle you meddle with me at your peril  ours not mine is the watchword of the future     xi  mere amateurs   he was a mere amateur but still he did some good work in science  increasingly of late years i have heard these condescending words uttered in the fatherland of bacon of newton of darwin when some bates or spottiswoode has been gathered to his fathers it was not so once time was when all english science was the work of amateursand very well indeed the amateurs did it i dont think anybody who does me the honour to cognise my humble individuality at all will ever be likely to mistake me for a laudator temporis acti on the contrary so far as i can see the past seems generally to have been such a distinct failure all along the line that the one lesson we have to learn from it is to go and do otherwise i am one on that point with shelley and rousseau but it does not follow because most old things are bad that all new things and rising things are necessarily and indisputably in their own nature excellent novelties too may be retrograde and even our greatgrandfathers occasionally blundered upon something good in which we should do well to imitate them the amateurishness of old english science was one of these good things now in course of abolition by the fashionable process of germanisation  dont imagine it was only for france that 1870 was fatal the sad successes of that deadly year sent a wave of triumphant teutonism over the face of europe  i suppose it is natural to man to worship success but ever since 1870 it is certainly the fact that if you wish to gain respect and consideration for any proposed change of system you must say they do it so in germany in education and science this is especially the case pedants always admire pedants and germany having shown herself to be easily first of european states in her pedantmanufacturing machinery all the assembled dominies of all the rest of the world exclaimed with one voice go to let us germanise our educational system  now the german is an excellent workman in his way patient laborious conscientious he has all the highest qualities of the ideal brickmaker he produces the best bricks and you can generally depend upon him to turn out both honest and workmanlike articles but he is not an architect for the architectonic faculty in its highest developments you must come to england and he is not a teacher or expounder for the expository faculty in its purest form the faculty that enables men to flash forth clearly and distinctly before the eyes of others the facts and principles they know and perceive themselves you must go to france oh dear yes we may well be proud of england remember i have already disclaimed more than once in these papers the vulgar error of patriotism but freedom from that narrow vice does not imply inability to recognise the good qualities of ones own race as well as the bad ones and the englishman left to himself and his own native methods used to cut a very respectable figure indeed in the domain of science no other nation has produced a newton or a darwin the englishmans way was to get up an interest in a subject first and then working back from the part of it that specially appealed to his own tastes to make himself master of the entire field of inquiry this natural and thoroughly individualistic english method enabled him to arrive at new results in a way impossible to the pedantically educated germannay even to the lucidly and systematically educated frenchman it was the plan to develop mere amateurs i admit but it was also the plan to develop discoverers and revolutionisers of science for the man most likely to advance knowledge is not the man who knows in an encyclopædic rotework fashion the whole circle of the sciences but the man who takes a fresh interest for its own sake in some particular branch of inquiry  darwin was a mere amateur he worked at things for the love of them so were murchison lyell benjamin franklin herschel so were or are bates herbert spencer alfred russel wallace mere amateurs every man of them  in an evil hour however our pastors and masters in conclave assembled said to one another come now let us teutonise english scientific education and straightway they teutonised it and there began to arise in england a new brood of patent machinemade scientistsexcellent men in their way authorities on the arachnida knowing all about everything that could be taught in the schools but lacking somehow the supreme grace of the old english originality they are firstrate specialists i allow and i dont deny that a civilised country has all need of specialists nay i even admit that the day of the specialist has only just begun he will yet go far he will impose himself and his yoke upon us but dont let us therefore make the grand mistake of concluding that our fine old english birthright in sciencethe birthright that gave us our newtons our cavendishes our darwins our lyellswas all folly and error dont let us spoil ourselves in order to become mere secondhand germans let us recognise the fact that each nation has a work of its own to do in the world and that as star from star so one nation differeth from another in glory let each of us thank the goodness and the grace that on his birth have smiled that he was born of english breed and not a german child  dont you think a military gentleman once said to me the germans are wonderful organisers no i answered i dont but i think theyre excellent drillsergeants  there are people who drop german authorities upon you as if a teutonic name were guarantee enough for anything they say hausberger asserts or according to schimmelpenninck this is pure fetichism believe me your man of science isnt necessarily any the better because he comes to you with the label made in germany the german instinct is the instinct of frederick william of prussiathe instinct of drilling very thorough and efficient men in their way it turns out men versed in all the lore of their chosen subject if they are also men of transcendent ability as often happens they can give us a comprehensive view of their own chosen field such as few englishmen except sir archibald geikie and hes a scot can equal if i wanted to select a learned man for a special government postbritish museum and so forthi dare say i should often be compelled to admit as government often admits that the best man then and there obtainable is the german but if i wanted to train herbert spencers and faradays i would certainly not send them to bonn or to berlin john stuart mill was an english scotchman educated and stuffed by his able father on the german system and how much of spontaneity of vividness of verve we all of us feel john stuart mill lost by it one often wonders to what great to what still greater things that lofty brain might not have attained if only james mill would have given it a chance to develop itself naturally  our english gift is originality our english keynote is individuality let us cling to those precious heirlooms of our celtic ancestry and refuse to be teutonised let us discard the lessons of the potsdam grenadiers let us write on the pediment of our educational temple no german need apply let us disclaim that silly phrase a mere amateur let us return to the simple faith in direct observation that made english science supreme in europe  and may the lord gie us britons a guid conceit o oorsels     xii  a squalid village   strange that the wealthiest class in the wealthiest country in the world should so long have been content to inhabit a squalid village  im not going to compare london as englishmen often do with paris or vienna i wont do two great towns that gross injustice and indeed comparison here is quite out of the question you dont compare oxford with little peddlington or edinburgh with thrums and then ask which is the handsomest things must be alike in kind before you can begin to compare them and london and paris are not alike in kind one is a city and a noble city the other is a village and a squalid village  no i will not even take a humbler standard of comparison and look at london side by side with brussels antwerp munich turin each of those is a city and a fine city in its way but each of them is small still even by their side london is again but a squalid village i insist upon that point because misled by their ancient familiarity with london most englishmen have had their senses and understandings so blunted on this issue that they really dont know what is meant by a town or a fine town when they see one and dont suppose its because london is in britain and these other towns out of it that i make these remarks for bath is a fine town edinburgh is a fine town even glasgow and newcastle are towns while london is still a straggling sprawling invertebrate inchoate overgrown village i am as free i hope from antipatriotic as from patriotic prejudice the high street in oxford milsom street in bath princes street in edinburgh those are all fine streets that would attract attention even in france or germany but the strand piccadilly regent street oxford streetgood lord deliver us  one more caveat as to my meaning when i cite among real towns brussels antwerp and munich i am not thinking of the treasures of art those beautiful places contain that is another and altogether higher question towns supreme in this respect often lag far behind others of less importancelag behind in those external features and that general architectural effectiveness which rightly entitle us to say in a broad sense this is a fine city florence for example contains more treasures of art in a small space than any other town of europe yet florence though undoubtedly a town and even a fine town is not to be compared in this respect i do not say with venice or brussels but even with munich or milan on the other hand london contains far more treasures of art in its way than boston massachusetts but boston is a handsome wellbuilt regular town while londonwell i will spare you the further repetition of the trite truism that london is a squalid village in one word the point i am seeking to bring out here is that a town as a town is handsome or otherwise not in virtue of the works of art or antiquity it contains but in virtue of its groundplan its architecture its external and visible decorations and placesthe louvre the boulevards the champs elysées the place de lopéra  now london has no groundplan it has no street architecture it has no decorations though it has many uglifications it is frankly and simply and ostentatiously hideous and being wholly wanting in a system of any sortin organic parts in idea in views in vistasit is only a village and a painfully uninteresting one  most englishmen see london before they see any other great town they become so familiarised with it that their sense of comparison is dulled and blunted i had the good fortune to have seen many other great towns before i ever saw london and i shall never forget my first sense of surprise at its unmitigated ugliness  get on top of an omnibusi dont say in paris from the palais royal to the arc de triomphe but in brussels from the gare du nord to the palais de justiceand what do you see from end to end one unbroken succession of noble and open prospects im not thinking now of the grande place in the old town with its magnificent collection of mediæval buildings the great fire effectively deprived us of our one sole chance of such an element of beauty in modern london i confine myself on purpose to the parts of brussels which are purely recent and might have been imitated at a distance in london if there had been any public spirit or any public body in england to imitate them but unhappily there was neither recall to mind as you read the strikingly handsome street view that greets you as you emerge from the northern station down the great central boulevards to the gare du midiall built within our own memory then think of the prospects that gradually unfold themselves as you rise on the hill the fine vista north towards sainte marie de schaarbeck the beautiful rue royale bounded by that charming parc the unequalled stretch of the rue de la régence starting from the place royale with godfrey of bouillon and ending with the imposing mass of the palais de justice it is to me a matter for mingled surprise and humiliation that so many englishmen can look year after year at that glorious streetperhaps the finest in the worldand yet never think to themselves mightnt we faintly imitate some small part of this in our wealthy ugly uncompromising london  i always say to americans who come to europe when you go to england dont see our towns but see our country our country is something unequalled in the world while our townswell anyway keep away from london  with the solitary and not very brilliant exception of the embankment there isnt a street in london where one could take a stranger to admire the architecture compare that record with the new boulevards in antwerp where almost every house is worth serious study or with the ring at cologne to keep close home all the time where one can see whole rows of german renaissance houses of extraordinary interest what street in london can be mentioned in this respect side by side with commonwealth avenue or beacon street in boston with euclid avenue in cleveland ohio with the upper end of fifth avenue new york nay even with the new via roma at genoa why is it that we english cant get on the kings road at brighton anything faintly approaching that splendid sea front on the digue at ostend or those coquettish white villas that line the promenade des anglais at nice the blight of london seems to lie over all southern england  paris looks like the capital of a worldwide empire london looks like a shapeless neglected suburb allowed to grow up by accident anyhow and thats just the plain truth of it tis a fortuitous concourse of haphazard houses  but we are improving somewhat the county council is opening out a few new thoroughfares piecemeal oh yes in an illogical unsystematic english patchwork fashion we are driving a badlydesigned unimpressive new street or two with no expansive sense of imperial greatness through the hopelessly congested and most squalid quarters but that is all no grand systematic reconstructive plan no rising to the height of the occasion and the empire you tinker away at a shaftesbury avenue parochial all of it and there you get the real secret of our futile attempts at making a town out of our squalid village the fault lies all at the door of the old corporation and of the people who made and still make the old corporation possible for centuries indeed there was really no london not even a village there was only a scratch collection of contiguous villages the consequence was that here at the centre of national life the english people grew wholly unaccustomed to the bare idea of a town and managed everything piecemeal on the petty scale of a country vestry the vestryman intelligence has now overrun the land and if the london county council ever succeeds at last in making the congeries of villages intoi do not say a city for that is almost past praying for but something analogous to a secondrate continental town it will only be after long lapse of time and violent struggles with the vestryman level of intellect and feeling  london had many great disadvantages to start with she lay in a dull and marshy bottom with no building stone at hand and therefore she was forecondemned by her very position to the curse of brick and stucco when bath oxford edinburgh were all built out of their own quarries then fire destroyed all her mediæval architecture leaving her only westminster abbey to suggest the greatness of her losses but brickearth and fire have been as nothing in their way by the side of the evil wrought by gog and magog when five hundred trembling ghosts of naked lord mayors have to answer for their follies and their sins hereafter i confidently expect the first question in the appalling indictment will be why did you allow the richest nation on earth to house its metropolis in a squalid village  we have a moloch in england to whom we sacrifice much and his hateful name is vested interest     xiii  concerning zeitgeist   a certain story is told about mr ruskin no doubt apocryphal but at any rate characteristic a young lady fresh from the abyss of bayswater met the sage one evening at dinnera gushing young lady as many such there bewho aglow with joy boarded the professor at once with her private artexperiences oh mr ruskin she cried clasping her hands do you know i hadnt been two days in florence before i discovered what you meant when you spoke about the supreme unapproachableness of botticelli indeed ruskin answered well thats very remarkable for it took me myself half a lifetime to discover it  the answer of course was meant to be crushing how should she a brand plucked from the burning of bayswater be able all at once on the very first blush to appreciate botticelli and it took the greatest critic of his age half a lifetime yet i venture to maintain for all that that the young lady was right and that the critic was wrongif such a thing be conceivable i know of course that when we speak of ruskin we must walk delicately like agag but still i repeat it the young lady was right and it was largely the unconscious pervasive action of mr ruskins own personality that enabled her to be so  its all the zeitgeist thats where it is the slow irresistible zeitgeist fifty years ago mens taste had been so warped and distorted by current art and current criticism that they couldnt see botticelli however hard they tried at it he was a sealed book to our fathers in those days it required a brave a vigorous and an original thinker to discover any merit in any painter before raffael except perhaps as goldsmith wisely remarked perugino the man who went then to the uffizi or the pitti after admiring as in duty bound his high renaissance masters found himself suddenly confronted with the judith or the calumny and straightway wondered what manner of strange wild beasts these were that some insane early tuscan had once painted to amuse himself in a lucid interval they were not in the least like the correggios and the guidos the lawrences and the opies that the men of that time had formed their taste upon and accepted as their sole artistic standards to people brought up upon pure david and thorvaldsen the primavera at the belle arti must naturally have seemed like a wild freak of madness the zeitgeist then went all in the direction of cold lifeless correctness the idea that the painters soul counted for something in art was an undreamt of heresy  on your way back from paris some day stop a night at amiens and take the cathedral seriously half the stately interior of that glorious thirteenth century pile is encrusted and overlaid by hideous gewgaw monstrosities of the flashiest bernini and baroque period there they sprawl their obtrusive legs and wave their flaunting theatrical wings to the utter destruction of all repose and consistency in one of the noblest and most perfect buildings of europe nowadays any child any workman can see at a glance how ugly and how disfiguring those floppy creatures are it is impossible to look at them without saying to oneself why dont they clear away all this highfaluting rubbish and let us see the real columns and arches and piers as their makers designed them yet who was it that put them there those unspeakable angels in muslin drapery those flyaway nymphs and graces and seraphim why the best and most skilled artists of their day in europe and whence comes it that the merest child can now see instinctively how out of place they are how disfiguring how incongruous why because the gothic revival has taught us all by degrees to appreciate the beauty and delicacy of a style which to our eighteenth century ancestors was mere barbaric mediævalism has taught us to admire its exquisite purity and to dislike the obstrusive introduction into its midst of incongruous and meretricious berninilike flimsiness  the zeitgeist has changed and we have changed with it  it is just the same with our friend botticelli scarce a dozen years ago it was almost an affectation to pretend you admired him it is no affectation now hundreds of assorted young women from the abyss of bayswater may rise any morning here in sacred florence and stand genuinely enchanted before the adoration of the kings or the venus who floats on her floating shell in a botticellian ocean and why because leighton holman hunt rossetti burnejones madox brown strudwick have led them slowly up to it by golden steps innumerable thirty years ago the art of the early tuscan painters was something to us northerners exotic strange unconnected archæological gradually it has been brought nearer and nearer to us on the walls of the grosvenor and the new gallery till now he that runs may read the ingenuous maiden fished from the abyss of bayswater can drink in at a glance what it took a ruskin many years of his life and much slow development to attain to piecemeal  that is just what all great men are forto make the world accept as a truism in the generation after them what it rejected as a paradox in the generation before them  not of course that there isnt a little of affectation and still more of fashion to the very end in all of it an immense number of people incapable of genuinely admiring anything for its own sake at all are anxious only to be told what they ought to admire dont you know and will straightway proceed as conscientiously as they can to get up an admiration for it a friend of mine told me a beautiful example two aspiring young women of the limplimbed shorthaired æsthetic species were standing rapt before the circular madonna at the uffizi they had gazed at it long and lovingly seeing it bore on its frame the magic name of botticelli of a sudden one of the pair happened to look a little nearer at the accusing label why this is not sandro she cried with a revulsion of disgust this is only aless and straightway they went off from the spot in high dudgeon at having been misled as they supposed into examining the work of another person of the same name  need i point the moral of my apologue in this age of enlightenment by explaining for the benefit of the junior members that the gentlemans full name was really alessandro and that both abbreviations are impartially intended to cover his one and indivisible personality the first half is official like alex the second affectionate and familiar like sandy  still even after making due allowance for such humbugs as these a vast residuum remains of people who if born sixty years ago could never by any possibility have been made to see there was anything admirable in lippi botticelli giotto but who having been born thirty years ago see it without an effort hundreds who read these lines must themselves remember the unmistakable thrill of genuine pleasure with which they first gazed upon the fra angelicos at san marco the memlings at bruges the giottos in the madonna dell arena at padua to many of us those are real epochs in our inner life to the men of fifty years ago the bare avowal itself would have seemed little short of affected silliness  is the change all due to the teaching of the teachers and the preaching of the preachers i think not entirely for after all the teachers and the preachers are but a little ahead of the age they live in they see things earlier they help to lead us up to them but they do not wholly produce the revolutions they inaugurate humanity as a whole develops consistently along certain preestablished and predestined lines sooner or later a certain point must inevitably be reached but some of us reach it sooner and most of us later thats all the difference every great change is mainly due to the fact that we have all already attained a certain point in development a step in advance becomes inevitable after that and one after another we are sure to take it in one word what it needed a man of genius to see dimly thirty years ago it needs a singular fool not to see clearly nowadays     xiv  the decline of marriage   men dont marry nowadays so everybody tells us and i suppose we may therefore conclude by a simple act of inference that women in turn dont marry either it takes two of course to make a quarrelor a marriage  why is this young people nowadays want to begin where their fathers left off men are made so comfortable at present in their clubs collegebred girls have no taste for housekeeping rents are so high and manners so luxurious good heavens what silly trash what puerile nonsense are we all little boys and girls i ask you that we are to put one another off with such transparent humbug here we have to deal with a primitive instinctthe profoundest and deepestseated instinct of humanity save only the instincts of food and drink and of selfpreservation man like all other animals has two main functions to feed his own organism and to reproduce his species ancestral habit leads him when mature to choose himself a matebecause he loves her it drives him it urges him it goads him irresistibly if this profound impulse is really lacking today in any large part of our race there must be some correspondingly profound and adequate reason for it dont let us deceive ourselves with shallow platitudes which may do for drawingrooms this is philosophy even though postprandial let us try to take a philosophic view of the question at issue from the point of vantage of a biological outlook  before you begin to investigate the causes of a phenomenon quelconque tis well to decide whether the phenomenon itself is there to investigate  taking society throughoutnot in the sense of those forty families to which the term is restricted by lady charles beresfordi doubt whether marriage is much out of fashion statistics show a certain decrease it is true but not an alarming one among the labouring classes i imagine men and also women still wed pretty frequently when people say young men wont marry nowadays they mean young men in a particular stratum of society roughly bounded by a silk hat on sundays now when you and i were young i take it for granted that you and i are approaching the fifties young men did marry even within this restricted area twas their wholesome way in life to form an attachment early with some nice girl in their own set and to start at least with the idea of marrying her toward that goal they worked for that end they endured and sacrificed many things true even then the long engagement was the rule but the long engagement itself meant some persistent impulse some strong impetus marriagewards the desire of the man to make this woman his own the longing to make this woman happynormal and healthy endowments of our racehad still much drivingpower nowadays i seriously think i observe in most young men of the middle class around me a distinct and disastrous weakening of the impulse they dont fall in love as frankly as honestly as irretrievably as they used to do they shillyshally they pick and choose they discuss they criticise they say themselves these futile foolish things about the club and the flat and the cost of living they believe in malthus fancy a young man who believes in malthus they seem in no hurry at all to get married but thirty or forty years ago young men used to rush by blind instinct into the toils of matrimonybecause they couldnt help themselves such laodicean lukewarmness betokens in the class which exhibits it a weakening of impulse that weakening of impulse is really the thing we have to account for  young men of a certain type dont marry becausethey are less of young men than formerly  wild animals in confinement seldom propagate their kind only a few caged birds will continue their species whatever upsets the balance of the organism in an individual or a race tends first of all to affect the rate of reproduction civilise the red man and he begins to decrease at once in numbers turn the sandwich islands into a trading community and the native hawaiian refuses forthwith to give hostages to fortune tahiti is dwindling from the moment the tasmanians were taken to norfolk island not a single tasmanian baby was born the jesuits made a model community of paraguay but they altered the habits of the paraguayans so fast that the reverend fathers who were of course themselves celibates were compelled to take strenuous and even grotesque measures to prevent the complete and immediate extinction of their converts other cases in abundance i might quote an i would but i limit myself to these they suffice to exhibit the general principle involved any grave upset in the conditions of life affects first and at once the fertility of a species  but colonists often increase with rapidity ay marry do they where the conditions of life are easy at the present day most colonists go to fairly civilised regions they are transported to their new home by steamboat and railway they find for the most part more abundant provender and more wholesome surroundings than in their native country there is no real upset better food and easier life as herbert spencer has shown result other things equal in increased fertility his chapters on this subject in the principles of biology should be read by everybody who pretends to talk on questions of population but in new and difficult colonies the increase is slight whatever compels greater wear and tear of the nervous system proves inimical to the reproductive function the strain and stress of coordination with novel circumstances and novel relations affect most injuriously the organic balance the african negro has long been accustomed to agricultural toil and to certain simple arts in his own country transported to the west indies and the united states he found life no harder than of old if not indeed easier he had abundant food protection security a kind of labour for which he was well adapted instead of dying out therefore he was fruitful and multiplied and replenished the earth amazingly but the red indian caught blatant in the hunting stage refused to be tamed and could not swallow civilisation he pined and dwined and decreased in his reservations the change was too great too abrupt too brusque for him the papoose before long became an extinct animal  is not the same thing true of the middle class of england civilisation and its works have come too quickly upon us the strain and stress of correlating and coordinating the world we live in are getting too much for us railways telegraphs the penny post the special edition have played havoc at last with our nervous systems we are always on the stretch rushing and tearing perpetually we bolt our breakfasts we catch the train or bus by the skin of our teeth to rattle us into the city we run down to scotland or over to paris on business we lunch in london and dine in glasgow belfast or calcutta excuse imagination the tape clicks perpetually in our ears the last quotation in eries the telephone rings us up at inconvenient moments something is always happening somewhere to disturb our equanimity we tear open the times with feverish haste to learn that kimberleys or jabez balfour have fallen that matabeleland has been painted red that shares have gone up or gone down or evaporated life is one turmoil of excitement and bustle financially tis a series of dissolving views personally tis a rush socially tis a mosaic of deftlyfitted engagements drop out one piece and you can never replace it you are full next week from monday to saturdaybusiness all day what calls itself pleasure save the mark all evening poor old leisure is dead we hurry and scurry and flurry eternally one whirl of work from morning till night then dress and dine one whirl of excitement from night till morning a snap of troubled sleep and again da capo not an hour not a minute we can call our own a wire from a patient ill abed in warwickshire a wire from a client hard hit in hansards endless editors asking for more copy more copy alter to suit your own particular trade and tis the life of all of us  the first generation after stephenson and the rocket pulled through with it somehow they inherited the sound constitutions of the men who sat on rustic seats in the gardens of the twenties the second generationthats you and mefelt the strain of it more severely new machines had come in to make life still more complicated sixpenny telegrams bell and edison submarine cables evening papers perturbations pouring in from all sides incessantly the suburbs growing the hubbub increasing metropolitan railways trams bicycles innumerable but natheless we still endured and presented the world all the same with a third generation that third generationah me there comes the pity of it one fancies the impulse to marry and rear a family has wholly died out of it it seems to have died out most in the class where the strain and stress are greatest i dont think young men of that class today have the same feelings towards women of their sort as formerly nobody i trust will mistake me for a reactionary in most ways the modern young man is a vast improvement on you and me at twentyfive but i believe there is really among young men in towns less chivalry less devotion less romance than there used to be that i take it is the true reason why young men dont marry with certain classes and in certain places a primitive instinct of our race has weakened they say this weakening is accompanied in towns by an increase in sundry hateful and degrading vices i dont know if that is so but at least one would expect it any enfeeblement of the normal and natural instinct of virility would show itself first in morbid aberrations on that i say nothing i only say thisthat i think the present crisis in the english marriage market is due not to clubs or the comfort of bachelor quarters but to the cumulative effect of nervous overexcitement     xv  eye versus ear   it is admitted on all hands by this time i suppose that the best way of learning is by eye not by ear therefore the authorities that prescribe for us our education among all classes have decided that we shall learn by ear not by eye which is just what one might expect from a vested interest  of course this superiority of sight over hearing is preeminently true of natural sciencethat is to say of ninetenths among the subjects worth learning by humanity the only real way to learn geology for example is not to mug it up in a printed textbook but to go into the field with a geologists hammer the only real way to learn zoology and botany is not by reading a volume of natural history but by collecting dissecting observing preserving and comparing specimens therefore of course natural science has never been a favourite study in the eyes of schoolmasters who prefer those subjects which can be taught in a room to a row of boys on a bench and who care a great deal less than nothing for any subject which isnt good to examine in educational value and importance in after life have been sacrificed to the teachers ease and convenience or to the readiness with which the pupils progress can be tested on paper not what is best to learn but what is least trouble to teach in great squads to boys forms the staple of our modern english education they call it education i observe in the papers and i suppose we must fall in with that whim of the profession  but even the subjects which belong by rights to the ear can nevertheless be taught by the eye more readily everybody knows how much easier it is to get up the history and geography of a country when you are actually in it than when you are merely reading about it it lives and moves before you the places the persons the monuments the events all become real to you each illustrates each and each tends to impress the other on the memory sight burns them into the brain without conscious effort you can learn more of egypt and of egyptian history culture hieroglyphics and language in a few short weeks at luxor or sakkarah than in a year at the louvre and the british museum the tombs of the kings are worth many papyri the mere sight of the temples and obelisks and monuments and inscriptions in the places where their makers originally erected them gives a sense of reality and interest to them all that no amount of study under alien conditions can possibly equal we have all of us felt that the only place to observe flemish art to the greatest advantage is at ghent and bruges and brussels and antwerp just as the only place to learn florentine art as it really was is at the uffizi and the bargello  these things being so the authorities who have charge of our public education primary secondary and tertiary have decided in their wisdomto do and compel the exact contrary objectlessons and the visible being admittedly preferable to rotelessons and the audible they have prescribed that our education so called shall be mainly an education not in things and properties but in books and reading they have settled that it shall deal almost entirely and exclusively with language and with languages that words not objects shall be the facts it impresses on the minds of the pupils in our primary schools they have insisted upon nothing but reading and writing with just a smattering of arithmetic by way of science in our secondary schools they have insisted upon nothing but greek and latin with about an equal leaven of algebra and geometry this mediæval fare i am delighted that i can thus agree for once with professor ray lankester they have thrust down the throats of all the world indiscriminately so much so that nowadays people seem hardly able at last to conceive of any other than a linguistic education as possible you will hear many good folk who talk with contempt of greek and latin but when you come to inquire what new mental pabulum they would substitute for those quaint and grotesque survivals of the dark ages you find what they want instead ismodern languages the idea that language of any sort forms no necessary element in a liberal education has never even occurred to them they take it for granted that when you leave off feeding boys on straw and oats you must supply them instead with hay and sawdust  not that i rage against greek and latin as such it is well we should have many specialists among us who understand them just as it is well we should have specialists in anglosaxon and sanskrit i merely mean that they are not the sum and substance of educational method they are at best but two languages of considerable importance to the student of purely human evolution  furthermore even these comparatively useless linguistic subjects could themselves be taught far better by sight than by hearing a week at rome would give your average boy a much clearer idea of the relations of the capitol with the palatine than all the pretty maps in dr william smiths smaller classical dictionary it would give him also a sense of the reality of the latin language and the latin literature which he could never pick up out of a dogeared livy or a thumbmarked Æneid you have only to look across from the top of the janiculum towards the white houses of frascati to learn a vast deal more about the alban hills and the site of tusculum than ever you could mug up from all the geography books in the british museum the way to learn every subject on earth even booklore included is not out of books alone but by actual observation  and yet it is impossible for any one among us to do otherwise than acquiesce in this vicious circle why just because no man can dissociate himself outright from the social organism of which he forms a component member he can no more do so than the eye can dissociate itself from the heart and lungs or than the legs can shake themselves free from the head and stomach we have all to learn and to let our boys learn what authority decides for us we cant give them a better education than the average even if we know what it is and desire to impart it because the better education though abstractly more valuable is now and here the inlet to nothing every door is barred with examinations and opens but to the golden key of the crammer not what is of most real use and importance in life but what pays best in examination is the test of desirability we are the victims of a system and our only hope of redress is not by sporadic individual action but by concerted rebellion we must cry out against the abuse till at last we are heard by dint of our much speaking in a world so complex and so highly organised as ours the individual can only do anything in the long run by influencing the massby securing the cooperation of many among his fellows  meanwhile i believe it is gradually becoming the fact that our girls who till lately were so very illtaught are beginning to know more of what is really worth knowing than their publicschoolbred brothers for the public school still goes on with the system of teaching it has derived direct from the thirteenth century while the girls schools having started fair and fresh are beginning to assimilate certain newer ideas belonging to the seventeenth and even the eighteenth in time they may conceivably come down to the more elementary notions of the present generation less hampered by professions and examinations than the boys the girls are beginning to know something now not indeed of the universe in which they live its laws and its properties but of literature and history and the principal facts about human development yet all the time the boys go on as ever with musa musæ like so many parrots and are turned out at last in nine cases out of ten with just enough smattering of greek and latin grammar to have acquired a lifelong distaste for horace and an inconquerable incapacity for understanding Æschylus one year in italy with their eyes open would be worth more than three at oxford and six months in the fields with a platyscopic lens would teach them strange things about the world around them that all the long terms at harrow and winchester have failed to discover to them but that would involve some trouble to the teacher  what a misfortune it is that we should thus be compelled to let our boys schooling interfere with their education     xvi  the political pupa   i have picked up on the moor the chrysalis of a common english butterfly as i sit on the heather and turn it over attentively while it wriggles in my hands i cant help thinking how closely it resembles the present condition of our british commonwealth it is a platitude indeed to say that this is an age of transition but it would be truer and more graphic perhaps to put it that this is an age in which england and for the matter of that every other european country as well is passing through something like the chrysalis stage in its evolution  but first of all do you clearly understand what a chrysalis is driving at it means more than it seems the change that goes on within that impassive case is a great deal more profound than most people imagine when the caterpillar is just ready to turn into a butterfly it lies by for a while full of internal commotion and feels all its organs slowly melting one by one into a sort of indistinguishable protoplasmic pulp chaos precedes the definite reestablishment of a fresh form of order limbs and parts and nervous system all disappear for a time and then gradually grow up again in new and altered types the caterpillar if it philosophised on its own state at all which seems to be very little the habit of wellconducted caterpillars as of wellconducted young ladies might easily be excused for forming just at first the melancholy impression that a general dissolution was coming over it piecemeal it must begin by feeling legs and eyes and nervous centres melt away by degrees into a common indistinguishable organic pulp out of which the new organs only slowly form themselves in obedience to the law of some internal impulse but when the process is all over andhi prestothe butterfly emerges at last from the chrysalis condition what does it find but that instead of having lost everything it has new and stronger legs in place of the old and feeble ones it has nerves and brain more developed than before it has wings for flight instead of mere creeping little feet to crawl with what seemed like chaos was really nothing more than the necessary kneading up of all component parts into a plastic condition which precedes every fresh departure in evolution the old must fade before the new can replace it  now i am not going to work this perhaps somewhat fanciful analogy to death or pretend it is anything more than a convenient metaphor still taken as such it is not without its luminosity for a metaphor by supplying us with a picturable representation often enables us really to get at the hang of the thing a vast deal better than the most solemn argument and i fancy communities sometimes pass through just such a chrysalis stage when it seems to the timid and pessimistic in their midst as if every component element of the state but especially the one in which they themselves and their friends are particularly interested were rushing violently down a steep place to eternal perdition chaos appears to be swallowing up everything the natural relations of classes disappear faiths melt churches dissolve morals fade bonds fail a universal magma of emancipated opinion seems to take the place of oldestablished dogma the squires and the parsons of the periodcall them scribes or augurswring their hands in despair and cry aloud that they dont know what the world is coming to but after all it is only the chrysalis stage of a new system the old social order must grow disjointed and chaotic before the new social order can begin to evolve from it the establishment of a plastic consistency in the mass is the condition precedent of the higher development  not of course that this consideration will ever afford one grain of comfort to the squires and the parsons of each successive epoch for what they want is not the reasonable betterment of the whole social organism but the continuance of just this particular type of squiredom and parsonry that is what they mean by national welfare and any interference with it they criticise in all ages with the current equivalent for the familiar tory formula that the country is going to the devil  sometimes these great social reconstructions of which i speak are forced upon communities by external factors interfering with their fixed internal order as happened when the influx of northern barbarians broke up the decaying and rotten organism of the roman empire sometimes again they occur from internal causes in an acute and so to speak inflammatory condition as at the french revolution but sometimes as in our own time and country they are slowly brought about by organic development so as really to resemble in all essential points the chrysalis type of evolution politically socially theologically ethically the old fixed beliefs seem at such periods to grow fluid or plastic new feelings and habits and aspirations take their place for a while a general chaos of conflicting opinions and nascent ideas is produced the mass for the moment seems formless and lawless then new order supervenes as the magma settles down and begins to crystallise till at last im afraid the resulting social organism becomes for the most part just as rigid just as definite just as dogmatic just as exacting as the one it has superseded the caterpillar has grown into a particular butterfly  through just such a period of reconstruction europe in general and britain in particular are now in all likelihood beginning to pass and they will come out at the other end translated and transfigured laws and faiths and morals will all of them have altered there will be a new heaven and a new earth for the men and women of the new epoch strange that people should make such a fuss about a detail like home rule when the foundations of society are all becoming fluid dont flatter yourself for a moment that your particular little sect or your particular little dogma is going to survive the gentle cataclysm any more than my particular little sect or my particular little dogma all alike are doomed to inevitable reconstruction we cant put the constitution into the meltingpot said mr john morley if i recollect his words aright but at the very moment when he said it in my humble opinion the constitution was already well into the meltingpot and even beginning to simmer merrily federalism or something extremely like it may with great probability be the final outcome of that particular melting though anything else is perhaps just as probable and in any case the melting is general not special the one thing we can guess with tolerable certainty is that the meltingpot stage has begun to overtake us socially ethically politically ecclesiastically and that what will emerge from the pot at the end of it must depend at last upon the relative strength of those unknown quantitiesthe various formative elements  being the most optimistic of pessimists however i will venture after this disclaimer of prophecy to prophesy one thing alone twill be a butterfly not a grub that comes out of our chrysalis  beyond that i hold all prediction premature we may guess and we may hope but we can have no certainty save only the certainty that no element will outlive the revolution unchangednot faiths nor classes nor domestic relations nor any other component factor of our complex civilisation all are becoming plastic in the organic plasm all are losing features in the common mass of the meltingpot for that reason i never trouble my head for a moment when people object to me that this that or the other petty point of detail in bellamys utopia or william morriss utopia or my own little private and particular utopia is impossible or unrealisable or wicked or hateful for these after all are mere utopias their details are the outcome of individual wishes what will emerge must be not a utopia at all either yours or mine but a practical reality full of shifts and compromises most unphilosophical and illogicala practical reality distasteful in many ways to all us utopiamongers the millennium by return of post is no more realisable today than yesterday the greatest of revolutions can only produce that unsatisfactory result a new human organisation  yet it is something after all to believe at least that the grub will emerge into a fullfledged butterfly not perhaps quite as glossy in the wings as we could wish but a butterfly all the same not a crawling caterpillar     xvii  on the casino terrace   i have always regarded monte carlo as an influence for good it helps to keep so many young men off the stock exchange  let me guard against an obvious but unjust suspicion these remarks are not uttered under the exhilarating effect of winning at the tables quite the contrary it is the bank that has broken the man today at monte carlo they are rather due to the chastening and thoughtcompelling influence of persistent loss not altogether unbalanced by a wellcooked lunch at perhaps the best restaurant in any town of europe i have lost my little pile the eight fivefranc pieces which i annually devote out of my scanty store to the tutelary god of roulette have been snapped up one after another in breathless haste by the sphinxlike croupiers impassive priests of that rapacious deity and now i am sitting cleaned out by the edge of the terrace on a brilliant cloudless february afternoon looking across the zoned and belted bay towards the beautiful grey hills of roccabruna and the gleaming white spit of bordighera in the distance tis a modest tribute my poor little forty francs surely the veriest puritan the oiliest chadband of them all will allow a humble scribbler at so cheap a yearly rate to purchase wisdom not unmixed with tolerance at the gilded shrine of fors fortuna  for what a pother after all the unwise of this world are wont to make about one stranded gamblinghouse in a remote corner of liguria if they were in earnest or sincere how small a matter they would think it of course when i say so hypocrisy holds up its hands in holy horror but that is the way with the purveyors of mint cumin and anise they raise a mighty hubbub over some unimportant detailin order to feel their consciences clear when business compels them to rob the widow and the orphan in reality though monte carlo is bad enough in its waydo i not pay it unwilling tribute myself twice a year out of the narrow resources of the garret grub streetit is but a skindeep surface symptom of a profound disease which attacks the heart and core in london and paris compared with panama argentines british south africans and liberators monte carlo is a mole on the left ankle  the devils advocate you say well well so be it the fact is the supposed moral objection to gambling as such is a purely commercial objection of a commercial nation and the reason so much importance is attached to it in certain places is because at that particular vice men are likely to lose their money it is largely a fetish like the sinfulness of cards of dice of billiards moreover the objection is only to the kind of gambling there is another kind less open at which you stand a better chance to win yourself while other parties stand a better chance to lose and that kind which is played in great gamblinghouses known as the stock exchange and the bourse is considered morally speaking as quite innocuous large fortunes are made at this other sort of gambling which of course sanctifies and almost canonises it indeed if you will note you will find not only that the objection to gambling pure and simple is commonest in the most commercial countries but also that even there it is commonest among the most commercial classes the landed aristocracy the military and the labouring men have no objection to betting nor have the neapolitan lazzaroni the chinese coolies it is the respectable english countinghouse that discourages the vice especially among the clerks who are likely to make the till or the chequebook rectify the little failures of their flutter on the derby  observe how artificial is the whole mild outcry how absolutely it partakes of the nature of damning the sins you have no mind to here on the terrace where i sit and where ladies in needlessly costly robes are promenading up and down to exhibit their superfluous wealth ostentatiously to one another my ear is continuously assailed by the constant ping ping ping of the pigeonshooting and my peace disturbed by the flapping deathagonies of those miserable victims yet how many times have you heard the tables at monte carlo denounced to once or never that you have heard a word said of the poor mangled pigeons and why because nobody loses much money at pigeonmatches that is legitimate sport about as good and as bad as pheasant or partridge shootingno better no worse in spite of artificial distinctions and nobody except the pigeons has any interest in denouncing it legend has it at monte carlo indeed that when the proprietors of the casino wished to take measures pour attirer les anglais they held counsel with the wise men whether it was best to establish and endow an english church or a pigeonshooting tournament and the church was in a minority since then i have heard more than one anglican bishop speak evil of the tables but i have never heard one of them say a good word yet for the boxed and slaughtered pigeons  let me take a more striking because a less hackneyed caseone that still fewer people would think of everybody who visits monte carlo gets there of course by the plm if you know this coast at all you will know that plm is the curt and universal abbreviation for the paris lyon méditerranée railway companyin all probability the most gigantic and wickedest monopoly on the face of this planet yet you never once heard a voice raised yet against the company as a company individual complaints get into the times of course about the crowding of the train de luxe the breach of faith as to places and the discomforts of the journey but never a glimmering conception seems to flit across the popular mind that here is a colossal wrong compared to which monte carlo is but as a fleabite to the asiatic cholera this chartered abuse connects the three biggest towns in franceparis lyon marseillesand is absolutely without competitors it can do as it likes and it does it regardlessi say regardless without qualification because the plm regards nobody and nothing yet one hears of no righteous indignation no uprising of the people in their angry thousands no moral recognition of the monopoly as a wicked thing to be fought tooth and nail without quarter given it probably causes a greater aggregate of human misery in a week than monte carlo in a century besides the one is compulsory the other optional you neednt risk a louis on the tables unless you choose but like it or lump it if youre bound for nice or cannes or mentone you must open your mouth and shut your eyes and see what plm will send you our own railways indeed are by no means free from blame at the hands of the democracy the southeastern has not earned the eternal gratitude of its seasonticket holders the children of the great western do not rise up and call it blessed except indeed in the most uncomplimentary sense of blessing but the plm goes much further than these and i have always held that the one solid argument for eternal punishment consists in the improbability that its board of directors will be permitted to go scotfree for ever after all their iniquities  i am not wholly joking i mean the best part of it great monopolies that abuse their trust are far more dangerous enemies of public morals than an honest gamblinghouse at every corner monte carlo as it stands is just a concentrated embodiment of all the evils of our antisocial system and the tables are by far the least serious among them it is an influence for good because it mirrors our own world in all its naked all its overdraped hideousness there it rears its meretricious head that gaudy palace of sin appropriately decked in its haussmanesque architecture and its coquettish gardens attracting to itself all the idle all the vicious all the rich all the unworthy from every corner of europe and america but monte carlo didnt make them it only gathers to its bosom its own chosen children from the places where they are producedfrom london paris brussels new york berlin st petersburg the vices of our organisation begot these overrich folk begot their diamonddecked women and their clipped french poodles with gold bangles spanning their aristocratic legs these are the spawn of landowning of capitalism of military domination of high finance of all the social ills that flesh is heir to i feel as i pace the terrace in the broad mediterranean sunshine that i am here in the midst of the very best society europe affords that is to say the very worst the dukes and the moneylenders the jay goulds and the reinachs the idlest the cruellest the hereditary drones the successful bloodsuckers but to find fault with them only for trying to win one anothers illgotten gold at a fair and open game of trenteetquarante with the odds against them and then to say nothing about the way they came by it is to make a needless fuss about a trifle of detail while overlooking the weightiest moral problems of humanity  whoever allows red herrings like these to be trailed across the path of his moral consciousness to the detriment of the scent which should lead him straight on to the lairs of gigantic evils deserves little credit either for conscience or sagacity my son be wise strike at the root of the evil let monte carlo go but keep a stern eye on london groundrents     xviii  the celtic fringe   we celts henceforth will rule the roost in britain  what is that you mutter a very inopportune moment to proclaim the fact well no i dont think so and im sorry to hear you say it for if there is a quality on which i plume myself its the delicate tact that makes me refrain from irritating the susceptibilities of the sensitive saxon see how polite i am to him i call him sensitive but opportune or inopportune lord salisbury says we are a celtic fringe i beg to retort we are the british people  conquered races say my friends well grant it for a moment but in civilised societies conquerors have sooner or later to amalgamate with the conquered and where the vanquished are more numerous they absorb the victors instead of being absorbed by them that is the nemesis of conquest rome annexed etruria and etruscan mæcenas etruscan sejanus organised and consolidated the roman empire rome annexed italy and the jus italicum grew at last to be the full roman franchise rome annexed the civilised world and the provinces under cæsar blotted out the senate britain is passing now through the selfsame stage one inevitable result of the widening of the electorate has been the transfer of power from the teutonic to the celtic half of britain i repeat we are no longer a celtic fringe at the polls in parliament we are the british people lord salisbury may fail to perceive that fact or as i hold more probable may affect to ignore it what will such tactics avail the ostrich is not usually counted among men as a perfect model of political wisdom  and are we after all the conquered peoples meseems i doubt it they say we celts dearly love a paradoxwhich is perhaps only the sensible saxon way of envisaging the fact that we catch at new truths somewhat quicker than other people at any rate tis a pet little paradox of my own that we have never been conquered and that to our unconquered state we owe in the main our radicalism our socialism our ingrained love of political freedom we are tribal not feudal we think the folk more important than his lordship the saxon of the southeast is the conquered man he has felt on his neck for generations the heel of feudalism he is slavish he is snobbish he dearly loves a lord he shouts himself hoarse for his beaconsfield or his salisbury till lately in his rural avatar he sang but one song    god bless the squire and his relations   and keep us in our proper stations  trite isnt it but so is the saxon intelligence  seriouslyfor at times it is well to be serioussoutheastern england the england of the plains has been conquered and enslaved in a dozen ages by each fresh invader before the dawn of history heaven knows what shadowy belgæ and iceni enslaved it but historical time will serve our purpose the roman enslaved it but left caledonia and hibernia free the cambrian the silurian the cornishman halfsubjugated the saxon and anglian enslaved the east but scarcely crossed over the watershed of the western ocean the dane in turn enslaved the saxon in east anglia and yorkshire the norman ground all down to a common servitude between the upper and nether millstones of the feudal systemthe king and the nobleman at the end of it all teutonic england was reduced to a patient condition of contented serfdom it had accommodated itself to its environment no wish was left in it for the assertion of its freedom to this day the southeast save where leavened and permeated by celtic influences hugs its chains and loves them it produces the strange portent of the conservative workingman who yearns to be led by lord randolph churchill  with the north and the west things go wholly otherwise even cornwall the earliest celtic kingdom to be absorbed was rather absorbed than conquered i wont go into the history of the west welsh of somerset devon and cornwall at full length because it would take ten pages to explain it and i know that readers are too profoundly interested in the shocking murder in the borough road to devote halfanhour to the origin and evolution of their own community it must suffice to say that the devonian and cornubian welsh coalesced with the west saxon for resistance to their common enemy the dane and that the west saxon kingdom was made supreme in britain by the founder of the english monarchyone dunstan a monk from the west welsh abbey of glastonbury wales proper overrun piecemeal by norman filibusterers was roughly annexed by the plantagenet kings but it was only pacified under the welsh tudors and was never at any time thoroughly feudalised glendowers rebellion richmonds rebellion the wesleyan revolt the rebecca riots the tithe war are all continuous parts of the ceaseless reaction of gallant little wales against teutonic aggression an alien church still disturbs the principality the lake district and ayrshireceltic cumbria and strathclydeonly accepted by degrees the supremacy of the kings of england and scotland the brother of a scotch king was prince of cumbria as the elder son of an english king was prince of wales indeed david of cumbria who became david i of scotland was the real consolidator of the scotch kingdom cumbria was no more conquered by the saxon lothians than scotland was conquered by the accession of james i or by the act of union that means absorption conciliation a certain degree of tribal independence for ireland we know that the mere irish were never subjugated at all till the days of henry vii that they had to be reconquered by cromwell and by william of orange that they rebelled more or less throughout the eighteenth century and that they have been thorns in the side of tory england through the whole of the nineteenth as for the highlands they held out against the stuarts till england had rejected that impossible dynasty and then they rallied round the stuarts as the enemies of the saxon general wades roads and the forts in the great glen aided by a few trifles of glencoe massacres kept them quiet for a moment but it was only for a moment the north is once more in open revolt dr clark and the crofters are its mode of expressing itself  nor is that all the celtic ideas have remained unaltered of course i am not silly enough to believe there is any such thing as a celtic race i use the word merely as a convenient label for the league of the unconquered peoples in britain ireland alone contains halfadozen races and none of them appear to have anything in common with the pict of aberdeenshire or the westwelsh of cornwall all i mean when i speak of celtic ideas and celtic ideals is the ideas and ideals proper and common to unconquered races as compared with the feudalised and contented serf of southeastern england are not the irish peasant the scotch clansman the statesman of the dales the cornish miner free men every soul of them english landlordism imposed from without upon the crofter of skye or the rackrented tenant of a connemara hillside has never crushed out the native feeling of a right to the soil the native resistance to an alien system the southeast i assert has been brutalised into acquiescent serfdom by a long course of feudalism the west and north still retain the instincts of freemen  as long as southeastern england and the normanised or feudalised saxon lowlands of scotland contained all the wealth all the power and most of the population of britain the celtic ideals had no chance of realising themselves but the industrial revolution of the present century has turned us rightaboutface has transferred the balance of power from the secondary strata to the primary strata in britain from the agricultural lowlands to the uplands of coal and iron the cotton factories the woollen trade great industrial cities have grown up in the celtic or semiceltic areaglasgow liverpool manchester leeds bradford sheffield belfast aberdeen cardiff the celtthat is to say the mountaineer and the man of the untouched countryreproduces his kind much more rapidly than the teuton the highlander and the irishman swarm into glasgow the irishman and the welshman swarm into liverpool the westcountryman into bristol celts of all types into london southampton newport birmingham sheffield this eastward returnwave of celts upon the teuton has leavened the whole mass if you look at the leaders of radicalism in england you will find they bear almost without exception true celtic surnames chartists and socialists of the first generation were marshalled by men of cymric descent like ernest jones and robert owen or by pureblooded irishmen like fergus oconnor it is not a mere accident that the london socialists of the present day should be led by welshmen like william morris or by the eloquent brogue of bernard shaws audacious oratory we celts now lurk in every corner of britain we have permeated it with our ideas we have inspired it with our aspirations we have roused the celtic remnant in the southeast itself to a sense of their wrongs and we are marching today all abreast to the overthrow of feudalism if lord salisbury thinks we are a celtic fringe he is vastly mistaken but he doesnt really think so tis a piece of his ponderous saxon humour talk of batavian grace indeed well the cecils came first from the fens of lincolnshire     xix  imagination and radicals   conservatism i believe is mainly due to want of imagination  in saying this i do not for a moment mean to deny the other and equally obvious truth that conservatism in the lump is a euphemism for selfishness but the two ideas have much in common selfish people are apt to be unimaginative unimaginative people are apt to be selfish clearly to realise the condition of the unfortunate is the beginning of philanthropy clearly to realise the rights of others is the beginning of justice put yourself in his place strikes the keynote of ethics stupid people can only see their own side of a question they cannot even imagine any other side possible so as a rule stupid people are conservative they cling to what they have they dread revision redistribution justice also if a man has imagination he is likely to be radical even though selfish while if he has no imagination he is likely to be conservative even though otherwise good and kindhearted some men are conservative from defects of heart while some are conservative from defects of head conversely most imaginative people are radical for even a bad man may sometimes uphold the side of right because he has intelligence enough to understand that things might be better managed in the future for all than they are in the present  but when i say that conservatism is mainly due to want of imagination i mean more than that most people are wholly unable to conceive in their own minds any state of things very different from the one they have been born and brought up in the picturing power is lacking they can conceive the past it is true more or less vaguelybecause they have always heard things once were so and because the past is generally realisable still by the light of the relics it has bequeathed to the present but they cant at all conceive the future imagination fails them innumerable difficulties crop up for them in the way of every proposed improvement before there was any county council for london such people thought municipal government for the metropolis an insoluble problem now that home rule quivers trembling in the balance they think it would pass the wit of man to devise in the future a federal league for the component elements of the united kingdom in spite of the fact that the wit of man has already devised one for the states of the union for the provinces of the dominion for the component cantons of the swiss republic to the unimaginative mind difficulties everywhere seem almost insuperable it shrinks before trifles impossible said napoleon there is no such word in my dictionary he had been trained in the school of the french revolutionwhich was not carried out by unimaginative pettifoggers  to people without imagination any change you propose seems at once impracticable they are ready to bring up endless objections to the mode of working it there would be this difficulty in the way and that difficulty and the other one you would think to hear them talk the world as it stands was absolutely perfect and moved without a hitch in all its bearings they dont see that every existing institution just bristles with difficultiesand that the difficulties are met or got over somehow often enough while they swallow the camel of existing abuses they strain at some gnat which they fancy they see flying in at the window of utopia or of the millennium if your reform were carried they say in effect we should doubtless get rid of such and such flagrant evils but the streets in november would be just as muddy as ever and slight inconvenience might be caused in certain improbable contingencies to the duke or the cottonspinner the squire or the mineowner they omit to note that much graver inconvenience is caused at present to the millions who are shut out from the fields and the sunshine who are sweated all day for a miserable wage or who are forced to pay fancy prices for fuel to gratify the rapacity of a handful of coalgrabbers  lack of imagination makes people fail to see the evils that are makes them fail to realise the good that might be  i often fancy to myself what such people would say if land had always been communal property and some one now proposed to hand it over absolutely to the dukes the squires the gamepreservers and the coalowners tis impossible they would exclaim the thing wouldnt be workable why a single landlord might own half westminster a single landlord might own all sutherlandshire the hypothetical duke of westminster might put bars to the streets he might impede locomotion he might refuse to let certain people to whom he objected take up their residence in any part of his territory he might prevent them from following their own trades or professions he might even descend to such petty tyranny as tabooing brass plates on the doors of houses and what would you do then the thing isnt possible the duke of sutherland again might shut up all sutherlandshire might turn whole vast tracts into grousemoor or deerforest might prevent harmless tourists from walking up the mountains and surely free britons would never submit to that the bare idea is ridiculous the squire of a rural parish might turn out the dissenters might refuse to let land for the erection of chapels might behave like a petty king augustus of scilly indeed there would be nothing to prevent an american alien from buying up square miles of purple heather in scotland and shutting the inhabitants of these british isles out of their own inheritance sites might be refused for needful public purposes fancy prices might be asked for pure cupidity speculators would job land for the sake of unearned increment towns would have to grow as landlords willed irrespective of the wants or convenience of the community theoretically i dont even see that lord rothschild mightnt buy up the whole area of middlesex and turn london into a golden house of nero your scheme cant be worked the anomalies are too obvious  they are indeed yet i doubt whether the unimaginative would quite have foreseen them the things they foresee are less real and possible but they urge against every reform such objections as i have parodied and they urge them about matters of far less vital importance the existing system exists they know its abuses its checks and its counterchecks the system of the future does not yet exist and they cant imagine how its far slighter difficulties could ever be smoothed over they are not the least staggered by the appalling reality of the duke of westminster or the duke of sutherland not the least staggered by the sinister power of a conspiracy of coalowners to paralyse a great nation with the horrors of a fuel famine but they are staggered by their bogey that state ownership of land might give rise to a certain amount of jobbery and corruption on the part of officials they think it better that the dukes and the squires should get all the rent than that the state should get most of it with the possibility of a percentage being corruptly embezzled by the functionaries who manage it this shows want of imagination it is as though one should say to ones clerk all your income shall be paid in future to the duke of westminster and not to yourself for his sole use and benefit because we your employers are afraid that if we give you your salary in person you may let some of it be stolen from you or badly invested how transparently absurd we want our income ourselves to spend as we please we would rather risk losing one per cent of it in bad investments than let all be swallowed up by the dukes and the landlords  it is the same throughout want of imagination makes people exaggerate the difficulties and dangers of every new scheme because they cant picture constructively to themselves the details of its working men with great picturing power like shelley or robespierre are always very advanced radicals and potentially revolutionists the difficulty they see is not the difficulty of making the thing work but the difficulty of convincing less clearheaded people of its desirability and practicability a great many conservatives who are conservative from selfishness would be radicals if only they could feel for themselves that even their own petty interests and pleasures are not really menaced the squires and the dukes cant realise how much happier even they would be in a free a beautiful and a wellorganised community imaginative minds can picture a world where everything is so ordered that life comes as a constant æsthetic delight to everybody they know that that world could be realised tomorrowif only all others could picture it to themselves as vividly as they do but they also know that it can only be attained in the end by long ages of struggle and by slow evolution of the essentially imaginative ethical faculty for right action depends most of all in the last resort upon a graphic conception of the feelings of others     xx  about abroad   the place known as abroad is not nearly so nice a country to live in as england the people who inhabit abroad are called foreigners they are in every way and at all times inferior to englishmen  these postprandials used once to be provided with a sting in their tail like the common scorpion by way of change i turn them out now with a sting in their head like the common mosquito mosquitoes are much less dangerous than scorpions but theyre a deal more irritating  not that i am sanguine enough to expect i shall irritate englishmen your englishman is far too cocksure of the natural superiority of britons to foreigners the natural superiority of england to abroad ever to be irritated by even the gentlest criticism he accepts it all with lordly indifference he brushes it aside as the elephant might brush aside the ineffective gadfly no proboscis can pierce that pachydermatous hide of his if you praise him to his face he accepts your praise as his obvious due with perfect composure and without the slightest elation if you blame him in aught he sets it down to your ignorance and mental inferiority you say to him oh englishman you are great you are wise you are rich beyond comparison you are noble you are generous you are the prince among nations he smiles a calm smile and thinks you a very sensible fellow but you add oh my lord if i may venture to say so there is a smudge on your nose which i make bold to attribute to the settlement of a black on your intelligent countenance he is not angry he is not even contemptuously amused he responds my friend you are wrong there is never a smudge on my immaculate face no blacks fly in london the sky is as clear there in november as in august all is pure and serene and beautiful you answer oh my lord i admit the force of your profound reasoning you light the gas at ten in the morning only to show all the world you can afford to burn it at that he gropes his way along pall mall to his club and tells the men he meets there how completely he silenced you  and yet my lord elephant there is use in mosquitoes mr mattieu williams once discovered the final cause of fleas certain people said he cannot be induced to employ the harmless necessary tub for them providence designed the lively flea he compels them to scratch themselves by so doing they rouse the skin to action and get rid of impurities now this british use of the word abroad is a smudge on the face of the otherwise perfect englishman perchance a mosquitobite may induce him to remove it with a little warm water and a cambric pockethandkerchief  to most englishmen the world divides itself naturally into two unequal and nonequivalent portionsabroad and england of these two abroad is much the larger country but england though smaller is vastly more important abroad is inhabited by frenchmen and germans who speak their own foolish and chattering languages part of it is likewise pervaded by chinamen who wear pigtails and the outlying districts belong to the poor heathen chiefly interesting as a field of missionary enterprise and a possible market for manchester piecegoods we sometimes invest our money abroad but then we are likely to get it swallowed up in mexicans or egyptian unified if you ask most people what has become of tom they will answer at once with the specific information oh tom has gone abroad i have one stereotyped rejoinder to an answer like that what part of abroad please that usually stumps them abroad is abroad and like the gentleman who was asked in examination to name the minor prophets they decline to make invidious distinctions it is nothing to them whether he is teaplanting in the himalayas or sheepfarming in australia or orangegrowing in florida or ranching in colorado if he is not in england why then he is elsewhere and elsewhere is abroad one and indivisible  in short abroad answers in space to that wellknown and definite date the olden time in chronology  people will tell you foreigners do this foreigners do that foreigners smoke so much foreigners always take coffee for breakfast indeed i love to answer ive never observed it myself in central asia tis parson adams and the christian religion nine english people out of ten when they talk of abroad mean what they call the continent and when they talk of the continent they mean france germany switzerland italy in short the places most visited by englishmen when they consent now and again to go abroad for a holiday i dont like abroad a lady once said to me on her return from calais foreigners in like manner means frenchmen germans swiss italians in the country called abroad the most important parts are the parts nearest england of the people called foreigners the most important are those who dress like englishmen the dim black lands that lie below the horizon are hardly worth noticing  would it surprise you to learn that most people live in asia would it surprise you to learn that most people are poor benighted heathen and that of the remainder most people are mahommedans and that of the christians who come next most people are roman catholics and that of the other christian sects most people belong to the greek church and that last of all we get protestants more particularly anglicans wesleyans baptists have you ever really realised the startling fact that england is an island off the coast of europe that europe is a peninsula at the end of asia that france germany italy are the fringe of russia have you ever really realised that the englishspeaking race lives mostly in america that the country is vastly more populous than london that our class is the froth and the scum of society think these things out and try to measure them on the globe and when you speak of abroad do please specify what part of it  abroad is not all alike there are differences between poland peru and palestine what is true of france is not true of fiji distinguish carefully between timbuctoo tobolsk and toledo  it is not our insularity that makes us so insular tis a gift of the gods peculiar to englishmen the other inhabitants of these isles of britain are comparatively cosmopolitan the scotchman goes everywhere the world is his oyster ireland is an island still more remote than great britain but the irishman has never been so insular as the english i put that down in part to his catholicism his priests have been wheels in a worldwide system his relations have been with douai st omer and rome his bishops have gone pilgrimages and sat on vatican councils his kinsmen are the macmahons in france the odonnels in spain the taafes in austria even in the days of the regency this was so look at lever and his heroes when england drank port county clare drank claret but ever since the famine ireland has expanded every irishman has cousins in canada in australia in new york in san francisco the empire is irish with the exception of india and india of course is a scotch dependency irishmen and scotchmen have no such feelings about abroad and its foreigners as londoners entertain but englishmen never quite get over the sense that everybody must needs divide the world into england and elsewhere to the end no englishman really grasps the fact that to frenchmen and germans he himself is a foreigner i have met john bulls who had passed years in italy but who spoke of the countrymen of cæsar and dante and leonardo and garibaldi with the contemptuous toleration one might feel towards a child or an andaman islander these italians could build giottos campanile could paint the transfiguration could carve the living marble on the tombs of the medici could produce the vita nuova could beget galileo galvani beccaria but stillthey were foreigners providence in its wisdom has decreed that they must live abroadjust as it has decreed that a comprehension of the decimal system and its own place in the world should be limitations eternally imposed upon the english intellect     xxi  why england is beautiful   as i strolled across the moor this afternoon towards waverley i saw jones was planting out that bare hillside of his with douglas pines and scotch firs and new strains of silver birches they will improve the landscape and i thought as i scanned them how curious that most people entirely overlook this constant betterment and beautifying of england you hear them talk much of the way bricks and mortar are invading the country you never hear anything of this slow and silent process of planting and developing which has made england into the prettiest and one of the most beautiful countries in europe  whats that you say astonished to find i have a good word of any sort to put in for england why dear me how irrational you are i just love england can any man with eyes in his head and a soul for beauty do otherwise england and italythere you have the two great glories of europe italy for towns for art for mans handicraft england for country for nature for green lanes and lush copses was it not one that loved italy well who sighed in italy    oh to be in england now that aprils there  and who that loves italy and knows england too does not echo brownings wish when april comes round again on dusty tuscan hilltops at perugia last spring through weeks of tramontana how one yearned for the sight of yellow english primroses not love england indeed miltons england shelleys england the england of the skylark the dogrose the honeysuckle not love england forsooth why i love every flower every blade of grass in it devonshire lane closecropped down rich watermeadow bickering brooklet ah me how they tug at ones heartstrings in africa no son of the soil can love england as those love her very stones who have come from newer lands over sea to her ivyclad churchtowers her mouldering castles her immemorial elms the berries on her holly the may in her hedgerows are not all these bound up in our souls with each cherished line of shakespeare and wordsworth do they not rouse faint echoes of gray and goldsmith even before i ever set foot in england how i longed to behold my first cowslip my first foxglove and now i have wandered through the footpaths that run obliquely across english pastures picking meadowsweet and fritillaries for half a lifetime till i have learned by heart every leaf and every petal you think because i dislike one squalid villagethe wen stout english william cobbett delighted to call iti dont love england you think because i see some spots on the sun of the english character i dont love englishmen why how can any man who speaks the english tongue and boasts one drop of english blood in his veins not be proud of england england the mother of poets and thinkers england that gave us newton darwin spencer england that holds in her lap oxford salisbury durham england of daisy and heather and pinewood are we hewn out of granite to be cold before england  upon my soul your unseasonable interruption has almost made me forget what i was going to say it has made me grow warm and drop into poetry  england i take it is certainly the prettiest country in europe it is almost the most beautiful i say almost because i bethink me of norway and switzerland i say country because i bethink me of rome venice florence but taking it as country and as country alone nothing else approaches it have you ever thought why man made the town says the proverb and god made the country not so in england there man made the country and beautified it exceedingly in itself the land of southeastern england is absolutely the same as the land of northern francethat hideous tract about boulogne and amiens which we traverse in silence every time we run across by calais to paris chalk and clay and sandstone stretch continuously under sea from kent and sussex to flanders and picardy the channel burst through and made the straits of dover but the land on either side was and still is geologically and physically identical what has made the difference man the planter and gardener england is beautiful by copse and hedgerow by pineclad ridge and willowcovered hollow by meadows interspersed with great spreading oaks by pastures where drowsy sheep deepfleeced and ruddystained huddle under the shade of ancestral beechtrees its loveliness is human in itself i believe the actual contour of england cannot once have been much better than the contour of northern francethough nowadays it is hard indeed to realise it judicious planting and a constant eye to picturesque effect in scenery have made england what she isthe garden of europe  of course there are parts of the country which owed and still owe their beauty to their wildnessdartmoor exmoor the west riding of yorkshire the surrey hills the peak in derbyshire yet even these depend more than you would believe when you take them in detail on the art of the forester the view from leith hill embraces john evelyns woods at wotton the larches that cover one juralike gorge were set there well within your and my memory but elsewhere in england the hand of man has done absolutely everything the american when he first visits england is charmed on his way up from liverpool to london by the exquisite air of antique cultivation and soft rural beauty the very sward is mosslike thoroughly wild country indeed unless bold and mountainous does not often please one it is apt to be bare unattractive and desolate witness the veldt the steppes the prairies you may go through miles and miles of the states and canada where the wildness for the most part rather repels than delights you i do not say everywhere in places the wilderness will blossom like a rose boggy margins of lakes fallen trunks in the forest overgrown with wild flowers make scenes unattainable in our civilised england even our roughest scenery is comparatively manmade our heaths are game preserves our woodlands are thinned of superfluous underbrush our moors are relieved by deliberate plantations but england in her own way is unique and unrivalled such parks such greensward such grassy lawns such wooded tilth are wholly unknown elsewhere compare the blank fields and long poplarfringed high roads of central france with our devon or our warwickshire and you get at once a just measure of the vast the unspeakable difference  and man has done it all alone he did it often as i take my walks abroadand when i say abroad i mean in englandi see men at work dotting about exotics of variegated foliage on some barren hillside and i say to myself there before my eyes goes on the beautifying of england thirty years ago the north downs near dorking were one bare stretch of white chalky sheepwalk half of them still remain so the other half has been planted irregularly with copses and spinneys which serve to throw up and enhance the beauty of the unaltered intervals beech and larch in autumn tints set off smooth patches of grass and juniper within the last few years the downs about leatherhead have been similarly diversified much of the loveliness of rural england is due one must frankly confess to the big landlords though the great houses love us not we must allow at least that the great houses have cared for the trees in the hedgerows and for the timber in the meadows as well as for the covert that sheltered their pheasants their foxes and their gamekeepers but almost as much of englands charm is due to individual small owners or occupiers tis they who have planted the grounds about villa or cottage they who have stocked the sweet old gardens of yew and box of hollyhock and peony they who have given us the careless rustic grace of the english village still one way or another man has done it all whether in grange or in manorhouse in palatial estate or in labourers holding look at the french or belgian hamlet by the side of the english one look at the french or belgian farm by the side of our english wealth in wooded glen or sheltered homestead bricks and mortar are not covering the whole of england that is only true of the squalid purlieus and outliers of london whither londoners gravitate by mutual attraction if you will go and live in a dingy suburb you cant reasonably complain that all the worlds suburban being the most cheerful of pessimists a dweller in the country all the days of my life i have no hesitation in expressing my profound conviction that within my memory more has been done to beautify than to uglify england only the beautification has been quiet and unobtrusive while the uglification has been obvious and concentrated it takes half a year to jerrybuild a dingy street but it takes a decade for newlyplanted trees to give the woodland air by imperceptible stages to a stretch of country     xxii  anent art production   yesterday at bordighera i strolled up the hills behind the town to sasso it is a queer little cluster of gleaming whitewashed houses that top the crest of a steep ridge and like many other italian villages it makes a brave show from a distance though within it is full of evil smells and all uncleanness but i found it had a churcha picturesquely ugly and dilapidated church and without and within this church was decorated by inglorious hands with very naïve and rudimentary frescoes the four evangelists were there in flowing blue robes and the four greater prophets with long white beards and the madonna appearing in most wooden clouds and the patron saint tricked out for his festa in gorgeous holiday episcopal vestments that was alljust the common everyday italian country church that everybody has seen turned out to pattern with manufacturing regularity a hundred times over yet as i sat among the oliveterraces looking down the steep slope into the borghetto valley and across the gorge to the green pines on the cima it set me thinking tis a bad habit one falls into when one has nothing better to turn ones mind to  we english coming to italy with our ideas fully formed about everything on heaven and earth naturally say to ourselves great heart alive what sadly degraded frescoes to think the art of raphael and andrea del sarto should degenerate even here in their own land to such a childish level but we are wrong for all that it is raphael and andrea who rose not my poor nameless sasso artists who sank and degenerated italy was capable of producing her great painters in her own great day just because in thousands of such italian villages there were workaday artisans in form and colour capable of turning out such ridiculous daubs as those that decorate this tawdry church on the ligurian hilltop  we english in short think of it all the wrong way uppermost we think of it topsyturvy beginning at the end while evolution invariably begins at the beginning the raphaels and andreas to put it in brief were the final flower and fullest outcome of whole races of church decorators in infantile fresco  everywhere you go in italy this truth is forced upon your attention even to the present day art here is no exotic it smacks of the soil it springs spontaneous like a weed it burgeons of itself out of the heart of the people not high art understand well not the art of burnejones and whistler and puvis de chavannes and sar peladan commonplace everyday art that is a trade and a handicraft like the joiners or the shoemakers look up at your ceiling its overrun with festoons of crude red and blue flowers or its covered with cupids and graces or it bristles with arabesques and unmeaning phantasies every wall is painted every grotto decorated sham landscapes sham loggias sham parapets are everywhere the sham windows themselves are provided not only with sham blinds and sham curtains but even with sham coquettes making sham eyes or waving sham handkerchiefs at passersby below them openair fresco painting is still a living art an art practised by hundreds and thousands of craftsmen an art as alive as cookery or weaving the italian decorates everything his pottery his house his church his walls his palaces and the only difference he feels between the various cases is that in some of them a higher type of art is demanded by wealth and skill than in the others no wonder therefore he blossomed out at last into michael angelos frescoes in the sistine chapel  to us english on the contrary high art is something exotic separate alone sui generis we never think of the plaster star in the middle of our ceiling as belonging even to the same range of ideas as say the frescoes in the houses of parliament  a nation in such a condition as that is never truly artistic the artist with us even now is an exceptional product art for a long time in england had nothing at all to do with the life of the people it was a luxury for the rich a curious thing for ladies and gentlemens consumption as purely artificial as the stuccoed italian villa in which they insisted on shivering in our chilly climate and the pictures it produced were wholly alien to the popular wants and the popular feelings they were part of an imported french italian and flemish tradition english art has only slowly outgrown this stage just in proportion as truly artistic handicrafts have sprung up here and there and developed themselves among us go into the cantagalli or the ginori potteries at florence and you will see mere boys and girls untrained children of the people positively disporting themselves with childish glee in painting plates and vases you will see them not slavishly copying a given design of the masters but letting their fancy run riot in lithe curves and lines in griffons and dragons and floral twistsandtwirls of playful extravagance they revel in ornament now it is out of the loins of people like these that great artists spring by naturenot statetaught artificial madeup artists but the real spontaneous product the lippi and botticelli the hereditary craftsmen the born painters and in england nowadays it is a significant fact that a large proportion of the truest artiststhe innovators the men who are working out a new style of english art for themselves in accordance with the underlying genius of the british temperament have sprung from the great industrial townsbirmingham manchester leicesterwhere artistic handicrafts are now once more renascent i wont expose myself to further ridicule by repeating here what i nevertheless would firmly believe were it not for the scoffers that a large proportion of them are of celtic descentbelong in other words to that section of the complex british nationality in which the noble traditions of decorative art never wholly died outthat section which was never altogether enslaved and degraded by the levelling and cramping and souldestroying influences of manufacturing industrialism  in italy art is endemic in england in spite of all we have done to stimulate it of late years with guano and other artificial manures it is still sporadic  the case of music affords us an apt parallel till very lately i believe our musical talent in britain came almost entirely from the cathedral towns and why because there and there alone till quite a recent date there existed a hereditary school of music a training of musicians from generation to generation among the mass of the people not only were the cathedral services themselves a constant school of taste in music but successive generations of choristers and organists gave rise to something like a musical caste in our episcopal centres it is true our vocalists have always come mainly from wales from the scotch highlands from yorkshire from ireland but for that there is i believe a sufficient physical reason for these are clearly the most mountainous parts of the united kingdom and the clear mountain air seems to produce on the average a better type of human larynx than the mists of the level the men of the lowland say the tyrolese croak like frogs in their marshes but the men of the upland sing like nightingales on their treetops and indeed it would seem as if the mountain people were always calling to one another across intervening valleys always singing and whistling and shouting over their work in a way that gives tone to the whole vocal mechanism witness welsh penillion singing and wherever this fine physical endowment goes hand in hand with a delicate ear and a poetic temperament you get your great vocalist your sims reeves or your patti but in england proper it was only in the cathedral towns that music was a living reality to the people and it was in the cathedral towns accordingly during the dark ages of art that exceptional musical ability was most likely to show itself more particularly was this so on the welsh border where the two favouring influences of race and practice coincidedat gloucester worcester hereford long known for the most musical towns in england  cause and effect act and react art is a product of the artistic temperament the artistic temperament is a product of the long hereditary cultivation of art and where a broad basis of this temperament exists among the people owing to intermixture of artisticallyminded stocks one is liable to get from time to time that peculiar combination of characteristicssensuous intellectual spiritualwhich results in the highest and truest artist     xxiii  a glimpse into utopia   you ask me what would be the position of women in an ideal community well after dinner imagination may take free flight suppose till the coffee comes we discuss that question  woman i take it differs from man in being the sex sacrificed to reproductive necessities  whenever i say this i notice my good friends the womensrights women with whom i am generally in pretty close accord look annoyed and hurt i can never imagine why i regard this point as an original inequality of nature which it should be the duty of human society to redress as far as possible like all other inequalities women are not on the average as tall as men nor can they lift as heavy weights or undergo as a rule so much physical labour yet civilised society recognises their equal right to the protection of our policemen and endeavours to neutralise their physical inequality by the collective guarantee of all the citizens in the same way i hold that women in the lump have a certain disadvantage laid upon them by nature in the necessity that some or most among them should bear children and this disadvantage i think the men in a wellordered state would do their best to compensate by corresponding privileges if women endure on our behalf the great public burden of providing future citizens for the community the least we can do for them in return is to render that burden as honourable and as little onerous as possible i can never see that there is anything unchivalrous in frankly admitting these facts of nature on the contrary it seems to me the highest possible chivalry to recognise in woman as woman high or low rich or poor the potential mother who has infinite claims on that ground alone to our respect and sympathy  nor do i mean to deny either that the right to be a mother is a sacred and peculiar privilege of women in a wellordered community i believe that privilege will be valued high and will be denied to no fitting mother by any man while maternity is from one point of view a painful duty a burden imposed upon a single sex for the good of the whole it is from another point of view a privilege and a joy and from a third point of view the natural fulfilment of a womans own instincts the complement of her personality the healthy exercise of her normal functions just as in turn the mans part in providing physically for the support of the woman and the children is from one point of view a burden imposed upon him but from another point of view a precious privilege of fatherhood and from a third point of view the proper outlet for his own energy and his own faculties  in an ideal state then i take it almost every woman would be a mother and almost every woman a mother of not more than about four children an average of something like four is necessary we know to keep up population and to allow for infant mortality inevitable celibates and so forth few women in such a state would abstain from maternity save those who felt themselves physically or morally unfitted for the task for in proportion as they abstained either the state must lack citizens to carry on its life or an extra and undue burden would have to be cast upon some other woman and it may well be doubted whether in a wellordered and civilised state any one woman could adequately bear bring up and superintend the education of more than four young citizens hence we may conclude that while no woman save the unfit would voluntarily shirk the duties and privileges of maternity few if any women would make themselves mothers of more than four children four would doubtless grow to be regarded in such a community as the moral maximum while it is even possible that improved sanitation by diminishing infant mortality and adult ineffectiveness might make a maximum of three sufficient to keep up the normal strength of the population  in an ideal community again the woman who looked forward to this great task on behalf of the race would strenuously prepare herself for it beforehand from childhood upward she would not be ashamed of such preparation on the contrary she would be proud of it her duty would be no longer to suckle fools and chronicle small beer but to produce and bring up strong vigorous free able and intelligent citizens therefore she must be nobly educated for her great and important functioneducated physically intellectually morally let us forecast her future she will be well clad in clothes that allow of lithe and even development of the body she will be taught to run to play games to dance to swim she will be supple and healthy finely moulded and knit in limb and organ beautiful in face and features splendid and graceful in the native curves of her lissom figure no cramping conventions will be allowed to cage her no wornout moralities will be tied round her neck like a millstone to hamper her intellectually she will be developed to the highest pitch of which in each individual case she proves herself capableeducated not in the futile linguistic studies which have already been tried and found wanting for men but in realities and existences in the truths of life in recognition of her own and our place among immensities she will know something worth knowing of the world she lives in its past and its present the material of which it is made the forces that inform it the energies that thrill through it something too of the orbs that surround it of the sun that lights it of the stars that gleam upon it of the seasons that govern it something of the plants and herbs that clothe it of the infinite tribes of beast and bird that dwell upon it something of the human body its structure and functions the human soul its origin and meaning something of human societies in the past of institutions and laws of creeds and ideas of the birth of civilisation of progress and evolution something too of the triumphs of art of sculpture and painting of the literature and the poetry of all races and ages her mind will be stored with the best thoughts of the thinkers morally she will be free her emotional development instead of being narrowly checked and curbed will have been fostered and directed she will have a heart to love and be neither ashamed nor afraid of it thus nurtured and trained she will be a fit mate for a free man a fit mother for free children a fit citizen for a free and equal community  her life too will be her own she will know no law but her higher instincts no man will be able to buy or to cajole her and in order that she may possess this freedom to perfection that she may be no husbands slave no fathers obedient and trembling daughter i can see but one way the whole body of men in common must support in perfect liberty the whole body of women the collective guarantee must protect them against individual tyranny thus only can women be safe from the bribery of the rich husband from the dictation of the father from whom there are expectations in the ideal state i take it every woman will be absolutely at liberty to dispose of herself as she will and no man will be able to command or to purchase her to influence her in any way save by pure inclination  in such a state most women would naturally desire to be mothers being healthy strong and free they would wish to realise the utmost potentialities of their own organisms and when they had done their duty as mothers they would not care much i imagine for any further outlets for their superfluous energy i dont doubt they would gratify to the full their artistic sensibilities and their thirst for knowledge they would also perform their duties to the state as citizens no less than the men but having done these things i fancy they would have done enough the margin of their life would be devoted to dignified and cultivated leisure they would leave to men the tilling of the soil the building and navigation of marine or aerial ships the working of mines and metals the erection of houses the construction of roads railways and communications perhaps even the entire manufacturing work of the community medicine and the care of the sick might still be a charge to some education to most art in one form or another to almost all but the hard work of the world might well be left to men upon whom it more naturally and fitly devolves no hateful drudgery of earning a livelihood women might rest content with being free and beautiful cultivated and artistic good citizens to the state the mothers and guardians of the coming generations if any woman asks more than this she is really asking lessfor she is asking that a heavier burden should be cast on some or most of her sex in order to relieve the minority of a duty which to wellorganised women ought to be a privilege  but all this has no practical bearing i beg your pardon an ideal has often two practical uses in the first place it gives us a pattern towards which we may approximate in the second place it gives us a standard by which we may judge whether any step we propose to take is a step forward or a step backward     xxiv  of second chambers   a second chamber acts as a drag progress is always uphill work so we are at pains to provide a drag beforehandfor an uphill journey  there in one word you have the whole philosophy of second chambers  how then did the nations of europe come to hamper their legislative systems with such a useless such an illogical adjunct in sackcloth and ashes let us confess the truthwe english led them astray on us the shame to us the dishonour theorists indeed wise after the fact as is the wont of theorists have discovered or invented an imaginary function for second chambers they are to preserve the people it seems from the fatal consequences of their own precipitancy as though the peopleyou and ithe vast body of citizens were a sort of foolish children to be classed with infants women criminals and imbeciles i adopt the chivalrous phraseology of an act of parliament incapable of knowing their own minds for two minutes together and requiring to be kept straight by the fatherly intervention of dukes of marlborough or marquises of ailesbury the ideal picture of the levelheaded peers restraining the youthful impetuosity of the representatives of the people from committing today some rash act which they would gladly repent and repeal tomorrow is both touching and edifying but it exists only in the minds of the philosophers who find a reason for everything just because it is there members of parliament i have observed seem to know their own minds every inch as well as earlsnay even as marquises  the plain fact of the matter is all the second chambers in the world are directly modelled upon the house of lords that old man of the sea whom england the weary titan is now striving so hard to shake off her shoulders the mother of parliaments is responsible for every one of them senates and upper houses are just the result of irrational anglomania when constitutional government began to exist men turned unanimously to the english constitution as their model and pattern that was perfectly natural evolutionists know that evolution never proceeds on any other plan than by reproduction with modification of existing structures america led the way she said england has a house of commons therefore we must have a house of representatives england has also a house of lords nature has not dowered us with those exalted products but we will do what we can we will imitate it by a senate monarchical france followed her lead so did belgium italy civilisation in general i believe even japan rejoices today in the august dignity of a second chamber but mark now the irony of it they all of them did this thing to be entirely english and just about the time when they had completed the installation of their peers or their senators england who set the fashion began to discover in turn she could manage a great deal better herself without them  and then what do the philosophers do why they prove to you the necessity of a second chamber by pointing to the fact that all civilised nations have got onein imitation of england furthermore it being their way to hunt up abstruse and recondite reasons for what is on the face of it ridiculous they argue that a second chamber is a necessary wheel in the mechanism of popular representative government a foolish phrase which has come down to us from antiquity represents the populace as inevitably fickle a changeable mob to be restrained by the wisdom of the seniors and optimates as a matter of fact the populace is never anything of the sort it is dogged slow conservative hard to move it advances step by step a patient surefooted beast of burden and when once it has done a thing it never goes back upon it i believe this silly fiction of the fickleness of the mob is mainly due to the equally silly fictions of prejudiced greek oligarchs about the athenian assemblywhich was an assembly of welltodo and cultivated slaveowners i do not swallow all that thucydides chooses to tell us in his onesided caricature about cleons appointment to the command at sphacteria or about the affair of mitylene and even if i did i think it has nothing to do with the question but on such utterly exploded oldworld ideas is the whole modern argument of the second chamber founded  does anybody really believe great nations are so incapable of managing their own affairs for themselves through their dulyelected representatives that they are compelled to check their own boyish ardour by means of the acts of an irresponsible and nonelective body does anybody believe that the house of commons works too fast and gets through its public business too hurriedly does anybody believe we improve things in england at such a breakneck pace that we require the assistance of lord salisbury and lord st leonards to prevent us from rushing straight down a steep place into the sea like the swine of gadara if they do i congratulate them on their psychological acumen and their political wisdom  what the commons want is not a drag but a goadnay rather a snowplough  no the plain truth of the matter is this all the second chambers in the world owe their existence not to any deliberate plan or reason but to the mere accident that the british nobles not having a room big enough to sit in with the commons took to sitting separately and transacted their own business as a distinct assembly with so much wisdom are the kingdoms of the earth governed how else could any one in his senses have devised the idea of creating one deliberative body on purpose to mutilate or destroy the work of another to produce from time to time a periodical crisis or a periodical deadlock there is not a country in the world with a second chamber that doesnt twice a year kick and plunge to get rid of it  the house of lords was once a reality it consisted of the ecclesiastical hierarchythe bishops and mitred abbots with the official hierarchythe great nobles who were also great satraps of provinces and great military commanders it was thus mainly made up of practical lifemembers appointed by merit the peers lay and spiritual were the men who commended themselves to the sovereign as able administrators gradually with prolonged peace the hereditary element choked and swamped the nominated element the abbots disappeared the lords multiplied the peer ceased to be the leader of a shire and sank into a mere idle landowner wealth alone grew at last to be a title to the peerage the house of lords became a house of landlords and the english people submitted to the claim of irresponsible wealth or irresponsible acres to exercise a veto upon national legislation the anomaly utterly indefensible in itself had grown up so slowly that the public accepted itnay even defended it and other countries accustomed to regard englandthe pecksniff among nationsas a perfect model of political wisdom swallowed half the anomaly and all the casuistical reasoning that was supposed to justify it without a murmur but if we strip the facts bare from the glamour that surrounds them the plain truth is thisengland allows an assembly of hereditary nobodies to retard or veto its legislation nowadays simply because it never noticed the moment when a practical house of administrative officers lapsed into a nest of plutocrats  mend or end as it stands the thing is a notevenpicturesque mediæval relic if we english were logical we would arrange that any man who owned so many thousand acres of land or brewed so many million bottles of beer per annum should ipso facto be elevated to the peerage why should not gallons of gin confer an earldom direct and brighton as be equivalent to a marquisate why not allow the equal claim of screws and pills with coal and iron why disregard the native worth of annatto and nitrates baron beecham or lord sunlight is a firstrate name as it is we make petty and puerile distinctions beer is in but whiskey is out and even in beer itself if i recollect aright dublin stout wore a coronet for some months or years before english pale ale attained the dignity of a barony no minister has yet made chocolate a viscount at present banks and minerals go in as of right while soap is left out in the cold and even cotton languishes if the chancellor of the exchequer put up titles to auction while abolishing the legislative function of the lords there would be millions in it but as we english are not logical our mending would probably resolve itself into fatuous tinkering we might get rid of the sons but leave the fathers we might flood the lords with life peers but leave the veto such tactics are too britannic stone dead hath no fellow     xxv  a point of criticism   a few pages back i ventured to remark that in utopia or the millennium the women of the community would probably be supported in common by the labour of the men and so be secured complete independence of choice and action when these essays first appeared in a daily newspaper a leader among women wrote to me in reply what a paradise you open up to us alas for the reality the question iscould women ever be really independent if men supplied the means of existence they would always feel they had the right to control us the difference of the position of a woman in marriage when she has got a little fortune of her own is something miraculous men adore money and the possession of it inspires them with an involuntary respect for the happy possessor  now i got a great many letters in answer to these postprandials as they originally came outsome of them strange to say not wholly complimentary as a rule i am too busy a man to answer letters and i take this opportunity of apologising to correspondents who write to tell me i am a knave or a fool for not having acknowledged direct their courteous communications but this friendly criticism seems to call for a reply because it involves a question of principle which i have often noted in all discussions of utopias and millennia  for my generous critic seems to take it for granted that women are not now dependent on the labour of men for their supportthat some or even most of them are in a position of freedom the plain truth of it isalmost all women depend for everything upon one man who is or may be an absolute despot a very small number of women have money of their own as we quaintly phrase itthat is to say are supported by the labour of many among us either in the form of rent or in the form of interest on capital bequeathed to them a woman with five thousand a year from consols for example is in the strictest sense supported by the united labour of all of usshe has a first mortgage to that amount upon the earnings of the community you and i are taxed to pay her but is she therefore more dependent than the woman who lives upon what she can get out of the scanty earnings of a drunken husband does the community therefore think it has a right to control her not a bit of it she is in point of fact the only free woman among us my dream was to see all women equally freeinheritors from the community of so much of its earnings holders as it were of sufficient worldconsols to secure their independence  that however is not the main point to which i desire just now to direct attention i want rather to suggest an underlying fallacy of all socalled individualists in dealing with schemes of socalled socialismfor to me your socialist is the true and only individualist my correspondents argument is written from the standpoint of the class in which women have or may have money but most women have none and schemes of reconstruction must be for the benefit of the many socalled individualists seem to think that under a more organised social state they would not be so able to buy pictures as at present not so free to run across to california or kamschatka i doubt their premiss for i believe we should all of us be better off than we are today but let that pass tis a detail the main thing is this they forget that most of us are narrowly tied and circumscribed at present by endless monopolies and endless restrictions of land or capital i should like to buy pictures but i cant afford them i long to see japan but i shall never get there the man in the street may desire to till the ground every acre is appropriated he may wish to dig coal lord masham prevents him he may have a pretty taste in venetian glass the flints on the shore are private property the furnace and the implements belong to a capitalist under the existing régime the vast mass of us are hampered at every step in order that a few may enjoy huge monopolies most men have no land so that one man may own a county and they call this individualism  in considering any proposed change whether imminent or distant in practice or in daydream it is not fair to take as your standard of reference the most highlyfavoured individuals under existing conditions nor is it fair to take the most unfortunate only you should look at the average  now the average man in the world as it wags is a farmlabourer an artisan a millhand a navvy he has untrammelled freedom of contract to follow the plough on another mans land or to work twelve hours a day in another mans factory for that other mans benefitprovided always he can only induce the other man to employ him if he cant he is at perfect liberty to tramp the high road till he drops with fatigue or to starve unhindered on the thames embankment he may live where he likes as far as his means permit for example in a convenient court off seven dials he may make his own free bargain with grasping landlord or exacting sweater he may walk over every inch of english soil with the trifling exception of the millions of acres where trespassers will be prosecuted even travel is not denied him florence and venice are out of his beat it is true but if he saves up his loose cash for a couple of months he may revel in the oriental luxury of a thirdclass excursion train to brighton and back for three shillings such advantages does the régime of landlordmade individualism afford to the average run of british citizen if he fails in the race he may retire at seventy to the ease and comfort of the union workhouse and be buried inexpensively at the cost of his parish  the average woman in turn is the wife of such a man dependent upon him for what fraction of his earnings she can save from the publichouse or she is a shopgirl free to stand all day from eight in the morning till ten at night behind a counter and to throw up her situation if it doesnt suit her or she is a domestic servant enjoying the glorious liberty of a sunday out every second week and a walk with her young man every alternate wednesday after eight in the evening she has full leave to do her lovemaking in the open street and to get as wet as she chooses in regents park on rainy nights in november look the question in the face and you will see for yourself that the mass of mothers in every community are dependent for support not upon men in general but upon a single man their husband against whose caprices and despotism they have no sort of protection even the few women who are as we say independent how are they supported save by the labour of many men who work to keep them in comfort or luxury they are landowners let us put it and then they are supported by the labour of their farmers and ploughmen or they hold northwestern shares and then they are supported by the labour of colliers and stokers and guards and enginedrivers and so on throughout the plain fact is either a woman must earn her own livelihood by work which in the case of the mothers in a community is bad public policy or else she must be supported by a man or men her husband or her labourers  my daydream was then to make every woman independent in precisely the same sense that women of property are independent at present would it give them a consciousness of being unduly controlled if they derived their support from the general funds of the body politic of which they would be free and equal members and voters well look at similar cases in our own england the dukes of marlborough derive a heavy pension from the taxes of the country but i have never observed that any duke of marlborough of my time felt himself a slave to the imperious taxpayer mr alfred russel wallace is justly the recipient of a civil list annuity but that hasnt prevented his active and essentially individualist brain from inventing land nationalisation mr robert buchanan very rightly draws another such annuity for good work done but mr buchanans name is not quite the first that rises naturally to my lips as an example of cowed and cringing sycophancy to the ideas and ideals of his fellowcitizens no no be sure of it this terror is a phantom one master is real realisable instant but to be dependent upon ten million is just what we always describe as independence   the end    printed by ballantyne hanson and co   edinburgh and london
