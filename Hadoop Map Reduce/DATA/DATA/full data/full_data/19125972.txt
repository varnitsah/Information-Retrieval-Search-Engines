           153        as we pulled away i glanced back at our fleet and saw           that the vessels were well on fire                         233        as soon as the line was made fast a man slipped down           quickly followed by another                                335      from lossings war of 1812   evidently ashamed of the barbarism committed by british hands viceadmiral cochrane attempted to palliate it by a pitiful trick after the destruction of the capital and the invaders were safely back on their vessels in the patuxent cochrane wrote a letter to secretary monroe in which he said to him having been called upon by the governorgeneral of the canadas to aid him in carrying into effect measures of retaliation against the inhabitants of the united states for the wanton destruction committed by their army in upper canada it has become imperiously my duty conformably with the governorgenerals application to issue to the naval force under my command an order to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts upon the coast as may be found assailable cochrane then expressed a hope that the conduct of the executive of the united states would authorize him in staying such proceedings by making reparation to the suffering inhabitants of upper canada etc this letter was antedated august 18 or six days before the battle of bladensburg so as to appear like a humane suggestion in the noncompliance with which might be found an excuse for the destruction of the national capital it did not reach mr monroe until the morning of the 31st of august a week after washington was devastated when that officer in a dignified reply reminded the viceadmiral that the wanton destruction by the british of frenchtown frederick georgetown and havre de grace and the outrages at hampton by the same people had occurred long before the destruction of newark     commodore barneys young spies     chapter i  captain joshua barney   it is two years since what we called the war of 1812 came to an end and i amos grout once owner of the oyster pungy avenger propose to set down here that which happened to my friend jeremiah sackett and myself during the year of grace 1814 when so others have said we did good work for our country although at the time neither of us was more than fifteen years old  this i do for two reasons first because i am proud of what we two lads succeeded in doing and hope that at some day when mayhap both jerry and i are dead other boys may read of the part we played and be encouraged thereby to work out their own plans for the good  secondly because i would have it known that through a scheme of his two boys living on the shore of chesapeake bay succeeded in doing what experienced men might have failed at and i am eager to have others realize my friends worth  so much for the reason as to why i a seventeenyear boy with none too many advantages in the way of book education am thus attempting to write a tale for others and now that whoever should chance to read this may feel acquainted with us it is for me to introduce my friend and myself in regular storytelling shape  we lads lived in benedict charles county maryland near the mouth of indian creek when the war broke out and while many of the people of our town were not pleased with the idea of fighting the britishers again simply to establish the rights of our american seamen jerry and i were hot in favor of it for in 1810 my friends brother tom was taken by the kings officers out of his vessel while she was off the capes on the false ground that he was born in england the poor fellow was forced to serve in the english navy three years leading a dogs life as can well be imagined since he would never say that he was willing to serve his majesty to the best of his ability  therefore it was that when we invested our savings in a small slooprigged pungy with the idea of making a living by fishing we named her the avenger with never a thought that she might one day do something toward avenging poor toms wrongs  jerrys parents and mine were poor people who could not afford to give their sons what so many fortunate lads havea good education fine clothes and money to spend we were obliged to do all we could to aid our families and had been wageearners since our tenth birthday  it would be too long a story if i should attempt to set down all that my friend and i did by way of gathering up money enough to pay nicholas trundy one hundred dollars for his pungy which was then going on six years old it was a big lot of money for two lads to save after contributing to the support of their families and we were near to four years doing it  it was a proud day for us when the little vessel became our property and we painted out the name handsome susan to put in its place in big red letters the avenger  she was about twentyfour feet long with a cuddy in which were four small bunks and had been in the oyster business since being launched as we intended she should remain there  we bought her early in the spring of 1812 when the people were talking strongly for or against war but it never entered our minds that we might get mixed up in the fighting for who could ever have dreamed that the britishers would come to benedict it was enough to satisfy us that the oyster business was fairly good and that we could often earn with the pungy as high as three dollars a day not counting the time occupied in running up to annapolis or baltimore  during the second year of the war we did not do as well but there is no good reason why i should go into all the details of what would not be entertaining save to an oysterman it is enough if i jump over to the spring of 1814 when we made a trade with an old sailor by name of darius thorpe whereby he was to sail with us for onethird of the profits after all expenses had been paid and this bargain was a good one for us lads since he was a masterhand at dredging being able to work all around either jerry or me  besides being an expert fisherman old darius was an artist at storytelling and there was hardly an evening during the first two months he was with us when we did not sit in the cuddy long after we should have been asleep listening to the old mans yarns  then as everybody knows about april captain joshua barney was ordered to fit up a fleet of small boats to protect the towns of the bay for by this time we were having mighty good proof that the united states was at war with england and it stands to reason that we lads were eager to know all that was possible concerning this officer who had been the most successful of the privateers sailing out of baltimore  we were on our way to annapolis with half a load of oysters when the news was given us by the captain of the oriole while he quoted the prices he got for his cargo and since the avenger was creeping along lazily with about onequarter as much wind as she needed we had plenty of time in which to discuss a matter that seemed to be of very great importance to us  there wont be any foolin when joshua barney gets here no matter how big or how little his fleet is darius said as he laid at full length on the deck sunning himself and in a twinkling it flashed across me that the old man may have sailed with or under the gentleman who was to command such a naval force as could be gathered in the chesapeake bay therefore i asked  do you happen to know the captain darius  we always called the old man by his first name because he insisted so strongly that we should said it made him feel at home and sounded a good deal like putting on airs to tack on the mister  know him the old man cried rising lazily on one elbow and swinging half around to look at me as i sat on the rudderhead i know him lock stock an ramrod lad the last deep sea cruise i went on was with him hes a snorter thats what he is an ive heard his whole story a hundred times over i tell you lads theres nothin in a book that can come up with josh barneys doins  give us the full yarn darius jerry cried were like to be loafin around here a good many hours if this wind holds soft as i reckon it will an we may as well make the most of the time  darius was always ready to spin a yarn which was much in his favor according to my way of thinking but he couldnt seem to rattle the words off easy like except when his mouth was full of tobacco therefore jerry and i could always tell whether the story was to be long or short by the amount of roughlycured plug he stowed between his jaws  it was a mighty big chew he took while making ready to tell of captain barney and i must say for darius that he never spun a yarn which interested me more than the one i count on setting down here  josh barney was born somewhere along 1759 in baltimore the old man began slowly as if determined to give a regular biography of the captain his folks let him go to school till he was ten years old an then he began to shift for himself by goin into a store but bless you he never was made for that kind of work an before two years passed he found it out went over to baltimore one day on a visit an wound up by shippin on a pilotboat but even that wasnt what he hankered for an finally his father shipped him as apprentice to captain tom drisdale on a brig for a voyage to ireland  i was in hopes your yarn had somethin about his runnin away to go to sea jerry said in a tone of disappointment  youll find these ere runaway sailors dont mount to very much except in story books an besides josh barney wasnt that kind of a chap drisdale made the passage an then went up to liverpool where he got a chance to sell the brig barney worked his way home before the mast on a fullrigged shipi dont jest remember her name when he struck baltimore again it was to find that the old man barney had been killed accidentally by the youngest boy of the family who was foolin with a loaded pistol an joshua had to shift for himself seeins his father didnt have none too much money an a big family the lad shipped for cadiz as ordinary seaman made the voyage all right had a little cash to leave with his mother an then signed as an a1 on a brig bound for italy  it dont make very much difference to us how many voyages he made jerry interrupted what we want to know is the kind of a man he is  if you can put a stopper on your jaw a bit youll soon find out the mate of the brig was sent into the forecastle not bein up to his work an josh barney took his place then the captain took sick an lo an behold before the lad had turned sixteen years old he was in command of the brig owin to the freights that offered he sailed for alicant an made port just as the spaniards were fittin out an expedition against algiers the brig was chartered as transport an he earned big money for the owners gettin back to the mouth of the chesapeake in 76 when the british sloop of war king fisher hove him to an took all his papers an weapons but let him keep on to baltimore where the brig was laid up then barney had more money an considerable of it for his mother  the old man paused to take in another cargo of tobacco and then continued  young as he was the lad found a chance to ship as masters mate on the sloop hornet william stone commandin an in one day so its said he carryin a flag an with a drummer an two fifers enlisted a full crew for the hornet all from baltimore which goes to show that the people there thought he amounted to somethin barney sailed in hopkins fleet to the bahamas where the town of new providence was taken an the commodore scooped in all the ammunition to be found on the island a little while after that he shipped on the schooner wasp which convoyed off the coast the vessel in which benjamin franklin was goin to europe to help pull this country through an when they came back into the cape may channel they found the kings ships roebuck an liverpoolone of fortyfour guns an the other of twentyeightwaitin for em there was lively times for a spell until the wasp contrived to slip into wilmington creek where she laid till half a dozen row galleys came down from philadelphia to attack the british ships then the schooner came out an while the fightin was goin on captured the brig tender one of his majestys armed vessels what poked her nose in to help the big fellows they say barney fought like a tiger an with his captain wounded brought the little schooner an her prize through the fog into port  then they gave him a lieutenants commission an sent him off in the sloop sachem all of which happened before he was seventeen years old he soon found a chance to fight an after an action of two hours captured an english brig after that they took the sloop race horse cuttin her up so badly she sank an the next to come their way was a snow from jamaica which the lad counted on bringin into port he bein put on board as prize master then he had a bit of bad luck the snow was recaptured an barney made prisoner as stands to reason but he was exchanged at charleston an rode horseback to baltimore  how do you happen to remember all these things jerry asked thinking perhaps that darius was giving us more guff than truth  remember it the old man repeated sharply why ive sailed with captain barney an every mothers son of the crew knew the story for it aint often that a lad of seventeen gets such a record so we couldnt help keepin it in mind besides which ive got lots of stuff in my pocket thats been printed about him well in 77 he shipped on the andrew doria for the defense of the delaware river an when that scrimmage was over he found himself drafted to the frigate virginia when as everybody knows he was taken by the britishers again an held for nearly a year before bein exchanged for the lieutenant of the mermaid then he went out in a letter of marquemeanin a privateerwith captain robinson they had but twelve guns a mighty small stock of powder an only thirtyfive men but bless you those fellows thought nothin of tacklin the british privateer rosebud full of men an guns fortyseven of the enemy were killed or wounded an aboard the yankee only one was wounded they sailed to bordeaux took on a cargo of brandy shipped seventy men mounted eighteen guns an on the voyage home had a runnin fight lastin well on to two days when they captured their game  then it was that barney got married an about a month afterward when drivin in a gig from philadelphia to baltimore he was robbed of every cent he had in the world he never told anybody of his loss but turned back to philadelphia took service aboard the saratoga sixteen guns an made a big voyage capturin one ship of twelve guns another of thirtytwo an two brigs then he was taken by the intrepid an mighty barbarous treatment he got for well on to a year when the young officer escaped an after he got home the government gave him command of the hyder ally with which he soon took the british ship general monk as this ere bit of paper will show  darius took from his pocket a wellworn slip cut from some newspaper which purported to be an extract from the hyder ally logbook and as it was mighty interesting to me im going to set it down here just as it was printed       april 8th 1782 at 10 am laying at anchor under cape may      delaware discovered three sail standing in from sea with a      light wind from the eastward at 11 perceived that they were a      frigate a ship and an armed brig at meridian the frigate      stood for cape henlopen channel the ship and brig standing in      for cape may made a signal for our convoy to get under weigh      and followed the convoy at 1 pm the ship and brig came into      the bay by cape may channel the frigate coming around under      cape henlopen prepared for action all hands to quarters       at threequarters past one the brig passed us after giving      us two fires we reserved our fire for the ship then fast      coming up we received very little damage from the brig who      stood after our convoy she mounted sixteen guns and was      formerly the american privateer fair american commanded by      captain decatur and equal to us in force       at 2 pm the ship ranged up on our starboard quarter and      fired two guns at us we were then at good pistolshot we then      attempted to run her on board by laying her across the      starboard bow but our yardarms locked which kept us too far      off to board at the same time poured in our broadside from      great guns and small arms       our fire was briskly kept up for twentysix minutes when she      struck her colors immediately sent our first lieutenant on      board and stood up the bay the frigate at this time under a      press of sail in chase after us and the brig ahead in chase of      our convoy again prepared for action and stood after the      brig but on her perceiving that the ship had struck she stood      for the frigate and got aground we were obliged to pass her      as the frigate gained on us       at 4 pm the frigate came to anchor in the bay supposed for      want of a pilot we then spoke the prize for the first time      and learned she was his majestys ship the general monk      captain rodgers of nineteen ninepounders but fighting twenty      guns and had on board when the action began one hundred and      thirtysix men of whom thirty were killed and fiftythree      wounded of sixteen officers on board fifteen were killed or      wounded the captain received three wounds       we had on board the hyder ally four killed and eleven wounded      the hyder ally mounted twelve sixpounders and four      ninepounders with a complement of one hundred and fifteen      men during the action we fired thirteen broadsides from our      cannon and from sixty to seventy rounds from our muskets       proportion of metal the general monk ten ninepounders fired      ninety weight of shot at one broadside the hyder ally six      sixes and two nines fired fiftyfour weight of shot at one      broadside proportionfifty to ninety  that all came from the logbook an youll find captain barney didnt try to blow his own horn darius said as i ceased reading but i happened to go on board the general monk when she got into philadelphia an saw the killed an wounded bein brought ashore in hammocks the prize looked tough her decks were covered with blood an three of the bow ports were knocked into one she was sold bought in by the government an barney took command of her sailin for france with despatches to benjamin franklin then the war came to an end an he settled in kentucky somewhere heres a newspaper story of what happened after that and darius gave me another slip of paper the matter on which i read aloud to jerry as follows  in 1789 captain barney finding his health impaired by his services embarked for carthagena in a small brig belonging to himself and partner thence he went to havana and then home in 1792 he sailed again and arrived at cape françois while there the town was burnt and he was obliged to fight his way he brought off fifty or sixty miserable women and children his vessel was captured by an english privateer brig two others in company three officers and eleven men were put on board and all the americans taken out except barney the carpenter boatswain and cook they were ordered to new providence the keys of the treasure chest were demanded but barney would not deliver them which occasioned much abuse and ill treatment he had concealed a small blunderbuss and his men some other arms with which they retook the ship the englishmen were made to work the vessel until they arrived at baltimore barney was compelled for his own safety to sleep on the quarterdeck in an armchair he again sailed for cape françois in 1793 on his return he was again captured by an english brig and taken to jamaica when he arrived in kingston he was committed to prison and bills were found against him for piracy his ship and cargo were condemned once more he escaped and on his return was offered command of a frigate but declined in 1795 he entered the french service remaining in that employ until 1800  now you can see what kind of a man it is wholl be in command here on the chesapeake darius said triumphantly when i ceased reading the britishers wont find it all plain sailin while hes around and im allowin hell make things hum  it pleased me to know that we would have a live man to protect us for if all the rumors were to be credited the time had come when we needed protection mighty bad but with all darius storytelling it never came into my mind that we would know this wonderful captain barney except by hearsay  we continued at our oyster business without being troubled in any way by the war although small fights were going on all around us during the early part of the summer  more than once had we seen the flotilla under command of this same captain barney who was come to be a commodore now in it were twentysix barges and pungies with nine hundred men all of whom saw more of service from may to july than they had ever dreamed of  the commodore did indeed make things hum as darius had predicted he attacked anything and everything that was british never seeming to care one whit whether he was outclassed or not and succeeded in doing the enemy a big lot of injury it is well known that once during a full four hours he kept his small fleet under the fire of a frigates guns hoping to capture her  then the britishers began to understand that if they wanted to have things their own way in the chesapeake it would be necessary to first do away with commodore barney and they began operations in great shape although at the time we who were most interested in that locality had little idea of what was coming  now after this fleet of barges and pungies began their work jerry seemed to have something of import on his mind but never a word would he say in explanation to darius and me until our business grew so dull that it was only with great difficulty we could earn enough to pay the running expenses and then it was that the lad came to the front with a scheme which he thought great while neither of us so much as dreamed of what the carrying out would result in  its no use freightin oysters to baltimore when we cant sell em for enough to pay for the use of the pungy to say nothin of our time in dredgin jerry began one afternoon about the first of august when we were coming down the bay with our pockets nearly as empty as the avengers hold  but we do get a dollar now an then i said with a laugh which is more than could be done if we turned idlers half a loaf is way ahead of no bread at all  darius nodded gravely as if to show that he agreed with me fully and jerry cried with more of anger than good humor in his tones  but im countin on havin a bit of meat now an then i could eat a razorback this minute without stoppin to take off the bristles but there isnt money enough on board to buy the smallest ham  how are you goin to mend matters lad while the price of oysters keeps down as it is now darius asked beginning to understand that jerry had something in his head which might serve us  im told that commodore barney keeps his men jumpin so lively at fightin that they dont have time for anythin else the lad said slowly as if speaking to himself and i wondered if he counted that the commodore could raise the price of oysters  i reckon thats the straight truth darius replied it aint his way to keep cats that dont catch mice  then why is it we cant make a trade to help supply the commodore with fish an oysters even though he didnt give very much for the freights we brought in it wouldnt be a case of losin three or four days out of every ten runnin up to baltimore  even then i failed to understand his scheme and said as much whereat the lad cried impatiently  you must be thickheaded amos grout if you cant see what im drivin at the matter has been in my mind these two months past so now i propose that we go to commodore barneyhe surely will hear what weve got to say an try to make a trade he buys moren half of all his provisions for the men of the fleet dont get time to do much fishin an we could let ourselves an the pungy outright or agree upon a price for what we bring in  it wasnt at all a bad scheme now that our regular business was so dull but i questioned if the commodore would listen to such as we were long enough to understand what kind of a bargain we had to offer  ill go bail that you wont have any trouble in gettin speech with joshua barney an for so long as the business warrants pervidin you can catch him when hes got a few spare minutes on his hands darius said quickly and from his tone i understood that he heartily approved of jerrys scheme  but where shall we find the fleet i asked and to the question jerry made answer  weve been countin on runnin in to see our folks at benedict an i warrant that there well get news of the commodore if not it wont cost so very much time to have a look around the lower end of the bay  yes an be snapped up by some bloomin britisher i said having no desire to mix in where people were fighting with such playful weapons as cannon and rifles  we should be able to keep out of the way of danger jerry replied as if he had thought out the whole scheme and i then understood that he had been mooning over it the past two months determined to spring it on us when the price of oysters dropped below what would be decent wages  well we didnt come to any conclusion that day owing to my standing back and throwing cold water but we were bound to touch at the home port and jerry bided his time until we were where information regarding the fleet could be had     chapter ii  at benedict   i had not supposed that the people of benedict would know very much concerning what was going on at the lower end of the bay but the avenger was hardly more than at anchor when i understood that we could have gone to no better place in order to learn what was being done  we had but just come to anchor not having time to set foot on the shore when jim freeman rowed over to us his eyes bulging and every freckle on his face standing out like pips on a gooseberry  what did you put in here for he cried before yet coming alongside are you hankerin to have your pungy burned or sunk  whats the matter jim jerry cried youre actin like as if somethin had gone wrong  gone wrong jim exclaimed and it did really look as if his eyes would roll right down on his cheeks the whole bloomin bottom has dropped out of everything the britishers are comin into the bay thickern spatter an i dont see how you got in here without bein caught  in here i cried in amazement have you lost your wits that you think the britishers would come into the patuxent river  i reckon its you that are needin wits jim cried as he scrambled over the rail so you think they wouldnt come into the patuxent eh  certainly not and for the very good reason that theres nothing here they want  jim looked at me in pity and i afterward understood that there was good reason for his so doing  how long have you been up baltimore way  near to ten days jerry replied hoping to hasten jim in the telling of the news with which he was near to bursting we had hard work to sell our oysters at any price an then it fell a dead calm with weather hot enough to tan a nigger  then theres little wonder that you boys are way behind the times as to what has been goin on round here and jim threw out his chest as he swelled with the importance of being the first to impart startling news in the first place he said speaking slowly as if to prolong his enjoyment at giving information which would not be pleasing to hear admiral cochrane the britisher has passed the capes with twentyone vessels an commodore malcolm is below with a fleet loaded with soldiers tom harrison swears there were moren ten thousand men  somebody has been stuffin you jim i said not crediting his news  then theyve stuffed commodore barney too an when he runs i allow the rest of us had better be huntin a hole  commodore barney dont run darius cried angrily for he never allowed anything disparaging to be said in his presence of the man whom he believed to be the greatest naval commander who ever lived  perhaps he dont very often but he has this time jim said in a tone so decided that we could not but believe he was convinced of the truth of his own words  did you see him darius demanded and i expected that when he answered this question jims story would fall to pieces but the lad replied bold as a lion  of course i did all the boats laid here after the fight in st leonards bay an it was only yesterday they scooted up the river  here was news with a vengeance and i no longer felt the same desire to punch jims head which had come over me when he first came aboard with what i believed was a cock and bull story  then with first one and another asking questions we learned from jim that while we were in baltimore the british frigate loire had chased commodore barneys flotilla into st leonards bay and blockaded it there until colonel carberrys artillery came down from frederick and drove the enemy away  then having learned of the enormous force at the mouth of the bay commodore barney sailed to benedict where he remained four and twenty hours or till word was brought that ten or twelve of the enemys vessels were bound up the bay bound most likely for baltimore or washington when he sailed for nottingham further up the river  darius was more concerned than either of us for he firmly believed that joshua barney would not have beaten a retreat without first having been positive that an overwhelming force was near at hand and if there were britishers near enough to drive the commodore away we had got ourselves in a pickle by coming up the river  the first thought which came to my mind was that the avenger was in great danger of being captured in short order for i made no question but that the enemy would pursue barney and we were where we could not escape save by way of the bay  jerry however had the idea that all these manoeuvres would further his scheme and he said as if being thoroughly well satisfied with the situation  we can run up to nottingham as well as the commodore and once there i reckon it will be possible to make our trade  but if the fleet is forced to remain there all hands will be idle and the commodore wont care to hire us while several hundred men are loafing around the decks i suggested and jerrys jaw fell  but jim had not exhausted his budget of news although it was impossible for him to give us anything more very startling  the commodore had only got eight pungies an five barges of the fleet  where are the other boats darius demanded sharply  somewhere on the delaware side they went off on a cruise before the britishers hove in sight he has taken on the schooner scorpion which was here at anchor an i heard one of the officers say that there was about five hundred men in this part of the fleet  im goin ashore darius said abruptly it aint no ways certain to me that jim has heard this thing right an i count on gettin down to facts  jerry and i were eager to land and without even stopping to thank jim for the news he brought we went over the rail into our canoe pulling in hot haste for the shore  never waiting to speak with such few loungers as were to be seen near the water front i went directly to my own home and there found more tidings of war  my father had joined commodore barney as had nearly all the ablebodied men of benedict agreeing to remain in service while our section of the country was menaced by the enemy and mother seemed to have the idea that i would follow his example  jerrys father had gone with the fleet and as she said only those who had been opposed to the war with england remained at home after greeting me and telling what little she knew of the situation mother set about getting together the few things i owned which might be needed on a long cruise and i was ashamed to say that as yet i had had no idea of going to fight the britishers  dont let it be understood i believed the united states could have done other than declare war in 1812 or that i had any secret liking for the britishers i simply believed that i did not have the backbone of a fighter and preferred to stand at a distance while the more eager went ahead but yet i was not really a coward as i think was afterward proved  however just then it made me feel rather uncomfortable to have mother gathering up my few belongings and telling me what to do in event of receiving such or such a wound and with my brain all in a whirl i went out of doors under the pretense that it was necessary i should have a talk with darius and jerry  once alone by myself behind the corncrib where no one would be likely to see me i tried to sum up the situation so far as i was immediately concerned and it did not look cheering we had sailed the avenger down the bay and up the river never sighting a single craft although it appeared that the british were swarming near about our very course it was not probable we could run to the southward without coming across some of their vessels especially if they were reckoning on pursuing commodore barney and even though we did get to the mouth of the river in safety where could we go the big fleets were at the entrance of the bay and had not come there for nothing the enemy was counting on attacking washington or baltimore it seemed certain and by going to the northward we would likely find ourselves out of the fryingpan into the fire  it seemed very much to me as if we had lost the avenger whichever way we turned and my heart grew heavy for once she was gone jerry and i were badly off  hardly knowing what i did i went toward my friends home and met him coming my way a look of excitement and eagerness on his face  well it seems as if we were in for it he cried when we were come within hailing distance and i asked irritably  in for what  a bit of fightin of course you wouldnt be willin to stay here with the cowards commodore barney left behind would you  there are a good many things i had rather do than poke my nose into a hornets nest i replied feeling as if jerry was in some way my enemy because he appeared to be so delighted with the situation  what did your mother say he asked giving no heed to my grumpiness  nothing much she is getting things ready for me to go away and without so much as asking if i counted on leaving  she knows as i do that you wouldnt remain behind the lad cried showing as much joy as if we were thinking of visiting a peepshow come on darius is waitin for us we must try to get a supply of provisions for its likely they havent any too large a store in the fleet  then was the moment when i should have declared bluntly that i had no idea of putting myself in a position to be shot at if it could be avoided but i hadnt the courage to tell him that i would not leave benedict immediately although i was fully determined not to go up the river  jim freeman and a couple of other boys strolled along having been in search of us they also took it for granted that the avenger would join commodore barneys fleet and were come to ask that the three be allowed to go with us  it wont do jim jerry said taking it upon himself to act as spokesman although i figured as captain of the pungy we cant feed ourselves the way things look now an it dont stand to reason we should add to the crew  but ill bring enough to eat jim persisted and turned to me as he said ive done you many a good turn amos an you wont lose anything by givin me lift now  do you call it a lift to be put where the britishers can kill you i asked angrily for if these lads were so eager to have a hand in the fighting as to beg for a chance it would be all the harder for me to declare that i wouldnt join the fleet  we might carry you as far as nottingham if youd agree to ship on some other craft after we got there jerry said without stopping to ask my permission  that well do an be glad of the chance jim replied acting as if really overjoyed by the permission to run his nose into danger well be on board in half an hour you cant get under way before then  no we shall likely be here an hour or more jerry said as if he was the sole owner of the avenger and when the foolish boys ran away at full speed he began to figure as to where we could get a small store of food  i held my peace angry and timorous until we were come to the water front where we found darius awaiting us and he as could be seen at a glance was of the same mind as jerry  ive found two hams an a side of bacon he cried triumphantly pointing to the articles which were in the canoe if you fellows can scare up some meal well be fixed for a spell did you see jim freeman an his crowd  yes theyre goin to nottingham with us jerry replied and the old man asked me  how soon can we get under way  i hesitated it was on the tip of my tongue to say that i would not stir a hand in the matter nor should the avenger leave her moorings but fortunately i remembered that we couldnt hold the pungy there to be destroyed when the enemy came up the river and to tell the absolute truth i was ashamed to declare bluntly that i had no idea of casting in my lot with such a firebrand as commodore barney  we ought to leave here in an hour jerry said making answer because he thought i was trying to figure how long it would take us to make ready amos wont need more than ten minutes to get what stuff his mother is puttin up for him an im goin round by the mill to see if they will trust us for half a bushel of meal  he was off like an arrow as he spoke and darius had no idea that i was hesitating as to the course to pursue for an old fighter like him supposed it would be a pleasure for me to voluntarily go into the worst kind of a row  it was fortunate indeed for me that the old man never suspected what was in my heart otherwise i would have been shamed in my home to such an extent that i could never go there again but all that came to mind later just then i felt as if i was being cruelly wronged by those who should have stood my friends  darius would have told me yet further of what commodore barney had done in the past but i cut him short by saying like a spoiled child  i dont care to hear anything more about him just now it strikes me that wed better be thinking of ourselves  the old man looked really distressed and but for the fact that my heart was sore i could have laughed because of the mistake he made darius really believed that i was grieving over being thus obliged to leave my mother and the children and he said soothingly  i come somewhere near knowin how it is lad at such a time as this the least home talk thats made the better for it kinder unstrings a fellow you wait here an ill go after what dunnage your mother is gettin together shell understand that a short partin is the best  i could not have stopped him for he was off before i had time to so much as open my mouth and there i stood leaning against the canoe giving the people of benedict to believe i was eager to be fighting for my country  jim freeman and his companions came along a few moments after darius left and in order to have some occupation rather than from a desire to serve them i offered to put the three aboard the avenger  they talked of nothing but what they would do once the enemy gave them an opportunity until i asked petulantly  is everybody in benedict as eager to shed blood as are you  not much jim cried with a laugh theres elias macomber for examplehes an englishman you know an hasnt been in this country moren four years hes makin a lot of wild talk bout what hell do to us folks when the britishers come up the river  what reason has he to make any fuss i asked rather for the sake of saying something than because i desired information  well i suppose all hands have roughed into him pretty bad on account of things hes said an now he counts on showin what his countrymen can do  now it was that i began to feel glad because of having said nothing in opposition to joining commodore barneys fleet by hanging back while all the others were taking up arms i would be ranging myself on the side of elias macomber which would have caused me to be ashamed of myself for he was by no means a reputable citizen  however glad i might be because i had refrained or been prevented from saying that which would have made it appear as if i took sides with the british i was in nowise reconciled to the idea of going where the bullets were like to be flying and after putting jim and his friend aboard the avenger i pulled back to the shore in anything rather than a cheerful frame of mind  darius was waiting for me and he must have run every step of the way from the river to my fathers home he had with him a small bundle wrapped in one of mothers blankets and said as he pulled the bow of the canoe up on the mud  i reckon it is jest as well that i went after your dunnage lad for your mother was ready to have a cryin fit which she couldnt perlitely let come on while i was there but ill warrant the water would have run had you been alone with her  she cant be feeling terribly bad otherwise she wouldnt have been so anxious to have me go i said sulkily  i dont know about that my boy it stands to reason she had rather anything else happened than that you should stay at home when this part of the country needs every hand that can be raised in defense she feels sore because you are goin but ill go bail shed have felt ten times worse had you said youd stay back with such as elias macomber  i wasnt in a proper frame of mind to appreciate all that the old man said and continued to consider myself as being abused although not to such an extent as before i heard about elias macomber  it was noised around in the village told most likely by jim freeman that we were going to nottingham to join the commodore and while darius and i stood by the canoe waiting for jerry we were literally besieged by women whose husbands or sons were with the fleet nearly all of whom wanted to send some message or this or that article which had been forgotten at the time of departure  i believe of a verity that darius and i charged ourselves with no less than twenty errands by word of mouth and as for packages why we had the bow piled full until it seemed as if we were to carry something by way of reminder for every man under commodore barneys command  nearby where we stood were also gathered four men whose sympathies were entirely with the british and among them as a matter of course was elias macomber  these worthless ones who would injure the country which had provided them with a home food and clothing to say nothing of the comforts of life evidently counted on ruffling our feathers believing it would be safe to do so now that nearly all the men were gone from the village and they began by talking loudly of the sorry spectacle which the commodore and his followers would present when admiral cochrane and his vessels came up the river  i feel certain that darius would have held his peace for he was not naturally a quarrelsome man had they made sport of everybody in the american army and navy save joshua barney but a word against him was to the old man much as a red flag is to a bull and in a twinkling the trouble began  the man who says aught against the commodore must answer to me for his words darius said angrily as he strode toward the four who were trying to bait him ill not stand here and listen to such talk  it was elias macomber who showed his lack of sound sense by making reply  we didnt ask you to stand here but if you choose to do so its more than likely youll hear a good many things which may not please you  hold your tongue as to barney or itll be the worse for all hands darius cried angrily and at that moment jerry appeared staggering under a bag which must have contained a full bushel and a half of meal  i shall always believe elias macomber held the idea that darius was a feeble old man otherwise he would have kept his tongue between his teeth for he was far from being brave but however that may be he replied hotly  i do not count on choosin my words when i speak of such a bag of wind as josh barney has shown himself to be  it seemed to me as if the words had not been fully spoken before darius launched out and in less time than it takes to tell it was in the midst of a hot onesided fight for the tories all pitched into him regardless of the fact that his quarrel was with elias  it stands to reason that i could never remain idle while a shipmate was getting the worst of it particularly when his adversaries were men for whom i entertained no friendly feelings and the scrimmage was hardly more than begun when i took a hand standing close by the old mans side  as i aimed a blow at elias i saw out of the tail of my eye jerry drop his meal as he came forward at full speed and at almost the same moment a loud splashing in the water caused me to glance quickly in the direction of the pungy  jim freeman had jumped overboard to do his share toward teaching macomber a lesson and when he arrived the odds would be even  of course it was a disgraceful spectacle but it could not have been avoided so far as i was concerned and i did my best fighting as vigorously as if i had been the one to urge upon my companions the necessity of joining the fleet  it is not well that i give too much space to this brawl when there are so many other adventures in which a fellow might well take pride to be recorded therefore i will only say that we had no very easy task to down these admirers of king george and the prince regent but finally succeeded thanks to the assistance of jim freeman  it is doubtful which side got the worst drubbing although we claimed a victory because the others ran but positive it is that the four of us had all the punishment needed and were forced to wash our faces more than once before we could look at each other without a certain feeling of shame  what made you tackle the whole of em jerry asked the old man if the rest of us hadnt been near at hand theyd wiped you out  id tackle twenty if they dared say anything against joshua barney darius cried as he shook his fist in the direction where our adversaries had last been seen id rather get the toughest pummellin such as them could give than keep my mouth shut while they was slurrin their betters  we were actually obliged to use force with him otherwise the old man would have gone in pursuit of the britishlovers and it was only by tumbling him into the canoe headforemost holding him down by sitting on him once he was there that we could make darius listen to anything like reason  let up on me an ill keep quiet he said after we had threatened to continue the drubbing begun by the tories but this much i promise that after the commodore has made shoestrings of that conceited admiral ill come back here an have it out with elias macomber  well let it go at that jerry said as he released his hold of darius and went back for the meal while jim wrung the water out of his clothing as best he could for the fellow had not stopped to throw off coat or shoes when he jumped overboard to take a hand in the scrimmage  it was near to half an hour before we were ready to go on board the avenger and by that time it was too late to make any protests against following the commodore  my comrades took it for granted that i was equally eager with them to be where i could do my share of fighting the britishers and so stirred up was i by the game of fisticuffs ashore that i actually forgot to be frightened by the prospect of taking part in a battle  we got our anchor and made sail on the avenger without delay and thus in less than an hour from the time of making port we were off again on what proved to be a series of wild adventures     chapter iii  elias macomber   of a verity elias macomber did me a good turn when he started the quarrel with darius thorpe for up to this time i had been sadly lacking in patriotism as may have been learned from that which is already set down in these pages  until this day it had been as if the war did not concern me or mine save as it affected the price of oysters and when i saw this lad or the other who had enlisted i said to myself that another foolish one had been found who willingly engaged to go where he might be killed  within a very few moments after the fight between elias macomber and his crew of britishlovers had come to an end i began to view the situation of affairs as an honest lad should  the country which protected me in my homethat territory which had been bought or redeemed by the blood of brave men and even of women and children from the savage indians and a merciless king was in danger and if i did not rush to its defense how might i expect my heritage of a free land could be preserved to me and those who came after me  like a picture i saw before me those brave men and women who had battled against the forces of nature as they made homes in the wilderness then struggled against the bloodthirsty indians to protect their little all and were finally called upon to fight a powerful nation in order to hold themselves free in the land already redeemed by sweat and blood  once that was presented to my mental vision i ceased to regret having been forced to thus set off for the purpose of joining commodore barneys fleet and rejoiced that my comrades had prevented me from showing the white feather when even my loving mother urged me forward i forgot all the fears which had assailed me and thought only of what it might be possible for me to do in order to show myself worthy the land of my birth  in a word i had in a few seconds been transformed from a cowardly lad who would shirk his duty lest perchance he receive some bodily hurt to a boy burning with the desire to do whatsoever lay in his power toward checking the advance of an enemy who was bent upon carrying on the war by destroying the property of peaceful settlers  unless my comrades read what i have here set down they will never know how near i was on that day at benedict to proving myself a falsehearted american lad  the afternoon was considerably more than half spent when we left home for the eighteenmile sail up the river and i saw little chance of our coming upon the fleet before morning unless we kept the pungy under sail far into the night for the breeze what little we had of it came from the westward and we could not make more than two miles an hour against the current  therefore it was that i said to darius when we were half an hour or more from port after jim freeman and his friends had wearied themselves by cutting monkeyshines on the deck in order to prove their joy at thus having an opportunity to do whatsoever they might in defense of their country  with so light a wind we are like to be forced aground when it is so dark that we cannot give the shoals a wide berth because of not seeing them and the old man replied saying that which was in my own mind  itll be a case of comin to anchor lad after the sun has set for we had best make haste slowly rather than jam the pungy up where a day may be spent in tryin to float her  but suppose the british are close at hand i asked for now i was hot with the desire to make certain of keeping so far ahead of the enemy that i could take part in whatsoever might be done by way of fighting  they will be more helpless than we after night has come for we know the river fairly well while they are strangers to it  if it had not been that we lads were about to take part in the war i might have refused to accept darius advice so readily for it must be confessed i am overly headstrong and apt to go contrary when one makes the least show of driving me but in the business we were about to embark upon i knew it was safe to follow the old man since he had had long experience in such matters the telling of which would be more entertaining than will be the account of our adventures  it was destined however that the avenger should come to anchor even before the river was shrouded in darkness for we were not more than four miles above our own town of benedict when the wind died away completely thus forcing us to make fast somewhere unless we were minded to drift back to our starting point  in my ignorance i would have anchored the pungy in the stream hoisting a riding light and turned in feeling that everything was safe and snug but to this darius made decided objection  keep out of the channel he said emphatically we know beyond a peradventure that the enemy is astern of us and there is no tellin when he may come  he will wait for wind before goin very far up the river i interrupted and thus showed my ignorance of anything concerning warfare for the old man replied  it wouldnt be strange if he should send a boat in the night to make certain of the water and get such other information as might be useful this ere pungy would be captured by half a dozen men as easily as if the whole british fleet was close by  are you of the opinion that we should haul in to the bank i asked very humbly understanding that if we would run safely it might be better to give darius the command  let her drop back beyond the point an then sneak in as far among the trees as her spars will permit he said and this we did pulling her around by aid of the canoe until we were nicely hidden from all save by closest scrutiny  right glad was i by this time that jim freeman and his two friends had come aboard for they were willing lads who strove to do all they might in the way of work and we who belonged on the avenger had an easy time of it  jim took it upon himself to get supper and he had brought with him such a tempting store of provisions all of which he turned over to the party that our meal that night was a veritable feast i had never but once before had such an appetizing repast and that one exception was when oysters were scarce and a baltimore dealer gave us a dinner at the hotel in addition to the regular price of the cargo  when our hunger had been satisfied and the cuddy put to rights we lads would have spent the time spinning yarns or in some other such amusement but darius put his foot down strongly against it  remember that you are liable to be made prisoners of war at any moment he said gravely wise men do not hide themselves and their vessel an then talk and laugh that strangers may know where they are hidden  do you really expect to see britishers on the river this night jim freeman asked with a laugh and much to my surprise the old man said emphatically  i surely do if all we heard at benedict be true an i have little doubt of it the enemy count on destroyin commodore barneys fleet an know that it can be found up this stream it will be strange cordin to what i know of such business if the admiral does not send out spies before shovin any armed vessels up here  it can well be supposed that such talk as this insured silence among us we had hardly begun to understand that we might be very near a british prison unless every precaution was taken but the old mans words and manner of speaking them brought us to a better realization of the situation  we almost held our breath fancying the enemy might be close aboard until darius talking in a whisper said  im countin on seein or hearin the britishers twixt now an mornin an it strikes me that we might do a good stroke of work for joshua barney by lookin after a prisoner or two it wouldnt be no ways strange if we could nab em pervidin they put themselves in a fair position to be taken  i was dumfounded by such a proposition and it is not impossible that my knees began to shake as i thought of attempting such a thing then i suddenly remembered that we had no weapons aboard except an old musket which we used to shoot into a flock of ducks now and then and i said with a laugh  do you expect that the britishers will surrender if we simply invite them our one musket wouldnt make much of a showin against a boatload of men  all that has been in my mind lad an i reckon it wont be hard to put ourselves in right good shape if any british spies count on comin up the river it wouldnt be till after dark an weve got no right to expect theyd be around this way much before midnight now ill paddle back to the village an see if i cant scare up two or three muskets it wont take me moren an hour for the whole job  darius said this as if asking advice but i could make no reply and my companions held their peace therefore after waiting a few moments without hearing any comment the old man set about carrying his plan into execution  noiselessly he hauled the canoe alongside went over the rail into her and took up the paddle as i stood near the bow waiting for his command to cast off the painter  keep quiet whatever happens an dont fuss if im kept quite a spell for if theres anythin to be learned i shall make mighty little account of time cast off lad an be certain that nothin goes up or down the river without your seeing it  i obeyed the command and in an instant the canoe glided into the obscurity of the shadows cast by the overhanging trees  with the disappearance of darius there came upon me the full sense of my responsibility for i was the one to whom the others would look in event of trouble and i knew full well how poorly fitted i was by experience to be in command of the pungy  the knowledge of my own shortcomings at least served one good turn since it made me more than usually cautious and without delay i set about preparations for obeying the command given by darius  all my companions were on deck and calling them aft to the cuddy companionway i said in a whisper  you heard the words of darius now i propose the work shall be done in this fashion all hands will remain on duty not in a group but stationed equal distances apart at the rail each one to watch and listen to the best of his ability no fellow shall speak with his neighbor nor can he move about lest the sound of footsteps on the deck give an alarm  then i took up my station near the stern and in the gloom i could see the forms of my companions while they ranged themselves as i had suggested neither of them making more noise than so many mice  from that moment not a sound could be heard from the deck of the avenger that which darius said had aroused us all to the danger and even though we had only a crew of lads i felt confident no blunder would be charged against us  it was dreary work waiting there in the darkness listening intently for the lightest unusual noise and believing that an enemy was or soon would be close at hand the gurgling of the water in an eddy the leap of a fish or a bit of driftwood striking against the side of the pungy sounded in our ears loud as thunder and we heard the ordinary night rustlings of the forest as if it was something strange to our ears  then came that which caused us to bend far out over the rail trying to pierce the gloom with our eyes for the measured stroke of oars could be heard and it was a positive relief to me even though it betokened the coming of strangers  i felt certain an enemys boat was approaching because had any one living on the river been coming up at that time of night paddles would have been used instead of oars i knew of no one nearabout benedict who would have rowed a boat against the current when she could have been handled so much more readily the other way  nearer and nearer came the splashing of water as if more than one oarsman was at work and when it seemed as if the boat must be close upon us i heard a low voice but could not distinguish the words  immediately the noise of the oars ceased and then came the words not loud but clear enough for us who were listening so intently to hear with reasonable distinctness  on which side of the river were we to pick the man up  the left sir the same side as the village  the avenger was lying near the right bank of the river such position having been taken because of the trees and not through good judgment  one of you men get ashore and see what can be found if this is the place agreed upon and he said he would be about three miles above the village there should be a road running on a line with the river  there was no question in my mind but that the speakers were britishers from one of the fleets and that some of our people had agreed to play the traitor by giving information or piloting the boat but if such was the case where was darius he had not had time to reach benedict before this boat came past there and might already be a prisoner on his way to the nearest english vessel  even though he had gained the village while the strangers were yet below it then was his danger the greater for he might unwittingly come directly upon them when he returned whichever way i looked at the matter i saw cause for grave fear and the perspiration came out in big drops on my forehead for without him we would be in a bad predicament  while these thoughts were running through my mind i gave due attention to what might be going on at the opposite side of the river for i was convinced that the boat was nearly in a straight line across from where we lay  i could hear such noises as told that one of the crew was scrambling ashore amid the underbrush and i heard a man cough but after that all was still until at least fifteen minutes were passed when there was a faint sound of voices from a distance and then the rustling of the foliage as if one or more was forcing a passage through the tangle of vines  hello came in a hoarse whisper from the boat and some one ashore replied  its all right sir  from what could be heard i knew that a man or men were making their way to the boat from the highway and then when it seemed as if he or they were aboard the voice which had given the command said in greeting  so youre come at last macomber i had begun to believe we were mistaken as to the rendezvous  i was delayed in the village for your orders were that i must get away without its being known and there are many inquisitive ones in benedict  my heart gave a great bound so it was elias macomber who was playing traitor for even though he was born in england the united states was his home by adoption and to our people he was bound in honor  if darius could only get weapons so that we might capture the boats crew what joy would be mine to carry the base hound to commodore barney as a prisoner  elias was speaking in a low tone and rapidly to some onewhom i had no doubt was a british officer and i could only catch a word here and there but it was enough to let me know that he was reporting all he had heard concerning the movements of the flotilla  at nottingham yesterday i heard thirteen barges an pungies with the schooner scorpion five hundred men all told well armed an knowin how to use their weapons  it was by such fragments of conversation as set down above that i knew elias macomber was giving all the information in his power to the enemy and i resolved that some day he should pay the penalty of the crime even though i was forced to pursue him singlehanded  when all the story had been told the officer asked  can you give us a place on the river where we may lay by during the day i am minded to have a look at the boats before going back to make report  i bent forward eagerly to hear the reply  at a mill five miles above here you will find a friend by name of essek harland he can give you all that may be needed  you shall go with us to make certain he takes us in  very well sir but in that case i cannot get back home before morning  you should be able to pull eight miles with a current in a few hours and i will pay for the hire of a boat  very well sir macomber replied in a tone of content and i laughed inwardly with joy for he would be our prisoner to a certainty if he came down the river alone  then the word was given for the oarsmen to resume their work and we heard the light splashing of water as the boat was pulled upstream  after that all was silent once more and jerry came tiptoeing aft to whisper in my ear  do you think darius managed to give them the slip or did they capture him  it seems to me that the officer would have told elias if he had taken a prisoner i replied and such fact gave me great satisfaction at all events he must be here soon if nothing has happened to his disadvantage  even as i spoke the canoe came out of the shadow gliding lightly and noiselessly as thistledown and we knew that darius was safe for the time being at least  did you run across the boat when you went down i asked in a whisper as he came over the rail and he stood silent as if with surprise  didnt you see a boat jerry asked impatiently and the old man replied  i met with nothing either goin or comin an ive brought back two muskets with a mighty small lot of powder an ball but its bettern nothin what do you mean by a boat  then we told him what we had heard and when i mentioned the name of the traitor he brought his hand down on his leg with a resounding thwack that might have been heard some distance away as he said incautiously loud  well have that snake lads if we dont do anythin more an he shall have a chance to see how the commodore looks when the britishers come up the river  then it is for you to take command of the avenger darius the boat has not been gone from here above ten minutes therefore it is likely to be some time before the traitor comes down stream  we wont wait here for him lads theres breeze enough stirrin now to send the pungy against the current an well push ahead  sheltered by the trees as the vessel had been we were ignorant of the fact that a night breeze was springing up until the avenger swung out into the stream and then we found it as darius had said  the little craft could make about two miles an hour against the current which as i reckoned was about what the boat could do with a couple of men at the oars and i suggested to the old man that there was danger we might overrun our game  he gave heed by sending all hands save me into the bow as lookouts and steered a zigzag course which reduced our speed a full third  i dont believe ive ever heard of this essek harland you tell about the old man said to me in a whisper and understanding that he desired all the information i could give concerning the miller i replied  hes of much the same kidney as elias macomber except that he was born in this country a mean native of north carolina who starves his slaves and makes them work twice as many hours as they should he runs the mill and it is said that all those who carry grist to him keep a sharp watch lest he take out too much toll if he hides the britishers or gives them any information it will be because they pay him for he will do any mean thing for money  have you ever heard it said whether he was for or against the war  no and i havent heard his name spoken for a year or more it would make little difference with him which side he was on if the opposite party offered money they could buy him  then we fell silent again during half an hour or more when darius said  you shall tell me when we are within a mile of the mill it wont be safe to run any nearer unless we have overhauled that snake of a macomber  i was so well acquainted with the river as to know every crook and turn for at least ten miles above benedict and when it seemed certain the pungy had run three miles or more i kept a sharp lookout on the banks in order to comply with the old mans request  it was just when i believed we were close upon the spot where the avenger should be stopped that jerry came tiptoeing aft waving his arms to attract our attention  macomber has hove in sight darius whispered take the tiller an head her for his canoe  as he spoke he darted into the cuddy returning a few seconds later with two muskets and these he carried with him well forward  i strained my eyes in vain for a view of the canoe which should be coming right fast with a favoring current and had not yet made her out when darius hailed  in the boat there whereabouts are our people  the old man had disguised his voice and the traitor must have believed that we were a party of british coming to join those whom he had piloted for he paddled alongside fearlessly as he replied  up the river half a mile or so  can you show us the way  ay that i can but it will delay me in  he ceased speaking very suddenly for at that moment jerry incautiously came toward the port rail and even though the night was dark it was possible to see that he was neither a british soldier nor sailor  quickly he seized the paddle to shove off but darius thrust the muzzle of a musket in his very face as he cried sharply  pass up your painter or ill shoot quick or your life is gone in another second  elias macomber was a coward as we knew full well but i never believed he would give in quite as readily as he did he passed up the painter as meekly as any cooing dove and when darius ordered him to come over the rail he made all haste to obey the command  when we gathered around the cur however for all of us were so eager that we could not keep out of sight any longer and he saw who had captured him he let go a cry of anger that was like unto the whoof of a bear as he struck out with both fists savagely  he would have showed better sense had he taken matters with a bit more grace for before he could land a blow on either of us darius floored him with the buttend of the musket and during a minute or two he laid like one dead  you struck too hard i cried in alarm for even though the man was a traitor it seemed terrible to take a human life  not a bit of it the old sailor said quietly as he set about lashing the fellows arms and legs he aint the kind that can be killed so easily get off the hatch for we must have him out of sight before coming up to the mill  illustration pass up your painter or ill shoot cried darius page 56  five minutes later our prisoner was snugly stowed aft near the cabin bulkhead and we had brought the pungy to anchor lest she overrun the port we counted on making     chapter iv  a lively tussle   darius would have it that the traitor had not been seriously hurt by the blow on the head but when he failed to show any signs of consciousness after we stowed him away in the hold i grew alarmed and calling on jim freeman for assistance set about trying to bring him to life for of a verity i believed him dead  it was not until we had worked over him ten minutes or more that i could see any change and then suddenly he opened his eyes blinking in the rays of the lantern jim was holding close by his face  what happened to me he asked wildly and as my fears that he had been killed were banished by the words so did my anger against him return  you were known to have been giving information to the enemy and piloting english spies to a hidingplace i replied sharply we took it upon ourselves to cut your career as a traitor short and while the job was being done you got a clip on the head that knocked you senseless  while i was speaking the cur looked me full in the face as if trying to make out who i was but i believe he feigned ignorance only that he might have time in which to decide upon a course of action  i could see by the look in his eyes when his mind was made up as to how he should steer and a moment later he said with a start of pretended surprise  is it you amos grout i was afraid i had fallen into the hands of enemies  you are not among friends and that is certain i replied boiling with rage because the miserable cur would try to pull wool over my eyes for i well knew what tack he was about to take  and are you willin to hold enmity simply because we had a bit of a scrimmage over differences of opinion i thought all that was settled on the spot  so it was i said curtly  then why have you tied me up in this fashion  listen to me elias macomber i cried do you think for a moment that you can deceive any one aboard this craft we heard all you said to the british officer who is in the patuxent with a boats crew spying and know where you took him to pass the night we sailed up the river for the purpose of capturing you and here you remain until we can deliver the meanest traitor in maryland over to commodore barney  now the cur was frightened and with good cause he would have said something more thinking i dare say that it might yet be possible to blind me but i refused to listen  i only came here to learn if you were alive and now that matter has been settled i count on leaving you dont be so foolish as to think you can wiggle out of the scrape by lying for when you made your talk with the britisher this pungy was on the other side of the river her spars hidden by the trees we heard nearly every word that was spoken  an youre gettin out of this part of the trouble mighty easy if amos insists you shall be left alone jim added angrily if i had my way all hands of us would take a turn at thumpin you an then the account between us wouldnt be square  come on jim i said impatiently it is doing no good to parley with such as him leave the traitor to himself until the commodore directs what shall be done  elias called after us imploringly as we went out of the hold but i had no desire to remain longer with the cur and we put on the hatch in order that if he did succeed in freeing himself of the bonds he would yet be imprisoned  on gaining the deck i looked around for darius but he was not to be seen and jerry understanding for whom i searched said  the old man has gone ashore he counts on lookin around the mill so that we may know exactly how to get at work when the time comes  at work i repeated in bewilderment what does he reckon on doing now that we have caught the traitor  it is in his mind that we can make prisoners of all the boats crew an if that could be done wed be takin with us such as would insure a hearty welcome from the commodore  we had better let well enough alone i replied irritably if commodore barney wont be pleased to see him when we offer our own services the use of the pungy and the biggest traitor in maryland then theres little reason to try to purchase his favor  youve agreed that darius should run this thing to suit himself an hes doin it i believe hes right too if theres a chance to take a few prisoners it would be downright folly to let it slip  and do you expect that we can capture at least half a dozen wellarmed britishers  there are as many of us when you come to figgerin up the fightin force an the advantage of takin them by surprise will overbalance the difference in weapons  it was useless to argue with jerry as i understood by his tone therefore i turned away saying to myself that by trying to bite off too big a piece in the way of taking prisoners we might find the tables turned very suddenly to our disadvantage  jim freeman and his friends seemed to be of the same mind as jerry and i said nothing to them lest i be accused of faintheartedness when everything was apparently going our way  we waited in silence for the coming of darius allowing the avenger to remain in the stream where some of the boys had anchored her while i was caring for the prisoner and not until nearly midnight did the old man put in an appearance  jim freeman was on the lookout well forward and that he did his duty well was shown by the fact that he came aft with the word that a canoe was drifting down the river while the craft was yet some distance away  jerry and i each with a musket went forward to make certain the newcomer was a friend rather than an enemy and when we hailed softly darius replied with a low hissing sound which was familiar to us all  he made fast came inboard and entered the cuddy without speaking therefore we followed knowing full well that he had something of importance to impart  when we were all together unable to see each other because of the darkness darius said softly in a tone of triumph  ive found the britishers an can put my hand on the whole gang without much trouble there are but three men an the officer who i reckon will be the only fellow to make much fuss when we get at work now im countin that one of jims friends shall be left on board to look out for the pungy an make certain the traitor dont kick up any row three of us will have a musket each an the other two can do mighty good work with belayin pins  where are the men jerry asked  in the loft of the mill the officer is havin a right sociable time with essek harland an if the millers bottle holds out i reckon them two wont be in shape to make much trouble jim is to say which of his party shall stay aboard an the sooner the rest of us get to work the better for i want to begin the scrimmage in a couple of hours  it was evident that my opinion as to whether the attempt to capture the britishers should be made was not to be asked and yet i must follow where darius led or give my comrades good reason for calling me a cowardor worse  the old man settled it that he and jerry should arm themselves with belaying pins and the two muskets he brought back from benedict together with our old fowlingpiece was distributed among the rest of us  jim freeman named dody wardwell as the one to keep ship and look after the prisoner and darius instructed the watchman to be free with his blows in case elias tried to pick up a row  if he undertakes to yip even once give him a dose over the head that will put him to sleep an it wont be much harm if you kill such a cur as he is keep your wits about you lad an remember that the prisoner is the one who can make the most trouble  then the old man saw to it that each of our weapons was loaded after which he led the way to the rail where the canoe was made fast  the little craft would not carry more than three therefore two trips were necessary in order to land us all and when we stood on the bank darius proposed that jerry paddle the boat up to the mill  why do we want her there i asked thinking he was providing for a means of escape we couldnt all take passage in her and in case we need to get away in a hurry it might be done easier by striking into the woods  im not thinkin how we can get her off for if the plan fails to work theres little chance any of us will need the canoe darius said grimly and i began to understand that he might be more of a fighter than would suit me it may be we shall want to send some prisoners down to keep macomber company an then a small craft will come in handy for their boat is hauled up high an dry among the bushes she is so heavy that it would be a long job to float her  jerry was so impatient to be in the thick of danger that he hardly waited for the old man to conclude his longwinded speech and before the last word had hardly been spoken he was paddling up stream at a rate which told that he would arrive at the rendezvous some time in advance of us who were to walk  neither was darius willing to waste much time and when jerry was lost to view in the darkness he struck through the underbrush toward the highway leading the party while i brought up the rear  it can well be fancied that we moved with the utmost caution for people do not set out on such an enterprise as we were bent upon with any great blowing of horns and although none of us were what might be called woodsmen i flatter myself that we did not bungle the job very badly  hardly more than a quarterhour had passed when darius left the underbrush to cut across toward the river and within five minutes more we were halted near the southeast corner of the mill not having heard or seen anything of those whom we hoped to make prisoners  jerry joined us almost immediately having been on the lookout during five minutes or more and he reported that there had been no signs of life in the vicinity since his arrival  we who carry the clubs will go ahead an if it so be possible do the biggest part of the work for our weapons aint the kind that make much of any noise darius whispered jim freeman will stand guard at the door of the mill but he is not to shoot unless it becomes necessary to prevent the britisher or the miller from takin a hand in the scrimmage pervidin there is one now follow me lads an remember that we must get the three sailors under our thumbs once weve started no matter what turns up  we stole up to the big door on the northwest corner the only entrance to the building and as i had expected found it fastened on the inside one would hardly have supposed that the britishers in hiding would neglect to make themselves as secure as possible  it appeared that darius was not disappointed for after pushing gently at the door and motioning for jim to stand in front of it he led the way along the northerly side of the mill to a portion of the underpinning which had given way disclosing an aperture through which a mule might have been driven  keep close at my heels he whispered and then he plunged into the darkness we obeying his command to the letter for a misstep might throw us into the millrace which we could hear rippling close at hand  one would have said that the old man had always lived in this place so directly and swiftly did he go to the desired point which was a portion of the flooring where was a trapdoor evidently used to dump the refuse for suddenly we found ourselves climbing up a heap of what appeared to be husks and cobs of corn  it was a simple task to gain entrance to the building in this manner for darius had only to force the trapdoor up with his shoulder and in a twinkling we were standing on the lower floor nearby what i took to be the hopper  touching each of us in turn that we might be warned to follow closely darius led the way to the easterly end of the building where he halted at the foot of a flight of stairs  now he marshaled his force according to the weapons jerry was behind him i came next determined to use my musket as a club so long as it could be done rather than take the risk of killing a man and in the rear of me was josiah coburn one of jim freemans party  now it must be understood that we could see nothing the darkness was so intense that one could almost feel it and yet we proposed to blunder in upon enemies who would probably shoot without warning in the direction of the slightest suspicious noise  it was not a cheerful adventure and i hold myself well excused for being frightened so that i followed the leaders orders implicitly to the best of my ability  just at this point when we were trembling with suppressed excitement and as in my case fear darius remembered that he had not unlocked the outer door in order that jim might hide within the building and we were forced to stand at the foot of the stairs while he groped his way back to remedy the neglect  it seemed to me that we remained there hardly daring to breathe a full halfhour although i suppose now that it was no more than five minutes and then our leader was returned  pushing his way to the head of the line once more we began the ascent of the stairs each fellow stepping cautiously but despite all our efforts each board sent forth loud protesting creaks as we bore our weight upon it and the only wonder was that the britishers did not awaken sooner  the noise we made in ascending the stairs seemed to me loud enough to alarm the inmates of the house near at hand and therefore i was neither startled nor surprised when some person at one end of the second floor cried out  who is there whats the row  cant you give your shipmates the same show for a watch below that youve got darius asked with a regular deepsea note in his voice and this it was that gave us a slight advantage since the men did not open fire  how did you get here the same voice asked and again the old man answered as if speaking to shipmates  the bloomin swab that piloted you here gave us the course where are you  over here and the voice came from the westerly end of the building thus showing that we must walk the entire length of the mill before coming upon our adversaries what ship are you from  my heart stood still as this question was asked for i knew only too well that darius was wholly ignorant as to what british vessels had entered the bay but the old sailor never hesitated as he replied  what other than the flagship you lubber  no ill be burned if you are the man cried loudly and i heard him spring to his feet shes in the potomac river long before this rouse up my bullies an lets have a look at these beachcombers  during this brief conversation we had been advancing swiftly in the direction from which the sailors voice could be heard and when his comrades were ready to receive us we could not have been a dozen paces distant from the three  i felt rather than saw that darius sprang forward there was a dull thud a groan and a cry from one of the other britishers which told that the battle was on but the number of active enemies had been reduced by one for there could be no question but that darius had put his man out of the fight for some time to come  i ran forward with my companions but it was impossible to use the musket even had i been eager to shoot because of the darkness and as i swung the weapon from side to side striving to feel my way some one clutched me by the throat  heres one of em i managed to scream before the fellows fingers shut off my wind and then i had my hands full trying to save my own life  i managed to hit my adversary two or three solid blows which weakened his hold somewhat otherwise i would have been strangled in short order and then i fought as i never did before but sadly at a disadvantage as can be imagined  how long we swayed to and fro i striving to reach the enemys face with my fists and he trying to strengthen his hold on my throat i know not but certain it is that i held him in fairly good play five minutes or more before the report of jim freemans musket told that the britishers were about to receive reinforcements  even as i fought with my adversary i understood that the english officer and probably the miller aroused by the noise of the scrimmage were coming to the rescue and the thought flashed through my mind that in a few moments more the battle would be decided in favor of his majestys forces  just at that moment a heavy body pushed past me i heard that sickening sound which tells that a living object has been struck a powerful blow and instantly the hands relaxed their grasp on my throat  that makes the third one weve got the upper hands of all up here an you lads are to make the britishers fast the best you can in the darkness while i tend to the visitors  it was darius who spoke and when this had been said i understood that he was running toward the stairway  now it was possible to see faint gleams of light coming through the cracks of the floor and i realized that the newcomers had with them a lantern  the report of jims musket had been followed by the discharge of a pistol and i heard the lad running across the floor at full speed  i did not have sense enough to obey the old mans command in regard to the prisoners but stood there like a simple staring at the moving rays of light and wondering how long it would take the british officer to shoot us all down  then to my great surprise i heard a voice from the head of the stairs on the floor where we were cry loudly  this way sir weve got the best of two bloomin yankees an the other is sneakin in some corner  there came the sound of hurried footsteps and then the light of the lantern so far illumined the head of the stairway that i could see darius lying at full length on the floor within a few inches of the opening  just for one second i stood as if stupefied and then i understood what the old man would do  the british officer ascended swiftly but before his head was fairly above the top of the stairs darius stretched out his long arm seizing the gentleman by the throat even as my adversary had seized me  now i had my wits about me running forward swiftly i caught the lantern before the officer could let go his grasp on it and thus made it possible to have a view of what was going on  darius hauled his captive up much as if he had been a bale of merchandise and as he was dragged to the floor i saw one whom i believed to be the miller directly behind him within three steps of the top of the stairs  with the lantern in my left hand i thrust forward the barrel of my musket full in his face as i said sharply  throw down that gun or ill fire  illustration with the lantern in my left hand i thrust forward the barrel of my musket full in the face of the miller page 72  the man was armed in much the same fashion as was i but he had little stomach for fighting as could be seen when he dropped the weapon immediately i spoke and when it fell clattering to the floor below jim freeman came into view from behind a pile of bags  can you look after the miller jim i cried and the lad replied as he came bounding up the stairs  ay let him go an ill blow the whole top of his head off if he dares to look crosswise  i knew jims musket must be empty since he had not had time to recharge it after firing that which served as an alarm but i took the chances of the fact being discovered and turned with the lantern held high above my head to view the scene  near at hand darius was kneeling on the british officers chest industriously engaged in strapping the latters arms to his body with the prisoners waistbelt  in the distance jerry and josiah knelt beside a form which was stretched out frightfully limp as if life had departed but i observed that they were securing the mans hands and feet with portions of his trousers  beyond them a short distance was a second britisher tied tightly with what appeared to be strips torn from his own clothing and midway between them and darius was a third body evidently that of the man who had attacked me but he remained motionless and having heard the blow which struck him down i could well understand why he did not give any very violent signs of life  it did not appear that i was needed elsewhere therefore i turned my attention to the miller who was standing like a statue not daring to lift a finger lest jim should blow off the top of his head  come here i said to him come here while my friend trusses you up in proper fashion what can you find there to tie him with jim  plenty jim cried gleefully as he picked up from the floor a couple of bags and began cutting them into strips heres enough an to spare of what is better than rope  the venture had come to a most successful end providing there were no others in the vicinity whose love for the british would prompt them to interfere and i was amazed even amid the excitement of victory that we had come off ahead when it seemed certain the enemy could overcome us easily  darius having bound his captive stood up facing me and from the expression on his face one never would have supposed that he had just come unscratched out of as lively a tussle as i ever took part in it was as if he had been stowing oysters in the hold of the avenger and was stretching his back before going at it again  youve done a big thing i said holding out my hand to congratulate him to you belongs all the credit of having taken these prisoners and when we meet commodore barney i shall insist that he hears the whole story for i doubt if every old sailor has head enough to put such a venture through in good shape  it could readily be seen that the old man was pleased by the praise but he made as if it was of no consequence  you lads have done your full share an if any credit is to be given it goes to the whole crowd  not a bit of it jerry cried looking up from his task of binding the sailor with whom i had fought its as amos says but for you this never would have been done an it wont be my fault if all the men of the fleet dont hear of it  were not out of the woods yet darius said as though he would change the subject if id had half the head you give me credit for wed run the pungy up here instead of leavin her a mile away  josiah can go after her i suggested and by the time were ready to put our prisoners aboard she should be here  this proposition suited the old man and jims friend left the building at full speed while i asked darius to make certain the miller was trussed up in proper fashion  whater you goin to do with me essek harland cried with a whine i aint to be blamed for whats been done this night how can i help it if a crowd of britishers take possession of my mill  talk that over with elias macomber hes aboard the pungy darius replied in a matteroffact tone as he proceeded to bind the man with strips of bags provided by jim     chapter v  with the fleet   the british sailors did not make any talk on returning to consciousness and finding themselves bound hand and foot the officer however after recovering from the bewilderment which appeared to have come over him because of having been taken prisoner in such an unceremonious fashion protested against being tied like a criminal  will you give your word to make no attempt at escape darius asked but this did not suit the britisher for most likely he was reckoning on a rescue by those of the people who favored the king and there were not a few of such vermin on the patuxent river  i refuse to give my parole save to an officer of the american army or navy he said stiffly and darius replied cheerily  then you see that weve got no other course save to deal out the same dose for all cause were not countin on losin any of you  what are you goin to do with me the miller asked and i took it on myself to make reply  youll get the same treatment as elias macomber and however harsh it may be you wont have it as tough as is deserved these others are prisoners of war but you two are traitors and spies therefore must expect to fare according to your deserts  thats about the size of it amos darius said as he went from one to another of the prisoners to make certain they were secured properly and in condition to travel i reckon lad that we might as well be gettin the crowd down to the shore for unless the wind has died away entirely josiah coburn should be here mighty soon  how would it do to take along a supply of meal jerry asked if it so be that we dont come up with the fleet by noon tomorrow wed be short of provisions with so many to feed  right you are lad well take from essek harlands mealchest as much as may be needed an surely he cant make any complaint when he gets his share  while jerry was rummaging around to discover the millers store we got the prisoners downstairs finding it no slight task because two of the sailors in a spirit of pure mischief refused to walk and we were forced to tote them like so many barrels of flour by the time they were at the foot of the stairs however both were willing to provide their own means of transportation for we did not handle them with any too much care  essek harland whimpered and whined like the cur that he was until we came to suspect he might be making a noise in order to give an alarm to somebody in the vicinity when darius reduced him to silence by threatening to put a gag in his mouth  we had no more than got in fairly good marching shape when josiah came up with the avenger the wind being strong enough to push her along about as fast as a man could walk  then well on to an hour was spent before the prisoners and the meal were stowed in the hold of the pungy and i counted that it was near daybreak when we started up the river toward where commodore barneys fleet was supposed to be  it struck me that we should meet with a warm reception from the commander when we delivered up to him the britishers and the traitors for by capturing the spies we had delayed the coming of the enemy for a few hours at least  and in thinking of this i came to ask myself how we were to present ourselves whether as lads who wanted to make a bargain to supply the fleet with fish or as recruits ponder over it as i might it was impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion and i decided that before committing myself in any way i would ask the advice of my father whom i was likely to find on some of the vessels belonging to the flotilla  it was darius who broke in upon my perplexing thoughts by asking  well what do you think of it now lad we couldnt have done the job any browner if wed had on board a full cargo of rifles an ammunition  ay darius it has been well done because you were on hand but i question if another might have worked the scheme as well  there are thousands whod make less bungle of it the old man replied and i could see that he was well pleased because of being praised even by a boy all thats needed is a little backbone but if the other fellow happens to have moren youve got then things are apt to go wrong  thanks to your arrangement of the affair the enemy didnt have a chance to show his pluck but wed have been in a bad box if you hadnt made the britishers believe for a minute or two that we were their friends  darius laughed heartily as he thought of the brief conversation with the sailors and then said with a chuckle  if id only known the name of a vessel belongin to their fleet wed been right on top of em before bein found out but as it was we got well alongside when the trouble began  then jerry came aft to take part in the conversation and we spent a good halfhour praising each other and chuckling over the good fortune that had been ours  we might have continued at such pleasing occupation a very long while but that day began to break and there was too much work on hand to admit of further foolishness  darius gave up the tiller to me and went below to look after the prisoners returning five minutes later with the british officer who much to my surprise was no longer fettered  this gentleman has decided that he can give his parole to us as well as to brother officers darius said by way of introduction he has pledged his word to make no attempt at escape therefore we will give him the liberty of the ship  which wont mean much for one who has been accustomed to the luxury found on board some of his majestys vessels i added trying to show that i had some semblance of good breeding an oyster pungy isnt the most beautiful craft in the world  very true the officer replied with a friendly smile but there is a vast difference between the hold and the deck of an oysterman  yes i can fancy that to one unaccustomed to such things the avenger seems like a foul ship below  so your vessel is named the avenger and the gentleman looked at me quizzically isnt that rather highsounding for a peaceful fisherman  the officer was so different from what i had fancied a britisher might be and had such a friendly air that i made no hesitation in telling him how the pungy got her name and after the explanation he ceased to laugh at it  i can well believe that some of your people have been abused he said in a kindly tone but there are always two sides to a story and the commander of one of the kings ships may believe that he is doing absolutely that which is right and just when in your eyes he commits a most grievous wrong  i had sense enough to understand that if i attempted to argue with the officer on the causes of the war i should speedily find myself in deep water therefore i made reply  it is not for me to measure words with such as you sir i know that jerrys brother who had never stepped foot on other than american soil was forced to serve in one of your ships being carried forcibly and secretly away to the great distress of all who cared for him  and in that case his majestys officers did a most grievous wrong he said frankly and then as if to turn the subject of conversation he asked when do you expect to come up with barneys fleet for i understand you are in search of it  if the wind holds we should be there by noon providing commodore barney is yet at nottingham  with this the gentlemen turned away to take note of what was being done for darius had brought the three sailors on deck they also having solemnly pledged themselves to refrain from attempt at escape  jerry was making preparations for cooking breakfast which would be no small job with so many to be fed and jim freeman was helping him it was to be a good wholesome meal better than we of the avenger had enjoyed for many a day because there was to be a plentiful supply of fried ham with corndodgers which last jerry could make better than any person i ever knew except my mother  the british sailors were taking things comfortably being seated on the deck well forward and apparently enjoying the sail up the river even though they were going as prisoners rather than passengers who could come or depart at will  darius remained in the hold some time and when he showed himself again as if his work was done i asked what he had been about  ive been makin them two sneaks fast to a stanchion where they wont have any too good a time i reckon weve got to treat em somewhere near decent though it goes mightily agin the grain how is breakfast comin on i could eat the toughest mule that ever walked  fortunately for him jerry announced at this moment that the meal was ready and darius would have it that i should eat in the cuddy with the officer but i insisted he was the one who could best do the honors aboard the avenger when we had seamen as guests and literally forced him to act the host  dody wardwell and josiah coburn were detailed to feed the prisoners including the curs in the hold and jerry jim and i ate on the deck aft where i could at the same time keep the pungy in the channel  jim brought out some of the stores he had taken from home and we lads had a veritable feast with the cause of success to give flavor to food which could not be improved upon even though it had been served on a kings table  it is needless for me to set down all that was said during the forenoon when we sailed very slowly up the river chatting in friendly fashion with our prisonersmeaning such of them as were allowed to remain on deck or discussing our plans for the future among ourselves and as we did this last we almost unconsciously reckoned jim and his friends as belonging to the pungy in fact after what they had done toward helping out on the nights work it was no more than right they should be allowed to consider themselves as a portion of the avengers crew if so be their desire ran that way  it was half an hour past twelve oclock when we came in sight of the flotilla anchored off nottingham and seemingly blocking the river until it would have been difficult for anything larger than a canoe to pass through  where shall we find the commodore among all that crowd of vessels i asked in perplexity and darius replied promptly  hes like to be aboard the scorpion unless havin gone ashore at all events its there we should look for him  fortunately for us the schooner was anchored nearer down stream than the remainder of the craft and there was no difficulty in running the avenger alongside  you shall do the talking darius i said as jim freeman passed a hawser and his friends dropped the sails  ill look after that part of it so far as tellin joshua barney who you are but after that youll take the tiller for the owners of a vessel are the ones to show themselves  just then a kindlyfaced gentleman came from the schooners cabin and looked about as if asking how we dared to make fast alongside he was one whom i would have picked out for a good friend rather than a desperate fighter therefore my surprise was great when darius whisked off his hat made a great flourish as he bowed in sailorman fashion and said  were here to report for duty an it please you commodore barney though you wasnt moren a captain when i sailed under ye weve brought a few british prisoners an a couple of traitors  why bless my heart its darius thorpe the commander cried as if well pleased at seeing the old sailor whereupon darius bowed again grinning with delight until it seemed as if he would split his mouth from ear to ear  its the same old shellback sir only hes turned oysterman bein too stiff in the joints for much deepsea work  when your joints grow stiff darius i shall begin to look after mine but up to the present time theyre fit for a hornpipe almost any day is that your craft  no sir she is owned by these two lads and he pointed to jerry and me  and you have taken prisoners on your own account the commodore asked looking directly at me as he advanced nearer the rail therefore i felt called upon to reply  it was really darius who took the prisoners sir i made answer he planned the work and did most of the execution the rest of us simply obeyed his orders with the result that we have this officer and i pointed to the gentleman who was standing well forward as if to be out of earshot with three sailors all on parole in addition there are in the hold two men living on the river whom we found giving information to the enemy and aiding them in their spying  come aboard and let me hear the particulars the commodore said kindly and yet the words were a command  i beckoned to jerry and observing it the commander said  come with the lads darius thorpe it may be that i have particular need of you  we three clambered on to the schooners deck following the commodore into the cabin which was not fitted up very much better than our cuddy save that it had a fairsized table with chairs and here we seated ourselves as comfortably as if about to have speech with our equals  now tell me how it happens that you are on the patuxent river taking prisoners here and there without due warrant from the government at washington the commodore said with a smile and i began by explaining why we started in search of the fleet not forgetting to make mention of the fact that we had hoped to find a sale for fish or oysters  then i gave a detailed account of all that had happened to us winding up by saying  we count that youll take the prisoners from us sir because we havent overly much food for so large a number and if it so be you can buy such as we can catch it shall be at whatever price you set  do you think lad that i would encourage you to spend your time fishing when you have already shown yourselves capable of bigger things i can use darius to good advantage and i doubt not but that he may need you and your vessel are you minded to serve your country lad  ay sir if it so be she needs me but lads like jerry and me may be of more service as fishermen than as soldiers  regarding that i am not so certain because of the proof you have brought it strikes me that your pungy and her crew will well serve my turn you may deliver the prisoners to an officer whom i will send aboard and later in the day we will have another chat  then the commodore arose to his feet in token that the interview was at an end and we lads went out joshua barney saying to darius as he went up the companionway stairs  since your joints are so stiff it may be a good plan for you to stay aboard the sloop during the remainder of the day and then youll be on hand when im ready to see you  i was both surprised and pleased to know that the old man stood so well with the commander i had looked upon darius thorpe as a brokendown sailor but commodore barney appeared to have a far different idea on the subject  darius was actually puffed up with pride when he gained the deck of the avenger his face was as red as a beet and his mouth open so wide that i could have tossed a quart of oysters into it without spilling one  well lads he cried turning on jerry and me insistently youve seen the biggest man in this country an what do you think of him  neither jerry nor i could do less than praise the commodore for he had treated us in a friendly fashion but although we spoke our minds emphatically declaring that he was a very pleasant gentleman darius was not satisfied  i tell you hes the greatest man in the country he repeated and i am not certain but that he would have insisted on our saying the same over and over again if an officer from the schooner had not come to receive the prisoners  the officer and the sailors went over the rail on being told that they were to change quarters but it was necessary that the traitors be brought from the hold and i proposed that darius and jim freeman attend to such duty for i had no desire to set eyes on elias macomber again  lets you and i deliver some of these packages and messages with which we are charged i suggested to jerry by so doing we shall meet many old friends and i would if possible have speech with my father before seeing the commodore again  why jerry asked as if in surprise when we went into the cuddy to get the articles which were to be delivered  i was at a loss to make reply it would not be pleasant to tell the lad that i wanted my fathers advice before agreeing to serve under the commodore since he might believe that to be a cowards trick therefore i said after some hesitation  it is for him to say what i shall do surely a fellows father should decide anything of this kind  but your mother the same as told you to come  ay and i am here now i will see my father which is but natural do not spend so much time in idle words for i would be out of the pungy before those curs are brought from the hold  we had our arms full of packages by this time and it did not take us long to load them into the canoe after which we paddled among the fleet having a bundle or message for some person aboard nearly every craft in the river  it was not until our work was nearly done that i came upon my father and he received me as if expecting i would come  when did you arrive at benedict he asked  yesterday noon sir  you couldnt well have got here earlier because of the wind i allowed you would join us as soon as possible  then you think father that i should serve under the commodore taking the chances of losing the pungy after having paid so much money for her  dont you he asked sharply and i could do no less than reply as he expected i would  thus it was settled beyond a peradventure that the avenger and her crew should become a portion of commodore barneys flotilla and i really felt better in mind after the question had been definitely decided  we stopped long enough to give father a detailed account of our adventures and by the way he slapped me on the back after the story was brought to an end i knew that he felt right well pleased because i had begun serving my country in such a satisfactory manner  when we returned to the avenger after our round of visits we found jim freeman and his friends keeping ship in great style they were looking as proud as peacocks and i failed to understand the meaning of it all for ordinarily they were meek lads until jim whispered  the commodore is a mighty nice man  ay that he is i replied thinking that darius had been drilling the crew in our absence to sing the praises of joshua barney both in and out of season  were goin to have a chance to do some big things  why do you think so  because when darius gave the word that the pungy had better be hauled down stream a bit an anchored the commodore put a stop to it by allowin that he wanted this craft where he could put his hand on her  and because of that you think that we are to play an important part in this portion of the war eh  it looks like it for a fact jim replied strutting to and fro and i could not but laugh outright for the idea that we might be called upon to do more than any others seemed ridiculous  matters began to wear a different look a moment later however when an officer came over from the scorpion and said that the commodore would have speech with jerry and me  where is darius i asked looking around without seeing the old man  hes been aboard the schooner this last half hour an ive taken particular notice that everybody else is kept out of the cabin jim replied thats one reason why im so certain well have a soft time of it while we stay with the fleet  dont stand there chewin things over in your mind jerry said impatiently as i loitered near the helm it strikes me that when the commander of a fleet sends for a couple of lads they should step out right lively  jerry was right and i meekly followed him to the commodores cabin where we saw darius hobnobbing with joshua barney as if they were two old cronies  we lads saluted in as sailorly a fashion as was possible for we were not well up on such manners and the commodore said abruptly as he handed me a folded paper  here is a guarantee from the government through me as the commander of the naval forces in this section that if your vessel is captured or destroyed by the enemy while you are under my orders you are to be paid the sum of four hundred dollars  i was dumfounded of course it was pleasing to know that we would be paid a good price in case we lost the avenger but why such an arrangement should be made at this time was way beyond me until darius said  wouldnt it be a good idee sir if you was to tell the lads what is expected of em im not allowin theyd go contrary to what i said but it would be pleasanter all around if they got the business from your lips  it shall be as darius says and the commander halfturned in his chair to face jerry and me i propose that you shall continue to act as oystermen but without spending much time at the labor in other words i want information from the enemy such as you can gather and have spent considerable time explaining where and how you may communicate with me that part of the business need not be repeated this much you should know darius has said that you would do so far as possible whatever i might set for you now i want your pungy to drop down the river at once you are to act as if engaged in the peaceful occupation of fishing for oysters and try to sell your cargo to the enemy in other words lads you are to spy out the disposition of the british ships when they advance for i am convinced that as yet they remain in the lower bay  if i had been fainthearted before what shall be said of my condition now in plain words the commodore proposed that we turn spies and if we were caught while thus engaged we would make a speedy trip to the nearest british yardarm with a rope around our necks  jerry did not appear to realize the dangers of the undertaking proposed and when the commodore suggested that we had better get under way at once he started toward the companionway as if about to embark on some pleasure excursion  are we to take on any weapons i asked remembering the crippled muskets and how dangerous it might be to discharge them  oystermen do not carry modern arms joshua barney said curtly go exactly as if you were performing your regular work as indeed you are except that the price received for your wares does not cut any figure     chapter vi  feeding the enemy   it was evident that commodore barney did not propose to spend any more minutes with us explaining the proposition he had made and indeed it really was high time he attended to others for no less than four gentlemen of importance in nottingham had sent a request for an interview  when the commander arose to his feet after settling the question as to whether we should be prepared to defend ourselves in case the occasion required i started up the companionway stairs beckoning for jerry to follow  darius thorpe although he had been only a sailor understood somewhat of manners among people of gentility and he saluted properlywhich we had forgotten to dowhile awaiting an opportunity to ascend the stairs  it was as if we no longer had an existence so far as commodore barney was concerned we were not yet out of the cabin when he called an orderly to say that he would see such or such a man immediately and began turning over papers on his table without even glancing in our direction  once on board the avenger i stopped to face my comrades thinking that now has come the time we should discuss the matter which was of such vital importance to ourselves but darius said impatiently  why do you stop here lad give the word for gettin under way so the commodore may see we know how to obey in sailorman fashion an if theres any talkin to be done well have plenty of time for tongue waggin while runnin down the river  but surely youre not proposing that we shall start without knowing where we are going or what is to be done i cried showing quite as much impatience as he had  thats jest what i do propose we can whittle out a plan while the pungy is slippin down stream as well as if she was made fast here  but what about jim freeman and his party  theres no reason why they shouldnt go with us six isnt any too many for the crew of an oysterman  but do you count on taking them without first explaining the situation it strikes me that when a fellow sets about that which may put his neck in a halter he is entitled to something by way of an understanding  if thats all which blocks our makin sail ill soon put an end to it and darius beckoned to jim and his friends who were standing well forward that they might not seem to be listening to that which possibly was not intended for their ears  the lads came aft quickly knowing full well by the expression on our faces that something serious was afoot and the old man said bluntly  the commodore wants us to spy on the british fleets if were caught on their anchorage or nosin around the ships pretendin to be what were not its a case of hangin an salt wont save us if you lads want to stay aboard takin the same chances we do well an good if not youd better go ashore in quick order for we shall be under way mighty soon  shall we be helpin the government the same as if we stayed aboard one of the vessels to do our share of fightin jim asked and darius replied  yes an a good deal more if you were taken prisoner after bein in a fight its only a case of goin to jail on one of his majestys ships but if youre taken while on such work as has been given out to us its a hangin for sure with you at the loose end of the rope  no one could say that darius had not put the matter plainly and i expected to see jim draw back but to my surprise he said stoutly  i reckon we fellows can stand it if you do well stay an the commodore shant have a chance to say that we didnt hold up our end of the business  surely i could make no protest of any kind after jim had announced himself so firmly and in order to make it appear that i was really eager to set forth on this dangerous expedition i said quickly  cast off there darius take the tiller tail on the halliards lads  we got under way in fine style and as the pungy swung around with the current i saw my father waving his hat from the craft to which he belonged and thus knew he understood we were bound on some service for the commander  nor was he the only one who bade us a mute adieu half the members of the fleet made some quiet demonstration in token of good wishes and just then it seemed almost a fine thing to be thus voluntarily going into extraordinary danger for the benefit of ones friends and acquaintances  i am well aware that by writing down all my thoughts i have pictured myself as a weakkneed lad and one who delighted in making a show of authority as has been seen when i was disgruntled because jerry or darius took it upon themselves to say that this thing or that should be done without first consulting me and yet i hold it is only fair i give the same plain dealing concerning myself as i try to in the case of my companions  now however as we were setting out on a cruise from which not one of us might return i was more than glad to surrender up to darius the charge of the avenger and i was determined that he should keep it taking whatsoever of honor might come to the commander contenting myself with being simply a member of the crew who would ever strive to obey all orders promptly whatever might be the situation and in so doing i counted myself to be wise  the old man remained at the helm speaking not a word and chewing vigorously as we worked the pungy down the reaches in face of a head wind not very strong at that but the current favored therefore we had the satisfaction of knowing that with all our pulling and hauling we were doing better than two and a half miles an hour  i had expected darius would propose that we hold a consultation as to our future course but he gave no sign of so doing and jerry finally asked  where are we headin for  fishin  i turned away thinking the old man had given an idle answer to evade questions but jerry was not to be turned down so readily and he said with a laugh  weve given over the fishin business for quite a spell i reckon cordin to my way of thinkin an seeins how this cruise may turn out to be anything rather than a picnic i allow that all hands should know what is to be done  thats my idee to a dot lad an im tryin to think up some kind of a plan so that when you fellows begin to figger i can put in my oar with some show of sense  but where do you reckon that were bound for  fishin lad where else can we be bound  i turned again understanding now that the old man was serious and asked him if he supposed we could do any spying on the british fleet while we were wasting time getting oysters or fish  didnt the commodore allow that we should keep right on bein oystermen darius asked with just a shade of impatience how do you expect we can sneak around the british fleet unless weve got some excuse for goin there it was in joshua barneys mind the way i looked at it that we might sell oysters to the fleet which would account for our bein among the vessels an to do that weve got to put in a cargo  it was plain enough now that the old man had spoken of it and i understood that we had a bit of dredging before us in order to make ready for the more important portion of the work  but after we get a load darius shall we sail boldly down the bay asking the britishers to buy  thats what ive been tryin to make out all of you can figger it cordin to your own idees an then well talk it over  surely this was putting it fairly and we tried to follow the old mans advice or at least i did but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion the only plan i could put together was that we first get our wares and then blunder ahead trying to sell them trusting to luck for the rest  we were a silent crew for some time as each fellow tried to think up some brilliant scheme and then when midnight was nearly come we had arrived off benedict  why not go ashore for an hour jerry suggested and all of us gladly agreed i in particular because i wished to see my mother once more now there was no petulance in my heart on account of her willingness to have me go into danger  darius had no relatives or even very near friends in the village therefore he volunteered to keep ship and jim freeman set us ashore in the canoe taking two at a trip after which each fellow went his way  my mother was overjoyed at seeing me so soon again even though i aroused her from sleep to open the door and asked so many questions that i could do no less than tell her all which had happened since i last saw her  she was frightened at learning what we were about to do and showed it plainly but never a word did she speak against the project  if it is your duty amos i have nothing to say although i wish most heartily that others had been pushed forward into danger and in thus speaking i am selfish for then some other mothers heart would ache be as prudent as you can without being cowardly my boy and may god be ever with you it is believed in the village that elias macomber has gone to join the british because he has not been seen since last night but if he should escape amos  there is little fear of that mother i replied confidently commodore barney is not the man darius has pictured him if he allows such a villain to escape  after this we talked of family matters until i went up stairs to look at my sisters and brother who were asleep then the visit was come to an end and i went out into the night with a heavy heart but determined that my family should have no cause to blush for me  i was the first to arrive at the shore and lying at full length in the canoe i waited until my comrades returned from their visit  jerry and jim came in company and appeared to be excited over something therefore to draw them on without asking any questions i repeated what my mother had said concerning elias macomber  ay that was the talk in town this forenoon jerry replied but now people are saying that he came back just before sunset  back here to benedict i cried in amazement  ay jims mother saw him as he went by her house on the way to his own she saluted him but he made no reply  but to be here he must have escaped i interrupted unable to hold my peace the commodore would not have set him at liberty without telling us  that goes without sayin an now what shall we do jerry asked as if he had some plan in mind  what can we do except to get away before he brings some of his cronies down here to make a row  jerry wants to catch him over again jim replied since my partner did not speak if hes alone in his house it wouldnt be such a dreadful hard job surely not as compared with what we did at the mill  it seemed as if our own safety demanded that we give some especial attention to the traitor and i proposed that we consult with darius at once  this was agreeable to my companions and we boarded the avenger without delay rousing the old man to bitter wrath when we told that elias had escaped  somebody will smart for bein so careless he cried joshua barney aint the man to overlook anythin of that kind do you allow there may be traitors in the fleet it looks mightily like it when a coward like macomber can give em the slip inside of twelve hours for if he was seen in this town at sunset he must have been at liberty by noon ay even before we got under way  jerry thinks we might catch him again by going at once to his home i said impatient to make the attempt or set sail for i was not easy in mind at lying there while the villain was free  and jerry is right darius exclaimed darting into the cuddy and returning in a twinkling with the old muskets see that these are well loaded lads an if we can lay hands on that cur again ill attend to it that he dont walk off like a gentleman at large within any very short time  well we found the weapons in fit condition for immediate use and paddled ashore in a hurry finding josiah and dody waiting for us they also had heard that elias was in the village and we knew beyond a peradventure even if we had not been certain before that the cur had slipped away from those who should have guarded him with their lives  it was not a long walk to macombers house and on arriving there we found the building closely shuttered as if deserted but we were not for taking outside indications as facts  although knowing full well that we were not proceeding in accordance with the law since we had no authority for forcing an entrance into a dwelling we burst open the rear door and made thorough examination of the place  the household goods were tossed and tumbled about as if some one had lately been there having little time to spare but no living thing could be found  the traitor had no children therefore flight with his wife would be comparatively easy and i was convinced that he had gone down the river intending to claim protection from the enemy  thats what he has done darius said emphatically when i gave words to my belief it stands to reason that he went away in a boat an theres just a chance we may come up with him yet lets get on board lads an if the avenger knows how to sail well bring it out of her this night  then we returned with all speed to the shore but i had little hope we could overtake the traitor because he had at least three or four hours the start and a canoe might be paddled twice as fast as the pungy would sail with such a light wind  darius however seemed certain we would overtake him and urged us lads to greater speed or more severe exertions until the little vessel was under way gliding down the river but little faster than the current would carry a canoe even though no paddles were used  so eager in the chase was darius that he would not allow either of us to go below but insisted that all hands remain on the lookout lest we overrun the game and losing no little time as he swung the avenger in close to this bank or that where the overhanging foliage afforded a hiding place for a small boat  not until daylight did we arrive off st leonards bay and it goes without saying that we had seen nothing of our traitor neither had we come across a craft of any kind  hes bound now to go on until he overtakes the british fleet darius said angrily when the coming of daylight revealed the shores to us well have the best of him once were out of the river  you cant keep up the chase much longer if we count on gettin a cargo of oysters jerry suggested and the old man declared that he would never throw over a dredge until it became certain that macomber had really escaped us  but after some reflection he was willing to take back his words knowing we could not go very far into the lower bay without some excuse for being there and also realizing that we must never pursue elias within sight of any vessel of the fleet otherwise he might give such information as would cut short our career in this world  with the coming of the new day the wind came out of the west with a force that gave promise of providing the pungy with a goodly sized bone in her teeth and in case macomber was no more than two hours in advance there was yet some possibility of overtaking him  we usually dredged for oysters off hog point or parkers creek therefore in a short time we would be on the fishing grounds unless we took the risk of standing across the mouth of the potomac on the chance of seeing the traitor and i did not believe he would venture to make that long stretch while the breeze was so strong  by the time we arrived at the mouth of the river there was no necessity of discussing the situation for the chase had surely come to an end  however great his need of coming up with the british elias macomber knew too much to trust himself in a canoe on the open bay while the wind held as it did and we knew beyond a peradventure that if he had not already gained the fleet he was hiding on shore somewhere  it would be folly to spend time in such a needleinthehaystack business as looking for him on shore when we had no clue to guide us as even darius was forced to admit and therefore we set about the work in hand which was the dredging of oysters enough to give us excuse for seeking out the enemy  it seemed to all of us that we were in more danger through information which elias might give than we would have been while playing the spy with him safely cared for on one of the vessels of commodore barneys flotilla and we went about the work as if it was possible to feel the chafing of british halters around our necks  we began dredging exactly as we would have done had we been trying to get a cargo for the baltimore market and never a sail did we see during all that day a fact which told us that the enemy was not yet ready to open his campaign  not until well into the night would darius allow that we had a sufficient quantity of oysters to warrant us in finding purchasers and even then there was no more than fifteen bushels aboard  it will do for a starter jerry said when jim freeman proposed that we spend one more day dredging  but the first britisher we came across would buy as many as weve got jim objected and jerry replied with the air of one who has thoroughly turned the matter over in his mind  so much the better we shall then have established ourselves in the business and can come back for another cargo there will be less suspicion of us the second time  i reckon youre right lad darius said decidedly we cant expect to gather much of any news the first pop an if we get acquainted it will be a long step in the right direction  as a matter of course the old mans opinion settled the question and we hauled around for a run down the bay double reefing the mainsail and jib as was proper when you take into consideration the fact that we had the same as no cargo aboard to give the pungy stiffness  up to this time neither one had made any proposition as to how we were to begin operations and i naturally concluded that we would sail boldly up to the first craft we saw asking if we could sell them oysters therefore i suggested when we were standing off on a course that would bring us on to the tangier islands  if we keep up this rate of speed we may come upon the enemy while it is yet night  ay lad an im thinkin it would be a good plan  but people dont go out sellin things before daylight i said with a laugh  im countin on bein properly interduced darius replied with a grin if were hailed an ordered to lay by till mornin we shall have one ships crew thatll listen to us  i did not understand this explanation more than if it had been given in latin but the others appeared to be satisfied and i held my peace rather than display ignorance  we kept our course a couple of hours and then directly in a line with the tangiers i saw the loom of what appeared to be a large ship  theres one of the fleet i said in a whisper to darius who was at the tiller and he replied in a matteroffact tone  ay lad im allowin shes the severn or the narcissus both of which made it hot for the commodore in the patuxent  how large are they  the severn should be carryin thirtyeight guns an the other four less if i remember rightly  i had rather we made our first attempt with a smaller vessel i said feeling decidedly uncomfortable in mind now we were so near beginning the dangerous work  bless you lad we might as well be overhauled by a frigate as a sloop so far as the chances of bein found out are concerned but were goin through this business as slick as we did at the mill  darius held the avenger straight for the enemy and when we were come within half a musketshot i heard the hail we had been expecting  sloop ahoy  ay ay sir darius cried  what craft is that  an oyster pungy with part of a cargo which were hopin to sell sir can we do any business with you  heave to an lay alongside until daylight  very well sir the old man cried and then he let fly a lot of orders to us of the crew which would have shamed a landsman to utter for of a verity no sailor could have understood them  however by giving no heed to what he said we brought the avenger into position but i soon saw that the tide was setting us away from the britisher and suggested that we let go the anchor  to this the old man would not agree  obey orders if you break owners he said with a grin and i knew he had some reason for thus being so foolish  however to make a long story short we remained hove to until day dawned and then we were within a cables length of a large ship while a mile or more further up the bay was the vessel that had first hailed  ahoy on the sloop came from the second ship and darius replied in the tone of a countryman  ay ay sir  why are you loafing around here  we came down to sell some oysters but the chap on tother craft told us to heave to an weve been driftin round here ever since i dunno whether we oughter go back to him or try to sell you what few bushels weve got  when did you take them  last night oh theyre fresh enough if thats what youre thinkin of dont you want to try em  what is the price  ten cents a bushel thats what we oughter get up to baltimore an i reckon we might knock off a little if we dont have to run there to unload  then without waiting for permission darius began giving us fool orders intended to get the pungy under way and we came lumbering around under the ships starboard where we could have been blown into the next world with no more labor than the lighting of a match  darius lifted one of the hatches and leaped into the hold ordering us to bear a hand lively that the gentlemen might taste the oysters and passing up a basket full shouting to me so loudly that he could readily have been heard on the ship  pass em over the side bubby dear an be careful how you fool round the rail  i should have laughed at his manner of speaking but that i knew he was playing a part and i did my best to obey the command  the sailors of the ship eager for anything by way of a change of food held out both hands invitingly for the fish and i contrived to swing the basket aboard  then it was that i saw an officer take charge of the fish calling for the after steward to come forward and a moment later some one cried  wheres your captain  i sung out for darius but he pretended to misunderstand and replied  they can have the lot for eight cents a bushel ask em if i shall begin takin em out  then it was that i fancied he had some good reason for wanting to remain out of sight and i looked around in alarm to see what had caused the trouble     chapter vii  an old acquaintance   jerry was at the tiller jim freeman and his friends stood near me at the mainhatch ready to obey the commands of darius and since all hands of us with the exception of josiah coburn really were oystermen knowing no other business or trade there was little reason for the britishers to have any suspicions regarding us  it was evident however that darius had seen something to cause him alarm otherwise he would not remain in the hold having a care to keep out of sight while he might be seeing much which would please the commander to hear about  so far as i could make out the britishers regarded us as ignorant fishermen who were trying to earn a very slim livelihood by selling oysters at a price which would hardly pay enough to provide food for a crew the size of ours  three or four of the petty officers were making very awkward attempts to open the shells with a marlinspike while the idle crew having nothing better to do watched the proceedings on their ship as well as aboard our craft  i was not looking for an explanation of the old mans behavior among the seamen therefore gave little heed to the old shellbacks who lined the starboard rail from the forecastledeck to the mainmast  gaze intently as i might it was impossible to see anything which could have caused darius uneasiness and i dismissed the matter from my mind with the belief that he remained hidden from view simply to avoid being recognized as an old sailor whom it would pay to impress into his majestys service  it was just when i was growing a trifle more cheerful in mind because of having banished the fears which assailed me when the old man leaped so suddenly into the hold that one of the officers called out  here you bubby come aboard and show us how to open these shellfish  will one of your men stand by for our line sir i asked because the pungy was bobbing around on the small waves ten feet or more from the ships side and i was not minded to take the chances of jumping for the rail when there was good possibility of landing in the water  the britisher said something to the knot of men forward and several of them stepped forward overhanging the rail while jerry made ready to pass one of the small hawsers  i stopped only long enough to get one of our oysterknives from the cuddy and by that time the avenger was alongside the ship rubbing against the huge fenders which had been swung out  at the moment there was no thought of fear in my mind because i was thus venturing into the very jaws of the lion i had it in mind only to play my part well and believed that by showing the gentlemen how easily the shells might be opened i would be forwarding our business  much to my surprise when i would have clambered aboard the ship whose rail towered many feet above ours one of the sailors leaned far over to give me aid when it was not really needed he grasped both my hands in a grip as of iron holding me back when it appeared that he would pull me aboard and while i was thus hampered i heard him whisper  tell darius thorpe to be to the eastward of the tangiers this night  having thus spoken he hauled me inboard quickly disappearing immediately among the throng of men which literally covered the ships deck  well bubby have you gone daft  this aroused me to the consciousness that i was playing my part very badly and i quickly went to the afterhatchway where was our basket of oysters around which several officers were standing  without speaking i whipped out the oysterknife and using the combing of the hatch as a bench set about opening the shells as rapidly as the most expert could have done  the gentlemen were so astonished at seeing me do readily what they had failed at that i had a good two dozen fat oysters ready for the eating before any one made an attempt at swallowing them  from that out until the basket was emptied i was kept busy and although i searched with my eyes while thus engaged it was impossible to single out the sailor who had sent the message to darius  when there was nothing before me but shells and one of the officers asked if my father was going to send more aboard i thought it would be more in keeping with my part to act like a lad who was eager to receive money for his cargo therefore i replied that we would send the whole load aboard at the rate of eight cents a bushel  to this proposition the gentleman agreed and i called out for the others to begin slinging the baskets up counting on lending a hand to take them over the rail but i was not allowed to abandon my job of oysteropener  i worked as lively as i ever did in my life and it surely seemed as if i would not be allowed to go on board the avenger until the entire cargo had been eaten therefore i called for jerry to help me after our small lot had been dumped on the ships hold  darius did not come out of the hold he had good excuse for remaining there while we were unloading but once the pungy was empty i greatly feared suspicions might be aroused by his remaining hidden from view  not until jerry and i had opened a full two bushels and given one of the cooks a few lessons in the manner of holding a knife to the best advantage while shucking were we allowed to cease the tiresome labor for it must be known that we did not claim to be experts at such work  one of the officers paid us for the cargo and agreed to take as many every other day while they remained at that station  as if eager to know how long we might find a ready market thereabouts i asked if he could tell me when there was a possibility of the ships being moved but he shut his mouth as close as any of our oysters saying that it was enough for us to know that they would patronize us while they remained there consequently i did not succeed in getting any information for commodore barney  i explained my reasons for asking such a question by saying that it would be a waste of time for us to sail down the bay when the fleets were not there because our only other market was at annapolis or baltimore and he said with a laugh  when were not here you can look for us further north and we will take your oysters wherever we go  i observed that we were on board the narcissus and thus understood that darius had made no mistake when he gave that name to the ship therefore my admiration for the old mans knowledge of nautical matters increased for only an experienced seaman could have thus recognized a craft he had seen but once before  by setting down so much when our business was concluded it would appear as if we loafed on the deck of the ship some time whereas we were given to understand that our room was better than our company immediately the transaction was completed and in a very few seconds after the officers allowed jerry and i to cease the labor of shucking we were aboard the avenger getting under way  look at the name theyve given that old bargee one of the gentlemen on the quarterdeck cried with a laugh as the pungy swung around until the letters on her stern could be read these americans may be hot for vengeance but i take notice that theyre ready to feed the enemy if theres a dollar to be made  all this seemed very funny to the britishers and they cracked many a quip and joke at our expense as i guessed by the roars of laughter which could be heard so long as we were within earshot  darius came on deck once we had filled away but he kept his hat pulled well down over his face as he walked aft from the mainhatch and when he had taken the tiller i asked  what were you afraid of that you kept under cover so close  it was a mighty snug shave lad he replied with a long indrawing of the breath i knew one of the men on the forecastle deck cause i was shipmate with him on the privateer honest ben when joshua barney was in command im not sayin that hed given me away but i feared he might sing out on seein me  what is his name  bill jepson hes a baltimore man but whether hes there owin to fallin in with a pressgang or on account of his own free will its hard to say though i never believed bill would willingly have served the king  he wants you to be to the eastward of the tangiers this night i said and the old man started as if he had been struck by a bullet  how do you know lad  then i told him when the sailor had had speech with me and again repeated the message  that shows as how poor bill was pressed into the service darius said sympathetically an now hes countin that an old shipmate will lend a hand  which of course you will do i cried hotly  we must make some kind of a turn to favor him but were here on the commodores business an the question is whether well be warranted in doin what may turn all the plans upside down bill reckons to slip over the side an swim ashore if were roundabout here the britishers will count it for certain that we had a hand in the desertion an the avenger may be taken from us before weve got well into our work the kings officers aint noways easy in handlin them as tries to get the best of em  but if the man swims for the islands expectin to find us and were not there hell be retaken  ay lad an most likely dance at the yardarm for desertion  then of course we must help him and i beckoned to jerry knowing full well he would fall into my way of thinking  before anything could be said between my partner and me however the avenger had come off the severn and we received peremptory orders to heave to  why didnt you remain alongside as you were told an officer asked angrily when the pungy was at a standstill and darius replied  the current carried us down the bay durin the night an when mornin came the captain of that other ship ordered us alongside sir he bought our cargo an agreed to take more so if youd like to trade with us we can have fifteen or twenty bushels here by tomorrow night in case the wind holds  i could see that two or three of the gentlemen on the quarterdeck put their heads together as if talking about us and then the one who had first spoken ordered us to lay alongside  theyre goin to search us an it may be ill have an invite to stop aboard quite a spell darius said half to himself as he swung the pungy around preparatory to obeying orders  then why do we go alongside it wouldnt take many minutes to run out of range i said excitedly  theyd sink us in a twinkling an even though i knew we might give em the slip it shouldnt be done cause we couldnt come here again which neverd suit the commodore  the possibility that any of our crew might be pressed into service on board the ship frightened me as may be imagined but i understood even while making the suggestion that we could not hope to escape and the fate of poor tom sackett was pictured before me  there was no way out of it however but my knees were very weak when we ranged up under the starboard guns waiting like criminals until his majestys officers should work their will regardless of right or wrong  darius was the one who stood in the most danger for it could readily be seen that he was an old sailor but he never turned a hair one would have said to see him that nothing was more pleasant than to thus be overhauled and he made a most awkward flourish by way of a bow when we were come into position  jim freeman passed a hawser and when it was made fast a midshipman who acted as if he owned the whole of chesapeake bay came aboard with two marines  the little whippersnapper poked his nose into the cuddy and pretended to be nearly overcome by the odor of the place therefore he sent the marines below to overturn everything in the bunks as if believing we had somebody hidden there  the soldiers came up with our three old muskets and the little whifflet demanded in a tone of authority to be told why we went so well armed  we carry em sir sos we can get a mess of ducks now an then darius replied as respectfully as if he had been speaking to the king they aint any great shakes of guns seeins how all of em are rusted pretty bad but we oystermen cant afford anythin better  one would have thought the little ape had found three or four thirtytwo pounders by the way he passed them up over the rail for the inspection of the officers on the quarterdeck and then he turned his attention to the hold  i heard the gentlemen laughing as they looked at our weapons and in a twinkling the pieces were thrown down on the deck with so little care that the hammer of one was broken off short to the lock but those who served the king had little care how they destroyed the property of those whose crime consisted in being born americans  the midshipman got one whiff from the hold which im free to admit wasnt pleasing and the soldiers were sent below while he stood with a handkerchief decked out with lace held to his nose as if in danger of fainting  as a matter of course nothing was found below save a lot of mud and some oyster shells a blind man might have seen that so far as the vessel was concerned she could be nothing more than an honest oysterman but the whifflet forced the marines to search over every portion of the hold and while this was being done one of the officers asked how many bushels we sold to those of the narcissus  darius replied to the question speaking as nearly unlike a sailor as possible and not until he had stated the price showing british silver as proof of the amount received was the curiosity of the gentleman satisfied  then the midshipman clambered over the side of the ship to make his report and the moment had come when if any of our number were to be taken from us we would be made aware of it  i stood by the side of darius trembling with apprehension and even amid my fear i took note of the fact that jerry was feeling far from comfortable in mind while the old man chewed incessantly on a huge piece of tobacco that caused his cheeks to swell out as if on the point of bursting  although we had good cause for being frightened nothing came of it and never did words sound more sweetly in my ears than when one of the officers said  you can get on about your business but dont make the mistake again of trying to get below us without first reporting  we wasnt countin on goin very far away sir darius replied awkwardly theres good fishin to be found around the islands here an i was reckonin on gettin the drags out  very well but see to it that you heave to when coming nearabout and remain until getting permission to proceed  yes sir ill do it for certain darius cried and as one of the britishers crew cast off our hawser we filled away standing to the northeast  there was not one aboard the avenger who did not realize what a narrow escape we had had from being forced to serve the king and i dare venture to say that all hands drew a breath of relief as the pungy sailed beyond range of the big guns  where are you bound jerry asked when he was sufficiently master of himself to note the course  i reckon well run over to pocomoke well find oysters in that locality such as they are an theres no need of running too far away from the market  youre goin to lend bill jepson a hand i cried joyfully for it would have gone far toward breaking my heart to turn a deaf ear to the poor fellows appeal  thats just what i aint so clear about darius replied thoughtfully suppose we talk the matter over a bit  i called jim freeman and his friends aft knowing full well what their opinion would be and when we were together repeated the story as i had told it to the old man  then darius explained that by helping a sailor to desert from one of the enemys ships we might get into serious difficulties to say nothing of losing the sloop and he also put it very plainly that in going outside the task set us we stood a good chance of disappointing the commodore  it was jerry who put the matter to my liking when he said  there are chances in favor of our bein able to do this without interferin with the work set for us by the commodore but there isnt much hope for the sailor if he swims over to the tangiers an fails of findin us waitin for him you say hell be hanged if they catch him tryin to desert i dont believe i could sleep well nights if we should leave this place an he met with his death  all hands of us felt much as did jerry and after thinking the matter over a moment darius said slowly as if choosing well his words  you lads must understand that im as hot for helpin bill as you can be but were doin our little part in a war an at such times the life of one man dont count for very much when the good of others is concerned to tell the truth i couldnt really say what we oughter do if i studied the thing over for four an twenty hours you lads own this ere pungy an i allow you have the right to say somethin as to what shall be done with her though you the same as put the craft out of your keepin when you took a guarantee from the commodore that so many dollars should be paid in case she was lost well consider it as settled an now get to work swing out the drags an well let the britishers see that were fishin even though it aint noways likely well get much here  i am free to confess that darius words made me a bit uneasy in mind regarding our deciding the matter for i knew full well that he had spoken no more than the truth it would be hard on bill jepson if we gave him the cold shoulder but by trying to lend a hand we might be doing others a wrong  however the question had been decided and there was little sense in crying over spilled milk for i was not minded to make any effort at bringing about a change of opinion therefore i turned to with the others that we might appear to be industriously fishing  darius stood to the eastward until we were in pocomoke bay and there we stood a good show of getting fifteen or twenty bushels before it would be time to be at the rendezvous appointed by bill jepson  during all this while we had the enemys fleets in fairly good view for the vessels appeared to be to the northward of new point but as a matter of course it could be of little benefit to the commodore to know how many vessels there were if we could not give him any idea of their weight of metal  it was nearly noon before we got breakfast and when the meal was come to an end we had struck some small oyster beds therefore we were kept jumping from that time until dark and then had on board a good twenty bushels of fair stock not enough from a moneymaking point of view but plenty to serve our purpose for it might not be well to let the britishers think we could take on a cargo quickly  now the greater portion of this time we were in view of those aboard the two vessels we had visited and by using their spyglasses it would have been possible for them to make out what we were doing  once the night began to shut in however we were out of sight and darius said as we hauled in the drags for the last time  now well run over for the tangiers lads an stay there till two or three oclock in the mornin if bill dont show up by that time we must count that he couldnt get away or was caught in the act  are you simply reckoning on laying off the islands i asked understanding that a man might swim ashore at one point while we were at another and easily fail of finding us  i reckon that some of us will take to the canoe an cruise off the western shore lookin for him his best time for makin the try will be when the last dogwatch goes off duty at eight oclock or again at midnight it wont be easy to paddle round so long but its a mans life that youre after  jerry and i will go in the canoe i said thinking it no more than right for us to perform the greatest share of the labor since we were held by darius responsible for making the attempt to aid the sailor  we made a hearty supper that night eating the last of the ham and frying a generous quantity of oysters with it and then the pungy was hove to on the westward side of the large island as near inshore as we dared to run  i proposed that she be anchored lest the wind set her on the beach but darius claimed that it was necessary for us to be ready to leave at a moments notice and promised to have an eye on the craft all the while we were absent  then jerry and i took to the canoe with good prospect of half a nights work before us and paddled around to the eastward after which we set about going back and forth for a distance of a quarter of a mile since that seemed to be the place a man naturally would make for  we could see the riding lights of the ship plainly and although it would require considerable labor to swim so far it should be readily done by one who was at all familiar with the work  wed find ourselves in a pretty hobble if a boat put off from the ship just now jerry said in a low tone and i was angry with him for having offered such a suggestion there was enough in the venture to make a fellow nervous without conjuring up all the possibilities at a time when one needed to have his wits about him  we wont think of anything except trying to pick the poor man up i said sharply this isnt the kind of work that suits me and im not so coldblooded that i can picture out all the trouble which may come upon us  a fellow cant help thinkin jerry replied grumpily and i said yet more curtly  he neednt talk about it to mix others up then angered with myself for having spoken so petulantly i added to tell the truth jerry i am as frightened as a lad well can be and dont dare to talk overly much lest i should show the white feather in a way to make you ashamed of me  you cant be any worse off than i am my partner replied and then we both laughed softly an acknowledgment of our timorousness seemed to hearten us and we worked the paddles in a more wholesouled fashion  as i have said we decided to pull back and forth on a line about a quarter of a mile long and all the while kept a sharp watch in the direction of the vessel for a swimmers head on the water is not a very large object to see in the night  we did not dare indulge in much conversation and during an hour we had not spoken once but then i said thinking to spare ourselves useless labor  if he slipped off at eight oclock he should have been here by this time we may as well lay still till midnight  i had hardly ceased speaking when we heard a sound as of some one whistling softly and nothing more was needed to tell us that bill jepson had succeeded in slipping away from the ship     chapter viii  the deserter   even after knowing that the deserter was near at hand we had considerable difficulty in locating him and not until after making a complete circle around the swimmer could i see his head  as we came alongside he grasped the gunwale to rest himself and asked  are you from the oysterman  ay shant we take you aboard now the pungy is on the other side of the island  the canoe would be overturned if i attempted to come over the rail paddle into shoaler water an ill try it  tired out i asked as we worked the craft toward the shore he still holding by the gunwale  nothin to speak of when its a case of escapin from the britishers id tried this a week ago if i hadnt known that the first search would be made on the island an i didnt dare take the chances of findin them as would help me off  we were not many moments in coming to the beach and then bill jepson clambered over the stern not being hampered overly much by wet clothing since he had come off with nothing save his trousers and shirt  i was willin to leave all my dunnage providin i could say good by to the bloomin ship when we put in here i counted on seein friends most anywhere for i hail from baltimore way but darius thorpes was the first friendly face i came across a good honest sailorman is darius an i knew he wouldnt leave me in a hole if it was possible for him to lend a hand  jepson had nothing startling to tell relative to his escape from the ship when the watch was changed he quietly slipped over the side dropping into the water without making any disturbance and swimming beneath the surface coming up to breathe only when it was absolutely necessary until he was a full halfmile from the severn  as we paddled around the island putting in our best strokes for we had no desire to be found in that vicinity when it was discovered on the british ship that one of the crew had deserted i asked jepson how he chanced to be aboard the enemys vessel and while his story related to a cruel wrong it was in no wise exciting or unusual  five months before the declaration of war he was taken from an american merchantman on the flimsy pretex of being an english citizen and since then had led what he called a dogs life aboard several of the kings ships never before had he seen an opportunity to escape and now he knew full well that if caught he would be hanged  now that we had the man i began to question as to what should be done with him for it was certain we must not take the chances of keeping him aboard the avenger and i could well understand that he might not want to remain if we were to fish in that vicinity  it seemed almost as if he read that which was in my mind for he said after a long time of silence  im only half free now for your pungy will be searched if you go anywhere near the narcissus again an the question is how i am to get to the mainland  we could put you ashore in maryland i suggested  yes an id starve to death before gettin anywhere unless you ran further up the bay than i allow youve any right to go he said with a laugh which had in it nothing of mirth  whats the sense of stewin over that part of it now jerry asked wait till you get aboard the pungy an i dare say darius will have a plan all worked out  hes a good one is darius an when he settles on a thing it comes mighty near bein sound well wait an ill spell one of you lads with a paddle if youll give me a show  after swimming so far i reckon youd better lay still i replied and from that time until we ran alongside the avenger not a word was spoken between us  if i had expected to see anything affecting in the meeting between the two old shipmates i was mistaken  darius who was on the lookout for us as may be supposed said when he saw that the canoe had three occupants  so you got him eh well bill jepson wasnt born to be drowned thats certain  then the old man passed us a line and the deserter said as he went over the rail  i knew i could depend on you darius  you made a mistake this time bill for if the boys hadnt hogged up agin it id left you to do the best you could seeins were down here on a bit of work for commodore joshua barney whose fleet is in the patuxent river as perhaps you have heard  well there i knew you wouldnt be foolin round here oysterin while able seamen are likely in good demand id be well fixed if i could run across the commodore just now  thats what ive been thinking of course it dont stand to reason you can stay here a great many hours  i must be off before daylight an am countin on your tellin me where  what do you know about the britishers  considerable which has been picked up from the marines whove been on duty aft there wont be any move made for two or three days an then theyre goin to strike washington an baltimore at the same time sir peter parker goes to our home an captain gordon will run up the potomac leastways thats what we of the gundeck have heard an you know that what leaks through the sentries is most generally to be counted on  ever been up the patuxent river darius asked abruptly  only two or three times  well thats where you oughter be tellin the commodore all you know an if the three of you agree heres a plan well try  darius looked at jerry and me as he spoke therefore i understood that we were counted as two of the three to whom he referred  im agreeable to anythin you figger out darius bill jepson said as he wrung the water from his scanty clothing  well then amos an jerry shall take you in the canoe an start for nottingham within the next ten minutes since they left to look for you ive been fixin up a sail for the craft an with a breeze like this you oughter be well across the potomac by sunrise  dont you need the lads with you jepson asked as jerry and i looked at each other in surprise and perhaps displeasure  yes but not so much as i need to hear from the commodore after he knows what youve got to say  the britishers are certain to search this craft twixt now an tomorrow night an seein the canoe is gone may smell a rat the deserter suggested  i reckoned all that in with my figgerin if you start for the patuxent river i shall run over to the delaware shore an pick up a boat somewhere  they knew how much of a crew you had when the oyster bargain was made  well what if the boys went ashore to go home for a couple of days that yarn will go down i reckon an if it dont ill have to take the chances for the sake of gettin you to joshua barney as soon as it can be done  darius had evidently considered the plan well and i understood that nothing would turn him from it unless one of us flatly refused to carry it into execution which considering all the importance of getting information to the commodore i was not prepared to do at the same time the idea of going back to nottingham in no better craft than our canoe was by no means to my liking  if youve got it worked out darius thorpe an allow it should be done im ready bill jepson said an it aint noways strange that i should be willin to jump at anythin considerin im like to go to the yardarm if captured now  the old man looked inquiringly at jerry and my partner said slowly much as if not being exactly certain what he thought of the scheme  im willin to go if it so be you want to keep the pungy here but cordin to my way of thinkin the chances are against our gettin there in the canoe  you can do it if the wind dont breeze up an it aint likely to at this time of the year then as if considering the question settled absolutely darius cried out to jim have you stowed everythin in the canoe  ay sir an ive taken all the provisions for them so well be left to suck our thumbs when we get right hungry  darius not only planned the journey while we were absent but had gone ahead with the preparations as if advised in advance that we would agree to it  well there was no use in hanging back since the thing must be done and i had sense enough to know that if we were going to make the venture the sooner it was begun the better chance we had for succeeding therefore i went over the rail into the canoe where i found a small spritsail a package of food and one musket with powder and balls sufficient for two or three charges  weve done the best we could by you lad darius called out as he saw me examining the cargo youll soon be where you can lay in a good supply  yes if we dont go to the bottom first i replied just a trifle sharply whereat darius replied with a laugh  ill trust you for that part of the business bill jepson should be a master hand with a paddle an take it all in all youre bound to push ahead right fast  how are we to find you again jerry asked  the commodore will attend to that part of it well stay here foolin around as agreed upon for a weekunless we get important news before then an if you havent shown up ill allow that joshua barney set you about other business  jerry and bill jepson took their places in the canoe the latter stepping the small spar to which the bit of canvas was rigged and as i ran a paddle out over the stern to take the place of a rudder i was astonished at feeling that the little craft was making remarkably good headway  almost at the same moment we started the pungy was hauled around for the delaware shore and in less than five minutes she was lost to view in the darkness  how is she doin the old sailor asked as he leaned over to watch the rush of water along the side  better than we could shove her with the paddles i replied not feeling overly inclined to talk very much  then i cant see but that everything is as smooth as grease an whats bettern all else were leavin the bloomin britishers astern in a way to make my heart glad the wind is likely to increase before it lessens so well be a good bit on our way by sunrise  ay jerry said grimly but if youve lived in baltimore you know what the mouth of the potomac is when the breeze comes strong an i dont allow that this canoe would make any too good weather of it in a heavy sea  she should be able to do it all right jepson said carelessly and then he set about filling a pipe he had borrowed from darius as if there was nothing in the world to cause him trouble  after he had lighted the tobacco he must needs ply us with questions regarding joshua barney to which we could make no very satisfactory replies because of our ignorance but he seemed to think it his duty to keep a conversation going regardless of the fact that both jerry and i showed plainly our disinclination to do very much tonguewagging  when an hour had passed and the canoe was walking along in right smart style surprising me by her performance under sail for i had never supposed she could be used in such fashion bill jepson said suddenly  look here whats the use of all hands standin watch give me the paddle an ill steer while you lads get a bit of sleep ill call you when its time to take your trick at the helm  at first i was inclined to hold my place but thought differently when i saw jerry curling himself up in the bow for a nap and gave the paddle to the sailor saying as i did so  i dont count on sleeping very long but if you should come up to the potomac before i turn out it would be a good idea to call me  i reckon you think that because im a deepwater sailor i aint fit to be trusted with one of these chesapeake cockle shells but bless your heart lad ive always knocked about in em an you shall see that ill handle you tenderly enough  i laid down in the bottom of the boat under the thwarts and contrived to make myself so comfortable that in less than five minutes i was sleeping soundly  when next i became conscious of anything there was at least two inches of water under my back and the spray was coming over the starboard side at a rate that threatened speedily to founder the little craft  jerry being in the bow which stood higher out of the water had not been disturbed  whats the matter i asked in alarm crawling out from under the thwarts with no little difficulty  matter nothin as i knows of bill jepson said as if surprised that i should have asked such a question what made you think anything was wrong  why were half full of water man and if it keeps coming in at this rate itll soon be a case of swimming  its a bit dusty thats all but the canoe is doin her work like a lady were well nigh across the potomac an just a hummin  the day was breaking and in the gray light of early dawn i could see the little craft laboring under her rag of a sail in a manner that sent my heart into my mouth although im not given to being timorous on the water  we must get in some of that sail i cried forced to yell at the full strength of my lungs in order to be heard above the rollicking sea song in which bill jepson was pouring forth his musical soul  let her go as she is ill answer for it that no harm will be done bill said with a laugh as he cut short his song we wouldnt be in as good shape with the paddles an thats a fact  by this time jerry had awakened and he like me had the idea that we were storming through it at a hotter pace than the canoe could safely stand but the sailor insisted that nothing was wrong although he did suggest it might be a good idea if we baled the craft a bit and we were forced to act upon his advice in order to save ourselves from being swamped  the canoe rode more easily when the liquid load had been taken from her and i came to the conclusion that perhaps it might be as well to let bill jepson have his way since we were cutting down the miles in great shape and speed was the one thing necessary for us just at that time  we were forced to use the baling dishes about every ten minutes before crossing the mouth of the river and then the little craft made better weather of it to the great relief of both us lads  no one would ever have suspected that bill jepson was a deserter who would surely be hanged if the britishers caught him he sang told stories of a wild and terrible kind mimicked the officers of the narcissus and explained what the americans would do when the enemy came up the bay going into the details of the naval maneuvers as if perfectly familiar with all the defenses instead of being wholly ignorant of everything connected with the war save from an english standpoint  it was not a very appetizing breakfast which we had that morning for the food stowed in the stern of the boat was soaked with water but to lads who had never been accustomed to luxuries a little thing like fasting did not seem to be of much importance  the breeze which had been freshening all night increased with the rising of the sun and jerry and i unwilling to suggest that the sail be reefed saw the little craft humming along under the guidance of bill jepson when had we dared assert our authority she would be creeping with no other motive power than the paddles in the hands of two tired boys  at noon we landed on the southerly side of hog point where i knew a fisherman lived and went toward the house hoping we might be able to get something in the way of provisions for i had in my pocket the money which had been paid by the officers of the narcissus  bill jepson remained in the canoe to keep ship as he said and jerry and i walked through the small growth of timber nearly encircling the building with never a thought of keeping ourselves concealed from view but yet remaining silent for the very good reason that we had nothing of interest to say to each other  thus it was by mere chance that our approach was almost noiseless and when we were come within view of the dwelling from whence we could hear the hum of voices none of the inmates were aware of our presence  this manjenkins was his namehad a wife and one child as i well knew therefore hearing the sound as of several voices i naturally looked out from the underbrush before showing myself for there was in my mind the thought that he might have a party of britishers as visitors  one man and he the owner of the dwelling was lying on the grass just outside the window talking with another who was seated within the building whose head and shoulders only could be seen but one glance at the face was sufficient to cause me to draw suddenly back as i motioned to jerry to advance where he could have a view of jenkins visitor  it was elias macomber who sat at the window talking with his host on the outside and we could readily overhear the conversation  under ordinary circumstances i hold that an eavesdropper is the meanest kind of a person but considering all the facts of the case it seemed just then that it was our duty to learn all we might  as we came up jenkins was evidently opposing something which the traitor had said for when we were in position to listen macomber cried sharply  i shall watch out for the british fleet an board the first vessel that heaves in sight i reckon i can tell the admiral somethin which hell like to hear  but elias jenkins remonstrated even though you dont believe in the war surely you wouldnt do that which might work harm to your neighbors  im an englishman  by comin here an settlin down you turned into an american or should have done so i claim that a man has no right to hold himself an englishman when he moves into another country to live never expectin to go back to the old home all your interests are here an by holdin true to the united states you are benefitin yourself  thats all rot i work for what i get here an have no man to thank for it  but the laws of the country protect you all the advantages to be had from the town where you live are yours the same as others an when you take them you have no right to do harm to the land which feeds you  its no use tryin to argue me out of it jenkins for you dont know how ive been treated in benedict ill give the british commander all the information in my possession an its enough to be of importance  just then a womans voice from the inside of the house summoned mr jenkins to some household duty and i drew back among the foliage yet further dragging jerry with me  well stay right here till we get our hands on that cur my partner exclaimed when we were so far from the house that there was no danger the words would be overheard an if commodore barneys men cant keep him a prisoner well turn to an see what kind of a fist we make of the job  i was of jerrys mind but there was nothing that could be safely done in broad day and we went softly back to the shore that we might hold counsel with bill jepson  we found the sailor sleeping peacefully on the warm sand but had no compunctions about disturbing his slumbers and after he was fully awake it became necessary to tell him the story of what we had done in the patuxent that he might the better understand the situation  so the spy is here an counts on stayin till the britishers come up the bay eh the old sailor said half to himself what have you lads got in your heads  were goin to get our hands on him once more an then take precious good care he dont have a chance to tell the britishers what he knows concerning the commodores fleet jerry said hotly  an you count on doin that first of all eh  sure that cur shant have a chance to give us the slip  but he said hed stay till the fleet came up  well  that wont happen for three or four days yet if all ive heard be true  it makes no difference to us when the vessels come what we want is elias macomber  what would you do with him supposin he was here this minute  carry him to commodore barney of course  can the four of us get along in the canoe  jerry and i looked at each other in perplexity it was a fact that the little craft would not carry four particularly when one was a prisoner who might struggle against being taken up the river and yet it seemed to me as if we were in duty bound to effect the capture  now this is the way it looks to me bill jepson said slowly as if talking with himself though of course i aint countin on interferin with you lads in any way what ive got to tell the commodore is of more importance than the yarn macomber can spin for the admiral an darius thorpe seemed to think i couldnt see the old man any too soon now if this ere sneak is goin to wait where he is till the fleet comes whats to prevent our keepin on as we started an then comin back to pull him in this wind will set us up the river in great shape an within four an twenty hours we should be at nottingham unless the town has been moved from where i saw it last  i understood at once that the sailors advice was good and should be followed yet it went sadly against the grain to go away from that place leaving the cur free to do us harm if the opportunity presented itself  jerry had much the same struggle in his mind as i but watching his face i soon saw that he was ready to act upon bill jepsons suggestion and without waiting for him to give his thoughts words i said  very well if were to go up the river first there is no time to be lost we must paddle the canoe close inshore until we get around the point so that we may not be seen from jenkins house and then well push her for all shes worth  we no longer remembered that we were hungry but jumped to the task as if every moment was precious as indeed was the case if we would make elias macomber a prisoner for the second time  as i had said in regard to paddling around the point so we did but once the canoe was so far beyond that she could not be seen from the dwelling we hoisted the sail and i dare venture to say that bill jepson might have run her rail under without hearing any word of protest from jerry or me so eager were we to be on the return voyage     chapter ix  an unexpected meeting   it was as if the elements favored us in the race to nottingham and indeed i counted it a race in which were pitted against us the british fleet and elias macomber  the wind held strong the day was cloudless and the canoe clumsy craft as i had always looked upon her sailed like a bird bill jepson insisted on holding the steering paddle and we were well content to have him at the helm for he held her so nearly to the course that our wake stretched out behind us straight as an arrow  under almost any other circumstances we would have made at least a short stop at benedict but now it was out of the question and we sailed by at full speed being hailed by several of our acquaintances who urged that we come to for a moment but we resisted all such entreaties  i knew that my mother on being told we had refused even to so much as have speech with our friends as we passed would understand we were on urgent business and have no thought that i had slighted her  when in due course of time we passed the mill from which had been taken the prisoners it bore the appearance of being deserted therefore we had good reason for believing that macomber was the only one of our capturing who succeeded in making his escape  it was late in the night before we came upon the fleet and were brought to by a hail from the guardboat  the commodore was yet with the flotilla on board the scorpion so the sentinels told us but they were minded to prevent our having speech with him at that unseemly hour  had jerry and i been alone i believe of a verity we would have been forced to wait until morning before seeing joshua barney but bill jepson could not be put aside as easily as two lads and he roared out as if he had been an admiral of the blue at the very least  tell him that darius thorpe has sent word from the lower bay an it must be delivered straight away  illustration i remember your face my man said the commodore come aboard at once page 153  in the darkness when it was impossible to see him no one could say that bill was not a person of the greatest importance and the sentinels judging from his voice must have concluded that he or the man whose name he gave was some one high in authority therefore they not only allowed us to approach the schooner but went before to announce our arrival  the commodore was not the kind of an officer to keep any one in waiting simply that due respect might be shown to his station but came on deck halfdressed bidding one of the sailors to hold a lantern that he might see who we were  so you lads have come back in haste eh he said on recognizing jerry and me have you by chance lost the pungy  no sir she is in the lower bay oysterin with darius in charge i made haste to say  and who is this you have with you  bill jepson sir who has served under you twice but is now a deserter from his majestys ship severn having been pressed into the british service nigh to three years ago the sailor replied rising to his feet at imminent risk of overturning the canoe  i remember your face my man come aboard at once all hands of you  we clamored over the rail having made the canoe fast and entered the commodores cabin  when did you desert from the severn joshua barney asked showing more of excitement than i had ever seen him display  last night sir an it may be by so doin ive upset some of your plans but when i asked for help it never struck me that darius might be there on special business  tell me all the story the commodore said motioning toward me and without delay i gave him a full account of what we had done save that then i said nothing regarding elias macomber  then he questioned bill jepson regarding what he knew and if i am any judge of such matters he got considerable valuable information  the sailor was able to give him the names of nearly all the vessels in the two fleets together with their probable weight of metal and repeated the gossip which had leaked from the severns cabin through the marines on guard  the commodore listened intently making many notes as bill spun his yarn and when it was come to an end he said  you did well to steer for here at once but i am inclined to believe that the enemy will move very soon is there anything else to be said  i would like to speak about elias macomber sir i made bold to say  that was the prisoner who escaped one of them got away and there is good reason to suspect that he received aid from some of our men we have no time to look into the matter now but it shall be thoroughly sifted later and if there be a british sympathizer among us it will go hard with him  then i gave him all the information we had concerning the traitor and wound up by asking if there was any reason why we should not go back and retake the cur  you may as well make the attempt although i question if he can tell the enemy anything which is not already known the utmost he could say would be that our force is small and so much the british learned at st leonards bay however i would like to have the fellow but am not willing you should run into any danger for the purpose of effecting the capture  i believe that jerry and i will be able to get hold of him and we will go back at once unless you have other work for us  there is nothing especial that you can do here warn darius thorpe to be ready for an immediate move on the part of the enemy and tell him to make sail for the patuxent at the first signs of activity you lads had better get some sleep before setting off again go forward and see that you have a hearty meal at once jepson you will remain aboard the schooner  bill thanked the commodore and the three of us went into a sort of forecastle which had been rigged up in the forward part of the vessel where after considerable arguing we succeeded in getting so much food as satisfied our hunger which was no small amount  then we turned in by lying down on deck which was preferable to getting into a bunk on such a hot night  as a matter of course we were aroused right early even before any signs of a new day could be seen but the three hours of sleep refreshed us wonderfully and we were ready to set off down the river  we managed at the expense of considerable argument to get a supply of provisions from the cook without awakening commodore barney and after a warm parting with bill jepson cast off the canoe  because the wind was blowing straight up the river it was impossible to use a sail save at the cost of considerable time and we took to the paddles which seemed like mighty hard work after our experience with the rag of a sail  dont let it be thought that we begrudged our labor i would have paddled till the skin was worn from both hands for the sake of retaking elias macomber and looked pleasant all the while but when a fellow has been flying over the water with no effort of his own save to keep the little craft on her course he cannot but contrast that pleasure with the dreary work of shoving her ahead with an ashen blade  again we felt obliged to pass our homes without stopping it would have taken a full hour hurry as we might to go ashore and speak ever so briefly with those who would greet us and in that length of time elias macomber could possibly join his friends the britishers  well keep well over on the eastern shore where there is less chance of bein seen an do our best at the paddles jerry said as we discussed the matter just before coming within sight of the village id give a good deal to see mother an the children but it seems as if we had no right to loiter  i was of his mind and we hugged the opposite bank of the river keeping under the screen of foliage as much as possible until there was no danger of being recognized  during all that day and far into the night we paddled now and then one would stop to rest his arms but the other continued the labor therefore the canoe did not come to a stop from the time we left the fleet until we were arrived at hog point  there we run her bow on the shore while we ate a hearty meal and discussed the question as to whether it would be better to approach the house from the northerly or the southerly side  i was in favor of going ashore where we then were but jerry won the day by suggesting that if we ran around on the other side it would be possible to see if the british came up the bay and this last was quite important to us in case we were forced to spend much time waiting for a fitting opportunity to catch our game  after refreshing ourselves with food we paddled around the point without danger of being seen because it was so late in the night and landed at the same place as before knowing that from there we would have no difficulty in finding the dwelling  after pulling the canoe up amid the bushes and hiding her as well as was possible in the darkness we laid down on the ground falling asleep almost immediately we had stretched ourselves out at full length and not until the first beams of the rising sun shone across our faces did we awaken  it was but natural that we should look down the bay before doing anything else but we saw nothing to disturb us a small craft was coming slowly up for the breeze was light but to her we gave little or no heed  we began the day by eating breakfast then we saw to it the boat was so nearly concealed by the foliage that she would not be seen save after careful search and we set out to reconnoiter the premises  we advanced cautiously stopping every half dozen paces to listen lest we inadvertently stumble upon the owner of the plantation or his guest and after spending half an hour in such slow progress we came in view of the place  elias macomber was pacing to and fro in front of the dwelling as if weary of his voluntary confinement and gazing seaward every few seconds for from that side of the house it must have been possible to get a full view of the bay  we might get our musket an rush up on him now jerry whispered and i replied as i believed darius would have done  we dont know how well armed jenkins may be nor what he will be willing to do in aid of his friend my idea is that we should wait here until the owner goes to his work leaving the traitor with the women folks and even then the task wont be an easy one for we must come out in sight of all hands a full three minutes before arriving at the house however fast we run  we should have brought the musket with us on this trip jerry grumbled and i soothed him by saying  there is really no time lost the first thing to be done was to make certain the scoundrel yet remained here that has now been ascertained and i will go for the weapon while you stand watch we mustnt be in too much of a hurry or we may spill the soup  jerry was satisfied to act as sentinel and i walked leisurely back to the shore believing that much time must elapse before we would get the desired opportunity  arriving at the shore i spent some minutes searching for the canoe so well had we hidden her and once getting the musket and ammunition in my possession i strolled down to the beach where i could have a view of the bay  only the single small vessel was in sight and i was on the point of turning away thinking it useless to gaze long at her when something in the rig of the craft struck me as being familiar  i looked again laid down the weapon and gazed yet more intently until finally there was no longer any question in my mind  the vessel was none other than the avenger if darius was yet on board why had he left his post of duty if anything had happened to him why had jim freeman taken it upon himself to leave the lower bay  the more i tried to solve the problem the stronger became the probability in my own mind that some serious disaster had overtaken our comrades and i ran at full speed giving little heed as to whether the advance might be heard by macomber until i was come to where jerry remained crouching in the grass his eyes fixed upon the dwelling  youre makin a terrible row he said angrily never looking around fortunately the cur has just gone inside or he might have heard you  jerry i said speaking with difficulty because of heavy breathing after having run so fast the avenger is close at hand she is the craft we saw something must have gone wrong  jerry turned his head very quickly now forgetting for the instant his desire to make a prisoner of elias macomber  what do you think can have happened he asked and i replied impatiently  that we shall only find out by boarding her come to the beach at once  but what about our work here and now it was the pungy that went from his mind leaving there only the great desire to accomplish the purpose for which he had come  never mind that now it may be we wont want to fool around here on his account come quickly jerry for she was close at hand before i started  it was actually necessary to shake the lad before i could arouse him to a full sense of the situation but once that had been done he followed me readily enough even urging that i move faster  the pungy was no more than half a mile away when we reached the shore and we launched the canoe without delay paddling straight out in her course  as she came up i could see darius at the tiller with jim beside him and the other two fellows lounging forward  nothing had happened to the crew that much seemed certain and i was at my wits end to account for the avenger being apparently heading for home  when we were come within hailing distance i shouted never thinking that i might be heard by those on the jenkins plantation  why are you coming back what has happened  where is bill jepson darius cried  with the fleet  when did you leave him  yesterday what is the matter  come aboard an ill tell you the old man replied as he threw the pungy up into the wind and we did not waste many seconds in going over the rail  now what is it i asked impatiently when i stood facing darius  the britishers are gettin under way an it kinder looked as if the oyster business wouldnt be any good after theyd left moorins if thered been any wind youd be seein em by this time what brought you ashore at hog point  elias macomber is there living with jenkins the planter we stopped on our way up thinking to get some provisions and not only saw the cur but heard him say he was waiting for the britishers to whom he could give a lot of information  while i had been speaking darius brought the pungy into the wind again and she was standing directly away from the man we had been so eager to capture  here jerry cried sharply you must heave to till we get that villain  how many people do you reckon are in the house darius asked as he twisted off a large piece of tobacco  weve only seen macomber and jenkins  dont know anythin more about the situation  we havent had time to learn anything more but it dont stand to reason there are other men  theyve both of em got wives whod fight if it come to a pinch no lads the best you could count on in the way of time would be a full day an we cant afford to waste an hour  but it wouldnt be wastin time if we finally caught him jerry cried hotly  thats where i dont agree with you lad the son of a seacook cant give the britishers any very valuable information whereas we can tell the commodore that which may be the means of savin our whole fleet id like to lay macomber by the heels as well as you would but i dont believe in usin a salmon to catch a sprat well run across him some day but jest now its our duty to get up the river in short order well try the canoe with a little bigger canvas an if she sails faster than the pungy you shall go ahead for an hour now is worth a full day next week  i was not convinced that the business of catching the traitor before he could give his information to the britishers was less important than that of carrying to the commodore word of preparation for departure on the part of the fleet more particularly since not a vessel had as yet hove in sight but when it came to arguing a point with darius i generally got the worst of it therefore i held my peace although it went sadly against the grain to do so  jerry did not give in so readily but insisted on heaving to the vessel declaring that he and i would do the work alone while the avenger went on up the river  youll do nothin of the kind lad darius said emphatically theres no tellin what joshua barney will decide on when he hears the word i have for him an i dont count to leave you down here at hog point to be gobbled up by the britishers for youre already under suspicion of havin had a hand in bill jepsons desertion  what do you mean i asked in surprise  jest what i said the officer from the severn declared that you two lads could tell what had become of bill  i had actually forgotten that we aided a deserter i cried tell us what happened after we left the avenger  well darius said slowly stopping to twist off a huge piece of tobacco and otherwise trying to make his yarn a long one so that we might round hog point in the meanwhile we run over to the delaware shore as i counted on doin tryin to find a boat but it was no go we didnt see anythin that would float an of course we couldnt fool round there very long after sunrise else the britishers would see us so i made up my mind that the best plan was to face the music right soon  we ran down for the narcissus but was hove to by the severn an a lieutenant with four marines came aboard bless your heart lad but they did search the pungy from stem to stern even shovelin the oysters over as if thinkin we might have bill under em then the officer went on board an that little nincompoop of a midshipman boarded us wheres your crew he squeaked an i said innocent like theyre all aboard sir youre a liar says he when i was here last there were five lads on deck an now i see only three oh the other fellows have gone home says i they only came out with us for a lark wheres your boat says he she belonged to them says i youre a liar says he yes sir says i which same was true an off he goes maddern a wet hornet  then the lieutenant comes aboard after i saw a lot of em on the quarterdeck talkin fit to kill an he asks me when you went home i told him you lived on the delaware shore an you skipped when the pungy got near shore youre a liar says he an i agreed with him sames i had with the midshipmite the boys have helped a deserter from the narcissus says he an have carried him to the mainland ive a mind to seize your vessel i tell you what it is lads bout that time i thought the avenger was a goner for britishers in american waters are mighty apt to do whatever comes into their minds  well did that settle it i asked as darius ceased speaking much as though his story had come to an end  no we had three or four officers come aboard later an i aint certain but that wed lost the pungy if signals hadnt been sent up on the flagship which i took to be a command to prepare for gettin under way leastways them as was botherin us scuttled over to their own craft in short order an then there was a heap of knockin about in gigs an barges with nobody givin any attention to us wed been hove to half a musket shot from the ship an when i saw they had other fish to fry an plenty of em i run close aboard as i yelled like a countryman any orders for us sir it was quite a long spell before anybody answered an id sung out two or three times when that little midshipman squealed you are to go about your business with that pungy an well overhaul you again when we have more time  then you started for the patuxent the best you knew how i said thinking i understood just what should have been done under the circumstances  i wasnt such a bloomin fool darius replied we run down to the narcissus bold as lions an i told em wed brought some more oysters but they threatened to fire into us if we didnt sheer off an then i coaxed for em to take what cargo i had offerin to sell at six cents a bushel till they must have thought i was a stark natural fool  but why didnt you get away when you had the chance jerry asked in surprise  i didnt want em to think i was anxious to go an meanwhile i had my eye on what they was doin which told plain as the nose on your face that the signals were as i had thought i almost cried when i said id have to run all the way to baltimore to sell the oysters an the best i got from them was more threats then we could steer straight up the bay without givin rise to suspicion that we was jest naturally hankerin to come  you played a fine trick on em i cried filled with admiration at the old mans method of getting away from unpleasant neighbors it couldnt have been done better  im not so certain of that darius replied but i could see that he was pleased by the praise i didnt have time to think up anythin different for the whole business come about so sudden like howsomever weve got news that joshua barney needs to hear an our cruise to the lower bay will pay if we can get to nottingham half a dozen hours ahead of the britishers which seems to be a settled thing with this wind  then i told him that the commodore felt convinced the enemy would advance sooner than was generally believed and he said in a tone of admiration  theres a man for you he can smell moren the most of folks can see an when he says its in his mind that a thing is so or so you can set it down as comin mighty near to bein a fact  then the old man asked concerning our interview with the commodore and by the time we had come to an end of our story hog point was so far astern that there was no longer any thought in my mind of returning  i was trying to make the best of the situation when jerry said fretfully  it was a big shame that we couldnt have taken elias macomber when he was there ready to drop like a ripe peach we might have walked right up to that house when we first saw him an the thing could have been done  but we mightnt have walked back again if there had happened to be two or three more in the building than we counted on never mind jerry well have the traitor before were many weeks older and whats more well take him ourselves never asking any man for assistance     chapter x  a change of base   when we were come near benedict i was not minded to pass it for the third time without stopping to see my mother and i said to darius  there seems to be no good reason why jerry and i should not visit our homes leaving you to continue on with the news we can take the canoe and paddle up the river tonight  it is your place to remain aboard the avenger the old man said almost sharply  what can we do more than would be done by you jerry asked in surprise  nothin so far as sailin up the river is concerned but with the news were takin to the commodore it is moren likely therell be a quick change when you might be needed  there cant be anything very serious happen twixt now and tomorrow morning i persisted yet holding to my scheme we wouldnt be more than twelve hours behind you under any circumstances  not if everything was in your favor but how if you met a boatload of britishers such as we captured the other night it aint safe to be foolin round the river alone just now an thats a fact  meaning that there is more of fear in your mind lest we come upon spies of the enemy than expectation commodore barney might need our services i asked and the old man finally admitted that perhaps such was the case  then in my pigheadedness i declared we would stop in the village and he gave proof of what he could do when things did not go exactly to his liking  i shall stop you from leavin the pungy he said doggedly without looking towards us  do you mean to say darius thorpe that youd prevent us from goin ashore jerry cried hotly  thats exactly the size of it lad i neverd let a shipmate of mine run his nose into danger when there was nothin to be made by so doin  but how would you stop us jerry asked his anger rapidly giving way to mirth as he pictured to himself darius the man whom we had hired to help us in the fishing setting himself up to say what we should or should not do  id knock you down with a belayin pin if it was handy but if not with my fist knowin joshua barney would uphold me in bringin back at any price the same crew i took away  i felt certain that the old man believed it his duty to do exactly as he had said in case we persisted in going contrary to what he thought was prudent and i also came to realize that to his mind the danger was great otherwise he never would have spoken in such a strain  however i did not let him know what was in my mind but stood well forward when we sailed past benedict as if i was too angry to have further speech and probably acted like a sulky schoolboy thinking that i was upholding my dignity  when we had run past the village however and there was no longer any possibility jerry and i would attempt to go ashore darius humbly asked us to come aft and once there he explained in a friendly way why we who had virtually bound ourselves to serve under commodore barney should report to him before attending to pleasure or personal matters he also made it plain that at this time when we knew beyond a peradventure the enemy was about to make an attack it was absolutely necessary every american who had agreed to aid in the defense should be ready for duty at a moments notice  in fact he showed us so clearly that he was in the right and we wrong that i was ashamed of having given way to the sulks and told him so whereat he said  then well drop the whole thing right out of our minds an now that its over ill bet you two or three cents worth of silver spoons that well be in benedict on service sent there by the commodore before four an twenty hours have passed  i would have asked him how that might be but just then jim freeman sung out for me to have a look at the cable which was considerably chafed and i did not get an opportunity of continuing the conversation  again we came up to the fleet in the night but darius did not hold any long parley with the occupants of the guardboat who hailed us simply saying as he steered the avenger straight for the scorpion  private service for the commodore  we ran alongside the schooner made the hawser fast ourselves since the single militiaman standing guard at the top of the cabin companionway did not see fit to aid us and while this was being done darius leaped on board the vessel saying in a loud tone  were come on board to report to the commander  you cant see him now the soldier said stiffly presenting his musket as if intending to use it in case the old man persisted in advancing  now look here you lopsided lobster darius cried at the full strength of his lungs you report to the commodore that the avenger is alongside or therell be trouble twixt you an me  it is not probable the old man expected that he could bully the sentinel who had had his orders as a matter of course but by bawling so loudly that he could have been heard on every craft of the fleet he awakened joshua barney which was exactly what he aimed at doing  whos kickin up this row the commodore asked sternly as he poked his head above the hatchway  the crew of the avenger sir come to report  get below here at once and the commander spoke as if impatient to hear that report  i had counted that darius should go alone to the interview but he insisted on being accompanied by jerry and me therefore we followed him into the cabin  the old sailor did not spend much time in saluting but in the fewest words possible told what he had learned and the commodore did not appear surprised by the information  it tallies with what i have already heard he said grimly how long will it take the enemy to run up to the mouth of the river  they should be there tomorrow night for there are some fast sailers in the fleet sir  find the swiftest canoe in the fleet put on board rations for twentyfour hours getting them from this schooner and run down the river without delay if your own crew is not huge enough to insure quick work call on for what men you need can you leave in thirty minutes  in five sir if we knew where to find the canoe were ready an ill keep the same crew  the commodore ran on deck hailed the guardboat spoke a few words in a low tone and returned to us saying as he did so  rout out my cook and tell him what you want say that i give him five minutes in which to have your provisions on deck if necessary in order to learn all which should be known here send a portion of your crew back with the boat and do the remainder of your work ashore in case i am not here when you get back report to lieutenant frazier and take his orders as you would mine  all this the commander had said hurriedly as if the moments were precious and having come to an end he began writing at the table giving no more heed to us than if we never had an existence  we left the cabin without delay and while darius went forward to have speech with the commodores cook jerry and i clambered on board the pungy to let jim and his friends know of the new duty to which we had been assigned  its a case of keeping on as spies i said after repeating the commanders words youre to be ready at once but whos to look after the avenger is something that hasnt been told us  there was no time to say anything more for at that point the guardboat came alongside having in tow a long canoe which looked as if a single stroke of the paddle might send her on a long voyage  here is the swiftest craft on the river and her owners heart will be broken if you allow the britishers to get hold of her the officer in charge of the boat said as he passed me the painter of the canoe  do you know what we are to do with the pungy i asked  my orders are to anchor her further up stream after you have gone dont leave anything valuable aboard for theres a good chance youll never see her again  we dont own anything valuable except the pungy herself and i fancy she wouldnt be very precious save to two lads like jerry and me who may never own one again if anything happens to her i said with a laugh for strange to say now when we were about to set off on the most dangerous portion of our work i failed to feel the slightest fear  at this moment darius and the commodores cook came on deck each bearing in his arms a certain amount of cooked food and this the old sailor threw without care into the bottom of the new canoe himself following with the utmost haste  come on lads if you count on gettin any sleep this night he cried impatiently as he took up one of the paddles  are we to go without weapons i asked  we shant need them if we meet the britishers it will be in such force that half a dozen of the best rifles ever made would do us no good and there will be none others on the river with whom we shall want to interfere  but we might run across elias macomber i urged not minded to go emptyhanded on such a perilous voyage  it is too late to fool around with spies now darius said sharply theyve done us all the mischief possible an its a case of standin before an open enemy  i had no desire to argue further within hearing of the commodore and scrambled down into the boat where my comrades were seated ready to begin the voyage  now indeed was darius the leader of the party and after the conversation in regard to the muskets i was prepared to obey him without a murmur  it is a large canoe which will carry six people comfortably without sign of being overloaded yet the boat we were in did it and i would not have hesitated to put in a couple more had it been necessary while she paddled as easily as a craft half her size  its a great little boat darius said approvingly as we began the voyage with a burst of speed which absolutely surprised me i reckon we could show our heels to the best that can be found on the river  where are we goin jim freeman asked impatient to know more regarding our purpose  thats what i cant say lad well run down till we see somethin of the britishers even though we come off the tangiers again but im thinkin well do well if we make hog point this trip  jim would have asked more questions but that darius cut him short by saying gruffly  theres a decently good reason for believin that the enemy may show himself any minute now an if we dont want to get into trouble itll be safe to hold our peace therell be plenty of time for tonguewaggin later  it can be fancied that we remained silent after such a remark and the old man kept four of us at the paddles constantly himself doing twice as much work as any other while the helmsman occupied that post only in order to rest himself the steering blade being shifted from one to the other accordingly as we grew tired  for the fourth time we passed benedict without making a stop but on this occasion i made no protest and when we had run a mile further down the river we came upon a pungy belonging to our village the master of which was evidently doing his best to get all the speed possible out of the craft  better put back he shouted nervously and darius gave the word to cease paddling as he asked  whats the news  the britishers are comin this way thickern spatter an i made up my mind it was time to get under cover  where were the foremost ships when you saw them  lessn a mile below hog point it looked like there was moren a hundred vessels  youd better not count on stoppin long at benedict darius cried as he motioned for us to take up the paddles again and before the captain of the pungy had time to ask a question we were beyond earshot  it may be the fleet thats bound for baltimore i suggested not being prepared at that time to believe the enemy would attempt to take large vessels far enough up the river to disturb our fleet  i allow some of em are headin baltimore way darius replied grimly but youll find that a good many of the fleet will make a try at stirrin up joshua barney  i knew the old man believed all he said because from this out when we were come to a bend in the river we would steer the canoe close up to the bank and slow down until he made certain that the next reach did not have in it any of the enemys craft  in this cautious manner we ran down stream perhaps five miles below benedict when on rounding a bend we saw no less than four armed vessels with a dozen or fourteen barges not more than a mile away  back water lads darius cried sharply swinging the canoes stern around with the steering paddle heres where we find our work id like it better if you wasnt so nearly fagged out but i reckon we can make five miles more before you give in  he had turned the canoe while speaking and we were running up stream in less than two minutes after having sighted the britishers  five miles should bring us to benedict i suggested  ay lad an thats where well make the first stop  but do you count that the enemy will get as far up as the village i asked in surprise mingled with no little consternation for this was bringing the war home to us with a vengeance  some of the ships may find the bottom but theyll get a few of em there take the helm amos an ill pull at the paddles  thus far since we took service under commodore barney all of darius predictions had turned out to be correct therefore i was fully prepared to believe all he said regarding the danger which threatened my native village  the old man would not allow us to indulge in conversation after the retreat was begun  dont waste your breath by talkin he said peremptorily well need all our wind to take us to benedict an once there ill give some of you a chance for tonguewaggin  within two miles of the village we passed the pungy we had met while going down stream going by her as if she was standing still and darius shouted  keep right on up the river the britishers wont stop this side of benedict an you can only save your vessel by joinin barneys fleet  if all ive heard be true im as like to lose her where he is as in most any other place the captain cried looking here and there anxiously as if believing it possible he might find a few puffs of wind lying around loose  i was in good shape when we arrived finally at the village because of having remained at the steering paddle but the other fellows were wellnigh exhausted and when we ran the bow of the canoe up on the shore not one of them made a move toward changing his position  get your wind lads as soon as may be for well pull half a mile or more upstream before settlin down here for any length of time the old man said leaping ashore smartly as if he had just awakened from the most refreshing slumber and while hurrying up the bank he added sharply stay where you are all hands until we finish this business  what it was he counted on finishing i could not so much as guess and my companions were too weary to speculate upon the matter just at that moment  we saw him speak with this or that person who came out of the shops or buildings as he appeared and immediately it was as if he had disturbed a colony of ants men and women began running hither and thither in terror and not a few carried with them household goods of such small value that it was a sheer waste of time to lug them around in a twinkling the entire village was in a commotion and no one appeared to have time to spend on us who had brought the disagreeable news  darius remained beyond our range of vision perhaps ten minutes and then he appeared with the four byard brothers trailing behind him whereupon jerry who had no particular love for these lads asked fretfully  what do you reckon he counts on doin with that trash if he needed more of a crew it strikes me he might have found better material  we soon learned what purpose the old man had in mind for on nearing the place where our canoe was drawn up the byard family went a short distance down stream in which direction their own craft was moored and began making her ready for a voyage  one of you lads must go to the commodore with news of what we have seen darius said speaking quick and sharp as if to prevent us from holding any parley on the subject the byards are to be paid for paddlin the best they know how from here to nottingham makin no stop on the way an he who goes will only need to act as helmsman  are the remainder of the party to stay here i asked not minded to take myself out of the way when so much of excitement might soon be witnessed  sure we who stay will be ready to make the quickest trip on record once weve found out all thats to be known who will go to the commodore  no one replied and by this time the byards had their canoe afloat  well draw lots darius said after finding that neither of us was willing to volunteer for the service the one who pulls the shortest twig starts without delay or grumblin an im free to tell you that those who stay behind with me are like to have the toughest nights work they ever put in  while speaking he had been breaking into bits a small twig and five of these he held in his clenched hand  make your choice quickly for we cant waste many seconds over this business the old man cried impatiently and we obeyed his command i hoping most sincerely that the lot would fall to some other than myself for i was willing to risk the hard work in order to remain with the leader  it was jim freeman who drew the short twig and his face was pulled down very long when he found that he had been selected  into the canoe with you darius cried an listen well to what i say tell the commodore that we came upon the advance ships of one fleet five miles below benedict and are waitin here to make certain what they will do he is to give these byard boys three dollars for takin you to nottingham make the best time possible for the fate of all our vessels in the river may hang on youre gettin there quickly  the byards dug their paddles deep in the water as if determined to obey orders as promptly as possible and in twenty seconds from the time darius ceased speaking the canoe was around the bend of the river jim waving us a mournful adieu as he disappeared from view  joshua coburn is to go with me to hide the boat further upstream the old man said with the air of a general giving his commands the others may stroll around the village but in half an hour every one must be here on the shore to meet me  i gave no heed to my companions but ran at full speed toward home answering curtly the greetings from the neighbors as i passed and soon i was where every fellow longs to bein mothers arms  she good soul had heard from those who saw us that we passed the village more than once but never a word of complaint because i had not stopped to see her  the first question was whether i had come to benedict under orders of the commodore or if i was taking time to visit her which should be devoted to some other purpose  i speedily soothed all such fears and frightened her by saying that darius believed the britishers would make a halt at the village  at first it was my belief that she should take the children and go far into the thicket but she good soul soon convinced me that such a course would be unwise since it was not known how long the enemy would remain and she could not stay in the forest very many hours with the young ones  we will wait here amos dear the british cannot be so barbarous as to make war upon the helpless if you or father was near at hand and i could go to you the situation would be far different  then she insisted that i should tell her all i had been doing and by the time that long story was come to an end i had need to join darius on the shore having stayed the full length of the furlough he gave us  it was not certain but that i could see my mother again before we went up river therefore our parting was not as sorrowful as it would have been had i known all the perils which were to be encountered ere i looked upon her dear face again  the village was in even a greater state of confusion and bustle than when i first passed through it a full half of the people were on the point of running away taking with them as many household belongings as could be carried or transported in carts or boats a large number stood on the streets undecided what course to pursue and asking each person they saw for advice while not a few were apparently bent on following the example set by my mother  i was appealed to for the latest news by a full score before i could reach the rendezvous but to all i had the same reply that i was in government service and could not delay  i was the last of our party to arrive at the shore the other lads were standing near darius looking uncommonly glum and i could well understand the reason for the sadness  did you hide the boat i asked and the old man replied  ay a little better than half a mile up stream where we can come at her conveniently in a hurry we have just been talkin however about takin stations on the opposite bank where it will be possible to see what is done without gettin in the way of the enemy  that seemed to me a very good idea for there might be many chances against our slipping away after the british had landed and i urged that the change of base be made without delay  it was if darius had only waited for my opinion immediately after i gave it he led the way along the road which followed the course of the river  within an hour we had the canoe hidden on the opposite shore and were seeking for some spot directly across from the village where we could see all that was done  it was some time before we found exactly what we wanted and then it was in the midst of a small clump of trees on a gentle rise of the land a full two hundred feet from the shore  here by trimming away some of the branches we could have a full view of the river and settlement in addition to being at a safe distance from the enemy who would hardly land on that side of the stream  weve got into position none too soon darius said as he pointed over the trees on the opposite shore where we could see the upper spars of what appeared to be a reasonably large vessel moving through the water slowly within ten minutes we shall know whether its a case of watchin em come to anchor an landin or takin to our heels to gain the canoe before they can get that far up the river     chapter xi  the british forces   after we were in a position to see all that might be going on immediately opposite and for a mile or more down the river we could make out the spars of several ships which appeared to be at a standstill and at once the question was raised as to whether they were aground or at anchor  you lads shall stay here never venturin to leave the hidinplace unless the britishers themselves drive you out an ill take a little trip down stream to see what is goin on if the enemy has come into the river without a pilot ill go bail that more than one of his vessels has taken the ground  then the old man stole softly through the underbrush and we gave but little heed to his departure so intent were we on the wondrous panorama spread out before us  the first craft to heave in sight was an armed brig the decks of which were brilliant with red uniforms and glittering weapons and immediately astern of this vessel were a dozen or more barges and two pungies  then came boats filled with soldiers one astern of the other until it surely seemed as if every craft in the chesapeake had been brought here to make up the procession which was more imposing than anything i had ever seen  it was the glittering fanciful side of war which would be transformed into something hideous immediately the actual work was begun for then one lost sight of the pomp and parade seeing only the ominous stains of blood and unable to hear aught save the shrieks of the dying and the groans of the wounded  then to our great surprise we found that the britishers were making preparations to take possession of the village the armed brig was moored stem and stern in the channel where her full broadside could be brought to bear upon the settlement and the three barges each having on board a twelvepounder were rowed up to the beach on which no less than four hundred soldiers with weapons ready for use stood as if to repel an attack  they are makin a mighty lot of fuss jerry said with a laugh a corporals guard could capture benedict without turnin a hair an yet look at that crowd  it was truly astonishing that so many men should have been brought to take possession of our little village boatload after boatload came up the river landing their living cargoes in the cove where we lads had always kept our canoes and before the disembarkation had been concluded the shore of the river was literally covered with soldiers marines and strangely enough companies of negroes who were decked out in uniforms of the british army  since that day i have seen statements made by the enemys officers to the effect that five thousand men were landed at benedict and for what purpose we lads were unable to imagine  i had never seen such a throng of people before the town was overrun and the woods above and below seemed to be packed full of armed men  fortunately for us none attempted to come on our side of the river but all stood in something approaching a military formation as if expecting an immediate attack  as a matter of course all us lads were greatly alarmed lest our families should come to harm amid such a gathering but we could not have afforded them any relief had we been at home and it was necessary to choke back our anxieties as best we might though it was difficult at times to prevent the tears from coming into a fellows eyes  the troops and guns had been landed before darius returned and what seemed to me strange no other vessels of any size had put in an appearance there were pungies barges and rowboats enough to entirely choke up the river but nothing larger than the armed brig which had first arrived  when the old man came back we learned why the fleet had apparently shrunken to such small proportions as compared with the size of the army  nearly every vessel is aground he said when he approached our hidingplace with every evidence of having traveled long and rapidly the river is black with em from here to the point an some are likely to stay quite a spell on the mud unless mighty quick work at lighterin is done i allowed the britishers had better sense than to run ships up here where theres about half water enough to float em  but what is the meaning of their landing so many men i asked there are twice as many as would be needed to capture the whole of charles and calvert counties  its washington theyre aimin at the old man said confidently though why theyve stopped here i cant figger out unless it is that so many of the ships are aground whoever is responsible for this end of the britishers movement has made a big blunder  will they do any harm to the townspeople think you i asked anxiously  it dont stand to reason they would there may be some plunderin by the rank an file but thats to be expected youre thinkin of your mother an the children eh well dont worry they wont come to harm an on that ill go bail  theres no tellin how soon some of that crowd will come over here jerry suggested there aint room enough on that side of the river for all hands of em an theyll begin to spread out pretty quick  that wont bother us any for were goin to pull up stakes darius replied quietly  are we to join the fleet i asked  its the proper thing just now i reckon seeins there aint likely to be anythin new around here till the enemy pushes on up the river which will be when he has floated some of his vessels  even after making this statement darius appeared to be in no hurry to move on he sat amid the foliage watching the throngs on the opposite side of the river until half a dozen officers came down close to the waters edge having in their midst one in civilians garb  theres a friend of yours the old man said quietly as he motioned toward the group an you can eat my head if i dont guess whats up  my face flushed with answer as i looked in the direction indicated and there saw in earnest converse with the britishers elias macomber the traitor  he has joined his friends without losin any time i wish i could get my fingers around his throat for a couple of minutes jerry cried shaking his fist in impotent rage  an i reckon youll soon have that chance lad darius said calm and serene as a summers morning watch out now an youll get an idee of the whole business which will go to show that you didnt lose anythin much when you left him at hog point it wouldnt surprise me a little bit if hes had a good share in sendin the ships aground for he couldnt have told within ten feet of the water to be found in the channel  i failed to understand very much of what the old man referred to but kept my eyes fixed on the opposite shore and saw that elias was making ready to embark in a canoe which was hauled up near at hand  hes goin back to see how many vessels are aground jerry suggested and darius added placidly  youll find that hes bound up river spyin an we count on goin in the same direction  now i understood elias was to reconnoiter the river for his very good friends and we could catch him on his return as we had done once before  i was near to crying aloud with joy when i realized that once he set out as darius predicted nothing could save him from our clutches therefore i literally held my breath as he took his seat in the canoe and pushed off  just for one instant my heart sank within me for it seemed as if he was bound down river but it appeared that he was simply making a flourish to exhibit his skill with the paddle and then he pulled up stream thereby doing jerry and me the greatest possible favor  yes hes our meat darius said with an odd smile as i looked at him questioningly hell go somewhere near the fleet to make certain it yet remains at the place where he made his escape an we wont press the villain give him plenty of time to get well away from his friends  then the old man settled back amid the foliage as if counting on remaining quite a while and i no longer thought of anything save the pleasing fact that we would once more present to commodore barney the miserable renegade  darius soon learned that it would not be well to prolong his halt we could see the soldiers pointing toward the thicket in which we were hidden as if suggesting it as a pleasant camping place when the day was so hot as to bring perspiration to a negros face and a few moments later some of the lighter boats were pushed out from the shore  i reckon its time for us to make a move darius said as he arose to his feet lazily we may as well be movin toward the canoe though i had counted on stoppin here till it was a bit cooler  according to my way of thinking we had no more than time enough in which to get away for now at least an hundred soldiers were coming across and in case we were discovered lurking amid the underbrush there would be such a hue and cry that we could not hope to escape  darius however would not move one whit more quickly because of my urging in fact it seemed much as if he walked the slower to test my nerves and instead of parleying with him further jerry and i went ahead at full speed having due care of course to caution  it pleased me when the old man was obliged to quicken his pace to a run for before we were well out of the thicket the foremost of the boats had gained the shore  we pressed on rapidly until coming to where our canoe was hidden and there we halted not wanting to embark until elias had had plenty of time in which to get well up the river for to me at least his recapture was more important than the task of carrying information to the commanding officer  lying within the shade of the trees and so far up river that we could neither see nor hear the swarm of soldiers which had lighted upon benedict we took things easy for a couple of hours keeping sharp watch however to make certain that no craft passed us and then darius gave the word to get under way  by this time it was night but the young moon and the stars in a cloudless sky lighted up the waterway clearly and we had no fear that macomber could give us the slip unless he returned by land  we paddled leisurely for our news was not of such a nature that an hour or two sooner or later would make a difference so far as commodore barneys plans were concerned and had gotten such a distance on our journey that i began to fear the traitor had struck across the country when we hove him in view half a mile or more ahead  he was still running up the river but i questioned if he intended to take any chances on being discovered for such as he would rather manufacture information out of his head than encounter danger  darius who had been using one of the paddles now took the helm and the canoe was swung inshore where she would be partially hidden by the shadows of the foliage for we did not care to start in open chase because he would probably take to the woods on discovering us and then our chances of making the capture would be small indeed  when our quarry rounded a bend in the river shutting himself out from view we bent all our energies to the paddles sneaking inshore immediately we opened him up again and thus we rapidly lessened the distance until at the third turn of the shore we were less than thirty yards astern  now give it to her lads darius said sharply put all your strength to the blades an well heave him to in short order  as we rounded the bend the water foaming from the boats bow much as it would have done from the stem of a ship under full sail macomber was but a short distance ahead and darius cried  push her along lads nows our time then bringing the paddle to his shoulder as if it had been a musket he shouted drop that oar mighty quick macomber or ill fire  the traitor thus receiving the first intimation that an enemy was near at hand glanced backward quickly and seeing the supposed weapon leveled full at him threw down his paddle with an exclamation of mingled fear and anger  we shot up alongside him like an arrow from the bow all hands of us reaching out to grasp the gunwale of his canoe and as we thus made fast darius grasped the fellow by the throat  you may as well give in quietly the old man said tightening his grasp until it would have been impossible for the man to make the lightest outcry if you flounder about much all hands will go into the water an once there i give my word that you wont come to the surface for we dont count on losin you the second time  the scoundrel was as meek as any lamb and when darius told me to fasten his arms together with my belt he held them out obediently  i took a double turn around his elbows and darius ordered him to step into our canoe which he did without hesitation but once there seated on the flooring of the boat with his back against the old mans knees he glowered at us like an angry cat  we reckoned you wanted to see barneys fleet when you put off from benedict an it aint jest right to make you paddle a heavy canoe so far darius said grimly youre goin back with us master macomber an this time youll stay  not very long the reptile said with a snarl admiral cochrane declares that hell destroy barneys fleet friday an dine in washington sunday so you see im not likely to stay with you any great while after the british come up the river  that is as may be now im countin that when your admiral gets as far up the river as nottingham if he ever does youll be somewhere else for weve taken you in charge  my time will come an then ill pay off a good many old scores macomber cried with a look on his face which was not pleasant to see  if it does you any good keep right on thinkin so darius replied mildly an in the meantime well keep our eyes on you give way lads the sooner were with the fleet now the better it will be  we had no more than settled well to work when darius ordered us to cease paddling as he half rose to peer steadily ahead and quite naturally all of us glanced in the same direction  a canoe carrying four men was coming down stream and while i was asking myself if we might not have come upon more british spies the old man settled back with a sigh of relief  its the byard boys goin home he announced and then as the other canoe came within hail he gave them information of what was happening at benedict  it dont look as if wed better go back there sam byard said thoughtfully when darius had come to an end of his news i reckon the britishers might make trouble for us eh  theyd be apt to if it was known youd just come from our fleet the old man replied with a laugh the best thing you can do is to turn around an follow us did you get your money  oh yes the commodore handed that over all right  where is jim freeman i asked  the commander allowed it wouldnt be many hours before all hands of you came back so he went aboard the pungy to keep ship  there darius said triumphantly you can see how near joshua barney comes to the truth when he makes a guess i believe he could stay at nottingham without ever gettin a report from anybody an tell just what the enemy was doin  hell have a chance to see what theyre doin as soon as some of the ships can be floated macomber said with a laugh which was not pleasant to hear  which is moren you can say for yourself if theres any danger of the britishers comin darius retorted youre our meat master traitor an will stay in the same keepin till weve settled our part of what you call old scores  then the word to buckle down to the paddles once more was given and the byard boys pulled their craft around to follow in our wake  an hour later we were alongside the scorpion again and this time it was not necessary to parley with those on the guardboat for on recognizing us they sheered off leaving our canoe to go where we pleased  neither did the guard on the schooner hesitate to arouse the commodore and within one minute after arriving darius was explaining to the commander all that had taken place at benedict  it must be they counted on coming further up the river the commodore said half to himself when the story was come to an end and darius took it upon himself to add  i allow there wouldnt have been any stop if the fleet hadnt gone ashore then the men were landed to prevent you from makin an attack  that seems reasonable but theyll be here soon enough for it is to this place they must come in order to strike the direct road to washington  then it was that darius bethought himself of what macomber had said and he repeated the words adding in conclusion as he laid his hand on the prisoners shoulder for as yet we had not left the canoe  weve brought this cur back sir an hope he wont find it as easy to slip away a second time he left benedict to spy on you as we saw from the other side of the river so we gathered him in  the commodore looked at the man as one would at a snake and then said curtly  youll have to keep him on board your vessel darius our facilities for taking care of prisoners are not what they should be do whatsoever you will with him so that we can make certain of putting our hands on him when the matter is to be settled you had better take up your quarters on the pungy and if youre needing provisions my cook will supply you until rations are dealt out  then the commodore turned on his heel returning to the cabin and we pulled around the fleet hunting for the avenger  not until after getting speech with the officer in charge of the guardboat did we find the craft and when we came alongside jim freeman acted as if beside himself with joy one would have said that we had been separated a full year by the way he welcomed us and when his eyes fell on elias macomber it was as if he had lost his senses  well we took the prisoner aboard the pungy securing him in the hold by lashing his hands behind him and making them fast to a ringbolt thus giving him a chance to sit down but he could neither stand nor stretch out at full length  it wont be none too comfortable but its the best we can do now darius said to the prisoner as if apologizing for not making him more secure at all events i reckon youll be here in the mornin an then we may make a change  the main hatch was put on and fastened down with the bar after which we went into the cuddy ready for anything in the way of provisions that jim could set before us  he was not overly well supplied having been on board only a few hours but we contrived to make a hearty meal and while eating jim heard all we could tell him regarding the occupation of benedict by the british forces  it was past midnight when we turned in so tired that all hands fell asleep within two minutes after making ready and it seemed to me that i had not fairly closed my eyes when we were awakened by a vigorous pounding on the side of the vessel  darius had his head out of the companionway before it was possible for me to get on my feet and i heard a strange voice cry sharply  it is the order of the commodore that every vessel in the fleet move up to pig point without delay rations will be served there at noon tomorrow  then i heard the sound of oars as the messengerboat was pulled to the next craft and darius said hurriedly  lads ill admit that there are a good many vessels in this ere fleet what can sail clean around the avenger but lets show the commodore that theres no crew under him who will obey orders more smartly turn out lively my bully boys jim you an dody get home the anchor an the rest of us will tail on to the halliards  darius had a willing crew if there was any opportunity to win the praise of the commander and he was not yet at an end of giving his orders when we began work  i venture to say that within sixty seconds from the time we were hailed the avenger was making way rubbing past this craft and that as she literally forced a passage through the fleet and all this before any signs of life could be seen on the other vessels even the scorpion was yet lying idly at her moorings  thats what i call a good start lads the old man said when we were well clear of the flotilla and the pungy forged ahead in good style under the force of a fairly strong night breeze were first under sail an itll go hard if we dont come to anchor off pig point ahead of any one else  why do you suppose this move is being made i asked for it smacked much of running away from the enemy to retreat so far up stream and darius had made us believe that joshua barney never retreated  the commander has got some good plan in his head an itll come out before were many days older the old man replied confidently  but surely were tryin to get away from the enemy jerry suggested  ay it has that look just now ill admit but youll see some big scheme in it very soon or im a dutchman which i aint  theres a boat dead ahead with four men rowin an one steerin jim freeman who had stationed himself in the tow as a lookout came aft to report  some smarty whos tryin to make the anchorage first darius growled but with this wind we can sail two miles to his one so it wont be that craft which will beat us in  by this time we were well up with the boat and to our surprise it was commodore barney himself who hailed  sloop ahoy pass a line and ill come aboard  he got the line smartly enough and when he came over the rail darius saluted as he said  we counted you were aboard the scorpion sir  that schooner wont get off for ten minutes or more and i allowed that the other vessels would be handled in the same leisurely fashion so i pulled ahead thinking to be at the rendezvous before the flotilla was well under way you lads obeyed orders smartly  its a way they have sir darius said with a grin as he looked over the rail to see that the commodores boat was being towed where she would be the least drag on the pungy  then it was that i tried to play the host by asking the commander if he would go into the cabin  it isnt a very nice place sir but its clean and you may be able to get some sleep  ill venture to say its as good a seaparlor as i or any other man deserves lad but im not needing sleep just now therefore will stay on deck  then he fell to pacing the starboard quarter as if he had been on his own ship at sea and we lads gathered well forward in order that he might see we understood somewhat of the respect due a commander     chapter xii  suspense   it is now in my mind to set down what may be dry reading for some who chance to see this labor of love on which i am engaged and yet if any one desires to know exactly why it was the britishers could destroy the capital of our country and come off very nearly scotfree it is absolutely necessary to become familiar with all our means of defense at this time  therefore it is that i shall copy that which was published many years later by mr lossing in his war of 1812 and in so doing the reader will ask how it is that i am writing this poor apology for a tale in the year of grace 1814 and yet putting into it facts which were made public many years later  the answer to the riddle is not as puzzling as it would seem i am now man grown with children of my own many years ago i put together this story and today desiring that my own boys may read it i am running over the leaves to add here or there that which may make plain what i a lad of seventeen years overlooked at the time or believed to be of little importance how strange it is that the same thing appears entirely different when viewed from the standpoints of a man and a lad  this is what mr lossing says concerning the time of which i wrote when everything was fresh in my mind and the sense of a wrong done this country by england still rankling deep in my heart       on the 6th of august 1814 the small british squadron in the      chesapeake was reinforced by a fleet of twentyone vessels      under admiral sir alexander cochrane the senior commander on      the american station these were soon joined by another under      commodore sir charles malcolm these vessels bore several      thousand land troops commanded by general ross an irish      officer and one of wellingtons most active leaders      washington and baltimore appear to have been chosen objects of      attack simultaneously a part of the british naval force under      sir peter parker went up the chesapeake toward baltimore and      another portion under captain gordon went up the potomac       at that time commodore barney with a flotilla of thirteen      armed barges and the schooner scorpion with an aggregate of      about five hundred men was in the patuxent river his vessels      had been chased out of the chesapeake and blockaded in st      leonards bay of this confinement they were relieved by some      artillery under colonel henry carbery with which he drove away      the loire the blockading frigate when the released flotilla      went up the patuxent first to benedict and then to      nottingham that it might be within cooperating distance of      both washington and baltimore       seeing this the british determined to capture or destroy it      and on the 18th of august a force of a little more than five      thousand men composed of regulars marines and negroes went      up the patuxent and landed at benedict with three cannon      under cover of an armed brig most of the other large british      vessels were below some of them aground and all too heavy to      ascend the comparatively shallow stream       barney then at nottingham promptly informed the navy      department of the movement and of a boast of the british      admiral that he would destroy the american flotilla and dine      in washington on the following sunday general winder by      direction of the war department immediately ordered general      samuel smiths division the third of the maryland militia      into actual service he also called upon general john p van      ness commander of the militia of the district of columbia for      two brigades to be encamped near alexandria and he sent a      circular letter to all the brigadiers of the maryland militia      asking for volunteers to the amount of onehalf their      respective commands       by his orders his adjutantgeneral hite issued a stirring      appeal to the citizens to come forward without regard to      sacrifices and privation in defense of the national capital      winder also asked general stricker of baltimore to send to      washington his volunteer regiments of infantry and his rifle      battalion       the veteran patriot general smith promptly responded to the      call of the government he at once issued a division order in      which he gave notice of the invasion and directed the whole of      general stansburys brigade to be held in readiness for active      service adding the third brigade is now under the pay of the      united states in its service and subject to the articles of      war that corps general smith declared to be the finest set      of men he ever saw they paraded at four oclock the same day      and on the following morning general stansbury left baltimore      for washington with thirteen hundred of his corps another      force under lieutenantcolonel joseph sterett consisting of      the fifth regiment of baltimore volunteers major pinkneys      rifle battalion and the artillery companies of captains myers      and magruder left baltimore on the evening of the 20th and      joined stansbury on the evening of the 23d       with wise precaution general smith ordered the eleventh      brigade and colonel moores cavalry to hold themselves in      readiness to march to baltimore at a moments warning for it      seemed probable that the enemy would strike at both cities      simultaneously       the british in the meantime had moved up the patuxent from      benedict the land troops being accompanied by a flotilla of      launches and barges that kept abreast of them the naval forces      were under the command of the notorious marauder cockburn      they reached lower marlborough on the 21st when barneys      flotilla then in charge of lieutenant frazier and a sufficient      number of men to destroy it if necessary moved up to pig      point where some of the vessels grounded in the shallow water       for the defense of washington the whole force was about seven      thousand strong of whom nine hundred were enlisted men the      cavalry did not exceed four hundred in number the little army      had twentysix pieces of cannon of which twenty were only      sixpounders this force if concentrated would have been      competent to roll back the invasion had the commanding officer      been untrammeled by the interference of the president and his      cabinet  all that was written when the facts of the case were well known and now the story shall be taken up as i wrote it when a boy                                       it was not all plain sailing from nottingham to pig point for the water was shallow and there were many places where it was necessary to handle even a pungy very tenderly in order to avoid taking the ground  while darius was not well acquainted with the stream he had a sailorly eye for bad places and never made the mistake of trying to jump the little vessel where she was likely to be held hard and fast  many times were we forced to take to the canoe in order to pull the avengers nose around more sharply than could be done by the helm and when it came to such labor of pulling and hauling the commodore lent a hand as if we had been his equal in station  and we did work lively for a fact hoping to have our anchor down before any other craft could arrive therefore no one complained when darius called on us for labor which might have been saved at the expense of three or four minutes in time  the commander was even more eager than were we to arrive at the appointed rendezvous speedily and we could readily guess that some big change was to be made in the general plans although what it might be we came far from guessing since all of us save darius thorpe believed he was simply running away from the enemy  well we succeeded in doing as we wished in regard to beating out the remainder of the fleet for when we came to anchor off the point and snugged everything down bristol fashion there were no signs that a single craft was following  commodore barney was chafing because of the delay as could be seen by the way in which he paced the deck rubbing his hands from time to time as he gazed down stream in vain for some token of the laggards  its only a deep water sailor who obeys smartly darius the commander said halting in his nervous walk to face the old man and jerry and i who were seated on the mainhatch pricked up our ears for it seemed positive we were to learn somewhat of future doings  these younger men know too bloomin much thats whats the matter with them darius said in reply ill go bail that half the crowd we left at nottingham believed they knew bettern you when the start should be made an stopped to curl their hair before makin sail  commodore barney laughed heartily at the old mans growling and then said suddenly  i count on leaving you second in command under frazier and it may be as well for you to understand matters in case i dont get a chance to speak with you at any length after the lieutenant arrives  you count on leavin me sir does that mean youre goin away right soon  ay when my force comes up there is no question but that the enemy is making the attack on our flotilla to cover his designs on washington he can have the fleet if he comes thus far i hope by daylight to be on the march for the wood yard where winder is encamped and count to take with me all the men that can be spared for force enough will be left behind to destroy the fleet in case the enemy appears lieutenant frazier is to be in charge of those who remain here and you will act as his second in command this is my plan you shall have seventy men or more and as soon as we leave you will make every craft ready for the torch see to it that there are combustibles on board in sufficient quantity to insure a clean job when fire is applied after that has been done you will wait for the british once it becomes certain that you cannot save the fleet start your fires and put out for the american army which will likely be near washington by that time  weve got some good boats with us sir darius said thoughtfully  ay my old shellback and that is why i am determined that they shall not be of service to the enemy you who remain behind will have more danger to face than those who move in advance and because of that it is necessary you keep the force well in hand see to it that every order however trifling is obeyed on the instant and in event of any disposition to shirk a command or to loiter after the word has been given deal with the culprit as you would on shipboard quick work is the only thing which will save you from being killed or made prisoners  when the commander spoke this last word the thought came to me that i had for the moment entirely forgotten elias macomber and i was puzzled to know what could be done with him while we were destroying the fleet if it so chanced we were forced to such an extremity  i spoke with jerry about it but he had no suggestion to offer save that i had better refer the matter to joshua barney  hes forgotten all about macomber as we did an now is the time to find out what we shall do with him it would hurt me mighty bad to let the cur join his british friends simply because we couldnt take care of him  this last idea nerved me to do that which i would have shrunk from at any other time and approaching the commander i asked  what is to be done with our prisoner sir jerry and i couldnt help hearing what you said to darius and we dont want to let such as him have a free foot after capturing him twice  dont fear for that lad the commodore said with a kindly smile give your man breakfast now so that he may be in condition to march and when you see that we are ready to set off bring him to me i will see to it that he has a caretaker who wont wink at an escape  then the commander fell to pacing the deck again and i called jim freeman and dody wardwell into the cuddy that they might cook breakfast for all hands including elias macomber  jerry insisted that the cur ought to be sent on his way with an empty stomach but to that i would not have agreed even though the commodore had failed to give especial orders to the effect that he be fed  by the time our cooking operations were well under way the foremost of the fleet began to heave in sight and from that moment joshua barney had something more to do than pace the avengers deck  we learned very soon that the scorpion had run aground which fact delayed several of the smaller boats since lieutenant frazier called upon many of the men for assistance but all reports ran to the effect that the fleet would unquestionably be at the rendezvous by early dawn  we drew lots to see who should feed the prisoner and josiah coburn selected the unlucky slip which was a great relief to me for i question if i could have put food into the villains mouth with any very good grace  we were yet at work on the breakfast when my father came aboard the barge to which he was drafted having been the third to arrive and it made me feel mighty good when he complimented us on our smartness in handling the avenger  we two went well forward where we might converse privately and i did not think i was betraying any confidences when i told him of the commodores plans he was in nowise surprised and said as one would if talking to a particular friend  i guessed that something of the kind might be in the wind when the word was given to get under way it would have pleased me better amos if you had been detailed to go with the advance  why so sir i asked secretly rejoicing because he was treating me as if i had been of his own age  because those who remain to destroy the fleet will be in great danger you cannot begin the work until the enemy is close upon you otherwise it might be said that valuable property had been sacrificed needlessly and your risk will be greater than mine  that is as it should be sir i replied forgetting that i had ever been weakkneed or lukewarm in the cause for mothers sake you should be the one to go home if both cannot  you have ever been a good boy and a dutiful son amos i shall pray that god will spare your life whatever he may will shall become of me  then my father kissed me and i never remember of his having done such a thing before after which he went over the rail hurriedly as if not caring to look me in the face  it was not a particularly cheerful conversation which we had had and yet i was wondrously heartened because of it the possible danger was very far from my mind as i dwelt upon fathers words and his goodbye it was as if i had suddenly come to know him in a different fashion than ever before  commodore barney used the avenger as his flagship while we were waiting for the scorpion and our deck was literally crowded with men who had been summoned to receive orders he even ate breakfast with us doing the greater portion of the eating holding converse with one or another and it can well be fancied that we were proud because of having made possible such an honor for our pungy  the day was just breaking when the scorpion attended by all the other laggards came up the stream the schooner was anchored alongside our pungy and the commodore and lieutenant frazier had a private interview in the cabin of the larger vessel after which word was given for the men to disembark  the captain of each vessel had received orders to go ashore with so many men therefore we saw no confusion when the final moment arrived  jerry and i made ready the canoe in order to take elias macomber out of the vessel and seeing us thus engaged lieutenant frazier said as if in surprise  i thought all you lads had been ordered to remain behind  so we have sir i replied and then i explained what we would do whereupon he called for a couple of men from the blushing susan to attend the prisoner we going with the party to make certain he was delivered up in good order  commodore barney had not forgotten the matter as could be seen when he came forward with the cur and he handed elias to a man from nottingham with this injunction  you are answerable for him until we arrive at general winders camp if he attempts to escape shoot him without compunction but give him fair treatment so long as he obeys orders  then the commander nodded to us as if we were old acquaintances and the march was begun every man stepping out briskly as if it pleased him to aid in the defense of the national capital  it really gave me a sensation as of homesickness to be thus left behind although sixty or seventy men yet remained they were so scattered among the fleet that it seemed as if we of the avenger were the only ones left to watch the enemy  you may as well take up your quarters on the schooner lieutenant frazier said to darius when the detachment was lost to view in the distance all of her crew are gone therefore we shall have plenty of room  i shipped with the boys an i reckon id best stay with em sir though i thank you kindly for the offer darius replied and the lieutenant added quickly  i meant the invitation for the entire crew of the pungy some of them can do the cooking while we stay here which wont be very long im thinking  and thus it was we made a change of quarters which neither pleased nor displeased me even though the cabin was decidedly finer than our cuddy because i had come to have a certain affection for the shabby pungy which cost us so much labor in the buying  according to lieutenant fraziers laying out of the work there was nothing for us of the avenger to do save care for the schooner and prepare the meals  six men were sent down the river in canoes to watch and report the movements of the enemy that we might have timely warning of their near approach and the remainder of the party which had been left behind were set about getting ready for the destruction of the fleet if that should become necessary  one may think that jerry and i had no reason to feel badly if our pungy should be burned since we had the guarantee from commodore barney which would insure our receiving much more money than she cost us and yet we did feel badly because it then seemed to us as if we could never get another craft quite so much to our liking a fellow cannot live on board a vessel many months sailing her in all kinds of weather and depending upon her for a livelihood without having a certain sentimental attachment for the fabric different from that felt for all others of its kind  however i had quite persuaded myself that the british would not come so far up stream simply in order to destroy the flotilla for it did not seem as if the outlay would be repaid by the result whichever way it might be viewed i had it in mind that when they learned how shallow the river was above nottingham the plan would be abandoned therefore i felt comparatively secure from harm as we idled away the hours  the fact that darius was so uneasy should have convinced me of the full danger for the old man was not one who borrowed trouble he fretted because he was forced to remain with the boats instead of acting as spy and nothing save the fact that joshua barney had placed him second in command could have kept him at pig point when it seemed to him that he might be able to accomplish much elsewhere  when the first of those who had been sent down stream returned i also began to feel uneasy in mind the report came that the entire force of britishers was embarking on barges and small boats with half a dozen 6pounders and as many mortars which showed that it was expected we would make some resistance and it angered me to hear the men talking as if we were to do no more than set the flotilla on fire when the enemy hove in sight  it seems to me that we might worry them some i said to darius when he had spoken in much the same tone as the others forty or fifty men posted along the shores would make them a little trouble i reckon  ay lad an effect about as much as so many wasps we might shoot down a few men but could not even delay the advance an what would be gained their five thousand soldiers would make it mighty warm for our people on the shore an when it came to killin im thinkin theyd be able to do the most execution  before he ceased speaking i understood how foolish had been my words but i was burning with such a desire to inflict some injury upon those to whose account could be laid the destruction of our property that i was not really responsible for the speech  it was on the evening of the day when joshua barney left us that i began to be sensible of the suspense in which one would necessarily be at such a time if the enemy came upon us suddenly it might be possible for them to capture all hands of us as well as carry away the boats and this last would be considered more of a disaster than the first  twenty of our men were posted at different points on both sides of the stream to act as sentinels and the remainder distributed among the fleet in such a manner that the flames could be started in very short order  neither lieutenant frazier nor darius proposed to turn in on this night they were to keep on the move from one sentinel to another in order to make certain each man was doing his duty and we lads were ordered to have a meal prepared for them at midnight  shortly after sunset another of our people came up the river with the report that a portion of the enemys force had started and it began to seem as if a night attack had been determined upon  it can well be fancied that we of the avenger had very little desire for slumber although had we been so disposed all of us might have had a good nights rest and also had the midnight meal ready when it would be required  we paced to and fro after the lieutenant and darius had left speaking only in whispers as if it might be possible the enemy could hear us and each moment expecting that the alarm would ring out  the suspense was to me most painful and i said to jerry  almost anything is better than this i wish we were not so well aware of their coming  if the fleet is to be burned an we know the enemy has started to come up here i cant see what is to be gained by waitin and my partner spoke in a tone of petulance we shall do no good stayin here and it may be that some of us could be of service elsewhere  its no use for you fellows to grumble jim freeman said with a laugh he having come up just in time to hear the useless words the orders are to wait till the britishers show themselves an i reckon neither lieutenant frazier nor darius would like to take the responsibility of doin anythin else you two will make a good thing out of this business in case the avenger is burned eh  weve got a guarantee for more than she cost but at the same time id rather have her than a better one jerry said promptly and i put my hand in his for he had spoken that which was in my heart  then we fell to talking for at least the tenth time of how the work of destruction would be accomplished and while we were thus engaged darius came alongside  you lads can turn in he said as he clambered over the rail mitchell has just come up the river with the news that the britishers are makin camp lessn two miles below we shant see em tonight but theyre likely to be here mighty early in the mornin  some of us must stay up to do the cooking i replied thinking of the meal the lieutenant had ordered  ill call you in case frazier dont change his mind about it but i reckon hell be willin to wait for breakfast  are you going to stay on board  i shall be here off an on just now were goin to inspect each craft sos to make certain the flames can be started quickly for theres no longer any chance but that the fleet must be destroyed     chapter xiii  burning the vessels   it seemed to me much like disastrous defeat to burn the flotilla on the approach of the enemy without making any effort whatsoever to defend it and for the time i believed that darius and all those who bragged so much about commodore barneys fighting qualities were making idle talk otherwise he would have attempted to hold his own no matter how great the odds against him  at the time i failed to realize that our fleet of small boats amounted to nothing as compared with either city which the british was threatening and that the commodore never showed himself to be a better fighter than when he allowed the enemy to spend their time with a lot of boats of little value while he was marching his men across country to aid in the defense of washington  one can readily fancy that we lads were not much inclined for sleep when darius brought word that we might turn in  it was definitely known that the british were only two miles away and would make no prolonged halt until after striking a blow at our fleet in fact it was possible they might approach within an hour the halt having been called only to make us believe they would not attempt to do any mischief during the night  we gathered aft but with no desire to go below and stood there leaning far out over the rail with eyes and ears open for some token of the coming foe  it was possible to distinguish even in the gloom a boat which was pulled from one craft to another stopping only a few seconds at each vessel and we knew the lieutenant and darius were making their rounds  again we questioned the wisdom of waiting until the enemy was close at hand before beginning the work of destruction never realizing how important it was to keep the britishers at the task of destroying the fleet so long as possible that the defenders of washington might have opportunity to make ready but we actually grew impatient because the torch was not applied at once  before lieutenant frazier brought the inspection to a close one of the men who had been sent to spy out the enemys movements came aboard the scorpion to make a report from him we learned that the british were really encamped for the night and there seemed little possibility any move would be made before daylight  even with this assurance we lads had no desire for slumber and were on deck listening and watching when darius returned  why didnt you turn in he asked almost sharply and i replied striving to speak in such a tone as would give him to understand that we were not to be dictated to regarding our individual actions while off duty  we prefer to remain awake even though the enemy was not so near i question if either of us would care to go into the hot cabin unless orders were given to the effect that we must do so  well i have it in mind to get forty winks when im able we may be kept on the move pretty much all the time after leavin here an it stands a man in hand to bottle up what sleep he can  i thought you counted on moving around all night  so i did before we knew that the britishers had settled down for a spell but now theres no need of more watchers than are already on duty the old man said as he disappeared through the companionway hatch leaving me fully sensible of the fact that i had proven myself a prig and a fool by trying to assert my right to do as i pleased  we could see boats moving slowly to and fro a short distance down the river and thus knew the guard having been largely increased that if an enemy came our way during the hours of darkness he must be seen by the sentinels some time before we on the schooner could distinguish him in the gloom  then jim freeman and his friends followed darius example by going into the cabin and but for what had passed between the old man and me i would have gone with them as it was i felt bound to remain and jerry understanding the situation although he refrained from speaking of it stayed with me like the true friend that he always has been  before midnight my eyes grew heavy with slumber and i said to my partner as i led him well forward where we could not be overheard in case any of those in the cabin were awake  it would seem as if you and i were left to look after the schooner and surely some one ought to be on duty even though the spies have reported that the enemy has encamped for the night  well thats about what were doin aint it jerry asked and i fancied he was trying not to laugh  yes and yet im getting mighty tired i propose that we stretch out on the deck a few minutes just to rest our legs  wont that be deserting our post jerry asked gravely  i dont think so because we can hear all that is going on and while it is so dark there isnt much chance of seeing anything  but suppose we fall asleep  ill see to it theres no chance of that i replied finding it hard work to repress a yawn and then jerrys mirth could be controlled no longer  what are you laughing at i asked sharply  at you amos you havent made a bloomin success of it whenever youve tried to put on airs over darius somehow he always contrives to get the best of you if you hadnt pulled him up with a sharp turn wed be below havin a good snooze with the other fellows but now were ashamed to go consequently well camp on deck  i was angry and yet i knew he had spoken only the truth however it seemed too late to mend matters and without making any reply i laid down under the rail fully determined to be more of a gentleman in the future  there had been in my mind a promise not to close my eyes in slumber that night but no sooner was i at full length on the deck than i crossed over into dreamland and knew nothing until the report of a cannon seemingly near at hand brought me to my feet very suddenly  whats happening i cried loudly and from the after rail jim freeman replied  the enemy are comin into position they began to show up nearly half an hour ago but i thought there was no need to waken you till the work was begun  those who had turned in as sensible fellows should have done were awake and on the alert in due season while i who believed the safety of the schooner devolved upon myself slept until the britishers were ready to begin operations  the day had dawned although it was a full halfhour before the sun would show himself down the stream within long range of our fleet were eight or ten barges each carrying a cannon drawn across the river in such manner as to make the flotilla a good target and the gun which had aroused me was evidently fired for the purpose of testing the position  i ran aft to where jim and his friends stood asking eagerly  what are our people going to do  the word has just been given to start the blaze and the lieutenant believes that we can hold the britishers in check until the vessels are well afire were to form on the shore and oppose the force which you see yonder  gazing in the direction of jims outstretched finger i could make out a line of redcoated men on the southerly shore some distance below the barges and it was not difficult to guess that they intended to move up once an action was begun to where they could fire at us from the bank  the british commander evidently believed we would fight to prevent the fleet from being destroyed and therefore was forcing his men to perform a great deal of unnecessary work  looking around at the boats and vessels of our fleet i could see that the work of destruction had already begun from the hatch of the avenger which craft was lying thirty or forty yards further up stream than the scorpion a thin thread of blue smoke was ascending lazily on the clear air and on five or six other pungies the same ominous token of approaching ruin could be seen  then it was that i saw little knots of our men pulling for the northerly shore and on gaining the bank stave in the hulls of their canoes to such purpose that the little craft could not again be made serviceable  i understood then that each squad was under orders to land immediately the task assigned them had been performed and wondered if the schooner was to be reserved until the last  does the lieutenant count on saving the scorpion to hold the britishers in check i asked of jim and for reply he pointed toward the main hatch from out of which darius was just emerging  have your canoe ready the old man cried addressing dody wardwell who was holding the painter of a small craft which lay under the stern i allow that well need to leave here in mighty quick time for when the fire starts itll run from stem to stern like a flash  illustration as we pulled away i glanced back at our fleet and saw that the vessels were well on fire  even as darius spoke i saw a curl of flame from the forward hatch and then a long glowing tongue leaped up toward the cordage  while i stood watching it fascinated by the eager lapping of the destroying element the enemy opened fire from the barges sending solid shot amid the fleet which had already been deserted at almost the same moment that line of red which had been motionless could be seen flashing here and there amid the foliage telling that the advance of the land force had begun  glancing back at our fleet after making certain that the britishers were coming toward us i saw that the vessels were well on fire although unquestionably many of them might have been saved had efforts been made immediately to that end  in five minutes more salt wont save em darius said in a tone of satisfaction them bloomin redcoats started a little too late come on lads it looks as if we were the last to leave the fleet an there isnt overly much time on our hands into the canoe with you  we obeyed the order without delay more particularly since the flames were already coming out of the scorpions after companionway and while paddling for the shore i saw that our people were drawn up in line ready to meet the enemy in case it became necessary to prevent them from interfering with the work of destruction  are we the only ones to go unarmed i asked noting that all of those ashore appeared to have weapons in their hands  i reckon well find what may be needed when we join our people darius replied the guns an ammunition were taken out of the vessels last night for powder aint a nice thing to have around when youre foolin with fire  it must be borne in mind that while we were thus speaking the cannon on the barges were being served with spirit and more than one solid shot had gone crashing through a burning vessel but none had come near enough to us to cause any particular alarm  when we were ashore i saw that there would be no scarcity of weapons among us and in fact several of the men were forced to carry two muskets because of the supply which had been left behind by those who marched away under the immediate command of commodore barney  we lads succeeded in getting a good outfit with quite as much ammunition as could be carried comfortably and by the time we had taken our places in the line the enemys shots were beginning to come dangerously near some of us  a cannon ball cut down a sapling within four feet of where lieutenant frazier was standing and another crashed among the splintered canoes on the bank while from the distance came those sounds which told of bullets striking amid the foliage  the soldiers were almost within effective range and the shot from the barges was by no means comforting while we could accomplish nothing by remaining idle  i wondered why the retreat was not begun if we were to make one and felt as if i had a personal grievance against the lieutenant because he failed to give that order which would permit of our getting away from such a disagreeable situation  growin uneasy lad darius asked with a grin as i involuntarily ducked my head when a solid shot passed over us  it strikes me that we cant do any great amount of good by standing here i replied irritably  the lieutenant is a reglar little man who believes in obeyin orders no matter what happens joshua barney left word that we were not to move from here till all the vessels were well afire an here i reckon well stay quite a spell longer  but they are all burning i said turning to look at the fleet each craft of which appeared to be enveloped in flames  yes theyve started well but if i was the one who had been left to decide when there was no longer a chance of savin em id hold here a spell longer as the lieutenant is doin  do you believe it possible that we could save the schooner now and i pointed toward the scorpion along whose spars the flames were creeping rapidly  two or three hundred men might do it if they set to work this minute though it would be a tough job the old man said as he gazed at the flames which were already sending forth heat enough to render our position too warm for comfort and at that instant a musket ball came humming past the end of his nose causing him to spring backward very suddenly  growing uneasy darius i asked and the old man laughed goodnaturedly as i thus passed him some of his own coin  its gettin warm all around but i reckon weve come mighty nigh to the limit set by the commander  then it was that the man next beside me cried aloud as he held up his right hand from which the blood was beginning to flow from a bullet wound  i was too angry to be frightened just then for it seemed as if lieutenant frazier was remaining too long under fire and a moment later came the welcome command  i dare venture to say that with the exception of lieutenant frazier and darius every man moved more readily and quickly than he ever did before until we were a good mile from the scene of destruction striking directly across the country for upper marlboro  now and then it was possible to catch glimpses of the flames which towered above the tops of the nearby trees but we heard nothing of the enemy which seemed to me strange until i mentioned the fact to darius when he came up after loitering in the rear with the lieutenant as if to show his contempt for the britishers  i allow theres plenty of sense in their stayin where the fleet is burnin the old man said quietly they saw only a few men leave when it had been said that joshua barney had five hundred with him now what more natural for them to suppose that we are tryin to lead em into an ambushfor the britishers still believe we fight in injun fashion then again it aint likely the foot soldiers are carryin rations havin the boats with em an it would be poor judgment to send a lot of men into the woods emptyhanded so to speak  then you do not believe we shall be pursued  if we are itll be a fool trick the old man replied and then he fell back to the rear in response to a signal from the lieutenant  after he had thus given his opinion which i believe to be shared by lieutenant frazier it was in my mind that we would tramp leisurely across the country until coming up with commodore barneys force but immediately we appeared to be out of danger word was given to quicken the pace  now it was that the officer and darius marched in advance the former having given the word that we were to keep close at his heels and during two hours i traveled faster than i ever did before it seemed as if the musket which had seemingly been a feathers weight when we started weighed more than twenty pounds at the end of the second hour and i was so nearly winded that it was as if i could go no further without first taking some rest  jerry was no less fatigued than i and did not hesitate to say he believed the lieutenant was making us march thus fast simply to gratify some foolish whim  then we were come to upper marlboro after fording the stream and the pleasure i felt at being allowed to sit down that i might rest my aching feet was so great that it cannot properly be described  while jerry and i were grumbling because of what seemed to us unseemly haste jim freeman who had been lying down a short distance away came over to where we were sitting his eyes bulging as if he had seen two or three ghosts at the very least  what do you suppose he said excitedly  i heard the lieutenant telling darius that a big force of britishers was marchin up from nottingham on the west side of the river bound for washington  how did he know that jerry asked sharply  a man who was sent back by commodore barney on a scout got here about the same time we did an he reported to the lieutenant but that aint all some of the folks livin round here say that a small forcenear three hundredlanded on the west side of the river after the enemy went into camp last night an is mighty near this place now  cordin to that it would seem as if we come pretty close to bein surrounded jerry exclaimed  thats just what darius said jim replied an the lieutenant told him hed been afraid all along that wed run into some such kind of a muss commodore barney warned him to be on the watch for what appears to be happenin an it begins to look as if we might have trouble mighty quick  there cant be a great deal of it for the britishers if their smallest force is three hundred for theyd make short work of us i said with an inward quaking ive been blaming the lieutenant for making us march so swiftly and now i wish he had pushed us on twice as fast  i had hardly more than ceased speaking when the command was given to fall into line once more and the men obeyed eagerly for the word had been passed around that our small force was in most serious danger  every man among us was tired i venture to say yet we literally overran the lieutenant who was setting the pace and pressed forward like a flock of sheep pursued by dogs  it was nearly noon when we arrived at what is known as the wood yard where general winder had encamped and thrown up some slight entrenchments and where commodore barney was to have joined him but now the place was deserted save for one man whom i remembered having seen on our fleet  as we soon came to know he had been sent back from long old fields by the commodore to quicken our movements and both jerry and i heard that which he said to the lieutenant when we came up  it seems that the american troops from all quarters were hastening to washington and commodore barney had given orders that we hurry forward with the least possible delay  the commodore told me to say that unless you kept your men moving night and day you would be captured for no less than three british forces are known to be on the way here from the patuxent so the messenger said and lieutenant frazier asked if he knew what body of the enemy was coming up the potomac  a portion of the british fleet under captain gordon is already to be seen from high point the man replied and then he withdrew some distance with the lieutenant as if to give him private instructions  there is no need for me to set down the fact that our small force was in a state of the greatest excitement from no less than three sources we had learned that the enemy was so near as to make capture seem certain and our only hope of safety was to press forward at the best possible speed until arriving at washington where we were told the commodore had already arrived  it was a good deal like being out of the fryingpan into the fire for in case we contrived to elude those who were close in the rear we must come face to face with a yet larger body of the enemy when we did our feeble best toward defending the city  i was getting quite a big taste of warfare and it was by no means to my liking although i had by this time come to understand that i must not put such ideas into words lest my companions accuse me of showing the white feather  we had marched eleven miles with only one halt of fifteen minutes and now instead of going into camp as had been supposed we were to press forward marching night and day for a distance of at least fourteen miles but even though it had been twice as far i would have gone on with at least a show of cheerfulness so great was my fear of being taken prisoner  we halted at the wood yard half an hour and then were going ahead once more but at a less rapid pace for we could not be expected to travel many hours at the same speed which had been kept up since leaving the burning fleet  we ate as we marched munching the cornbread and bacon as best we might and falling out of line to get a drink of water whenever we came to a brook or spring  at the end of the first hour we were halted for ten minutes and then the advance was continued until it seemed to me that i could not put one foot before the other  i suppose i shall hold out as long as the rest of you do but it seems as if id got to drop down right here jerry said to me as we trudged along side by side on as fatiguing and dispiriting a march as i have ever known since its better for a fellow to kill himself by walkin than be sent back to a prison on board one of the british ships  i tried to cheer the dear lad although i myself was needing encouragement most woefully and perhaps i succeeded somewhat by saying  our fathers would set us down as cowards and drones if the men went in with the report that we couldnt travel twentyfive or thirty miles without knocking under  youre right amos and jerry stepped out briskly we should be able to do more of this kind of work than darius who has spent all his life aboard ship an yet there he is humpin along chipper as a sparrow  i turned to look at the old man who was in the rear marching in good order and acting as if on some pleasure excursion which he hoped would not come to an end too soon it shamed me to see him so jolly when i was feeling so sore  from that moment whenever i felt as if it was impossible to take another step i looked at darius and forced myself to forget weariness or hunger  it was nearly sunset when we were come to long old fields where a portion of general winders army had encamped the day previous and here we were met by another messenger from the commodore  this last man had as large a store of fresh provisions as could be hauled by one mule and within five minutes after coming up with him we were getting supper giving no heed to anything save the fact that we had food in plenty for at least one meal  later darius told me that the second messenger repeated orders for us to press forward without unnecessary delay but when our hunger was appeased the lieutenant gave the word that we would be allowed to remain in camp a full two hours and this was no sooner made known than the majority of us stretched our tired bodies on the ground for a time of sleep  jerry and i lay side by side and when we were first in the proper position for sleeping i spoke to my comrade but he made no reply the dear lad had actually fallen into slumber at the very instant his head touched the ground  perhaps i remained awake while one might have counted twenty but i am confident it was no longer than that and then i closed my eyes not to open them again until conscious of a heavy blow on the soles of my feet     chapter xiv  at washington   the first thought in my mind on being aroused from deep slumber by a heavy blow on my feet was that the enemy had come upon us and a battle had been begun while i remained unconscious  springing up quickly my eyes hardly halfopen i made ready to defend myself with no other weapons than those provided by nature but nothing more formidable confronted me than darius thorpe whose mouth was stretched wide in a grin as if he saw something exceeding comical in thus disturbing a fellows slumbers  this is no time for horseplay i cried indignantly having but two hours for rest it would seem that such jokes might be dispensed with  i dont allow that im jokin the old man replied gravely the smile disappearing from his face as he understood that i was thoroughly angry you have used up your allowance of time in sleepin an now its a case of gettin into line  i havent had a fiveminutes nap i cried firmly believing that i spoke the truth  its a good two hours since we came to a halt but even though the time wasnt up wed have to get into motion for another messenger has arrived from the commodore an there wont be any more loafin twixt here an washington  what is the news i asked beginning to be ashamed of myself because of having lost my temper  general ross commandin the british forces on land has arrived at the wood yard an the chances are that with troops accustomed to long marches he will push on without much of a halt even if we were not needed in washington it would stand us in hand to move mighty quick  then darius continued his task of awakening the sleepers and i made ready for another march when it seemed as if the word to halt had but just been given  when we set out again all of us from the avenger were side by side and although it may seem childish to say so the fact that i had friends at either hand gave me renewed strength of body as well as of mind  it is not well that i make any further attempt at following step by step what was supposed to be a hurried movement to reinforce our comrades of the flotilla but which in reality was neither more nor less than a hasty retreat it is enough if i say that late in the night following the day when commodore barneys fleet was destroyed we arrived at the marine barracks in washington where was the force which had accompanied our commander  just then we were too tired and footsore to give any heed to our friends who had been impatiently awaiting the arrival of us who had been left behind on a dangerous duty we only asked permission to lie down anywhere in order to rest our aching limbs and this we were able to do as a matter of course  when morning came however and we were awakened by the bustle and confusion which would naturally arise when five or six hundred men are quartered in four buildings forming a square we gave little heed to the stiffness of joints and blistered feet which remained as mementoes of that long march as we greeted those for whom we had greater or less affection  the first person whom i saw was bill jepson he had been searching through the barracks for jerry and me and i really believe the old fellow was heartily pleased at seeing us once more  well my bullies how about that famous ship avenger amos grout commander and darius thorpe general supercargo bill cried in a voice of thunder as he shook hands with each of us in turn beginning with me and ending with dody wardwell  what there is left of her might be found at the bottom of the patuxent if you hunted long enough i replied feeling a bit saddened by the loss of the pungy and not having had time before to think very much about her fate  the whole fleet went up eh tell me about it and bill seated himself on the edge of a bunk as if expecting to hear a long yarn  there wasnt much to be told as is known by any one who has had the patience to read what has been set down here but i gave him a full account of all we had done and wound up by complaining of the long march we had been forced to take  dont let a little thing like that distress you matey for unless the britishers whip us out of our boots here in washington im thinkin well have to scratch gravel a good many times before this ere war is ended wheres darius  we could give him no information concerning the old man save to say that he was with us when we went to sleep the night previous whereupon bill said with a laugh  i reckon hes tellin the commodore how this little business should be carried on though he claims that the man never lived who could give joshua barney points  i had no particular desire to hear about the commodore or darius therefore i asked if he knew anything concerning elias macomber and as i mentioned the name bill burst into a hearty laugh  know anythin about him lad i reckon i do seeins i helped lodge him in jail an how the hound whined for a chance to escape he promised me more dollars than i could carry in my hat if id give him five minutes the start but so longs he didnt let on where hed get the coin or how it might be passed over to me i couldnt make any dicker  then theres no need to worry any more about his getting away i said to myself whereat bill jepson looked grave and i made haste to say  one might think from the look on your face that you believed his chances for escape were good  hell stay where he is while we hold possession of the city an of that you may be certain lad but in case the british  you are not thinking that the enemy can take washington jerry cried in amazement  ay lad an if the truth was known im not the only one who is believin much the same thing  but all the people in this country would come here to defend the city i exclaimed thinking for the moment that bill jepson was trying to play upon our fears  they havent done it so far and the sailor looked grave again as near as i can hear weve got about seven thousand men near about an moren threequarters of em are so green that it would be dangerous to let the cows have a whack at em  have the britishers a larger force jim freeman asked  no lad not quite so many when you come to number em up but they are all trained soldiers every one the match for three of ours in a reglar battle no matter how well the americans can fight then again what with the president an all the big bugs takin a hand weve got too many commanders leave the whole business to one mansay joshua barney for example an i believe we could hold our own  to us youngsters who had come expecting to aid in a successful defense of the city this kind of talk was not particularly cheerful and i would have welcomed any change in the conversation but bill jepson had used his eyes to good advantage during the short stay in washington and was determined that we should receive the benefit of what he had seen and heard  last night mr monroe the secretary of state sent a despatch to the president an i saw a copy of it while on duty at the commodores quarters it read like this the enemy are advanced six miles on the road to the wood yard and our troops are retiring our troops were on the march to meet them but in too small a body to engage general winder proposes to retire till he can collect them in a body the enemy are in full march to washington have the materials prepared to destroy the bridges that was signed with mr monroes name lads an after so much he wrote you had better remove the records now do you think im so far out of the way in sayin that theres a good chance of our gettin the worst of it  just at that moment to my great relief of mind my father appeared in the doorway of the barracks and i sprang to meet him  how good it was to see his dear face once more what a sense of relief came over me because he was near i was yet so young as to believe that no harm could come to a fellow while his father was near and on the moment all the fears which had been aroused by bill jepson passed out of mind  it is not necessary for me to set down that conversation between my father and me while it related to the dear ones at home or our own two selves but when we had spoken our fill on such matters it was but natural we should come back to the situation in which our troops were placed and greatly to my surprise i found that my father despaired of success in much the same measure as did bill jepson  we can only do our best lad and for your mothers sake well pray that both of us may go back to benedict but if only one then it should be you who have promise of so many more years of life than i  we were yet speaking of matters much too private to be set down in a story like this when the command came for all the men of commodore barneys force to fall into line and on the instant we understood that we were to join the small army led by general winder  i know not how it was we were so confident as to our destination except that the general and our commander had been long in consultation before this day but certain it is we felt positive all of us were about to retrace our steps  and now while our men are scurrying to and fro making ready for another march before having recovered from the one just ended let me set down here what i afterward read in print for it will serve to explain why we did not do that which the country expected and even demanded  winders situation was an unenviable onea with a comparatively strong foe on his front ready to fall upon him or the capital he was expected to defend he had only about twentyfive hundred armed and effective men in camp and many of these had been from their homes only three or four days they were undisciplined and untried and surrounded and influenced by a crowd of excited civilians to whose officious but wellintended information and advice the general was compelled to listen in addition to this intrusion and interference of common men he was embarrassed by the presence and suggestions of the president and his cabinet ministers the most of them utterly ignorant of military affairs better would it have been for winder and the country if these civilians from the president down had kept away from the camp and the field and prudently preserved silence  a lossings war of 1812  as a matter of course we of the rank and file knew very little concerning the trials of the officer who was charged with the defense of the city but we did understand that our force was not sufficient in either discipline or numbers to cope with that which we must meet yet i did not hear a word of grumbling or fear as we made ready for the march  it was as if a full knowledge of the danger served to inspire us with courage  we set out within ten minutes after the order had been received but i did not see commodore barney until we had retraced our steps to long old fields and there we found the small army throwing up a slight breastwork as if believing that an attack was imminent  this looks as if you an i might see more of war than may be pleasant jerry whispered to me as we stood in line waiting to be dismissed it is all very well to fight when youre on board a good vessel but runnin around on shore marchin here till you can do no more than move an then marchin back again is a little better than i hanker after  its too late to talk like that i replied smiling as i remembered how eager my partner had been to go as a soldier when i was hanging back were like to see an hundred times worse than this before were many hours older  ay an theres never one here save you amos who shall have an inklin of the fact that im growin mighty sick of my bargain  then we were dismissed to find such tents and rations as general winders force could spare us for our baggagetrain was yet on the road and while we were thus engaged jim freeman shouted to us  darius has got a tent for our crowd its close by the commodores an whats better the old sailor has been rummagin round till hes got all the grub well need for some time to come  where are dody and josiah i asked  holdin down the tent till we can take possession theres so much pullin an haulin after rations an quarters that it aint safe to leave anything alone  i supposed that we would be ordered to aid in throwing up the breastworks therefore it stood us in hand to learn where we belonged before the labor was begun and without delay we followed jim  indeed we had been fortunate in having darius to care for us since thanks to him none at long old fields save the officers were quartered as well as we  in a few moments the canvas tent strewn with our belongings had quite a home air and we lost no time in making an attack on the store of provisions which the old sailor had gathered for us  we were eating hurriedly lest we should be ordered to take up the picks and shovels before our hunger could be satisfied when darius came in looking thoroughly fagged and worn out  but for you wed been without a shelter tonight i said as he threw himself on the ground near me  an that would have made little difference lad for the open air in a summers night is ahead of any canvas house howsomever the tent serves as a place where we can keep our belongings without fear some of these clodhoppin imitations of soldiers will get away with em  i suppose we shall be called upon to take a hand in throwing up breastworks i suggested and a more cheerful look came over the old mans face than i had seen since word was given to fire the fleet  we who have just come in will be allowed to take it easy if the britishers dont interfere till mornin when if theres time left us well turn to at throwin dirt  all of us lads settled back with a certain sense of comfort and satisfaction difficult to describe there were many in that small army who were hungry because of the delay and confusion in sending out supplies and yet more who would lie down with nothing to shelter them from the heavy dew while we were well protected and with a goodly food supply all of which spoke well for the forethought and ability of darius thorpe  im goin to turn in if so be weve got nothin to do till mornin jim freeman said as he suited the action to the words and josiah and dody followed his example  i was not minded to close my eyes in slumber until after having heard from the old sailor all he could tell although it goes without saying that i was tired enough to be able to sleep standing up  have you heard anything new since we arrived i asked and darius replied in a low tone as if afraid his words might be overheard by some one on the outside  the commodore says we shall have a battle within eight an forty hours an you know how well he can smell out such things it seems certain we cant meet the enemy here unless more men are sent an as i take it we shall march hither an yon till we come to the fight fit for nothin but to turn in  where are the british now  the main body is at upper marlboro but there are a couple of columns movin about in a way that betokens mischief for some of us twixt now an mornin  what have you been doing i didnt see anything of you after we started back for this place  i came on ahead ridin part of the way with the commodore an weve been on the move pretty much ever since general stansbury is at bladensburg an general winder counts on goin there tomorrow for a conference leavin our commodore in command here  but what have you been doing to tire you so thoroughly i persisted  nothin exceptin tag around at joshua barneys heels an hes a reglar tiger at walkin whereas it puts me in bad shape  why not lie down while you may and get some sleep i asked  because im under orders to go back to the commodore you lads turn in an ill creep under cover whenever its possible  having thus evaded my question as to what he had been doing the old man went out of the tent leaving jerry and i gazing at each other but not daring to speak the thoughts which were in our mind  if commodore barney and darius thorpe were so anxious as to what might be the result of our meeting with the enemy surely we two lads ignorant of everything pertaining to warfare save marching had cause for alarm  we sat facing each other a full ten minutes without speaking it was possible to hear the laborers as they threw up the slight breastwork which could be of but little service save to mark our position or the hum of conversation as the idlers paced to and fro near the tent and all these sounds was token that we were a tiny part of the living machine with which nations waged war  theres no sense in sittin here like a couple of dummies jerry finally said wed best be gettin all the sleep we can an then well be the better prepared for what is before us  it would have pleased me well to find my father and have a talk with him but i did not feel warranted in leaving my comrades at such a time therefore i acted at once upon jerrys suggestion  it was not a difficult matter to fall asleep after the long march and until late in the night i enjoyed a most refreshing slumber when the entrance of darius awakened me  what is the time i asked  near to midnight  have you been working all this while  movin around with the commodore thats all darius replied as he laid down beside me and a moment later his heavy breathing told that the weary old man was resting after nearly twenty hours of labor  try as i might it was impossible to close my eyes in sleep immediately my thoughts would stray back to benedict and the more my mind dwelt upon mother and the children the less inclined did i feel for slumber  i twisted and turned while my tentmates slept more or less noisily until by the cries of the sentinels i knew it was two oclock in the morning and then the idea that in a few hours i must be at work with no chance for rest caused me to feel drowsy  save for the measured tread of the sentinels and their calls from time to time the silence of the encampment was profound and i was idly saying to myself that it seemed difficult to fancy one was in the midst of more than two thousand men when suddenly came a sharp cry from a distance followed by another and another until the long roll of the drums rang out on the night air like distant thunder  what is it i cried as darius sprang to his feet  the call for all hands the old man said as he groped around for his musket and ammunition the britishers have shown themselves hopin to take us by surprise most like move lively lads for joshua barneys followin must be the first in line  how we contrived to arm ourselves and get out of the tent into the midst of a throng of apparently bewildered men i know not but certain it is we found ourselves there following darius who was the only one i saw that evidently had his wits about him left to ourselves we would have wandered aimlessly around the encampment as did many hundred of the men but the old sailor who surely should have been born a soldier led us to the proper place as if he had always served his country on land instead of water  we found our people from the flotilla in fairly good formation ready to repel an attack while the raw militia were scurrying to and fro like frightened sheep and such fact made me feel proud that i was a member of barneys seamen  youve done well lads the commodore said approvingly while he moved to and fro in front of us to make certain that we were all there well show these landsmen before this little scrimmage is over that we old shellbacks are not webfooted when it comes to obeying orders  then it was that i began to understand why those who served under joshua barney were so proud of and had such confidence in him there was in the ring of his voice in his way of looking at a fellow and his every movement something which bespoke him a friend and from that moment i became as ardent an admirer of the fighting captain as ever was darius thorpe  of a verity i believe a full fifteen minutes elapsed before all our people were in line of battle which spoke badly for what might happen in case the enemy planned a surprise and then we learned that the alarm was a false one  some weakkneed sentinel was frightened at his own shadow the commodore said speaking quietly to his men but it hasnt done us any harm to be routed out in short order for now we can see how necessary it may be to know our stations turn in my hearties and get what rest you can before we stand up in front of the redcoats to give them a lesson which theyre needing  then we went back to our tent but not to sleep there is a mighty lot of excitement in turning out at night to be shot at and darius was the only member of our party who felt inclined to lie down  we sat under the canvas talking in whispers lest we disturb those near at hand and the old sailor was soon giving good proof that he had sailed over into dreamland  of what did we talk i cant really tell but you might put yourself in our places and say if you would not naturally speak of those most dear when you knew beyond a peradventure that within a few hours at the most you would be standing face to face with death  when the day broke we stole softly out of the tent that darius might get all the sleep possible and building a small fire toasted the strips of bacon which made up the greater portion of our rations  then all hands sat around the tent to prevent any one from awakening the old man without good and sufficient cause until sunrise when word was passed from one to another that orders had been given to load all tents on the baggagewagons for the army was to move within an hour  then it was that we felt obliged to call darius and he came up on his feet at the first word having all his wits about him at the moment of awakening as is the habit of sailormen  goin to move eh he said when we told him of the order then im thinkin the next halt will be at whatsoever place general winder has picked out for a battlefield look after the tent lads while i get a word with the commodore  he marched off in the direction of headquarters and we set about the task i observing while passing among the militia that the men as a rule were looking mighty glum which augured ill for their performances if indeed a battle was near at hand     chapter xv  bladensburg   if i would tell all that was done in and around washington by our people and then have space in which to set down that which we lads were able to accomplish after the british had worked their will very much of what then seemed highly interesting to us of the avenger must be passed over with but few words  perhaps it is well that it should be so for we moved here and there without apparent aim or purpose until every man and officer was on the verge of exhaustion and then when it required no slight effort simply to remain on our feet we were forced to meet the british army which had advanced by short stages to the end that the men should be in the best physical condition for that struggle which decided the fate of the nations capital  we had no sooner struck our tents than word was brought that the president was on his way from the potomac to review our troops and at such information darius grumbled loud and long therefore we lads knew full well that commodore barney was opposed to such monkeyshines otherwise the old sailor would not have dared to voice his complaints so stoutly  when we might have been resting preparatory to the extraordinary fatigues that were before us all our little army were forced to remain in line a good two hours when president madison was ready to begin the review after which we marched and countermarched in front of him when three men out of every four were unable to understand the words of command  it was a most ridiculous performance as can well be fancied and if the chief magistrate of the land was well pleased with the result it is more than can be said for the officers in command  by the time this mockery of a review had come to an end scouts arrived with information that the main body of the enemy was still resting comfortably at upper marlboro whereupon we were allowed to remain in line while the general sent couriers to the different commanders under him directing them to move in the direction of the british camp  we remained on parade from shortly after sunrise until ten oclock in the forenoon when we were as tired as if from a long march then we were dismissed but since all the tents had been carried away in the baggagewagons there was nothing for us to do save lounge around in the open field exposed to the burning rays of the sun  nothing more was done in the way of throwing up breastworks therefore we who had been the last to leave the fleet were not called upon to handle pick or shovel  an hour before noon general winder escorted by a troop of lavals cavalry left the encampment and it was reported that he had gone to hold a conference with general stansbury at bladensburg  all our rations save what each man had held back in his pockets were with the baggagetrain therefore we did not make a very hearty meal at noon and perhaps it was as well for while we were eating the small amount of food at our disposal two companies of maryland militia under command of major peter came into camp on the double quick with every evidence of terror on their faces  immediately the long roll was sounded and as we fell into line once more expecting to see the enemy advancing word was whispered around that major peter scouting in the direction of marlboro on the wood yard road had skirmished with the britishers and been driven back  commodore barney and general smith who had command of the militia in the absence of general winder set about making preparations for battle and major mckenney was sent in hot haste to inform our commander of the position of affairs  we remained under arms and in momentary expectation of being engaged in a life or death struggle until near sunset when general winder arrived and without loss of time we were headed for washington at a sharp pace thus being forced to march over the same ground three times without having seen the enemy once  we arrived for the second time at the capital about midnight and were posted near the eastern branch bridge there to get such repose as might be possible while we did guard duty on that side of the city  in order to show that my grumbling had good foundation i am going to set down here a portion of general smiths report as i heard it read a week later  the arrival at the eastern branch bridge terminated the four days of service of the troops of this district they have been under arms with but little intermission the whole of the time both night and day have traveled during their different marches in advance and retreat a considerable tract of country exposed to the burning heat of a sultry sun by day and many of them to the cold dews of the night uncovered they have in this period drawn but two rations the requisition therefor in the first instance being but partially complied with and it being afterward almost impossible to procure the means of transportation the wagons employed by our quartermaster for that purpose being constantly impressed by the government agents for the purpose of removing the public records when the enemys approach was known and some of them thus seized while proceeding to take in provisions for the army  on that night after our arrival we heard that the british were advanced within two miles of long old fields we who comprised the command under general winder were worn and dispirited lavals horsemen were exhausted and stansburys men at bladensburg were tired out by long marches lack of sleep and scarcity of food  as if to make bad matters worse our general fell from his horse near about daybreak and really was not fit to remain in the saddle although he pluckily kept on duty not the least of which were many conferences with the president and members of his cabinet  at sunrise after our force had indulged in less than two hours sleep lavals scouts brought in positive information that the british general ross was marching directly toward bladensburg half an hour later messengers came from general stansbury with the word that the enemy was in his front and urging that reinforcements be sent at once  it was a case of making another march without breakfast and for the matter of that we had had no supper the night previous  there was more than one grumbler when we obeyed the summons to fall in but the men under commodore barney held their peace after our leader urged that we act like patriots and not like children who had come out expecting to enjoy a holiday  well off we posted for bladensburg a good eight miles from where we had halted and i for one hoped that the battle since there must be one would be on at once for it seemed better to be shot at than worn down by apparently aimless running to and fro  we of the flotilla arrived near bladensburg shortly after noon and were stationed about a mile from the village on the washington road there we found two eighteens and three 12pounders all ships guns mounted on carriages which had been drawn to the spot by the marines from the navy yard and with these we were supposed to hold our position having no other support than a crowd of raw militia in front of us  our force meaning those under commodore barneys command numbered as i have already said about five hundred and although we had no knowledge of military tactics we knew enough to obey our officers to the best of our ability which was considerably more than could be said for very many of the troops near at hand  i cannot set down that which followed in proper fashion so that it could be understood by those familiar with the game of war i only know what happened near my comrades and myself for the crew of the avenger had taken good care to stand side by side at this time when one or all of us might meet death through the medium of british lead  for myself i can say this that when i looked around at the mass of menfive thousand strong i have since heard and saw them wrangling over this trifling matter or that openly disputing some command or boldly leaving an assigned position to take up one which pleased them better i had more fear of what might come to us through the cowardice or ignorance of our own people than regarding the ability of the enemy to cut us up  darius made his preparations for the conflict by stuffing a huge piece of tobacco into his mouth after which he proceeded to read us a lecture on behavior while under fire  remember this he said with the air of one who knows it all it isnt every bullet that finds its billet an the toughest time is just now when were waitin for what all hands know is bound to come think of the folks at benedict an kinder figger out what theyd say if you went home after showin yourselves cowards under fire there are worse things than bein killed or wounded in battle an the hardest is to live knowin every youngster on the street has the right to call you a whitelivered sneak what ran away when danger came stand here behind joshua barney for i warrant he wont give you a chance to get in front of him an youll be doin about right  when the old man had come to an end of his instructions we would have conversed among ourselves speaking much no doubt of the folks at home but he sternly bade us hold our tongues thinking that we would not be heartened by such talk and straightway began to tell us a yarn of how he and bill jepson had fought under commodore barney when the enemy was a ship of thirtytwo guns and they in a schooner carrying only twelve 10pounders  the yarn had not yet come to an end when a commotion among the men in front of us caused me to crane my neck to look in the direction many were pointing and there i saw the lines of red marching directly toward us in perfect order as if on parade  at almost the same moment the enemy began to throw rockets among our people and these exploding hurled bullets in every direction  within two minutes from the time i first saw the britishers no less than five men near me were stricken down and the sight of the gaping wounds together with the moans of the sufferers gave me a sensation of faintness which was wellnigh overpowering  stand steady you lads from the avenger darius cried sharply warned no doubt by the sight of our pale faces that we were growing sick in more ways than one somebody must get hurt else the battle would never be over an were here to spoil the britishers fun which we shall do mighty soon joshua barney is only waitin for the proper time an when he gives the word to begin work therell be a change of tune  at that moment and before a gun had been fired the militiamen in front of us broke into a run toward the rear many of them throwing down their muskets as they took part in a most disgraceful retreat  for the credit of our flotillamen and the marines i must set it down that not one of them wavered when the retreat was begun and after the last of the cowards was in the rear i heard the commodore shout  nows your time lads give it to em hot an strong but make every charge count  then our ships guns were discharged and the faintness left me as i saw the missiles cut down long lanes in the redcoated ranks the smell of burning powder must have got into my brain for from that moment i knew nothing save that my musket was to be loaded and discharged as rapidly as possible  men fell around me by the score yet i gave no heed to the evidences of suffering once a man shot through the head pitched forward directly into my arms covering me with blood as he sank dead at my feet and yet unused though i was to such scenes it caused me no other feeling than that of anger because he had spoiled my aim  i knew nothing of what was going on immediately in front of me save that the red line now broken by many a gap was before my eyes that it advanced fell back and advanced again sending among us such a shower of bullets that the buzzing in the air was like unto a swarm of angry bees  once jerry tried to say something to me but i pushed him back petulantly so strong a hold had the fever of battle upon me my musket barrel grew hot to the touch and it was no longer possible to charge it properly without compunctions i exchanged weapons with one of the dead men at my feet and continued the work shouting aloud in vengeful joy when i saw an enemy fall by my hand  darius cried out in my ear but i heard him not nor did i heed the fact that he wanted to speak with me i was insane with the scene of carnage the salty odor of blood and the choking stifling fumes of burning powder  then suddenly darius pulled me back by the coatcollar forcing me to run with him and as we went swiftly past our guns toward the rear i asked what he was doing  the word had been given to retreat he cried do the best you can with your legs lad for therell be no quarter given if we are taken we of the flotilla with the marines have borne the brunt of this whole battle for the last half hour an weve left our mark on the redcoats even if we are turnin tail now  but the commodore i cried now getting back a portion of my scattered senses  wounded ten minutes ago an taken off the field i hope it was in my mind to help him but he ordered me to go back to duty an i went for when joshua barney gives the word even though hes half dead its safest to obey without makin much talk captain miller of the marines was shot down at about the same time  then i had sense enough to see that all my comrades of the avenger were close about me none of them appearing to be hurt and while we ran to save ourselves from being made prisoners let me set down that which was written less than a week after the battle of bladensburg for as it turned out we had fought a regular battle  no troops remained in line except the party under commodore barney and two detachments on his right that were well posted having been so roughly handled the enemy made no attempt to advance directly in front of the seamen and marines but after forcing the troops on their right from the field by a demonstration in that direction they prepared to turn the rear of barney in order to surround him  while these movements were going on in front a party of light troops had been thrown out on the enemys right and the militia having abandoned the ground they were also beginning to close upon the americans that stood by this time commodore barney captain miller and several other officers were wounded and victory being impossible against odds so great an order was given to commence a retreat  the defense had been too obstinate to admit of carrying off the guns which were necessarily abandoned all the men retired with the exception of the badly wounded among the latter however were commodore barney and captain miller who both fell into the enemys hands  of the marines nearly onethird were among the casualties and the flotillamen suffered considerably though in smaller proportions the people of the flotilla under the orders of barney and the marines were justly applauded for their excellent conduct no troops could have stood better and the fire of both artillery and musketry has been described as to the last degree severe  jerry who reads each day what i write says that by putting down the account of what we of the flotilla did i am blowing my own horn but i do not so consider it since the fact is a matter of history and if we won praise on that disastrous day then we should boast of it to the end that the picture may not be so black  and now to return to us of the avenger who were fugitives without any idea of where safety might be found  strange to say not one of us had been wounded while many a better man close beside us had met his death  darius took it upon himself to lead our party and right willing were we to have him act as commander though i question if he really knew where he was going when we left the bloody field  there is no shame in my heart when i set it down that we ran from the enemy and did our level best at that game the order to retreat had been given after we had done all that might have been expected from well seasoned troops and to have remained longer would have been a useless sacrifice  by instinct rather than deliberation darius led us southward close on the heels of several hundred men all of whom were quite as eager as we to keep out of the enemys clutches  to the best of my knowledge the british did not pursue they had won a victory but in so doing received quite as much of a drubbing as was needed and officers as well as privates were willing to remain on the hardearned field  i believe it was a full hour before darius would allow us to slacken the pace and then we were well among the foremost of the fugitives  by this time we were so nearly winded that it was impossible to continue the flight without a breathing spell and the old man allowed us to halt when we were close upon the city  we could see that our people were bearing to the west in order to give washington a wide berth and when it was possible to speak because of my heavy breathing i asked darius where he proposed to go  thats what i havent rightly made up my mind on the old man said thoughtfully it stands to reason that the enemy will sooner or later try to make as many prisoners as possible an im allowin that those fellows ahead are bound to have a hot time of it before theyre many hours older if we could only get down the river  but we cant an that much is certain jerry said petulantly  perhaps youve got another scheme in your head since the oyster business turned out so well and it is possible that i spoke sharply realizing with bitterness just then that but for my partners proposition to sell fish to the fleet i might never have discovered i owed my country a duty and consequently would not at that moment be hunted down or in danger of it  perhaps i have jerry replied quietly giving no heed to my disagreeable manner of speaking  what is it lad darius asked curiously i take it that at such a time as this a bit of advice no matter from whom it comes is well worth listenin to  why not go straight into washington an stay there till we find a chance to slip down the river  into washington jim freeman cried in alarm why the britishers have promised to burn the town  i know that an it aint likely any of our people will go there because of that same thing  an yet you allow that we should stick our noses into the mess darius asked  ay because the britishers never will suspect that any who took part in the fight would go there it should be possible to find a hidingplace somewhere in the town an it strikes me we wouldnt be in as much danger as if we kept with the crowd  i began to think that there was more in jerrys scheme than appeared when he first suggested it and darius seemed to be considering the matter very seriously  in the first place my partner continued warming to the subject when he saw that we were interested it would be necessary to get there before the britishers took possession an it might be we could pass ourselves off as fellows who had stayed in the town like cowards rather than take the chances of bein shot  its a pretty good scheme lad an i for one am willin to try it darius said abruptly as he rose to his feet if the others think as i do wed better be movin  after the old man had thus spoken there was not one of us who would have ventured to object for he had shown that in any business of this kind he knew more than all of us put together therefore we made ready to set out but before the first step had been taken we saw coming toward us from the direction of bladensburg a man riding a mule and waving his arms as if to attract our attention  go on i said petulantly we cant afford to hang around here very long if we count on finding a hidingplace in the city and that is only one of the country people who wants to sell his mule  i reckon well wait a bit darius replied firmly unless im way out of my reckonin yonder man was in the fight an has scooped up one of the baggagewagon mules to help him along  but our party is too big for safety now and what will it be if we allow every straggler to trail on behind we might as well follow the other fugitives  all this i said like a peevish child and no sooner had i ceased speaking than darius seized me by the shoulder forcing me to turn until i had a full view of the newcomer  look at the man the sailor cried sternly an then say whether you will allow every straggler to trail on behind us when the road is as free to one as another  in an instant i was covered with confusion and remorse the man to whose company i had objected was none other than my own father and as he approached i could see that he was wounded in the right leg  there was nothing i could say just then to show my comrades how deeply i regretted having spoken in such a tone therefore i ran forward to greet him who a moment previous i had been eager to leave behind  my comrades joined me as i saluted my father much more warmly than i might have done but for the unkind words i had spoken and in a few seconds we heard all the story he could tell  he had been wounded quite severely during the early part of the battle and went to the rear in search of the surgeons failing to find those whose duty it was to be near the scene of action and unable to walk any further owing to loss of blood he laid down under one of the baggagewagons which had been used to transport ammunition  here he bandaged his wound as well as possible and was about to set out once more in search of aid when the final retreat was ordered unable to walk he would soon have been made a prisoner or perhaps in the heat of the moment received worse treatment when the idea of escaping on one of the mules occurred to him  cutting the traces he rode off taking a course to the north in his ignorance of the country but discovering his mistake he turned about and the first persons he saw were those of our party  without wasting any time we told him of jerrys scheme and he having nothing better to propose agreed to make the venture more particularly because he stood sadly in need of some attention since the wound had been only rudely bandaged  darius claimed that he could treat it after a sailorly fashion provided we found clean water and cotton cloth and declared that it would heal as well after such treatment as if any save a skilled surgeon had dressed it  as a matter of course we kept the mule for it was necessary my father should ride and after the delay needed in which to explain matters our little party started toward washington knowing full well that we were going where it was certain the enemy would soon come  although i had agreed to jerrys scheme and was willing to do whatsoever the majority of my companions decided was for the best i could not but believe that ours was as rash a move as fugitives ever made for of a verity it was thrusting ourselves into the jaws of the lion  now that my father was with us having his wound as proof that he had taken part in the battle we could no longer hope to pass ourselves off as cowards who remained at home while others were fighting for us and in event of being captured in the city i believed we would receive rougher usage than those taken prisoners on the battlefield     chapter xvi  in hiding   i question if my companions were any less uneasy in mind regarding our seeking a refuge in the city about to be occupied by the british than was i but no one ventured to say exactly what he thought lest it serve to check our courage and of a verity we needed that in abundance if we were to make a success of jerrys scheme  darius and i walked either side of the mule on which my father rode where we might be ready to give the wounded man assistance in case his strength failed him suddenly but neither of us dared discuss the possibilities of the future  when we were come nearly to the city my father asked me if we had any money with which to purchase food and i replied by showing him the two silver coins remaining of the amount paid by the britishers for oysters  darius had the same number of pieces in copper and jim freeman was the capitalist among us he having no less than two shillings  we had funds in plenty for the purchase of such food as would satisfy our hunger during two or three days and the only matter which gave us any uneasiness was regarding a shelter which had now become absolutely necessary since father joined us for it went without saying that he must not be seen  when jerry conceived the scheme we were attempting to carry into execution he believed as did i that washington would be almost wholly abandoned by the citizens and in fact it was reasonable to suppose that when the news of the defeat was brought to the city nearly every one would seek safety in flight therefore we counted on being able to take shelter in any building which took our fancy  while yet in the outskirts of the town however we understood that we were mistaken so far as i could see the inhabitants remained within their homes probably under the belief that the enemy would behave like civilized people rather than as barbarians and our chances for finding a hidingplace seemed small  having no acquaintance with the city we walked on at haphazard until having come within a short distance of a tavern near the capitol hard by a large building which looked not unlike a rope walk  it was in my mind that we could do no better than stop at the tavern trusting that our small store of money would suffice to pay for one room in which all of us might gather but to this darius made most decided objection  it is the last place for us to choose he said decidedly even if the house is not taken as quarters by some of the officers it will be visited by the rank and file and we might as well be in the open air yonder smokehouse would suit our purpose better  it seemed to me that in a city said to contain nine hundred buildings we could do better than hide in a smokehouse and so i said claiming that we would be in no more danger by making ourselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances than if we huddled into some corner  jim freeman and jerry seemed to be in my way of thinking but darius declared that unless we could content ourselves with such a hidingplace as was not likely to attract the attention of the enemy we might count him out of the scheme  but what can be done with the mule if we take to the smokehouse i cried believing i thus had an argument which he could not well answer  turn him loose of course he is government property and would give stronger proof of our havin been with the army than your fathers wound besides should the soldiers hear him an you cant reckon on keepin that kind of a beast quiet theyd be bound to have him out if only for the sake of sport  then darius went toward his chosen place of refuge leaving us to follow or not as best pleased us and the result can well be imagined  we would not cut loose from the old sailor who because of his experience in such circumstances was best calculated to advise and aid therefore we followed him meekly but with many a mental complaint  when we were come to the rough building which was hardly larger than the cabin of the scorpion darius lifted my father from the animals back as if he had been no more than a child and carried him into the place that was less inviting than the hold of the avenger after we had taken out a cargo of oysters  placing him in one corner where he might sit with his back against the boards the old sailor went outside and drove the mule in the direction of the tavern himself following until he was lost to view much to our surprise and disquietude  now what is he about jerry asked petulantly i thought we were to stay here  it seems that we are i replied with a mirthless laugh but it appears that master thorpe counts on being better lodged  do you suppose he allows to stop at the tavern while were to stay in this smokehouse jim freeman asked in a tone of dismay and i sore at heart because my advice had not been followed replied bitterly thereby setting myself down for at least the twentieth time as a simple  we can be certain hell look after himself no matter how we may fare  then we stood waiting in silence until it should be certain that darius had really abandoned us when my father said striving to suppress any evidence of the pain which he suffered  you lads are making a big mistake if you think darius thorpe would leave you at such a time as this he has ever had the name of holding to a comrade and hell not steer another course while were in so much danger  five minutes later i was covered with shame because of my unkind words when we saw the old man returning with as much hay as he could stagger under  heres what will make our cripple a bit more comfortable he said cheerily as he thrust his burden through the narrow door pile it well up under him an ill go back for the rest of the supplies  none of us lads made any comment when darius returned toward the tavern but that all hands were conscious of the same sense of shame as had come over me i understood by the expression on their faces  when the old man joined us the second time he had in his arms the larger part of a ham some strips of cotton cloth and a jug of water  how did you get all that stuff jerry asked in surprise  traded the mule when i was drivin the beast off it struck me that he might be made to serve us a bit so i drove a bargain  did you give the people to understand that he was yours  not a bit of it lad i aint tryin that kind of business even when im hungry i told the truth but claimed that the beast was under my protection an id be willin to leave him for the few things we might need it aint certain but id got what i asked for without the mule though it was better to have a reglar trade made pitch into the ham and later it may be we can get some bread  we did not wait for the second invitation but began chipping off bits of the meat eating greedily regardless of the fact that it was uncooked when i saw that darius was making no effort toward getting his share  why dont you eat i asked as i gave my father a small handful of the uninviting food  im the surgeon now an till this job is finished i reckon i can contrive to get along without more in my mouth than a piece of terbacco its mighty lucky i laid in a good supply before we left pig point  the truehearted old sailor had provided us lads with a meal and now proposed to dress my fathers wound before attending to his own wants which must have been greater than ours because he had performed more work  i resolved then and there that however much against him might be appearances i would never believe him guilty of any mean act toward his comrades and in the future he should have the full half of anything which might come into my possession  darius washed and bandaged fathers wound raised the bed of hay that he might recline more comfortably fastened the door in such a manner that there would be no token on the outside of our occupancy and not until all this had been done did he give heed to his own necessities  were not so bad off here as we might be the old man said in a tone of content as he whittled away at the small remnant of ham while we lads were stretched at full length on the hay im allowin that whatever happens the britishers wont look in a smokehouse for american soldiers or sailors an we can stay here snug as bugs in a rug barrin bein a little hungry till amos father is in better condition to travel  but it will be a long while before that wound is healed jim freeman exclaimed in dismay  yes i reckon itll be quite a spell pervidin the britishers stay in the city but if they go it wont be a hard job to find a boat thatll take us to the patuxent but theres little call to make much talk about movin for we cant leave one of the crowd no matter what happens to the rest of us  by the time all this had been done it was sunset the retreat from bladensburg had been begun about four oclock in the afternoon and we were not so badly off to be in washington and housed so soon after the defeat  the one distressing question was whether the enemy would make search in the city for such as we  after he had eaten all the scraps of ham remaining on the bone darius set about making a more thorough examination of our refuge beginning with the small shutter at the top of the building which was used when the meat having been cured it was desired to clear the place of smoke  what are you doing up there my father asked when the old sailor clambered on the logs to get at the shutter  makin sure we can keep a lookout in case things get too hot darius replied with a laugh im allowin this shutter can be swung open a crack without its bein noticed from the outside  he had no more than opened the window when an exclamation burst from his lips and without delay i clambered up beside him  from this point of vantage we had a fairly good view of what was going on near about the capitol building and my heart beat fast and furiously with fear as i saw the enemy advancing  there seems to be the biggest part of the british army darius said pointing in the direction of the buryingground where i could see the soldiers bivouacking for the night but nearer at hand were two officers evidently high in commandgeneral ross and admiral cockburn as i afterward learned with an escort of three or four hundred men riding directly toward us  within full view of our hidingplace was a dwelling standing near the government building and as we gazed i saw the flash of a musket come from this house when the horse on which the general was riding fell dead carrying the officer to the ground with him in what looked to be an ugly fall  thats a fool trick darius cried angrily when no other sign of attack could be seen or heard a crazy man must have fired that shot which can do no other good than to make the enemy hot to inflict some punishment  we saw a score or more of the escort rush to the assistance of the officer while the remainder of the soldiers were wheeled about to face the dwelling  i was confident that they would fire a volley into the house and indeed i could well have excused such a course considering the provocation but instead of this a squad of men were told off to enter the building as we saw when the force ran forward on the doublequick with fixed bayonets  by this time as may well be imagined all our party with the exception of my father were clinging to the timbers of the building that a view might be had of what was going on outside and darius ever mindful of others took it upon himself to keep our invalid informed of what was being done  theyve sent a squad of men to clean out the house i reckon the old sailor said for fathers benefit the officer aint hurt so but that he can mount a spare horse which a colonel has just brought him now the two in command are pointin out the different buildins looks as if they were pickin out their quarters theres one thing certain fine birds like them wont want to sleep in a smokehouse so we aint likely to be turned out right away  i interrupted the report by exclaiming aloud in my excitement for i saw smoke issuing from the dwelling which i afterward learned was the home of mr robert sewall and then it was i understood for what purpose the squad had been sent  theyve fired the house darius continued to my father an without givin them who may be livin there a chance to carry anythin out soldiers are stationed to prevent the people from tryin to fight the flames an it wouldnt surprise me if we saw a pretty hot time in this town  at this moment a squad of men was sent to the ropewalk another to the tavern hard by our place of refuge and a third to the next building which from the sign on its front i knew to be the national intelligencer newspaper  after what we had seen it was not difficult to guess the purpose of these soldiers and darius said to my father  theyre firin the ropewalk now an it looks as if the whole city might go  surely the british wouldnt do so barbarous a deed my father exclaimed war isnt carried on in that way these days  it seems to be goin so now there comes the smoke from the tavern an men are stationed to prevent the people from savin anything how about it lads if we had spent our last cent hirin a room there the smoke would be forcin us out by this time an wed soon find ourselves prisoners in the hands of such as stand ready to burn a city where are mostly women an children  its not certain but that well be forced out as it is i exclaimed when the tavern barns get afire this smokehouse stands a good chance of burning  it may be lad but the wind draws in on the other side an im allowin that this shanty small as it is wont come to harm though if it does go well try to keep our upper lips stiff so the villainous redcoats shant have a chance to crow over us very much  we saw the men comprising the escort now break ranks each going apparently where he pleased and darius cried in anger  it is to be a reglar sack of the city such as were told they had in the old times when men were reckoned as bein little better than brutes work like this will count big for the britishers before the other nations of the world there goes a crowd of soldiers into the little shop beyond the tavern theyre plunderin it in piratical style see em throw the goods out into the street the redcoats from the encampment scentin booty are comin up by the hundreds  from where we were perched it was possible to see three shops and by the time the tavern was well afire no less than five hundred men had robbed these tramping into the dirt such goods as they did not want to carry away and then the buildings were set on fire  verily it was a barbarous sack of the city  then it was when the flames from the buildings of which i have spoken were mounting high in the sky that i observed the commander order up a full company of soldiers it was possible to see for although night had come the fire lighted up surrounding objects as at noonday that he gave them orders at great length after which they started off toward the capitol at full speed  theyre goin to burn the government buildins darius cried for my fathers benefit a hundred or more have been detailed to do the work an the commanders are watchin proceedins like that chap i forget his name who played on the fiddle while rome was burnin an all this is bein done by the high an lofty britishers who count on settin the pace for the whole world  jim freeman and dody wardwell who could not find perches near the window that they might look out now opened the door regardless of consequences and stood gazing at as cruel a scene as can well be imagined  women and children driven back by the redcoats stood tearfully watching the destruction of their homes forced to see every cherished article destroyed and more than that i saw a soldier tear from the hands of an old lady a small box which he opened took some things therefrom which i judged were pieces of jewelry and threw the remainder into the flames  the smokehouse was as hot a place as i care to remain in very long at a time and as well filled with smoke as when put to the use for which it was originally intended even darius had doubts about the small buildings escaping the flames and said to my father  keep watch for the first show of fire master grout an well see that youre posted as to what is bein done outside if we have to leave here itll be a good idee to draw off toward the ropewalk theres no one near by that place an we may contrive to steer clear of the enemy  now it was that long tongues of fire curled above the government building swaying this way and that in the wind like fiery serpents until the inflammable portion of the nations capitol was ablaze  it seemed as if our smokehouse was completely surrounded by burning buildings had the britishers given any attention to such an insignificant structure as we were concealed in jim and dody must have been discovered for they gave no heed to hiding themselves as they stood literally transfixed with horror at the terrible scenes  not until all the buildings were so enveloped in flames that there could be no possibility of saving them did the two officers ride away and then it was to go in the direction of their encampment  i gave no further heed to the barbarians but watched with a sort of fascination the destroying element until darius cried  theres more mischief afoot see a full regiment are under marchin orders  what can they do now i asked helplessly everything around here is in flames the entire city is ruined  theres the presidents house an a good many fine dwellins at the other end of the town the old sailor replied unless im way out of my reckonin youll see more fire before theres less  the barns of the tavern were now burning but the wind drew in with greater force a draft having been formed by the flames i suppose and while our refuge was as hot as it well could be the more intense heat was carried in the opposite direction  i reckon this ere smokehouse will stand while many a better buildin goes down darius announced were gettin the biggest part of the heat from the stables now an i dont see any signs of fire on these logs you lads stay here with our invalid an ill sneak round outside a bit there may be a chance to get somethin in the way of rations if the men break into more shops as is likely  then the old man slipped down from his uncomfortable perch stopped at the door to warn jim and dody that they must not stray far away and disappeared behind the ruins of the tavern  it gave me a certain sensation of loneliness to have darius go at that time although it was late in the day to make such a discovery i had come to understand of how much assistance he was to us lads and how helpless we would be without him but as a matter of course i could not presume to dictate as to his movements  the one singular thing to me in this wanton work of destruction was the fact that not all the buildings in this portion of the city had been given over to the flames it seemed as if the british commander had singled out certain dwellings to be burned while the others were unmolested save in two cases where i saw soldiers bringing out plunder which was valueless to them and had been taken only in a spirit of cruelty  perhaps an hour was spent by the enemy in our immediate vicinity and then that quarter of the city was deserted by all save the homeless ones or those who mourned over the loss of property  the conflagration was still sufficient to light up the streets and fields near by therefore we could not venture out save at the risk of being seen but i question if any especial attention would have been given us except in the case of my father had we gone boldly forth  had he not been with us i should have proposed that the moment was come when we might be able to slip down the river unobserved for who would give heed to a party of lads when the capital city of the united states was in flames with my father however we were forced to remain in hiding for his wound was sufficient evidence that he had taken part in the battle of bladensburg and this would insure his being seized as a prisoner of war  jim and dody however went across to where two shops were in flames and returned a few moments later with a piece of bacon which had been trampled upon in the street a bag of dirty flour and what was better than all three loaves of bread the whole of which had been thrown aside by the britishers when they plundered the buildings  it was quite a store for our empty larder unsavory though the bread and flour looked but hungry lads and particularly those who are fugitives cannot afford to be squeamish in regard to their food  in less than half an hour after the regiment marched from the encampment toward the upper end of the city we saw the flames rising in great volume telling that there was no idea in the minds of the victors to spare anything which could readily be destroyed  as a matter of course we did not then know what was being done but later we learned that the presidents mansion the treasury buildings the arsenal and the barracks where three thousand troops could be quartered were all laid in ashes under the orders of general ross and admiral cockburn  before midnight the conflagration in the portion of the city where we had sought refuge had so far subsided because there was nothing left for the flames to feed upon that only glowing embers and the blackened walls of the capitol could be seen but the night was turned into day because of the fires at the other end of the town  we lads were weary with watching the wicked work jim and dody had toasted a large piece of bacon over the embers of the tavern we had partaken of a second meal rather because the food was at hand than owing to hunger and now all hands felt the need of sleep even though we were literally surrounded by enemies  but darius had not returned and we could not give ourselves up to slumber while he remained absent  at first i fancied that he was watching the work of the britishers but when my father began to show signs of alarm because the old sailor did not return my anxiety was great  if any of the redcoats came upon him they would suspect that he had been among that company of seamen and marines who had inflicted so much injury upon them during the day just passed and it was not difficult to understand that he would speedily be made a prisoner     chapter xvii  missing   i am minded to set down here what i afterward saw printed concerning the doings in other portions of washington the particulars of which we were ignorant at the time  while the public buildings in washington were in flames the national shipping stores and other property were blazing at the navy yard also the great bridge over the potomac from washington city to the virginia shore  commodore thomas tingey was in command of the navy yard and before the battle had received orders to set fire to the public property there in event of the british gaining a victory so as to prevent its falling into the hands of the invaders tingey delayed the execution of the order for four hours after the contingency had occurred  when at halfpast eight in the evening he was informed that the enemy was encamped within the city limits near the capitol he applied the torch and property valued at about a million of dollars was destroyed  the schooner lynx was saved and most of the metallic work at the navy yard remained but little injured the fine naval monument was somewhat mutilated but whether accidentally at the time of the conflagration or wantonly by the british who went there the next day to complete the destructive work is an unsettled question  at the same time the long bridge over the potomac was fired at both ends the americans on the virginia side thought a large body of british troops were about to pass over and fired that end to foil them while the british on the city side perceiving as they thought a large body of americans about to cross over from the virginia side fired the maryland end of the bridge the value of the entire amount of property destroyed at washington by the british and americans was estimated at about two million dollars  while we awaited the coming of darius thorpe and believing that the city of washington would be totally destroyed before the britishers had gratified their desire for vengeance jerry started a subject which caused me to be more uncomfortable in mind than i had been concerning the absence of the old sailor  the enemy are bent on burnin all the government buildins in the city even if they do no more an what about the jails  i was at a loss to fully understand the question but my father replied  they wont go so far as to burn the prisoners lad all that crowd of evildoers will be set at liberty and i reckon theyll be the only americans who can rejoice because of the english victory at bladensburg  then in that case jerry said grimly we can set it down as a fact that elias macomber is paradin the streets with his good friends the british boastin of his suffering at the hand of the americans  i started up in very unpleasant surprise until this moment i had given no heed to the cur whom we had captured twice since we left the burning fleet at pig point but now i realized that my partner was right there could be no question but that elias macomber was a free man once more and all our efforts to bring him to justice had only resulted in giving him an opportunity to pose as a martyr  well hes got a chance to pay off old scores now if he only knew it jim freeman suggested how happy the villain would be if he knew where he could find us in hidin  dont talk about him i said petulantly it makes me heartsick to think that after all our work he is in fine feather strutting around the city as one of the best friends the british had in this section speak of something else what of bill jepson does any one know if he came out of the battle alive  i saw him not more than five minutes before the order was given to retreat my father said he had been sent back to the wagons for ammunition and appeared to be having a royal time  well hope he got away at the last for if hes taken theyll hang him as a deserter i said and then finding it impossible to prevent my thoughts from straying to our missing comrade i added darius wouldnt have stayed away so long unless something serious had happened we ought to go in search of him  where would you look first jerry asked if the britishers got their hands on him we stand little chance of seein the poor fellow for theyll keep him a close prisoner  it doesnt seem possible that we can accomplish very much i said with a long drawn sigh but we must do as he would if one of us was missing  and what would that be my father asked  i wish i knew sir he surely would search for us as we must for him but i am all at sea as to how the work should be begun  every member of the party was eager to be doing something but so far as having any plan in mind they were all like me and we sat there staring at each other like a lot of frightened rabbits until i could remain idle no longer  im going out somewhere i cried almost anything is better than sitting here in suspense when it may be that he has simply fallen into difficulties from which we might extricate him  but what of the british my father asked and i replied recklessly  we must take our chances as to them sir it does not seem probable that two or three lads would be looked upon by them with suspicion for there must be many wandering around the city this night  who will go with you  thats for me to do jerry said promptly the other fellows will stay here with you sir and the door must not be opened without good reason keep under cover while we are gone he added to jim an dont let one of the boys so much as stick his nose outside come on amos the longer we stand here talkin about it the greater will the danger appear  then he stepped outside quickly and i followed his example closing the door behind me lest father should attempt to say something in the nature of a farewell which i knew would unnerve me because i believed it was exceedingly dangerous for any of our party to move around the city  when we were alone in the night where the shadows were distorted by the dancing glow of the live embers on every hand jerry said grimly  it was foolish to make any talk about what we would do toward findin darius while we were in the smokehouse because we might have argued till mornin without comin to any conclusion but now that weve started out id like to know how were goin to work  i could make no satisfactory reply to this question and plainly told him so we had nothing to guide us on the search the old man had given us no idea of where he might go and all we knew was that he disappeared beyond the burning tavern  he wouldnt have followed the britishers i said after a long pause therefore it seems foolish to look for him at the other end of the city if we only knew what he went after  i reckon the first thing in his mind was to get food and he might have thought that could be done where the shops were bein robbed  and then would come to his mind the question as to how we might get down the river while father is unable to walk i added believing that by thus trying to make out what darius was most likely to do we could hit upon a plan for the search  the only way wed be able to leave this city by water if we wanted to get home would be on the potomac river an hed need a stout canoe for such a voyage  we were not coming to any understanding by this line of thought therefore i harked back to the belief that he might have followed the britishers to the upper end of the city and proposed knowing of no better course to walk in that direction  the day was beginning to dawn no soldiers were to be seen on the streets and i began to believe that the invaders wearied with their work of destruction had returned to the encampment near the buryingground  we came upon the ruins of the presidents mansion the fire had eaten out the interior of the building but the walls were yet standing and near about apparently having neither purpose nor business there were an hundred people or more all gazing at the evidences of the most approved method of making war by the british standard  we mingled with these idlers to make certain darius was not among them and then went toward the other ruins on a like errand but with no success  it was sunrise perhaps a little later when we stood near the ruins of the barracks where a number of negroes were digging amid the glowing embers with the hope of finding weapons which might be restored to a condition of usefulness after being subjected to such great heat  one of these searchers for useless treasure straightened up as we approached and i saw that he was an old man who looked as if he might have been a gentlemans servant  do you live here in washington uncle i asked and the old darkey replied  ise aint noways conditioned fur to answer dat question sah kase i dunno whar massa am ter be foun dese yere queer days wha wese habin  who is your master  massa clayton sah hes foolin roun wid some ob dem militious men but i aint foun out wedder he whipped de britishers or ef dey done gone got de bes ob him  i reckon you can say that he has got the worst of it up to the present time for your militious men didnt make any great showing i said with a laugh and then there came into my mind the memory of elias macomber tell me uncle where did the american soldiers keep their prisoners  right hyar sah ise done seed de barracks jail many a time  were you around here when the building was fired  yes sah i stood right hyar when de ossifers rode up  did they set the prisoners free  sure enuf honey moren twenty ob dem an ise tellin you dat dem white men was mighty glad fo to get clear so easy like  come on amos jerry said impatiently you can do no good talkin with the old darkey for he doesnt know anything concerning our business  i recognized that fact fully and yet i lingered to ask one more question never fancying of how much importance the answer might be to us  where do the british keep their prisoners surely they must have brought in some since the battle and these barracks would have been a prime place for anything of the kind  dey is pilin de mericans inter dat stone house back ob whar de arsenal uster was fore it got set on fire las night  where is that uncle jerry cried excitedly and the old darkey replied as he pointed out the direction  ober yander sah des whar youse kin see de red roof  now it was that i understood what was in jerrys mind and only with difficulty could i restrain myself from running forward at full speed  if darius had been captured then it was in the stone house he must be confined and i believed our search would be at an end if we could look into every portion of that building  there were many loungers near about and no one might say how many were british spies or sympathizers therefore we remained looking at the men who were digging amid the ruins until feeling certain our departure would not attract undue attention  there were many lads of about our age idling on the streets watching simply from curiosity the movements of the enemy and i said to myself that if we were careful to do nothing which might cause suspicion we could walk wheresoever we pleased without fear of being taken for lads who under commodore barney had given the invaders such good battle for the possession of the hill at bladensburg  now we know where darius is jerry exclaimed when we were where there was little danger our words would be overheard  how can you be so certain of that he might have come to grief in many another way than that of being gobbled up by the enemy  in any other case ill warrant hed have contrived to send some word to us im convinced hes in the stone house  in which event im afraid we cant be of much assistance to the poor fellow the britishers will take good care that their prisoners dont escape  im not so certain about that jerry replied stoutly in case we have time enough it should be possible to do somethin if we could let him know that were near at hand ill go bail hed cook up some kind of a plan  while thus talking we had been walking at a reasonably rapid pace toward the ruins of the arsenal and were now arrived so near that it was possible to see the redcoated sentries pacing to and fro in front of the building at one side a number of soldiers were bivouacked probably that they might be on hand in case the prisoners attempted to rise against the keepers and here there everywhere were curious onesperhaps some interested as were wegazing at the small building where were so many brave fellows most likely penned up like cattle  the greater number of those idlers must be townspeople and since they are allowed to loiter around the buildin theres no good reason why we shouldnt do the same jerry said as i came to a halt and he had hardly more than spoken before he stepped back very suddenly pulling me with him  whats the matter i asked in alarm for at such a time ones fears rise rapidly  look at that fellow who is standin on his tiptoes to look in at the window my partner whispered and obeying i saw that miserable cur whom we had twice captured and who had contrived to escape us the same number of times  elias macomber i cried involuntarily  ay jerry replied an now i can read you the whole riddle darius came around this way when the prisoners were set free macomber saw him and gave information to the enemy thus causin the old mans arrest now the villain is tryin to get a glimpse of the sailor in order to crow over him  i had no doubt but that the lad had come very near the truth in his guessing but i did not speculate upon it very long for the question in my mind was whether we could be of any service to the old man who had served us so truly and faithfully  whats to be done jerry asked as we stepped behind a clump of bushes in a nearby garden where we might not be seen by the fellow who would have rejoiced if he could have put us in the same place with darius  at the moment jerry spoke i had never an idea as to what might be done but i replied as if the plan was plainly mapped out in my mind  you shall go back to the smokehouse and tell father and the lads what we have learned say that we may not be back until dark but they are to stay under cover no matter what happens short of being discovered by the british ill watch here till macomber goes away for he isnt likely to play at that game all day and you should be back within an hour  jerry started off without stopping to argue the question and i was left alone to keep in view the man who could do us so much mischief if he had an inkling that we were in the vicinity  twice he spoke with the sentinel as if asking some favor and each time the man shook his head decidedly therefore i concluded that the cur had tried to enter the building that he might jeer such of the prisoners as had been friends of his in the past  then he peered in at the window again never making an effort to look through any other and i concluded that from such position he could see the prisoner he had most reason to hate which of course must be darius  i did not dare remain in one position all the while lest some one see that i was spying upon the prison and grow suspicious as to my motives while macomber was so intent upon gazing at his enemies that i might have brushed past him without attracting attention  therefore it was that i paced to and fro never taking my eyes from the cur however and making certain there was a place of concealment near at hand into which i could dart at a moments warning  not until fully half an hour had passed did he abandon his fruitless efforts and then he walked in the direction of the british encampment as if with some fixed purpose in his mind which i had no doubt was to ask for a permit to visit the prisoners  had he gone toward any other quarter of the city it would have pleased me to see him go but now i was sorely distressed in mind for his way led the same course jerry must pursue when returning from the smokehouse and it would be the irony of fate if the two should come face to face  however that was an evil which i could not mend and therefore i put the matter from my mind so far as possible while i set about doing the only thing which seemed to promise a chance to have speech with our comrade  i proposed to take macombers place at the window and if it was possible to see darius inside there was no question in my mind but that i could contrive to attract his attention  there was no little danger in making the attempt because i might thus arouse suspicion in the mind of the sentry or be seen by an officer who would insist on knowing why i was there but it was the only way by which i could have speech with darius if indeed he was a prisoner and i determined to take the chances  i lounged across the street as if having no particular purpose in view walked past the end of the building twice peering about me like a simple and then stepped up to the window  one glance inside and i saw the man for whom i had been searching he was lying at full length on the floor chewing tobacco most industriously and seated tailorfashion beside him was bill jepson  there were very many militiamen in the room but these two old shellbacks seemed to hold themselves aloof from the others and i could well understand that this exclusiveness was because of the cowardice shown by many of the toy soldiers the day previous  neither darius nor bill seemed to be paying any attention to what was going on around them and i began to realize that it might not be as simple a matter to attract their attention as i had supposed  i did not dare do anything which would cause the sentry to be curious or be noticed particularly by those who were passing in either direction therefore the most i ventured was to drum idly on the glass with the tips of my fingers which was not a difficult task since the iron bars were so far apart that i could thrust my entire arm between them and the windowsash  darius was not as heedless to the surroundings as he appeared no sooner had i begun to tap ever so gently than he looked up and after one quick meaning glance rose leisurely to his feet speaking softly meanwhile to bill  the latter never so much as looked toward me but the two moved here or there as if weary with remaining long in one position and all the while they were approaching the window  then darius leaned against the sash with bill facing the middle of the room as he talked with many gesticulations to his companion  i noticed that the old man bent over as if weary until his face was very near the glass and while bill waved his arms as if in the midst of a heated argument i saw darius lips move  on the rooftonightbring ropeten oclock  no less than three times were these words repeated i reading them from the motion of his lips for as a matter of course he did not dare to speak so loud that i could hear him  then i went through the same motions with my lips in order to make certain there could be no mistake and darius nodded his head in token that i had the words correctly  now it was my business to get away from the prison as soon as possible for elias macomber might return at any moment and i backed into the street while gazing at the top of the building looking most likely the greenest lad that ever visited a city  while thus acting the simple i was making ready for whatsoever plan darius wanted to carry into effect for i studied the outside of the jail until i could tell within a foot of how much rope would be needed  the stone house was three stories in height with an ordinary pitched roof from which projected four chimneystwo at each end from the eaves to the ground i judged it was not less than thirty feet and from the eaves to the nearest chimney measuring at whichsoever corner you chose was ten feet to that length add three feet for a turn around the chimney and two halfhitches and one had the length of rope darius wantedsay fortythree or four feet  i noticed that on the side of the roof nearest the street was a trapdoor or scuttle very nearly in the middle well up toward the ridgepole and it must be that our comrades would come through that since i saw no other way by which they could get outside  without doubt those two old shellbacks had made a careful survey of the place within ten minutes after being imprisoned and had a plan for escape mapped out ready to be carried into execution providing any aid could be had from the outside  by the time i had backed entirely across the street i had a picture of the jail in my mind which could be recalled at any moment and as i turned to saunter away i came face to face with jerry  have you been over there he asked motioning toward the stone house  yes and have the same as talked with darius and bill jepson let us get out of sight where we shant be watched i was afraid you would run into macomber he started off some time ago and i got it into my head that he was going to the british encampment  i reckon thats where he was bound for i kept my eyes open mighty wide both goin an comin therefore saw the cur while he was a long distance away otherwise we might have run into each other as you an i did  all right at the smokehouse  snug as bugs an your father is as chipper as a sparrow  then i led the way up what appeared to be a lane in the rear of some dwelling until we were where we could talk without danger of being seen or heard     chapter xviii  the escape   jerry was thoroughly astonished after i had told my story because we had had such plain sailing when there was nothing to start us on a course for the missing comrade we had gone out blindly and by sheer accident ran upon our man without trouble or delay  it heartens a fellow to have things happen this way my partner said in a tone of satisfaction theres no question but that were in a bad box take it all around for after the british get settled down in the city they will most likely look about for such as us therefore our work must be done quickly an by your hittin the nail square on the head it looks as if we might pull through all right  the future did not look so promising to me darius and bill undoubtedly knew that they could gain the roof of the stone house during the night but even then they were far from being free and i questioned if it would be possible for us to loiter around the building after sunset without attracting the attention of the sentries  however it was not for me to throw cold water because a fellow needs all his courage when he would do that which lay before us and it was well jerry should feel confident as to the result  therefore it was that instead of discussing how we could set about rendering the necessary aid i began by questioning as to how the rope might be procured and as a matter of fact it was by no means a simple matter to get one of the desired length  weve got to buy it of course jerry said quickly and as if it was possible for us to make such purchases at any time  in the first place we havent money enough i suggested and secondly how many shops will you find open in this city  these questions were sufficient to let jerry understand that it was not all plain sailing before us and after some reflection he said  suppose we go back to the smokehouse there we can talk it over with the others an at the same time get something by way of breakfast  there was plenty of time at our disposal since darius had set ten oclock that night as the hour when we could aid him and i welcomed my partners proposition but instead of going directly to the place of refuge i insisted on making a long detour to lessen the chances of running across elias macomber  that the cur had gone to the encampment hoping to get a permit to see the prisoners in order to gloat over their misfortune i had no doubt and if he was successful i felt equally certain he would go to the jail by the shortest route in event of failure however and i was positive he would fail the villain might wander anywhere while working off his disappointment therefore it stood us in hand to be exceeding cautious  as it proved however we had seen the last of that miserable britishlover and after jerry saw him on the street he passed out of our lives for many months  i believed of a verity that we walked at least three miles cutting across lots here or traveling many rods out of our course there until it seemed as if we had traversed every lane and obscure passage to be found in the city but we arrived safely at last which repaid us for all the extra work we had seen no one who gave any heed to us and when we sneaked into the smokehouse from behind the ruins of the tavern i felt positive no one saw us  it can well be supposed that our comrades gave us a hearty welcome and when i explained how much had been accomplished they became quite as certain of ultimate success as jerry but the question of procuring a rope put the matter in a different light  we counted every penny belonging to the party and had less than three shillings while the length of rope we needed would cost three or four times as much  its certain we cant buy one even though all the shopkeepers in the city stood ready to wait upon us i said after we had ascertained the amount of capital on hand now what is to be done  no one answered for many minutes and then jim freeman proposed that if we couldnt get what we needed in any other way it would be admissible to steal the rope in view of the use to which it would be put  dody wardwell thought we might go to a shopkeeper who dealt in such goods and telling the story beg what was needed  it was my father who solved the riddle  i dont believe we are warranted in stealing he said no matter what might be accomplished neither do i think it safe to confide in any stranger whom you should meet but the begging proposition if carried out properly comes nearer filling the bill than anything else  what do you call doin it properly jerry asked  there must be oystermen in port either here at georgetown or alexander and the chances are you would know some of them go round the water front and see what can be found then try the other towns and ill guarantee you can strike an acquaintance somewhere after that everything is simple for you may borrow a rope without fear that information will be lodged against you  come on amos jerry cried springing to his feet in excitement your father has hit upon the very plan an we were thickheaded not to have thought of it at first  there was no time to be lost more particularly in case we should be forced to visit the two towns mentioned but i believe that we would really be forwarding the business if we delayed long enough to get something to eat and my comrades were of the same opinion  jim had tried his hand at making bread by mixing flour and water together and baking the stuff in an old tin pan over the embers of the tavern ruins it was possible to eat the mixture and that was the best that could be said therefore we satisfied our hunger with raw bacon and imitation bread which did not require very many minutes  jim and both the other fellows were eager to go with jerry and me but they would not be able to forward matters and it seemed like taking too many risks to make our party so large therefore we decided that they must stay in the smokehouse as before a decision which was not to their liking although neither of the lads made any protest  then jerry and i set out after listening to such advice as my father had to give and began the search on the eastern branch  there were but few vessels in port the greater number of those that remained when the enemy entered the potomac had run up the river as high as possible lest they be destroyed and we did not find an oyster pungy until we were well over toward georgetown  it was then near noon and jerry and i decided that if the captain of the boat before us looked like an honest seaman we would take the chances of telling him so much of our story as might be necessary rather than run the risk of not finding another craft of the kind  there were no sign of life on deck but as we went over the rail the companionway hatch was opened a few inches and some one cried  whats wanted this vessel is hauled up for repairs an theres nobody here but methe keeper  will you let us come below for a short time i asked and the hatch was closed very suddenly as the voice cried emphatically  no my orders are to allow no company here  let me have a try at the old idiot jerry said in a low tone as he went toward the companionway and the voice from below replied thus showing that he could hear very well even though the hatch was closed  the old idiot dont want any truck with boys so keep off or ill make it hot for you  listen to me shipmate and then perhaps youll sing a different tune i said going close to the companionway where it might not be necessary to raise my voice we are a couple of oystermen from benedict in trouble and are looking for some one to lend a hand  tell me your names  i gave the desired information and added  we owned the pungy avenger which was burned at pig point when the enemy came up the river  the hatch was opened in a twinkling and when we descended to the cuddy i was both surprised and overjoyed by seeing robert hanaford an oysterman from st leonards bay  shut that hatch he said nervously and jerry did as he was bidden i got caught in the river like a fool an am now expectin the bloomin britishers will burn the craft when they fall short of like amusement in the city tell me how you happened to be here  i told him so much of our story as seemed necessary and when i was come to the retreat from bladensburg he said grumpily  i reckon you two lads an darius thorpe are bigger fools than i am it was accident that brought me into this scrape whereas you got into a muss with your eyes wide open wheres darius  the britishers are holding him prisoner and count on sending him down to the fleet i suppose  hell rot there unless he offers to serve the king in which case seeins how the enemy needs good sailors theyll give him a show that a dog wouldnt welcome  did you ever run across bill jepson from baltimore i asked at random not knowing exactly how to lead up to the request for a rope  ay that i have lad bill an me run on this same pungy moren two years ive heard it said that one of the kings press gangs gathered him in  then i told the captain how we had helped bill to desert and wound up the story by sayin  bill is a prisoner with darius and will be hung when the britishers learn who he is theres a show to help both the sailors out of the scrape but were needing six or eight fathom of good manilla rope an havent got the money with which to buy it  how do you count on usin it and captain hanaford leaned forward in a manner which told that he was thoroughly excited  then i told him all we had accomplished that morning and explained what darius proposed we should do whereupon he cried heartily  take anything ive got lads an if it so be i can lend a hand count on me to the finish ill risk even the pungy to help a sailorman out of a hole an a good deal moren that when it comes to bein bill jepson whos in trouble  now that we were assured of getting what was needed there was no need of great haste and i told the captain the remainder of our story even to describing where father and the lads were hiding  whether you get bill an darius out of jail or not youll be wantin to go down the river lad so why dont you bring all hands aboard ive known your father this many a day an would like to do him a good turn wed be a little crowded i reckon but some of you youngsters can bunk in the hold an if the britishers dont burn the pungy shell be a sight better than a smokehouse  what about provisions captain jerry asked  ive got enough an to spare unless were held here a couple of weeks i didnt count on doin any fightin in this ere war but when it comes to lendin shipmates an neighbors a hand youll find that bob hanaford is willin to go down to his last cent  i realized what a blessing it would be if we could get father on board the pungy where he would have a comfortable bunk to lie in and such nursing as captain hanaford might give when we lads were absent but how to get him down to the boat was a puzzle  supposin you free darius an bill tonight whatll you do with em the owner of the pungy asked and i replied mournfully  we hadnt got as far as that in our plans of course they must be taken out of the city  an the british fleet is loafin down in the river somewhere twixt here an the bay the captain added  ay but if we can get hold of a boat it shouldnt be such a hard job to slip by the vessels on a dark night  would you leave your father behind  certainly not he must go with us  then you oughter have him down here on the river before beginnin work ill tell you how it might be fixed lad allowin that there aint any more burnin of houses tonight i could help him through the streets if it so be he can make any fist at walkin the other lads would set out on their own hook an it should be wed come together on this ere craft unless the britishers are overhaulin everybody thats aboard i dont know how things may be runnin for i havent been outside this cuddy since the fires began  i told him that jerry and i had not been interfered with on the streets and i believed he could go where he pleased provided it was not too near the encampments  then ill try it lads an start for your hidin place within an hour can you give me the bearins  the captain was reasonably familiar with that portion of the city and there was no doubt in my mind but that he could find the smokehouse without any difficulty  then we overhauled his spare rope in the hold selecting a length of halfinch manilla which had been used no more than enough to make it pliable and carried it to the cuddy  it would not be safe to lug the rope through the streets in the daytime lest some over officious person should insist on knowing what we proposed to do with it we would be forced to take a long walk in order to fetch it but that was of little consequence compared with the additional security such a plan seemed to afford  then we separated captain hanaford agreeing to be at the smokehouse within an hour and when jerry and i went over the side of the pungy it was with lighter hearts than when we came on board  it is true that the most dangerous portion of the undertaking was yet to be performed but everything had turned so favorably for us since we set out in search of darius that we could not but feel a wonderful degree of courage regarding the remainder of the task  jerry was so well pleased that he would have talked about what we were to do even on the street but i insisted that we should hold our peace until it was impossible any one could overhear us and in silence we made our way toward the place of refuge  it is needless for me to attempt to describe the joy of our comrades when we told them of the friend we had met and the plans which had been laid  my father showed plainly by his face the relief of mind because of the possibility that he might have different quarters  i havent grumbled because i knew you lads had about all you could stagger under he said when we told him that captain hanaford was bent on trying to get him aboard the pungy i cant stay in this place very much longer without taking big chances of going under for the wound needs careful attention but if i can be with bob hanaford everything will come around shipshape because he knows by experience what a gunshot hurt is like  do you think it will be possible to keep on your feet for such a long distance i asked anxiously because until this moment i supposed my father was getting on as comfortably as a man in his condition could reasonably expect  ill manage that part of it lad the knowledge of what is to be gained will keep me up  well there is no good reason why i should try to set down all we said while waiting for the owner of the pungy and when he finally arrived having had little or no difficulty in finding the smokehouse it was as if a great and beneficial change was immediately apparent  the captains first act was to rebandage my fathers wound jerry getting him a supply of fresh water from the well at the ruins of the tavern and when that was done he set about making arrangements for our moving taking upon himself the entire direction of affairs much to my relief  his first act was to explain to jim dody and josiah the location of the pungy sending them off at once with explicit directions as to the streets through which they should pass the lads were to go into the cuddy without loitering on deck and keep the hatch closed and bolted until his arrival  jerry and i were to stay in the smokehouse until it was time to begin work in behalf of darius and bill while the captain and my father were to set out as soon as it was sufficiently dark to screen them from view of the curious ones  jim and his friends started without delay welcoming any change after being shut in from the open air so long and when they were gone the captain announced that he would bring the rope to the jail shortly before ten oclock  i aint sayin but that you two lads could work the thing as well without me but im achin to have a hand in settin them two old shellbacks free youll find that i wont be in the way even if i dont do any good  it was a big relief to know that we were to have his assistance and i so gave him to understand  after father had been made as comfortable as was possible under the circumstances we lounged around waiting for the night to come but never saying another word concerning what we hoped to do  i for one was too nervous regarding the possible outcome to care about holding converse even with friends for there was in my mind a very vivid realization of what would be the result in case we failed while trying to get the sailors from the roof of the stone house or if they were discovered when getting through the scuttle  it seemed very much like death for all hands concerned if the slightest slip was made and when a fellow believes he stands near a violent end he is not given to speech  the moments dragged so heavily that it seemed to me the night would never come once during this painful time of waiting jerry spoke of the possibility that jim and his friends might lose their way or be taken in charge as suspicious persons but i could not arouse myself to feel any anxiety concerning them my thoughts were with those two old sailors in jail and the part which the british sentries might play while we were trying to effect their release  finally after it was as if we had spent a full day in the smokehouse the sun went down and it was yet quite light when captain hanaford announced that he and my father might safely make the start  weve got to steer a roundabout course he said an i reckon itll be plain sailin from now till dark stay where you are lads an dont so much as poke your nose out till halfafternine  how shall we be able to tell the time i asked rather for the sake of saying something than because i wanted information  you will hear the sentinels at the encampment often enough to give you a fair idee get there as near as possible to the hour set an youll find me close at hand  then he went out my father leaning heavily on his arm and jerry and i faced each other in the gloom heeding not the fact that we had had nothing to eat during nearly eight and forty hours save the chips of ham and the unsavory mess prepared by jim thinking only of what we were to do and the many chances against success  it was jerry who broke a long silence by saying with an attempt at cheerfulness  i dont know of any reason why we should moon round here like a couple of chumps it wont help matters any an surely it dont improve my courage  then i forced myself to take part in conversation speaking of this or that trouble or adventure in the past but never once of what might be before us in the future and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth  with all due regard to prudence we went by the most direct course to the stone house never seeing a britisher on our way and it must have been at least a quarterhour before the time set when we were come to where it was possible to have a good view of the roof of the jail  the night was dark with heavy ominous looking clouds hanging low in the sky but yet we could have distinguished the form of a man on the top of the building  we were half hidden by the clump of bushes in the garden of the dwelling where i had been screened from view of elias macomber when we saw a man approaching leisurely and looking from side to side in search of some one  i recognized captain hanaford and stepped out to meet him asking how he and father had managed to get along  he pulled through all right lad an was lyin in my bunk happy as a cricket when i left  but youve forgotten the rope i exclaimed and the captain opened his coat to show me the line wound around his waist in such a fashion that one might have come close upon him without suspecting that he carried anything  he stepped behind the bush to unwind it and while he was thus engaged i distinctly saw the form of a man emerge from the scuttlehatch on the roof of the jail  theyre coming out i whispered excitedly and then glanced hurriedly around to learn where the sentries were stationed  to my surprise i could not see a single person save the soldier who appeared at the corner once in every two or three minutes as he paced his beat at the end of the building it seemed extraordinary that there should be no others in sight but such was the fact and surely we had no reason to complain because the enemy was careless  a few hours later i understood the reason for this seeming neglect of the prisoners  my comrades were ready for the work on hand immediately i gave the alarm and swiftly the three of us crossed over i wondering if it would be possible for us to throw the rope to the roof where the sailors could catch it  illustration as soon as the line was made fast a man slipped down quickly followed by another  as we neared the building i saw that darius had already made arrangements for getting one end of the rope into his possession  a bit of cloth was swinging to and fro at the corner of the jail when i arrived and taking hold of it curiously i saw that it was made fast to a string formed of two or three strands of yarn  the old sailor had unraveled their socks in order to procure that which would enable them to haul up the rope  there was no need of word or signal captain hanaford made fast one end of the halfinch manilla gave the yarntwine a jerk in token that all was ready and then we payed out on the rope to make certain it went up without kinks  in less than three minutes a man slipped down the line at a rate of speed that must have heated his hands in great shape and he was hardly more than on the ground before the second prisoner followed  we had effected the escape and it now remained to get under cover in the shortest possible space of time  it wont do to run but you can keep close at my heels the captain said as he set off at a walk which fully equaled running and we followed very closely i literally holding my breath as i tried to realize that the task which had seemed so formidable a few moments previous had been accomplished with the greatest ease     chapter xix  the unexpected   there is little need for me to set it down that we neither slackened pace nor halted until we were in the cuddy of the pungy  not a member of our party spoke until we descended the companionway stairs and faced the lads and my father who had lighted a candle as a sort of welcome and then darius exclaimed  well im blowed if you dont look kinder cozy here whod think this crowd had been hobnobbin with the britishers for the last two or three days bob hanaford where did the lads run afoul of you an why didnt you get your pungy down river before the enemys fleet came up  there was a deal of handshaking and congratulations before we settled down to anything like rational talk and then jerry and i told how we found the captain and what had happened since darius left the smokehouse  then it was the old mans turn to give an account of his misadventures and this he did after refreshing himself with an enormous piece of tobacco  i went out leavin you people in hidin with the idee that if many shops were to be robbed by the soldiers i might get somethin to eat outer the general wreck first off nothin came my way an then i ran square across a basket of ships bread thinks i this is good enough for one trip an i gathered the stuff under my arm puttin for the smokehouse under full sail without bein noticed by the redcoats who were havin too lively a time to give me much attention as luck would have it the thought never came into my mind that i had need to look for anybody but britishers an before i was halfway to port i struck up agin that sneak elias macomber  then it was i understood that the redcoats wasnt the only snags in the road an i gave him one clip on the jaw that i counted would knock him down an out but my calkerlations was wrong instead of topplin over as a decent man would have done after gettin the full weight of my fist he began to screech an yell fit to raise the dead my legs moved mighty lively jest then for a blind man could have seen what might happen but the britishers had me foul before id moren got well started no less than six grappled me an i hauled down my flag cause there wasnt any sense in makin a bad matter worse  them soldiers must have had orders in advance to lug any prisoners they might take to the shanty back of the arsenal for they steered a straight course for the place without stoppin to ask any mans advice an what chafed me moren everythin else was that rat of a macomber close at my heels as he told what he would do now that his friends had taken possession of the country i contrived to give him one kick on the shins which ill guarantee he remembers this minute an then he kept well back in the rear thats the end of the yarn lads  but where did you meet bill i asked  in the jail he was brought up with a sharp turn durin the retreat bein so stuffy that he kept well in the rear instead of pushin ahead as he might have done  did macomber succeed in getting into the prison  he wasnt inside an thats a fact but he stood at the window an kept shoutin all kinds of threats till one of the sentries drove him away havin had too much of his yip  you saw me quickly enough  well you see lad i had my eye on the window countin to throw my shoe through the glass when he showed his ugly face again hopin that hed get cut a bit an besides i somehow had it in my head that you an jerry would flash up sooner or later  but how did you contrive to come at the scuttle captain hanaford asked  that was plain sailin bill was one of the first put into the place an knowin hed take a trip to the yardarm when the britishers found out who he was he naturally took advantage of the chance to snoop round a bit we had the run of the whole buildin seeins there wasnt many of us an when he went in the prisoners didnt number moren twenty he found a key in the door that led up to the attic which seemed to be a sort of storeroom an thinkin it might come in handy if the others didnt know the lay of the land he locked the bloomin place havin done so without bein seen when i came he didnt know anythin about the scuttle but we figgered that if there wasnt one we could get up stairs an pull bricks enough out of the chimney to give us a hole there wasnt any need of doin that however cause we found the hatch bolted on the inside an the rest was easy the only thing about the whole business which bothers me is why the britishers didnt have a good look around before turnin the buildin into a jail  the drubbin they got at bladensburg even though they did win the battle confused them my father said with a chuckle of satisfaction  it strikes me that wed better get the pungy under way mighty soon captain hanaford interrupted it cant be a great while before some of the crowd sees the rope we left danglin from the chimney an then you may set it down as a fact that this city will be searched in a way that wont be comfortable for us  but wherell you go bob bill jepson asked the british fleet is in the river an to sail up stream strikes me as bein dangerous for they can send light boats after us an this draft wont make much fist of runnin away from them in such a breeze as youve got now  i had an idee the wind was gettin up the oysterman said as he opened the hatch a few inches and at that instant a gust swept into the cuddy bringing with it a full pail of water  a good nice little thunder squall the captain said in a tone of content an if it comes from the right quarter were in luck  darius was on deck in a twinkling and i followed him hoping that we might be able to leave our mooring for at such a time it would not be a very difficult matter to get so far up stream as to baffle pursuit  at the moment however it seemed as if our good fortune had deserted us the wind was drawing down the river with a force that shut off all hope of sending the pungy against it and the rain came in such torrents that the deck was awash in short order  its a case of stayin where we are or takin the chances of runnin down river when you couldnt see a nigger under your nose darius said as he and i reentered the cabin wet to the skin although we had not been exposed to the fury of the tempest above two minutes im willin to run a good many risks but puttin this pungy under sail with half a dozen frigates somewhere on the course is a little too steep for me  captain hanaford was exceeding anxious to be under way but he understood that nothing could be done while the storm raged with such fury and we sat in the darkness discussing what might be done when the morning came  it was finally decided that we would take all the risk of going down stream as soon as the tempest abated for there were many creeks along the shore where we might run under cover to avoid the fleet or if the worst came we could go on shore abandoning the pungy  in order that captain hanaford might be willing to take the chances of losing his vessel i showed him the guarantee we had received from commodore barney and promised that when we got the money from the government he should share equally with us  im ready to do whatsoever is agreed upon without askin you lads to pay for my pungy in case i lose her he said stoutly there aint any certainty id been able to keep her if you hadnt come aboard for if the britishers will burn nigh on to a whole city they wont stop at a few oysterboats if theres any fun to be had in settin em afire i dont jest hanker though to fool around with a lot of frigates an thats a fact  we wont fool with em darius said decidedly it stands to reason they must be below fort washington else wed heard the firin when they tried to come past now twixt here an there we should find a creek where a pungy like this could be hidden  i know of a place about eight miles from here the captain said thoughtfully and bill jepson cried cheerfully  then that settles the whole business well get under way when this ere squall is over and before daylight be where we can keep out of sight till the fleet comes up once theyre this side of us we shall be in clear water  but bill was not calculating on the force of the squall i have seen a good many summer storms but never one to equal that on the night of august twentyfifth in the year of grace 1814  we could hear now and then ashore even amid the howling of the wind and the crashing thunder the rending of wood as houses were unroofed and from the terrible uproar which came later we believed the trees growing near where we lay were being torn up by the roots as was really found to be the case when morning dawned  the pungy rocked to and fro as if in the open bay straining at her hawsers until it became necessary to pass extra ones otherwise she would have been swept from her moorings  those of us who went on deck to do this work were wetted in an instant as if we had jumped overboard and at times it became necessary to hold fast by the rail otherwise we would have been literally blown into the river  there was no possibility of getting under way that night and all hands kept watch in the cuddy until day broke when and not until then did the storm abate  the wind had aided the britishers in working havoc from the deck of the pungy i saw no less than four houses the roofs of which had been torn off and one negro shanty was in ruins as far as we could see the trees were uprooted and the river ran so full of wreckage that i wondered we had not been swamped off hand  well stay here a few hours longer i reckon darius said to me as he pointed toward the fragments of buildings and trees with which the river seemed literally to be choked if this pungy struck fair on somethin like that yonder shed founder for a fact  the veriest landsman who ever lived would have understood that it was folly to think of getting under way just then and my heart grew heavy as lead in my breast for i firmly believed that before another hour had passed the enemy would be out searching for the prisoners who had escaped in which case all hands of us stood a good chance of seeing the interior of that stone house  as we stood on deck regardless of the possibility that some of the enemy might come that way a man ran down the street toward the waters edge waving his arms about and otherwise acting as if nearly beside himself with joy or grief  what is the matter friend captain hanaford cried at the full strength of his lungs and the man made quite a lengthy reply but all we could hear of it was this one exclamation  the british  are they comin this way the captain demanded screaming until his face was crimson and bill jepson suddenly dropped out of sight through the companionway  theyve gone the man replied and we could now hear his words more distinctly because he was coming nearer each instant  gone where captain hanaford cried impatiently cant you tell us what has happened  the british have cleared out bag an baggagewent durin the storm  what darius screamed and we looked at each other incredulously for surely it could not be possible that the enemy had evacuated the city so soon  come on board an tell us what you know captain hanaford cried it is of the greatest importance for us to learn exactly the situation of affairs  the stranger did not accept the invitation to come on board but he halted within easy speaking distance and thus told the story which seemed incredible  last night the people livin near the encampment were warned on pain of death to remain within doors from sunset till sunrise those who were curious enough to look out of the windows saw that the camp fires had been increased an supposed reinforcements were comin in but this mornin neither hide nor hair is to be seen of the redcoats an a planter comin in from nearabout long old fields reports that the soldiers are marchin in the direction of nottingham an that aint all for the troops that stayed at bladensburg after the battle are on the way to upper marlboro cordin to the report of an old darkey who came into town not half an hour ago  having thus unfolded his budget of news the man hurried on to spread the glad tidings leaving us who were aboard the pungy in a state of mingled bewilderment and joy  i cant understand it darius said after a brief pause during which we had looked at each other questioningly im goin to take the chances of findin out for myself  the old man went over the rail as he spoke and i would have followed but that he said sharply  stay where you are lad we aint dead certain bout that yarn an if its a case of gettin into trouble it better be one than two who pays for nosin round a british camp  captain hanaford felt certain the news must be correct for our informant had the appearance of being an honest man and nothing could have been gained by spreading such a story  well cook the best breakfast to be had by way of rejoicin he said an after thats been done all hands shall come into a council of war to decide if were to make the venture down the river  if the enemy has really evacuated the city it is reasonable to suppose that the fleet will go back down the bay i said thinking myself very wise in such matters it strikes me that the way home lies open before us  my companions were of the same opinion and a very merry party we were on the oyster pungy that morning as we tried in vain to guess why the enemy had left so suddenly when there seemed to be nothing to prevent him from taking possession of all the country round about  before the feast was ready to be eaten darius returned and a single glance at his face was sufficient to show that the good news was true  theyve gone an theres no mistake about it he announced as he sprang over the rail lightly as any boy i went to the place where the troops were encamped before bein willin to believe theyd turned tail so suddenly now id like to know if that very friendly gentleman elias macomber has been left behind or if he followed the force if hes in this city i could make it mighty interestin for him  never mind the sneak darius my father cried there is no need for you to punish him because if the british go away hell find it very uncomfortable around here and thats enough to serve the cur out for all he has done  darius did not appear to think that macombers misdeeds could be atoned so easily but he kept his opinion to himself and joined us in what was at the same time a feast of rejoicing and thanksgiving  not until the meal was come to an end did we begin the discussion as to how we should get home and then captain hanaford opened the question by asking  now lads are we to run up stream into the mud or take our chances of findin the british fleet twixt here an the bay  darius immediately proposed that we strike out for the chesapeake using the same argument i had that since the retreat of the soldiers there was little chance the vessels would make any effort at running past fort washington  bill jepson who could not be blamed for feeling a bit nervous at going any nearer a british vessel of war than was absolutely necessary believed that it would be safer for us to go back to benedict by land keeping at a respectful distance in the rear of the enemy but his plan was not considered because it would be impossible for my father to travel on foot and i at least was not disposed to part company with him  we spent a full hour discussing the situation and then it had been decided that we would run boldly down the river nearly all of us feeling confident that there were no longer any british vessels to block our way  there was nothing to delay us in making the start as soon as the river should be clear of the tokens sent by the storm except darius desire to make systematic search for elias macomber but to this all of us objected so strongly that much against his will he was forced to give over the idea  for my part i had seen enough of the britishlover we had captured him twice which was our full share of such business and if we did spend time hunting him down providing he yet remained in the city what could we do with the villain he had forfeited all rights of citizenship in our section of the country and i had no doubt that wherever he went his sins would find him out it was better we leave him alone from whatever standpoint i viewed it  captain hanaford decided that the river would be clear of drift by morning therefore we were agreed to set sail then and as a means of passing the time pleasantly we lads went over to the stone house to see how the old shellbacks managed to escape so readily  we found the building open and abandoned the enemy had taken the prisoners away and we were not hindered in going over it thoroughly  when that inspection was ended we viewed the ruins in the different parts of the city paid a visit to the smokehouse and returned to the pungy late in the afternoon well satisfied to bring our visit to the capital to the earliest possible close  on that evening captain hanaford brought aboard a surgeon who cared for my fathers wound and what was better declared that he saw no reason why it should not heal speedily leaving him none the worse for having received it  we were eager to be under way as may be supposed and as soon as the day dawned on the 27th of august we cast off from the dock feeling that the good god had been very kind in permitting us to return to our homes when so many had been left at bladensburg to fill soldiers graves  it was as if everything favored us at the start of the homeward journey the river was free from the drift of all kinds which had covered its surface the wind was blowing gently from the north and the day gave promise of being clear  the pungy slipped along as if conscious that she like ourselves had escaped from great dangers and was longing for another cargo of oysters in her hold  bill jepson acted as if he had suddenly lost his senses he sang the wildest kind of songs danced two or three hornpipes and then insisted on darius joining him while jim freeman furnished the music by whistling fast and furiously as a matter of fact all of us even including my father were disposed to be exceeding jolly now that we were homeward bound with the belief that the enemy was no longer in a position to annoy us  we lads talked of the pungy we would buy when the government paid us for the avenger and laid many a plan for the future when jim his two friends jerry darius and i would begin oystering again in a craft capable of carrying three or four times the cargo we had been able to squeeze into the old boat which had been sacrificed at pig point  then when it was near noon we had come within sight of fort washington and as we rounded the bend captain hanaford gave vent to an exclamation of surprise and fear which was echoed by bill jepson  at some considerable distance down the river it was possible to see the upper spars of seven vessels of war which were slowly approaching the fortification from the southward  its the british fleet captain hanaford cried as he shoved the tiller hard down thereby swinging the pungys nose into the mud of the eastern bank we were bloomin fools to think that the enemy had all run away  its the fleet under captain gordon an i can tell you just how strong it is bill jepson said as he rubbed his head nervously there are two frigates of thirtysix an thirtyeight guns two rocket ships of eighteen guns each two bomb vessels of eight guns each an one schooner carryin two guns  the schooner would be enough to bring us up with a sharp turn therefore i hold that it dont make any difference how many frigates are behind her darius cried the question is whether the fort can prevent their comin up the river  no one aboard could say what might be done by those in the fortification or how strongly it was garrisoned but later i read the following in one of the newspapers and will set it down here so that what happened while we were on the river may be the better understood  the only obstruction to the passage of the fleet on which the americans might place the least reliance was fort washington on the maryland side of the potomac about twelve miles below the national capital it was a feeble fortress but capable of being made strong so early as may 1813 a deputation from alexandria georgetown and washington waited upon the secretary of war and represented the importance of strengthening the post  an engineer was sent to examine it he reported in favor of additional works in the rear while he believed that the armament of the fort and its elevated situation would enable a wellmanaged garrison to repulse any number of ships of war which might attempt to pass up the river nothing more was done  in july 1814 when a british fleet and army were in the chesapeake the authorities of alexandria again called the attention of the secretary of war to the feeble condition of fort washington the secretary did not believe the enemy would push for the capital and nothing was done the alexandrians appealed to general winder who recommended the strengthening of the post three of the banks in alexandria offered to loan the government fifty thousand dollars for the construction of more defences for the district the money was accepted but nothing was done to fort washington when the battle of bladensburg occurred and the seat of government was left to the mercy of the invaders fort washington was as feebly armed as ever and its garrison consisted of only about eighty men under captain samuel t dyson     chapter xx  dodging the enemy   as i have said captain hanaford shoved his tiller hard over throwing the pungy around until her nose struck the mud and it was a question of getting her off the bank in the shortest possible space of time unless we were minded to lay there when the action began for none of us doubted but that an engagement was close at hand  its a case of runnin back up the river bill jepson said nervously an the sooner we get about it the better  darius was not of the same opinion as was shown when he said after waiting a moment to learn if any other had an opinion to express  im willin to agree that were bound to put back a bit sos to be out of the way when the iron begins to fly but i dont hold that we should run very far off until findin out how things are goin to turn  you might settle that question after the pungy is afloat my father said grimly just at present were in a bad place if theres to be any firing done and when were off the mud youll have plenty of time in which to discuss the situation  thats about the size of it captain hanaford added emphatically and then he ordered us lads into the small boat that we might pull the pungys bow around  any one who has ever run an oysterman such as we have in the chesapeake knows that when a craft of that build takes ground ever so lightly it is not a simple matter to float her especially when theres no cargo that can be shifted to bring the stern down and the bow up  we lads worked our prettiest with the paddles after making fast to the vessels nose and finding that we were making no headway the three ablebodied men began pushing with poles which are kept aboard for such purpose until she slid slowly into deeper water  then it was a case of clawing away from the fort which was not easy since the wind that had brought us down so finely now blew directly in our teeth and the pungy was a masterhand for sliding off when you tried to tack  as a matter of course it was necessary to stand over toward the opposite shore which was not a pleasant piece of business since it carried us within view of the enemy but we had no choice in the matter  if we get back as far as alexandria by sunset well be doin mighty well unless you bring her around an try to slide up bill jepson said grumblingly but she did not make any better headway because of his being disgruntled  well have to take things as they are matey darius said grimly if the old hooker wont carry us out of harms way we can take to the shore at any time which is a bit of consolation youd better keep pasted in your hat  this breeze will fine down within an hour captain hanaford said as if speaking to himself an then itll be a case of anchorin no matter where we  he did not finish the remark for at that moment it was as if the earth and sky had come together with one deafening crash then followed three or four reports like unto peals of thunder near at hand and those of us who chanced to be looking astern saw the fort actually leap into the air while from the mass of earth and stone came a shower of fragments such as literally obscured the light of the sun for an instant after which it fell upon us with a crash that caused the pungy to rock to and fro like an eggshell  while one might have counted fifty i stood dazed unable to understand what had happened and bleeding from a dozen scratches caused by the fall of fragments which absolutely covered the deck of the pungy to a depth of two or three inches then i understood that the fort had been blown up captain dyson believing he could not hope with the small force under his command to withstand an assault from the fleet  as we afterward came to know his instructions from the war department were to the effect that he should destroy the fortification rather than take the chances of its being captured by the enemy but what seemed strange to me then and does now was the fact that he had not fired a single gun in defiance surely he might have discharged his pieces once in the hope of doing a little damage before setting a match to the magazine  of all our party in the pungy not one escaped more or less severe bruises or scratches and the wonder is that the vessel was not sent to the bottom off hand  however we were yet afloat and the river was open for the passage of the britishers therefore it may be understood that we could not afford to spend many minutes in speculations upon what might or might not have been done  within three minutes from the time of the explosion darius and bill jepson were in the small boat making fast to the bow of the pungy and when captain hanaford shouted to ask what they counted on doing the old sailor replied  theres a creek half a mile further up stream an if you can get any headway on this applebowed lugger we may be able to hide before the britishers come in sight  it was absolutely certain that we could not hope to escape by sailing because any fouroared boat in the british fleet would have overtaken us in a twinkling therefore unless it might be possible to hide we were in a bad scrape from which i saw no relief save at the expense of abandoning the pungy  how we worked to push the vessel through the water darius and bill plied the paddles with every ounce of strength in their bodies while we on deck trimmed the sails to a nicety shifted everything movable to bring her into better trim for sailing and even swung the two long sweeps outboard  we five lads manned the enormous oars with which the pungy was provided to help her around or when she drifted too near inshore and i dare venture to say that we did quite as much toward forcing the craft ahead as the two old shellbacks did by towing  fortunately for us the britishers did not appear to think it necessary to move up the river swiftly knowing full well that all the towns above were at their mercy whenever they arrived but the fleet hove to off the ruins of the fortification while some of the officers landed to ascertain the amount of damage done it was this last which gave us the opportunity of which we stood so sorely in need otherwise we were taken prisoners beyond a peradventure  by dint of pulling and paddling we contrived to get the pungy into the creek of which darius had spoken before the enemy came in sight again and then it was a case of hauling her so far inland that she would be hidden from view by the foliage  it can well be supposed that we did not waste any time at this last work the perspiration was running down our faces in tiny streams when the craft was finally as far up the narrow waterway as she could be taken and then all hands were so exhausted that we threw ourselves on the deck to regain breath and strength  all the while that we had been in strenuous flight my father stood at the helm thus giving captain hanaford the chance to aid us otherwise the task would not have been accomplished so quickly  but even when we were thus snug unless perchance the britishers took it into their heads to search the river banks our work was by no means done  it was now necessary that we should know if the enemy went up stream and after we had rested no more than five minutes when a full hour would have been hardly enough to put me in proper trim again darius said  come amos you an i will stand the first watch bill an jerry can spell us in a couple of hours  what do you count on watching i asked curtly  the britishers of course well paddle down to the river an lay there till the fleet goes one way or the other  it would have been a long watch had we remained on duty until the entire fleet sailed in one direction but as to that we were happily ignorant and i took my place in the canoe believing the enemy would sail past our hiding place in a very short time  we allowed the canoe to drift down the creek until we were come within a few yards of the river and then well hidden by the undergrowth we made ourselves as comfortable as possible where we could command a full view of the channel  it doesnt appear to be as easy to get back home as we counted on i said by way of starting a conversation and darius replied confidently  this ere stop wont put us back very much though itll make a power of extra work for i count to be slippin down river within a couple of hours at the longest  then the old man fell silent and i was not disposed to wag my tongue because of looking ahead to the meeting with mother and the children which now seemed so near at hand  we had been on watch an hour or more when the enemy appeared the schooner was leading the way slowly being towed by boats with the men taking soundings every fifteen or twenty yards in order to show the channel to the two frigates close astern and another hour went by before the three vessels had passed our hidingplace  then we watched eagerly expecting to see the rocketships and bombvessels appear but they did not heave in sight although it seemed to me as if they should have been close behind the larger ships in order to take advantage of the labor being performed by those on board the schooner  when half an hour had passed and the river so far as we could see in either direction was free from craft of any kind darius bestowed a resounding slap upon his leg as he cried angrily  what an old fool i am to be sure in two years more if i keep on runnin down hill i wont be able to tell my own nose from somebodys else even when its pulled  whats the matter now i asked in surprise  whats the matter lad cant you see that only part of the fleet is goin up stream if the other ships counted on leavin anchorage theyd been in the wake of the frigates were shut in here between two ends of the british force an likely to stay quite a spell  there could be no question but that he was right and i sat staring at him like a stupid the dreams in which i had been indulging disappearing like mist before the morning sun of a verity mother and the children were further from me than when we had crouched in the smokehouse at washington with general ross army close at hand  what can we do i asked at length  thats a question easier asked than answered the old man replied as if he had come to an end of his ideas while your father is wounded beyond the power of walkin were anchored to the pungy so to speak  what would you do if he was in good shape  it couldnt be such a terrible tough voyage to strike across the country from here to benedict leavin the pungy in the creek till the britishers get tired of foolin around in the potomac but its no use to spend breath on what cant be done our crew will hang together whatever comes lets go an report it wont do us any good to stay here  we paddled slowly back to our comrades and when we had told them the situation of affairs they were in as much of a muddle as had been darius and i  theres no tellin how long the frigates will stay round washington captain hanaford said and then as a sudden thought came to him he added im gettin the best of this scrape i reckon if the pungy was where you lads found her shed fare badly when the bloomin englishmen get where they can make mischief  ill stay here and keep ship while the rest of you walk across lots to benedict my father suggested but darius refused to hear any such proposition declaring as he had when we were in the canoe that our party should hang together to the last  so far as bodily harm is concerned were safe here till the cows come home the old man said thoughtfully an that oughter make us feel reasonably good seeins how one spell it looked a deal like bein killed or stayin in a british prisonship were a mighty poor crowd if we cant manage to lay still a week or two  it did really seem as if we had reason to be ashamed of grumbling when matters had been so much worse and i mentally resolved that i would make the best of the situation even though we were forced to remain in hiding a full month  my father did his best at cheering us by saying and with a deal of reason in his speech that the enemy would not dare remain shut up in the river very long lest the american fleet come to the mouth of the river and blockade him or with a superior force force him to surrender  its captain gordon of the sea horse who is in command bill jepson said an you can count that he wont be caught nappin  then we can reckon on bein free to leave this creek within three or four days at the outside and after that itll be a question of dodging the britishers into chesapeake bay which shouldnt be a hard task  taking this view of the matter and knowing we had provisions in plenty all hands began to look at affairs in a more cheerful light with the result that ours was soon a jolly party with but one aim which was to make the time pass as pleasantly as possible  during the remainder of that day we talked of all that had occurred since commodore barney left pig point and speculated upon the result of an attack upon baltimore  that night we turned in without standing watch and next morning came a light drizzling rain which forced us to keep under cover unless we were willing to toddle around on the wet decks which was not particularly cheerful amusement  by three oclock in the afternoon we had talked until our tongues were tired and every topic of conversation was exhausted then we fell silent with none too pleasing thoughts for company until darius sprang to his feet with an exclamation that aroused us all  what bloomin idjuts we are to think we must needs wait here till the britishers come down the river he cried excitedly  i thought it was settled that we couldnt well do anything else captain hanaford said in mild surprise  so it was but the sun was shinin with every prospect of a fair night  i looked at the old sailor in bewilderment it seemed as if he had suddenly taken leave of his senses for there was nothing to be made of his words  whats crawlin over you darius captain hanaford asked has anythin happened suddenly  yes an thats a fact here we are lyin up here in a nasty storm as if we was bound to stay when its only a case of haulin the pungy into the channel an lettin her drift past the vessels below the fort ill wager an apple against a doughnut that well go by slick as fallin down hill cause itll be darker n sam hill tonight there aint any moon to break the blackness an unless we come plump on to the enemy theyll never be any the wiser  i could see that the older members of the party believed as did darius but to me it seemed like taking needless chances when by remaining in hiding a few days we might set sail without hindrance for if our pungy was seen there could be little doubt but that she would be sunk off hand  however it was not for me to start any argument with my elders who understood such matters far better than did either of us lads and i held my peace expecting that an argument would ensue  to my great surprise no further word was spoken regarding the plan but captain hanaford pulled on his oiledcoat as he said curtly  itll be a good twohours job to pull the pungy into the stream an wont be handy work after dark  darius and bill made ready to accompany him on deck and to my great surprise i found that these three at least believed the plan of trying to drift past the british ships in the darkness one which should be carried into effect  i looked at my father but he appeared to think all was as it should be and for the moment i was dumfounded at the idea of taking so many and such great chances simply to save idling a few days  when the men went on deck we lads followed as a matter of course but never one of us was called upon to perform any part in the labor  the creek was too narrow to admit of turning the pungy therefore it became necessary to tow her out stern first and this the three men did quite handily with darius and bill jepson in the boat and captain hanaford on deck to keep the branches of the trees from fouling with the rigging  half an hour before sunset the little vessel was at the mouth of the waterway where she could be put into the stream with but a small amount of labor and captain hanaford ordered jim freeman and dody wardwell to turn to at getting supper  while the meal was being prepared the captain and the two old sailors talked about the probable location of the enemys ships and when the conversation was come to an end i learned that they counted on letting the pungy take her own course after rounding the point on which the fort had been located  it was to be a piece of blind luck all the way through and i made up my mind that if the vessel was afloat after we passed the ships it would be a sure case of interposition of that divinity which watches over fools  i seemed to be the only one however who was borrowing any trouble on account of the proposed venture and it can well be fancied that i held my peace although i did a power of thinking  when supper had been eaten and the last spark of fire in the cookstove extinguished lest it should be seen by the enemy all hands went on deck  of a verity the night was black enough if that was the only thing wanted to insure success standing at the tiller i could not even make out the loom of the mainmast and as for saying whether the pungy was in the stream or the river it was impossible  darius and bill jepson went about their portion of the task however as if it was broad day  the pungy was pulled out into the current the old sailors came over the rail and we were fully committed to the venture  i had supposed that some portion of the sails would be spread to give us steerageway if nothing more but in this i was mistaken a square of white canvas could be more readily seen in the darkness than the entire hull of the pungy which was painted black therefore we would go through with only the empty spars to give an alarm if so be the enemy caught a glimpse of us  we had hardly more than started when the rain began to fall heavily and bill jepson said with a chuckle of satisfaction  everythin is workin our way there aint a barnacle aboard the ships thatll stand up an take all this water when he can keep himself dry by seekin the shelter of the rail  but suppose we run plump on to them i asked in a whisper  then itll be a case of doin some tall an lively hustlin lad an no man can say what oughter be done till were in the scrape  can you make out the shore on either side i asked  yes by stoopin low sos to sight the sky over the treetops you can contrive to get an idee of whether were in the middle of the stream but you cant do much more  i might stand on my head without being able to tell which was land and which water  i reckon thats true bill said with a laugh but when youve knocked around at sea as long as i have youll learn to see through ink bottle an all  stop that noise darius whispered harshly youre not even to breathe loud from this out an walkin across the deck will make trouble with me for the man or lad who does it  thus it was that each fellow felt obliged to remain wherever he stood when the order had been given we could well understand the reason for such caution and were not disposed to go contrary to the command  i peered into the gloom intently hoping i might distinguish the shadows of the trees ashore but it was impossible and from that moment i remained with my eyes shut as one involuntarily does when the blackness is intense  how slowly the time passed i tried to get some idea of the minutes by counting up to sixty allowing that number of seconds had gone by but failed in so doing because my anxiety was so great that i did not keep the reckoning  it seemed as if an hour had fled although the current should have carried us among the fleet in less than half that time when i was startled by hearing a voice close by my side apparently  its a bloomin nasty night matey  right you are was the reply its jest my luck to be muckin round here when the lads from the other ships are havin high jinks in one of the yankee cities  then it was that i realized we were within a few yards of a ship and by some stroke of good fortune had missed fowling her  it surely seemed as if they must see us although i could not make out even a shadow of her strain my eyes as i might and in case we were discovered the end would come very rapidly as i then believed  from that moment it was as if i did not breathe so fearful was i of giving some alarm which would betray our whereabouts  the pattering of the rain on the water raised no slight noise and this was favorable to us our tiller had been lashed so that there might be no possibility the rudderhead would creak in its socket and every rope was brailed to guard against its flapping  had ours been the ghost of a ship and those on board a phantom crew we could not have glided down stream more silently but the danger which had been ever present in my thoughts was that of coming in collision with one of the ships  we had already passed the first in safety but there were three others and in fear and trembling i admitted to myself that we could not hope to slip by them all     chapter xxi  in port   the moments passed in silence save for the hissing of the raindrops as they mingled with the water of the river and i was saying to myself that of a verity we must have drifted safely through the fleet without touching a ship when that came which i had been fearing  suddenly i felt a shock then a noise as of wood grinding against wood and i knew we had fouled the enemy  while one might have counted five the pungy rubbed against the side of the ship and then came the hail  ahoy there ahoy  what are you hailing a strange voice cried and he who had first broken the silence replied  theres a craft of some kind alongside sir  then it was as if a swarm of bees had been let loose the enemys ship was alive with moving buzzing beings some of whom cried out this or that order and others called down maledictions on the head of the man who had needlessly aroused them  theres nothin here sir sam was dreamin i heard the voice of a sailor cry and almost at the same instant came the rattling of firearms as they were being handled sounding so near aboard that it seemed as if a portion of the enemy had leaped upon our decks  make ready fire sounded the command sharp and quick  then came a sheet of flame which lighted up surrounding objects until we could distinctly see the deck of the bombvessel and the eager men thronging her deck  this illumination was but as the lightnings flash and then we could hear the angry hum of the bullets as they swarmed above our heads  we had been seen and i believed that a broadside would follow in short order yet at the same time i realized that our good fortune had followed us when it sent the pungy afoul of a bombvessel instead of a craft which had her guns ready trained for service  now had come the time however when we were to remain idle no longer  i heard darius call bill jepson and knew by the noises which followed that the two sailors were taking to the canoe in order to tow the pungy and at the same time captain hanaford cast off the lashing of the tiller as he ordered us to run up the canvas  work i have never moved so lively before nor since as i did then when i felt positive that within a very few seconds our deck would be swept by grape and cannister  at such moments of supreme danger ones senses are unnaturally acute and while i gave strict attention to all that was taking place aboard the pungy it became possible to understand what the enemy was about  the other vessels of the fleet were making ready to take a hand in our destruction from every quarter we could hear cries of command mingled with the noise of men running to and fro and just when the pungy began to feel the effect of the canvas which was clapped on her in such a hurry a rocket went up illumining the scene for ten seconds or more  then it was i saw that we had passed three of the ships having come to grief on the last in the line and had no time to take further note of the surroundings when the guns of all four craft belched forth with a mighty roar that caused the pungy to tremble but the impact of the shot did not follow  thus suddenly aroused and in the intense darkness which had been dispelled only long enough to dazzle a fellows eyes the gunners had not been able to take accurate aim otherwise we must have gone to the bottom like a stone  they wont have time to try that game more than once again before well be well out of their way i heard darius say and i knew we had sufficient speed to render useless the work of towing otherwise the two sailors would not have come aboard  now three rockets were sent up in rapid succession and while the light lasted i knew that the british gunners were taking aim at us but we had slipped so far down the river by this time that there were some few chances in our favor however closely they might shoot  down on your faces darius cried and i dropped like a stone understanding that such an order had been given to lessen the chances of our being hit but at the same time the thought came to me that it was better to be killed by a roundshot which would cut a mans life short instantly than mangled by a splinter  then came the flash of burning powder the mighty roar of big guns the hurtling shot striking the water on every side and the pungy reeled and quivered as if she had struck a rock  one ball went home that time darius cried and i knew by the sound that he had leaped to his feet running with all speed into the cuddy  from below i made out the tiny gleam of the match as darius lighted a lantern and did not need to be told that he was gone to learn what injury our vessel had received  immediately the cannon had been discharged captain hanaford was on his feet grasping the tiller as if it was possible to steer the pungy while the blackness continued so dense that one might fancy he could feel it and then came the glare of more rockets  this aided the helmsman of ours more than it did the british gunners since it gave him an opportunity to see exactly where his vessel was but as to that i gave no heed all my mind was centered on the distance between us and the enemy  i could have cried aloud with joy and am not certain but that i did on seeing that we were drawing away with more speed than i had believed was in the clumsy craft and what was of greater importance the pungy was rounding a bend which once passed would put us beyond reach of the guns  the rockets had been fired just in the nick of time otherwise we would have gone ashore on the western bank  for the third time we heard the thunder of the guns but the shot must have passed astern of us for i did not hear either the splashing of water or the splintering of our woodwork to tell where they struck  then darius came on deck with an announcement that relieved me of nearly all my fears  the pungy has a solid shot above the waterline well forward but theres no need of pluggin it for the ball didnt get through the timber i reckon weve done the trick eh captain  were off for a fact an unless we strike the mud twixt here an the bay weve seen the last of that lot of britishers  now it was that all hands of us were ordered forward to act as lookouts and the pungy danced along in the darkness as if rejoicing at her escape from a peril that had wellnigh proved her ending  it is impossible for me to set down what we said or did when it was seen that we had really escaped from as dangerous a venture as human beings ever embarked in i dare say we acted like a party of simples and certain it is that the older members of the crew were no less boisterous in their rejoicings than we lads  and now there remains but little more to be said for the homeward voyage was short  at midnight the rain ceased falling the clouds were partially dispersed and we had sufficient light to enable us to navigate the little vessel without difficulty  in four and twenty hours without having come across an enemy or anything to cause alarm we were in benedict once more captain hanaford having sailed past his own home in order to land us and well was it for all hands that we did not arrive the day previous because not until then did the fleet under admiral cochrane with the land forces under general ross take their final departure leaving the little village looking as if a herd of cattle had been pastured there  it only remains for me to say since this story has nothing to do with my movements after we were returned from service under commodore barney that in due time the government honored the commodores guarantee thus enabling jerry and me to purchase a pungy much larger and better than the avenger and at the same time have quite a substantial sum of money to give our parents  and all this i have written in the cuddy of the new boat which we have named the joshua barney while jim freeman dody wardwell josiah coburn darius and jerry have discussed each portion as it was set down for we are shipmates in the oyster business sharing the profits as well as the work until a stranger would find it difficult to say which is the captain or which the cook  now that my portion of the work has come to an end i shall copy here that which will serve to wind up the yarn in proper shape  referring to the close of the battle of bladensburg a newspaper writer says  the english sharpshooters had straggled about and were doing much mischief barneys horse fell between two of the guns pierced by two balls several of his officers were killed or wounded the ammunition wagon had gone off in the general confusion and retreat of the army the enemy began to flank out to the right under cover of a thick wood and had nearly surrounded the commodore his men were nearly exhausted having undergone a threedays march without a regular supply of provisions he had received a wound in the thigh some time before and was faint from loss of blood when he ordered a retreat which was effected in good order by the men and such officers as could follow he retired a few yards with the help of three of his officers whom he had ordered away and fell from weakness in which situation he was found by the enemy  general ross and admiral cockburn came to him and tendered every assistance he was carried in a litter to the village of bladensburg and the next day in the company of his wife and son was taken home in a carriage a week later he was formally exchanged for two british colonels the ball had been probed for by the english surgeons but without effect and it was not found until after his death which is said to have been caused by the wound  and now regarding the fleet which we dodged mr lossing says in his war of 1812  the british squadron appeared before fort washington on the 27th of august three days after the capture of the capital captain dyson either misunderstood general winders order or was influenced by mortal fear for he blew up and abandoned the fort without firing a gun no doubt the british fleet could have been kept below by the heavy cannon of the fort dyson chose not to try the experiment and for his injurious conduct he was dismissed from the service  the british squadron now had nothing to fear and without interference the frigates sailed on anchoring off alexandria on the evening of the 28th on the morning of the 29th it assumed a hostile attitude a hundred yards from the wharves and was well prepared to lay every building in the town in ashes the citizens sent a deputation to captain gordon to ask upon what terms he would consent to spare the town he replied that all naval stores and ordnance all the shipping and its furniture merchandise of every description in the city or which had been carried out of it to a place of safety and refreshments of every kind must be immediately given up to him also that the vessels which had been scuttled to save them from destruction must be raised and delivered up to him do all this he said and the town of alexandria with the exception of public works shall be spared and the inhabitants shall remain unmolested  these were harsh and humiliating terms and the inhabitants were allowed only one hour for consideration they were powerless and were compelled to submit the merchandise that had been carried from the town and the sunken vessels could not be given up to the invader so he contented himself by burning one vessel and loading several others chiefly with flour cotton and tobacco with these in charge the squadron weighed anchor and sailed down the potomac   the end   good fiction worth reading  a series of romances containing
