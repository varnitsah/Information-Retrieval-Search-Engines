theories of a novelist     the betrayal  chapter i  the face at the window  like a clap of thunder the north wind rushing seawards seemed suddenly to threaten the ancient little building with destruction the window sashes rattled the beams which supported the roof creaked and groaned the oil lamps by which alone the place was lit swung perilously in their chains a row of maps designed for the instruction of the youngthe place was a schoolhousecommenced a devils dance against the wall in the street without we heard the crash of a fallen chimneypot my audience of four rose timorously to its feet and i glad of the excuse folded my notes and stepped from the slightly raised platform on to the floor  i am much obliged to you for coming i said but i think that it is quite useless to continue for i can scarcely make you hear and i am not at all sure that the place is safe  i spoke hastily my one desire being to escape from the scene of my humiliation unaccosted one of my little audience however was of a different mind rising quickly from one of the back seats she barred the way her broad comely face was full of mingled contrition and sympathy  i am so sorry mr ducaine she exclaimed it does seem a cruel pity doesnt itand such a beautiful lecture i tried so hard to persuade dad and the others to come but you know how they all love hearing anything about the war and  my dear miss moyat i interrupted i am only sorry that a mistaken sense of kindness should have brought you here with one less in the audience i think i should have ventured to suggest that we all went round to hear colonel ray i should like to have gone myself immensely  blanche moyat looked at me doubtfully  thats all very well she declared but i think its jolly mean of the duke to bring him down here the very night you were giving your lecture  i do not suppose he knew anything about that i answered in any case i can give my lecture again any time but none of us may ever have another opportunity of hearing colonel ray allow me  i opened the door and a storm of sleet and spray stung our faces old pegg who had been there to sell and collect tickets shouted to us  shut the door quick master or itll be blown to smithereens its a real noreaster and a bad un at that why the missiell hardly stand ill see to the lights and lock up master ducaine better be getting hoam while thee can for the creeksll run full tonight  once out in the village street i was spared the embarrassment of conversation we had to battle the way step by step we were drenched with spray and the driving rain the wind kept us breathless mocking any attempt at speech we passed the village hall brilliantly lit the shadowy forms of a closely packed crowd of people were dimly visible through the uncurtained windows i fancied that my companions clutch upon my arm tightened as we hurried past  we reached a large grey stone house fronting the street miss moyat laid her hand upon the handle of the door and motioned to me to enter  i shook my head  not tonight i shouted i am drenched  she endeavoured to persuade me  for a few moments at any rate she pleaded the others will not be home yet and i will make you something hot father is expecting you to supper  i shook my head and staggered on at the corner of the street i looked behind she was holding on to the door handle still watching me her skirts blowing about her in strange confusion for a moment i had half a mind to turn back the dead loneliness before me seemed imbued with fresh horrorsthe loneliness my fireless grate and empty larder moyat was at least hospitable there would be a big fire plenty to eat and drink then i remembered the mans coarse hints his unveiled references to his daughters and his wish to see them settled in life his superabundance of whisky and his only halfveiled tone of patronage the man was within his rights he was the rich man of the neighbourhood corn dealer farmer and horse breeder i was an unknown and practically destitute stranger come from heaven knew where and staying onbecause it took a little less to keep body and soul together here than in the town but my nerves were all raw that night and the thought of john moyat with his hearty voice and slap on the shoulder was unbearable i set my face homewards  from the village to my cottage stretched a perfectly straight road with dykes on either side no sooner had i passed the last house and set my foot upon the road than i saw strange things the marshland which on the right reached to the sea was hung here and there with sheets of mist driven along the ground like clouds before an april tempest white flakes of spray salt and luminous were dashed into my face the sea indriven up the creeks swept the road in many places the cattle trembling with fear had left the marshland and were coming lowing along the high path which bordered the dyke and all the time an undernote of terror the thunder of the sea rushing in upon the land came like a deep monotonous refrain to the roaring of the wind  through it all i battled my way hatless soaked to the skin yet finding a certain wild pleasure in the storm by the time i had reached my little dwelling i was exhausted my hair and clothes were in wild disorder my boots were like pulp upon my feet my remaining strength was expended in closing the door the fire was out the place struck cold i staggered towards the easy chair but the floor seemed suddenly to heave beneath my feet i was conscious of the fact that for two days i had had little to eat and that my larder was empty my limbs were giving way a mist was before my eyes and the roar of the sea seemed to be in my ears even in my brain my hands went out like a blind mans and i suppose broke my fall there was rest at least in the unconsciousness which came down like a black pall upon my senses  it could only have been a short time before i opened my eyes some one was knocking at the door outside i could hear the low panting of a motorcar the flashing of brilliant lamps threw a gleam of light across the floor of my room again there came a sharp rapping upon the door i raised myself upon my elbow but i made no attempt at speech the motor was the rowchester daimler omnibus what did these people want with me i was horribly afraid of being found in such straits i lay quite still and prayed that they might go away  but my visitor whoever he was had apparently no idea of doing anything of the sort i heard the latch lifted and the tall bulky form of a man filled the threshold with him came the wind playing havoc about my room sending papers and ornaments flying around in wild confusion he closed the door quickly with a little imprecation i heard the scratching of a match saw it carefully shielded in the hollow of the mans hand then it burned clearly and i knew that i was discovered  the man was wrapped from head to foot in a huge ulster he was so tall that his cap almost brushed my ceiling i raised myself upon my elbow and looked at him looked for the first time at mostyn ray he had the blackest and the heaviest eyebrows i had ever seen very piercing eyes and a finely shaped mouth firm even to cruelty i should have known him anywhere from the pictures which were filling the newspapers and magazines my first impression i think was that they had done him but scanty justice  as for me there is no doubt but that i was a pitiful object of colour i had never very much and my fainting fit could scarcely have improved matters my cheeks i had noticed that morning when shaving were hollow and there were black rims under my eyes with my disordered clothing and hair i must indeed have presented a strange appearance as i struggled to gain my feet  he looked at me as well he might in amazement  i would ask you he said to excuse my unceremonious entrance but that it seems to have been providential you have met with an accident i am afraid allow me  he helped me to stagger to my feet and pushed me gently into the easy chair the match burnt out and he quietly struck another and looked around the room for a candle or lamp it was a vain search for i had neither  i am afraid i said that i am out of candlesand oil i got a little overtired walking here and my foot slipped in the dark did i understand that you wished to see me  i did he answered gravely my name is mostyn raybut i think that we had better have some light i am going to get one of the motor lamps  if you could callin the morning i began desperately but he had already opened and closed the door i looked around my room and i could have sobbed with mortification the omnibus was lit inside as well as out and i knew very well who was there already he was talking with the occupants i saw a girl lean forward and listen to him then my worst fears were verified i saw her descend and they both stood for a moment by the side of the man who was tugging at one of the huge lamps i closed my eyes in despair  once more the wind swept into my room the door was quickly opened and closed a manservant in his long coat and cockaded hat tied round his head with a piece of string set down the lamp upon my table behind the girl and mostyn ray were talking  the man had better stop he whispered there is the fire to be made  for the first time i heard her voice very slow and soft almost languid yet very pleasant to listen to  no she said firmly it will look so much like taking him by storm i can assure you that i am by no means a helpless person  and i he answered am a campaigner  get back as quickly as you can richards she directed and get the things i told you from mrs brown jean must bring you back in the motor  once more the door opened and shut i heard the swish of her skirts as she came over towards me  poor fellow she murmured im afraid that he is very ill  i opened my eyes and made an attempt to rise she laid her hand upon my shoulder and smiled  please dont move she said and do forgive us for this intrusion colonel ray wanted to call and apologize about this evening and i am so glad that he did we are going to take no end of liberties but you must remember that we are neighbours and therefore have privileges  what could i say in answer to such a speech as this as a matter of fact speech of any sort was denied me a great sob had stuck in my throat they did what was kindest they left me alone  i heard them rummaging about in my back room and soon i heard the chopping of sticks presently i heard the crackling of flames and i knew that a fire had been lit a dreamy partial unconsciousness destitute of all pain and not in itself unpleasant stole over me i felt my boots cut from my feet i was gently lifted up some of my outer garments were removed every now and then i heard their voices i heard her shocked exclamation as she examined my larder i heard the words starvation exhaustion scarcely applying them to myself then i heard her call to him softly she was standing by my bookcase  do you see this she murmured guy ducaine magdalen and the college coat of arms they must belong to him for that is his name  i did not hear his answer but directly afterwards a little exclamation escaped him  by jove what luck i have my flask with me after all is there a spoon there lady angela  she brought him one directly he stooped down and i felt the metal strike my teeth the brandy seemed to set all my blood flowing once more warmly in my veins the heat of the fire too was delicious  and then the strangest thing of all happened i opened my eyes my chair was drawn sideways to the fire and immediately facing the window the first thing that i saw was this pressed against it peering into the room was the white face of a man an entire stranger to me    chapter ii  good samaritans  they both hurried to my side i was sitting up in my chair pointing my eyes fixed with surprise i do not know even now why the incident should so much have alarmed me but it is a fact that for the moment i was palsied with fear there had been murder in the mans eyes loathsome things in his white unkempt face my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth they gave me more brandy and then i spoke  there was a manlooking in a mans face there at the window  ray took up the lamp and strode to the door when he returned he exchanged a significant glance with lady angela  there is no one there now at any rate he said i dare say it was fancy  it was not i answered it was a mans facea horrible face  the omnibus is coming back he said quietly the servants shall have a good look round  i would not worry about it lady angela said soothingly it is easy to fancy things when one is not well  so they meant to treat me like a child i said nothing but it was a long time before my limbs ceased to shake the tall servant reappeared with a huge luncheon basketall manner of delicacies were emptied out upon my table lady angela was making something in a clip ray was undoing a goldfoiled bottle soon i found myself eating and drinking and the blood once more was mashing through my veins i was my own man again rescued by charity and of all the women in the world fate had sent this one to play the lady bountiful  you are looking better my young friend colonel ray said presently  i feelquite all right again thank you i answered i wish i could thank you and lady angela  you must not attempt anything of the sort she declared my father bythebye mr ducaine wished me to express his great regret that he should have interfered in any way with your arrangements for this evening you know there are so many stupid people around here who have never understood anything at all about the war and he was very anxious to get colonel ray to talk to them he had no idea however that it was the night fixed for your lecture and he hopes that you will accept the loan of the village hall from him any night you like and we should so much like all of us to come  his grace is very kind i murmured i fear however that the people are not very much interested in lectures even about their own neighbourhood  i am at any rate lady angela answered smiling and i think we can promise you an audience  colonel ray who had been standing at the window came back to us  if i may be permitted to make a suggestion lady angela he said i think it would be well if you returned home now and i will follow shortly on foot  indeed i said there is no need for you colonel ray to remain i am absolutely recovered now and the old woman who looks after me will be here in the morning  he seemed scarcely to have heard me afterwards when i knew him better i understood his apparent unconcern of any suggestion counter to his own he thought slowly and he spoke seldom but when he had once spoken the matter so far as he was concerned was done with lady angela apparently was used to him for she rose at once she did not shake hands but she nodded to me pleasantly colonel ray handed her into the wagonette and i heard the quicker throbbing of the engine as it glided off into the darkness  it was several minutes before he returned i began to wonder whether he had changed his mind and returned to rowchester with lady angela then the door handle suddenly turned and he stepped in his hair was tossed with the wind his shoes were wet and covered with mud and he was breathing rather fast as though he had been running i looked at him inquiringly he offered me no explanation but on his way to the chair which he presently drew up to the fire he paused for a full minute by the window and shading the carriage lamp which he still carried with his hand he looked steadily out into the darkness a thought struck me  you have seen him i exclaimed  he set down the lamp upon the table and deliberately seated himself  seen whom he asked producing a pipe and tobacco  the man who looked inwhose face i saw at the window  he struck a match and lit his pipe  i have seen no one he answered quietly the face was probably a fancy of yours i should recommend you to forget it  i looked down at his marshstained shoes one foot was wet to the ankle and a thin strip of green seaweed had wound itself around his trousers to any other man i should have had more to say yet even in those first few hours of our acquaintance i had become like all the others to some extent the servant of his will spoken or unspoken so i held my peace and looked away into the fire i felt he had something to say to me and i waited  he moved his head slowly towards the bookcase  those books he asked are yours  yes i answered  your name then is guy ducaine  yes  did you ever know your father   it was a singular question i looked at him quickly his face was sphinxlike  no why do you ask did you  he ignored me absolutely for several moments his whole attention seemed fixed upon the curling wreath of blue smoke which hung between us  he died i suppose he continued when you were about twelve years old  i nodded  my uncle i said gave me a holiday and a sovereign to spend he told me that a great piece of good fortune had happened to me  colonel ray smiled grimly  that was like old stephen ducaine he remarked he died himself a few years afterwards  three years  he left you ten thousand pounds what have you done with it  mr heathcote of heathcote sons and vyse was my solicitor  well  i remembered that he had been away from england for several years  the firm failed i told him for a quarter of a million mr heathcote shot himself i am told that there is a probable dividend of sixpencehalfpenny in the pound to come some day  colonel ray smoked on in silence this was evidently news to him  awkward for you he remarked at last  i laughed a little bitterly i knew quite well that he was expecting me to continue and i did so  i sold my things at magdalen and paid my debts i was promised two pupils if i would take a house somewhere on this coast i took one and got ready for them with my last few pounds their father died suddenlyand they did not come i got rid of the house at a sacrifice and came to this cottage  you took your degree  with honours  he blew out more smoke  you are young he said a gentleman by birth and i should imagine a moderate athlete you have an exceptional degree and i presume a fair knowledge of the world yet you appear to be deliberately settling down here to starve  i can assure you i answered that the deliberation is lacking i have no fear of anything of the sort i expect to get some pupils in the neighbourhood and also some literary work for the moment i am a little hard up and i thought perhaps that i might make a few shillings by a lecture  of the proceeds of which he remarked with a dry little smile i appear to have robbed you  i shrugged my shoulders  i hoped for little but a meal or two from it i answered the only loss is to my selfrespect i owe to charity what i might have earned  he took his pipe from his mouth and looked at me with a thin derisive smile  you talk he said like a very young man if you had knocked about in all corners of the world as i have you would have learnt a greater lesson from a greater book when a man meets brother man in the wilds who talks of charity they divide goods and pass on even the savages do this  these i ventured to remark are not the wilds  he sighed and replaced his pipe in his mouth  you are young very young he remarked thoughtfully you have that beastly hothouse education big ideas on thin stalks orchids instead of roses the stove instead of the sun the wilds are everywhereon the thames embankment even in this godforsaken corner of the world the wilds are wherever men meet men  i was silent who was i to argue with ray whose fame was in every ones mouthsoldier traveller and diplomatist for many years he had been living hand and glove with life and death there were many who spoke well of him and many illmany to whom he was a hero many to whom his very name was like poison but he was emphatically not a man to contradict in my little cottage he seemed like a giant sixfoottwo broad and swart with the burning fire of tropical suns he seemed to fill the place to dominate me and my paltry surroundings even as in later years i saw him the master spirit in a great assembly eagleeyed strenuous omnipotent there was something about him which made other men seem like pygmies there was force in the stern selfrepression of his speech in the curve of his lips the clear lightning of his eyes  my silence did not seem altogether to satisfy him i felt his eyes challenge mine and i was forced to meet his darkly questioning gaze  come he said i trust that i have said enough you have buried the thought of that hateful word  you have stricken it mortally i answered but i can scarcely promise so speedy a funeral however what more i feel i added i will keep to myself  it would be better he answered curtly  you have asked me i said many questions i am emboldened to ask you one you have spoken of my father  the look he threw upon me was little short of terrible  ay he answered i have spoken of him let me tell you this young man if i believed that you were a creature of his breed if i believed that a drop of his black blood ran in your veins i would take you by the neck now and throw you into the nearest creek where the water was deep enough to drown  i rose to my feet trembling  if those are your feelings sir i declared i have no wish to claim your kindness  sit down boy he answered coldly i have no fear of you nature does not pay us so evil a trick as to send us two such as he in successive generations  he rose and looked out of the window the storm had abated but little the roar of the sea and wind was still like thunder in the air black clouds were driven furiously across the sky torrents of rain and spray beat every now and then upon the window he turned back and examined the carriage lamp  it is an awful night i said i cannot offer you a bed unless you will take mine but i can bring rugs and a pillow to the fire if you will lie there  then for the only time in my life i saw him hesitate he looked out of my uncurtained window into the night very often have i wondered what thought it was that passed then through his brain  i thank you he said the walk is nothing and they will expect me at rowchester you have pencil and paper write down what i tell youcolonel mostyn ray no 17 sussex square you have that good it is my address presently i think you will get tired of your life here come then to me i may be able to show you the way  out of the conservatory i interrupted smiling  he nodded and took up the lantern to my surprise he did not offer to shake hands without another word he passed out into the darkness  in my dreams that night i fancied that a strange cry came ringing to my ears from the marshesa longdrawnout cry of terror ending in a sob i was weary and i turned on my side again and slept    chapter iii  the cry in the night  youd be having company last night sir mrs hollings remarked inquisitively mrs hollings was an elderly widow who devoted two hours of her morning to cleaning my rooms and preparing my breakfast  some friends did call i answered pouring out the coffee  friends good samaritans i should call em mrs hollings declared if so be as they left all the things i found here this morning why theres a whole chicken to say nothing of tongue and biscuits and butter and relishes and savouries the names of which isnt often heard in this part of the world theres wine too with gold paper round the top champagne wine i do believe  is the tide up this morning i asked  none to speak of mrs hollings answered though the roads been washed dry and the creeks are brimming ive scarcely set foot in the village this morning but theyre all atalking about the soldier gentleman the duke brought down to the village hall last night might you have seen him sir  yes i saw him i answered  a sad shame as it was the night of your lecture sir the woman babbled on for they were all crazy to hear him my the hall was packed  would you mind seeing to my room now mrs hollings i asked i am going out early this morning  mrs hollings ascended my frail little staircase i finished my breakfast in haste and catching up my hat escaped out of doors  i shall never forget the glory of that morning the sky was blue and cloudless the sun was as hot as though this were indeed a midsummer morning the whole land saturated still with the fast receding sea seemed to gleam and glitter with a strange iridescence great pools in unaccustomed places shone like burnished silver the wet sands were sparkling and brilliant the creeks had become swollen rivers full of huge masses of emerald seaweed running far up into the marshland and spreading themselves out over the meadows beyond there was salt in the very atmosphere i felt it on my tongue and my cheeks were rough with it overhead the seagulls in great flocks were returning from shelter screaming as though with joy as they dived down to the sea it was a wonderful morning  about two hundred yards past my cottage the road which from the village ran perfectly straight took a sharp turn inland leaving the coast abruptly on account of the greater stretch of marshland beyond it was towards this bend that i walked and curiously enough with every step i took some inexplicable sense of nervous excitement grew stronger and stronger within me the fresh morning air and the sunlight seemed powerless to dissipate for a moment the haunting terror of last night it was a real face which i had seen pressed against the window and where had ray been when he returned with sandclogged boots and the telltale seaweed upon his trousers and later on had i dreamed it or had there really been a cry it came back to me with horrible distinctness it was a real cry the cry of a man in terror for his life i stopped short in the road and wiped my damp forehead what a fool i was the night was over here in the garish day there was surely nothing to fear nevertheless i who had started out thirsting only to breathe the fresh salt air now walked along with stealthy nervous footsteps looking all the time from left to right starting at the sight of a dark log on the sands terrified at a broken buoy which had floated up one of the creeks some fear had come over me which i could not shake off i was afraid of what i might see  so i walked to the bend of the road here in case the turn might be too sharp for some to see at night a dozen yards or so of white posts and railings bordered the marshes i leaned over them for a moment telling myself that i paused only to admire the strange colours drawn by the sunlight from the seasoaked wilderness the deep brown the strange purple the faint pink of the distant sands but it was none of these which my eyes sought with such fierce eagerness it was none of the artists fervour which turned my limbs into dead weights which drew the colour even from my lips and set my heart beating with fierce quick throbs half in the creek and half out not a dozen yards from the road was the figure of a man his head and shoulders were beneath the water his body and legs and outstretched arms were upon the marsh and although never before had i looked upon death i knew very well that i was face to face with it now  how long it was before i moved i cannot tell at last however i climbed the palings jumped at its narrowest point a smaller creek and with slow footsteps approached the dead man even when i stood by his side i dared not touch him i dared not turn him round to see his face i saw that he was of middle size fairly well dressed and as some blown sand had drifted over his boots and ankles i knew that he had been there for some hours there was blood upon his collar and the fingers of his right hand were tightly clenched i told myself that i was a coward and i set my teeth i must lift his head from the water and cover him up with my own coat while i fetched help but when i stooped down a deadly faintness came over me my fingers were palsied with horror i had a sudden irresistible conviction i could not touch him it was a sheer impossibility there was something between us more potent than the dread of a dead mansomething inimical between us two the dead and the living i staggered away and ran reeling to the road plunging blindly through the creek  about two hundred yards further down the road was a small lodge at one of the entrances of rowchester it was towards this i turned and ran the door was closed and i beat upon it fiercely with clenched fists the woman who answered it stared at me strangely i suppose that i was a wildlooking object  its mr ducaine isnt it she exclaimed why sakes alive whats wrong sir  a dead man in the marshes i faltered  she was interested enough but her comely weatherhardened face reflected none of the horror which she must have seen on mine  lordy me whereabouts sir she inquired  i pointed with a trembling forefinger she stood by my side on the threshold of the cottage and shaded her eyes with her hand for the glare of the sun was dazzling  well i never did she remarked but i said to john last night that i pitied them at sea hes been washed up by the tide i suppose and i count therell be more before the days out a year come next september there was six of em gentlefolk too whod been yachting eh but its a cruel thing is the sea  where is your husband i asked  up chopping wood in fernham spinney she answered id best send one of the children for him hell have a cart with him will you step inside sir  i shook my head and answered her vaguely she sent a boy with a message and brought me out a chair dusting it carefully with her apron  youd best sit down sir you look all struck of a heap so to speak maybe you came upon it sudden  i was glad enough to sit down but i answered her at random she reentered the cottage and continued some household duties i sat quite still with my eyes steadily fixed upon a dark object a little to the left of those white palings above my head a starling in a wicker cage was making an insane cackling on the green patch in front a couple of tame rabbits sat and watched me pinkeyed imperturbable inside i could hear the slow ticking of an eightday clock the woman was humming to herself as she worked all these things which my senses took quick note of and retained seemed to me to belong to another world i myself was under some sort of spell my brain was numb with terror the fire of life had left my veins so that i sat there in the warm sunshine and shivered until my teeth chattered inside the woman was singing over her work  and then the spell developed a nameless but loathsome fascination drew me from my seat drew me with uneven and reluctant footsteps out of the gate and down the narrow straight road there was still not a soul in sight i drew nearer and nearer to the spot once more i essayed to move him it was utterly in vain such nerve as i possessed had left me wholly and altogether a sense of repulsion nauseating invincible made a child of me i stood up and looked around wildly it was then for the first time i saw what my right foot had trodden into the sand  i picked it up and a little cry unheard save by the seabirds which circled about my head broke from my lips it was a mans signet ring thin and worn smooth with age it was quaintly shaped and in the centre was set a small jetblack stone the device was a bird and underneath the mottovinco  my hand closed suddenly upon it and again i looked searchingly around there was not a soul in sight i slipped the ring into my waistcoat pocket and moved back to the white railings i leaned against them and taking a pipe and tobacco from my pocket began to smoke  strangely enough i had now recovered my nerve i was able to think and reason calmly the woman at the lodge had taken it for granted that this mans body had been thrown up by the sea was that a possible conclusion there was a line all down the sands where the tide had reached a straggling uneven line marked with huge masses of wet seaweeds fragments of timber the flotsam and jetsam of the sea the creek where the mans body was lying was forty yards above this yet on such a night who could say where those great breakers driven in by the wind as well as by their own mighty force might not have cast their prey within a few yards of him was a jagged mass of timber the cause of those wounds would be obvious enough i felt the ring in my waistcoat pocketit was there safely enough hidden and i looked toward the lodge as yet there were no signs of john or the cart  but behind me coming from the village i heard the sound of light and rapid footsteps i turned my head it was blanche moyat shortskirted a stick in her hand a feather stuck through her tamoshanter  goodmorning she cried out heartily ive been to call at your cottage  very kind of you i answered hesitatingly miss moyat was goodhearted but a little overpoweringand in certain moods she reminded me of her father  oh i had an errand she explained laughing father said if i saw you i was to say that he has to call on the duke this afternoon and if you liked he would explain about your lecture last night and try and get the village hall for you for nothing the duke is very goodnatured and if he knows that he spoilt your evening father thinks he might let you have it for nothing  it is very kind of your father i answered i do not think that i shall ever give that lecture again  why not she protested i am sure i thought it a beautiful lecture and im not keen on churches and ruins myself she added with a laugh which somehow grated upon me what are you doing here  watching the dead i answered grimly  she looked at me for an explanation i pointed to the dark object by the side of the creek she gave a violent start then she screamed and caught hold of my arm  mr ducaine she cried what is it  a dead man i answered  her face was a strange study there was fear mingled with unwholesome curiosity the heritage of her natural lack of refinement she leaned over the palings  oh how horrible she exclaimed i dont know whether i want to look or not ive never seen any one dead  i should advise you i said to go away  it was apparently the last thing she desired to do of the various emotions which had possessed her curiosity was the one which survived  you are sure he is dead she asked  quite i answered  was he drowned then  i think i replied that he has been washed up by the tide there has probably been a shipwreck  gracious she exclaimed it is just a sailor then  i have not looked at his face i answered and i should not advise you to he has been tossed about and injured his clothes though are not a seamans  she passed through a gap in the palings  i must look just a little closer she exclaimed do come with me mr ducaine im horribly afraid  then dont go near him i advised a dead man is surely not a pleasant spectacle for you come away miss moyat  but she had advanced to within a couple of yards of him then she stopped short and a little exclamation escaped from her lips  why mr ducaine she cried out this is the very man who stopped me last night outside our house and asked the way to your cottage    chapter iv  miss moyats promise  we stood looking at one another on the edge of the marsh in the clear morning sunlight i had no chance of escape or subterfuge there was terror in my face and she could see it  youyou cannot be sure i exclaimed it may not be the same man  it is the same man she answered confidently he stopped me and asked if i could direct him to your house it was about half an hour after you had gone he spoke very softly and almost like a foreigner i told him exactly where your cottage was didnt he come to you  no i answered i have never seen him before in my life  why do you lookso terrified she asked you are as pale as a ghost  i clutched hold of the railings she came over to my side up the road i heard in the distance the crunching of heavy wheels a wagon was passing through the lodge gates john the woodman was walking with unaccustomed briskness by the horses heads cracking his whip as he came i looked into the girls face by my side  miss moyat i said hoarsely cant you forget that you saw this man  why she asked bewildered  i dont want to be dragged into it i answered glancing nervously over my shoulder along the road dont you see that if he is just found here with his head and shoulders in the creek and nothing is known about him they will take it that he has been washed up by the sea in the storm last night but if it is known that he came from the land that he was seen in the village asking for methen there will be many things said  i dont see as it matters she answered puzzled he didnt come and you dont know anything about him but of course if you want me to say nothing  she paused i clutched her arm  miss moyat i said i have strong reasons for not wishing to be brought into this  all right she said dropping her voice i will doas you ask  there was an absurd meaning in her little sideglance which at another time would have put me on my guard but just then i was engrossed with my own vague fears i forgot even to remove my hand from her arm so we were standing when a moment later the silence was broken by the sound of a galloping horse coming fast across the marshes we started aside lady angela reined in a great bay mare a few yards away from us her habit was all bespattered with mud she had evidently ridden across country from one of the private entrances to the park  what is this terrible story mr ducaine she exclaimed is there really a shipwreck i can see no signs of it  no shipwreck that i know of lady angela i answered there is a dead man hereone only i have heard of nothing else  her eyes followed my outstretched hand and she saw the body half on the sands half on the marsh she shivered a little  poor fellow she exclaimed is it any one from the village mr ducaine  it is a stranger lady angela i answered we think that his body must have been washed in from the sea  she measured the distance from highwater mark with a glance and shook her head  too far away she declared  there was a wild sea last night i answered and such a tide as i have never seen here before  what are you doing with it she asked pointing with her whip  john hefford is bringing a wagon i answered i suppose he had better take it to the police station  she wheeled her horse round  i am glad that it is no worse she said there are reports going about of a terrible shipwreck i trust that you are feeling better mr ducaine  i am quite recoveredthanks to your kindness and colonel rays i answered  she nodded  you will hear from my father during the day she said he is quite anxious to come to your lecture goodmorning  goodmorning lady angela  she galloped away miss moyat turned towards me eagerly  why mr ducaine she exclaimed i had no idea that you knew lady angela  nor do i i answered shortly our acquaintance is of the slightest  what did she mean about the lecture  i affected not to hear john the wagoner had pulled up his team by the side of the palings and was touching his hat respectfully  another job for the dead ouse sir my missis tells me  there is the body of a dead man here john i answered washed up by the tide i suppose it isnt an uncommon occurrence here is it  lor bless you no sir the man answered stepping over the palings i had three of them here in one month last year if youll just give me a hand sir well take him down to the police station  i set my teeth and advanced towards the dead man john hefford proved at once that he was superior to all such trifles as nerves he lifted the body up and laid it for the first time flat upon the sands  my hes had a nasty smash on the head john remarked looking down at him with simple curiosity quite the gent too i should say will you give me a hand sir and well have him in the wagon  so i was forced to touch him after all nevertheless i kept my eyes as far as possible from the ghastly face with the long hideous wound across it i saw now however in one swift unwilling glance what manner of man this was he had thin features a high forehead deepset eyes too close together a thin irongrey moustache whatever his station in life may have been he was not of the labouring classes for his hands were soft and his nails well cared for we laid him in the bottom of the wagon and covered him over with a couple of sacks john cracked the whip and strode along by the side of the horses blanche moyat and i followed behind  she was unusually silent and once or twice i caught her glancing curiously at me as though she had something which it was in her mind to say but needed encouragement as we neared my cottage she asked me a question  why dont you want me to say that i saw this man in the village last night and that he asked for you mr ducaine i cant understand what difference it makes he may have spoken to others besides me and then it is bound to be known what harm can it do you  i cannot explain how i feel about it i answered i am not sure that i know myself only you must see that if it were known that he set out from the village last night to call upon me people might say unpleasant things  she lowered her voice  you meanthat they might suspect you of killing him  why not nobody knows much about me here and it would seem suspicious it was i who found him and only a few hundred yards from my cottage if it were known that he had left the village last night to see me dont you think that it would occur to any one to wonder if we had metand quarrelled there could be no proof of course but the mere suggestion is unpleasant enough we were in the middle of the open road and the wagon was several yards in front nevertheless she drew a little closer to me and almost whispered in my ear  do you know who he is what he wanted to see you about  i have no idea i answered i am quite sure that i never saw him before in my life  did you see him last night she asked  not to speak to i answered i did catch just a glimpse of him i believe in rather a strange way but that was all  what do you mean  i saw him looking in through my window but he came no nearer lady angela and colonel ray were in the room  in your room  yes colonel ray called to say that he was sorry to have spoilt my lecture  and lady angela  yes  she came in too  the girls openmouthed curiosity irritated me  i happened to be ill when colonel ray came they were both very kind to me  this man then she continued he looked in and went away  i suppose so i answered i saw no more of him  she turned towards me breathlessly  i dont see how a fall could have killed him or how he could have wandered off into the marshes just there the creek isnt nearly deep enough to have drowned him unless he had walked deliberately in and lain down he was quite sober too when he spoke to me mr ducaine how did he die what killed him  i shook my head  if i could answer you these questions i said i should feel much easier in my own mind but i cannot i know no more about it than you do  we were both silent for a time but i saw that there was a new look in her face it was a welcome relief when a groom from rowchester overtook us and pulled up his horse by our side  are you mr ducaine sir he asked touching his hat  yes i answered  i have a note for you from his grace sir he said i was to take back an answer if i found you at home  he handed it to me and i tore it open it contained only a few lines in a large sprawling handwriting  rowchester wednesday morning  the duke of rowchester presents his compliments to mr ducaine and would be much obliged if he could make it convenient to call upon him at rowchester between three and four oclock this afternoon  i folded the note up and turned to the groom  will you tell his grace i said that you found me on the road and i was unable therefore to write my answer but i will call at the time he mentions  the man touched his hat and rode away blanche moyat who had been standing a few yards off rejoined me  has the duke sent for you to go there she asked with obvious curiosity  yes he has offered to lend me the village hall i told her i expect that is what he wants to see me about  she tossed her head  you didnt tell me so just now when i told you that father had offered to speak about it she remarked  i am afraid i said gravely my mind was full of more serious matters  she said no more until we reached the front of the moyats house then she did not offer me her hand but she stood quite close to me and spoke in an unnaturally low tone  you wish me then she said not to mention about that manhis asking the way to your cottage  it seems quite unnecessary i answered and it would only mean that i should be bothered with questions which i could not answer  very well she said goodbye  i shuddered to myself as i followed the wagon down the narrow street towards the police station a strange reserve had crept into her manner during the latter portion of our walk there was something in her mind which she shrank from putting into words did she believe that i was responsible for this grim tragedy which had so suddenly thrown its shadow over my humdrum little life    chapter v  the graciousness of the duke  at a quarterpast three that afternoon i was ushered into the presence of the duke of rowchester i had never seen him before and his personality at once interested me he was a small man greyhaired keeneyed clean shaven he received me in a somewhat bare apartment which he alluded to as his workroom and i found him seated before a desk strewn with papers he rose immediately at my entrance and i could feel that he was taking more than usual note of my appearance  you are mr ducaine he said holding out his hand i am very glad to see you  he motioned me to a chair facing the window a great uncurtained affair through which the north light came flooding in whilst he himself sat in the shadows  i trust he said that you have quite recovered from your last nights indisposition my daughter has been telling me about it  quite thank you i answered lady angela and colonel ray were very kind to me  he nodded and then glanced at the papers on his desk  i have been going through several matters connected with the estate mr ducaine he said and i have come across one which concerns you  the proposed lease of the grange i remarked  exactly it seems that you arranged a three years tenancy with mr hulshaw my agent and were then not prepared to carry it out  it was scarcely my own fault i interposed i explained the circumstances to mr hulshaw i was promised two pupils if i took a suitable house in this neighbourhood but after all my plans were concluded their father died unexpectedly and their new guardian made other arrangements  exactly the duke remarked the only reason why i have alluded to the matter is that i disapprove of the course adopted by my agent who i believe enforced the payment of a years rent from you  he was within his rights your grace i said  he may have been the duke admitted but i consider his action arbitrary not only that but it was unnecessary for he has already found another tenant for the place i have instructed him therefore to send you a cheque for the amount you paid him less the actual cost of preparing the lease  now my entire capital at that moment was something under three shillings a gift of fifty pounds therefore which after all was not a gift but only the just return of my own money was more than opportuneit was heavensent if i could have given way to my feelings i should have sprung up and wrung the little mans hands as it was however i expect my face betrayed my joy your grace is exceedingly kind i told him the money will be invaluable to me just now  the duke inclined his head  i am only sorry he said that hulshaw should have exacted it it shows how impossible it is to leave the conduct of ones affairs wholly in the hands of another person now there is a further matter mr ducaine concerning which i desired to speak to you i refer to your projected lecture last night  i beg that your grace will not allude to it i said hastily it is really of very little importance the duke had a habit which i began at this time to observe he appeared to enter into all discussions with his mind wholly made up upon the subject and any interruptions and interpolations he simply endured with patience and then continued on his way without the slightest reference to them he sat during my remark with halfclosed eyes and when i had finished he went on wholly ignoring it  this is a strange little corner of the world he said and the minds of the people here are for the most part like the minds of little children they need forming i have heard some remarks concerning the war from one or two of my tenants which have not pleased me accordingly while colonel ray was here i thought it an excellent opportunity to endeavour to instruct them as to the real facts of the case it was not until after the affair was arrangednot indeed until i was actually in the hallthat i heard of our misfortune in selecting the evening which you had already reserved for your own lecture i trust that you will allow me to offer you the free use of the hall for any other date which you may select my people here and i myself shall esteem it a pleasure to be amongst your audience  i was quite overwhelmed i could only murmur my thanks the duke went on to speak for a while on general matters and then skilfully brought the conversation back again to myself and my own affairs before i knew where i was i found myself subjected to a close and merciless crossexamination my youth my college career my subsequent adventures seemed all to be subjects of interest to him and i although every moment my bewilderment increased answered him with the obedience of a schoolboy  it came to an end at last i found myself confronted with a question which if i had answered it truthfully must have disclosed my penniless condition i rose instead to my feet  your grace will excuse me i said but i am taking up too much of your time it is not possible that these small personal details can be of any interest to you  he waved me back to my chair which i did not however immediately resume i was not in the least offended the dukes manner throughout and the framing of his questions had been too tactful to awaken any resentment but i had no fancy for exposing my illluck and friendless state to any one i was democrat enough to feel that a crossexamination which would have been impertinent in anybody else was becoming a little too personal even from the duke of rowchester  sit down mr ducaine he said i do not blame you for resenting what seems to be curiosity but you must take my word for it that it is nothing of the sort i can perhaps explain myself better by asking you still another sort of question are you in a position to accept a post of some importance  i looked at him in surprise as well i might  sit down mr ducaine he repeated i have said enough i hope to prove that i am not trifling with you  you have managed at any rate to surprise me very much your grace i said i am eager to receive employment of any sort may i ask what it was that you had in view  he shook his head slowly  i cannot tell you today he said it is a matter upon which i should have to consult others  a sudden thought struck me  may i ask at whose suggestion you thought of me i asked  it was colonel ray who pointed out certain necessary qualifications which you possess the duke answered i shall report to him and to some others the result of our conversation and i presume you have no objection to my making such inquiries as i think necessary concerning you  none whatever i answered  the duke rose to his feet i took up my cap  if colonel ray is in i said and it is not inconvenient i should be glad to see him for a moment  colonel ray left unexpectedly by the first train this morning the duke answered looking at me keenly  i gave no sign but my heart sank  if it is anything important i can give you his address he remarked  thank you i answered it is of no consequence  there was a moments silence it seemed to me that the duke was watching me with peculiar intentness  ray stayed with you late last night he remarked  colonel ray was very kind i answered  bythebye he said i hear that some stranger lost his life in the storm last night you found the body did you not  yes i answered there was a great deal of wreckage on the shore this morning  the duke nodded  it was no one belonging to the neighbourhood i understand he asked  the man was a stranger to all of us i answered  the duke stood with knitted brows he seemed on the point of asking me some other question but apparently he abandoned the idea he nodded again and rang the bell i was dismissed    chapter vi  lady angela gives me some advice  rowchester was a curious medley of a house a mixture of farmhouse mansion and castle added to apparently in every generation by men with varying ideas of architecture the front was low and irregular and a grey stone terrace ran the entire length with several rows of steps leading down into the garden on one of these as i emerged from the house lady angela was standing talking to a gardener she turned round at the sound of my footsteps and came at once towards me  she was bareheaded and looked as straight and slim as a dart i fancied that she could be no more than eighteen her figure and face were so girlish the quiet composure of her manner however and the subdued yet graceful ease of her movements were so suggestive of the great lady that it was hard to believe that she was indeed little more than a schoolgirl  i hope that you are better mr ducaine she said  thank you lady angela i have quite recovered i answered  she looked at me critically  i can assure you she said that you look a very different person you gave us quite a fright last night  i am ashamed to have been so much trouble i answered such a thing has never happened to me before  you must take more care of yourself she said gravely i hope that my father has expressed himself properly about the lecture  his grace has been very kind i answered he has promised me the free use of the hall at any time  of course she said i hope that you will give your lecture soon i am looking forward very much to hearing it this always seems to me such a quaint fascinating corner of the world that i love to read and hear all that people have to say about it  you are very kind i said but if you come i am afraid you will be bored the notes which i have put together are prepared for the comprehension of the village people  so much the better she declared i prefer anything which does not make too great a strain upon the intellect besides it is the very simplicity of this country which makes it so beautiful  yet it is a land i remarked of elusive charms  sometimes unless they are pointed out she replied by one who has the eye and ear for nature these are the hardest to appreciate only the other evening i was standing upon the cliffs and i thought what a dreary waste of marshes and sands the place was and then a single gleam of late sunshine seemed to transform everything there is hidden colour everywhere if one looks closely enough and i suppose it is true that the most beautiful things in the world are those which remain just below the surfacea little invisible until one searches for them bythebye mr ducaine she added if you are on your way home i can show you a path which will save you nearly half the distance  you are very kind lady angela i answered cannot i find it though without taking you out of your way  she smiled  you might she said but i walk down to the cliffs every afternoon i was just starting when you came it is quite a regular pilgrimage with me all day long we hear the sea but except from the upper windows we have no clear view of it this is the path  we crossed the park together all the while she talked to me easily and naturally of the country around the great antiquity of its landmarks the survival of many ancient customs and almost obsolete forms of speech at last we came to a small plantation through which we emerged on to the cliffs here to my surprise we came upon a quaintly shaped grey stone cottage almost hidden by the trees i had passed on the sands below many times without seeing it  rather a strange situation for a house is it not lady angela remarked my grandfather built it for an old pensioner but i do not think that it has been occupied for some time  it is marvellously hidden i said i never had the least idea that there was a house here at all  we stood now on the edge of the cliff and she pointed downwards  there is a little path there you see leading to the sands she said it saves you quite half the distance to your cottage if you do not mind a scramble you must take care just at first so many of the stones are loose  i understood that i was dismissed and i thanked her and turned away but she almost immediately called me back  mr ducaine  lady angela  her dark eyes were fixed curiously upon my face she seemed to be weighing something in her mind i had a fancy that when she spoke again it would be without that deliberationalmost restraintwhich seemed to accord a little strangely with the girlishness of her appearance and actual years she stood on the extreme edge of the cliff her slim straight figure outlined to angularity against the sky she remained so long without speech that i had time to note all these things the sunshine breaking through the thintopped pine trees lay everywhere about us a little brown feathered bird scarcely a dozen yards away sang to us so lustily that the soft feathers around his throat stood out like a ruff down below the sea came rushing on to the shingles  mr ducaine she said at last did my father make you any offer of employment this afternoon  it was a direct almost a blunt question i was taken by surprise but i answered her without hesitation  he made me no definite offer i said at the same time he asked me a great many questions for which he must have had some reason and he gave me the idea that subject to the approval of some others he was thinking of me in connection with some post  colonel ray was telling me she said how unfortunate you have been with your pupils i wonderdont you think perhaps that you might get some others  i have tried i answered so far i have not been lucky at present too i scarcely see how i could expect to get any for i have nowhere to put them i had to give up the lease of the grange and there is no house round here which i could afford to take  some portion of her delicate assurance had certainly deserted her her manner was almost nervous  if you could possibly find the pupils she said hesitatingly i should like to ask you a favour the manor farm on the other side of the village is my own and i should so like it occupied i would let it to you furnished for ten pounds a year there is a man and his wife living there now as caretakers they would be able to look after you  you are very kind i said again but i am afraid that i could not take advantage of such an offer  why not  i have no claim upon you or your father i answered we are almost strangers are we not i might accept and be grateful for employment but this is charity  a very conventional reply mr ducaine she remarked with faint sarcasm i gave you credit for a larger view of things  i found her still inexplicable she was evidently annoyed and yet she did not seem to wish me to be there was a cloud upon her face and a nervousness in her manner which i wholly failed to understand  if i were to tell you she said raising her eyes suddenly to mine that your acceptance of my offer would be a favourwould put me under a real obligation to you  i should still have to remind you i declared that as yet i have no pupils and it takes time to get them further i have arrived at that position when immediate employment if it is only as a breaker of stones upon the road is a necessity to me  she sighed  my father will offer you a post she said slowly  now you are a real samaritan lady angela i declared i only hope that it may be so  her face reflected none of my enthusiasm  you jump at conclusions she said coldly how do you know that the post will be one which you will be able to fill  if your father offers it to me i answered confidently he must take the risk of that  i was surprised at her speechperhaps a little nettled i was an honours man an exceptional linguist and twentyfive it did not seem likely to me that there was any post which the duke might offer which on the score of ability at any rate i should not be competent to fill  he will offer it you she said looking steadily downwards on to the sands below and you will accept it  i am sorry  sorry i exclaimed  very if i could find you those pupils i would she continued if i could persuade you to lay aside for once the pride which a man seems to think a part of his natural equipment it would make me very happy i  stop i interrupted you must explain this lady angela  she shook her head  explain is just what i cannot she said sadly that is what i can never do  i was completely bewildered now she was looking seaward her face steadily averted from mine as to her attitude towards me i could make nothing of it i could not even decide whether it was friendly or inimical did she want this post for some one else if so surely her influence with her father would be strong enough to secure it she had spoken to me kindly enough the faint air of reserve that she seemed to carry with her everywhere which coupled with a certain quietness of deportment appeared to most of the people around to indicate pride had for these few minutes at any rate been lifted she had come down from the clouds and spoken to me as any other woman to any other man and now she had wound up by throwing me into a state of hopeless bewilderment  lady angela i said i think that you owe me some explanation if you can assure me that it is in any way against your wishes if you will give me the shadow of a reason why i should refuse what has not yet been offered to mewell i will do it i will do it even if i must starve  a little forced smile parted her lips she looked at me kindly  i have said a great deal more than i meant to mr ducaine i think that it would have been better if i had left most of it unsaid you must go your own way i only wanted to guard you against disappointment  disappointment you think after all then  no that is not what i meant she interrupted i am sure that you will be offered the post and i am sure that you will not hesitate to accept it but nevertheless i think that it will bring with it great disappointments i will tell you this already three young men whom i knew very well have held this post and each in turn has been dismissed they have lost the confidence of their employers and though each i believe was ambitious and meant to make a career they have now a black mark against their name  you are very mysterious lady angela i said doubtfully  it is of necessity she answered perhaps i take rather a morbid view of things but one of them was the brother of a great friend of mine and they fear that he has lost his reason there are peculiar and painful difficulties in connection with this post mr ducaine and i think it only fair to give you this warning  you are very kind i said i only wish that the whole thing was clearer to me  she smiled a little sadly  at least she said let me give you one word of advice you will be brought into contact with many people whose integrity will seem to you a positive and certain thing nevertheless treat every one alike trust no one absolutely no one mr ducaine it is your only chance now go  her gesture of dismissal was almost imperative i scrambled down the path and gained the sands when i looked up she was still standing there the wind blew her skirts around her slim young limbs and her hair was streaming behind her her face seemed like a piece of delicate oval statuary her steady eyes seemed fixed upon some point where the clouds and sea meet she took no heed of she did not even see my gesture of farewell i left her there inscrutable a child with the face of a sphinx she had set me a riddle which i could not solve    chapter vii  colonel rays ring  the ring lay on the table between us colonel ray had not yet taken it up in grim silence he listened to my faltering words when i finished he smiled upon me as one might upon a child that needed humouring  so he said slipping the ring upon his finger you have saved me from the hangman what remains your reward eh  it may seem to you i answered hotly a fitting subject for jokes i am sorry that my sense of humour is not in touch with yours you are a great traveller and you have shaken death by the hand before for me it is a new thing the mans face haunts me i cannot sleep or rest for thinking of itas i have seen it dead and as i saw it alive pressed against my window that night who was he what did he want with me  how do you know ray asked that he wanted anything from you  he looked in at my window  he might have seen me enter  then i told him what i had meant to keep secret  he asked for me in the village he was directed to my cottage  ray had been filling his pipe his fingers paused in their task he looked at me steadily  how do you know that he asked  the person to whom he spoke in the village told me so  then why did that person not appear at the inquest  because i asked her not to i told him if she had given evidence the verdict must have been a different one  it seems to me he said quietly that you have acted foolishly if that young woman whoever she may be chooses to tell the truth later on you will be in an awkward position  if she had told the truth yesterday i answered the position would have been quite awkward enough let that go i want to know who that man was what he wanted with me  colonel ray shrugged his shoulders  my young friend he said have you come from braster to ask that question  to give you the ring and to ask you that question  how do you know that the ring is mine  i saw it on your finger when you were giving me wine  then you believe he said that i killed him  it is no concern of mine i cried hoarsely i do not want to know i do not want to hear but i tell you that the mans face haunts me he asked for me in the village i feel that he came to rowchester to see me and he is dead whatever he came to say or to tell me will be buried with him who was he tell me that  ray smoked on for a few moments reflectively  sit down sit down he said gruffly and do abandon that tragical aspect the creature was not worth all this agitation he lived like a dog and he died like one  it is true then i murmured  if you insist upon knowing ray said coolly i killed him there are insects upon which ones foot falls reptiles which one removes from the earth without a vestige of a qualm with a certain sense of relief he was of this order  he was a human being i answered  he was none the better for that ray declared i have known animals of finer disposition  you at least i said fiercely were not his judge you struck him in the dark too it was a cowardly action  ray turned his head then i saw that around his neck was a circular bandage  if it interests you to know it he remarked drily i was not the assailant but for the fact that i was warned it might have been my body which you came across on the sands i started a second too soon for our friendand our exchange of compliments sent him to eternity  it was in selfdefence then  scarcely that he would have run away if he could i decided otherwise  tell me who he was i insisted  ray shook his head  better for you not to know he remarked reflectively much better  my cheeks grew hot with anger  colonel ray i said this may yet be a serious affair for you why you should assume that i am willing to be a silent accessory to your crime i cannot imagine i insist upon knowing who this man was  you have come to london ray answered quietly to ask me this  i have told you before why i am here i answered i will not be put off any longer who was that man and what did he want with me  for a period of time which i could not measure but which seemed to me of great duration there was silence between us then ray leaned over towards me  i think he said that it is my turn to talk you have come to me like a hysterical schoolboy you seem ignorant of the primeval elements of justice after all it is not wonderful as yet you have only looked in upon life you look in but you do not understand you have called me a coward it is only a year or so since his majesty pinned a little cross upon my coatfor valour i won that for saving a mans life mind you he was a man he was a man and a comrade to save him i rode through a hell of bullets it ought to have meant death as a matter of fact it didnt that was my luck but you mustnt call me a coward ducaine it is an insult to my decoration  oh i know that you are brave enough i answered but this man was a poor weak creature a baby in your hands  so are the snakes we stamp beneath our feet he answered coolly yet we kill them in egypt i have been in more than one hot corner where we fought hand to hand i have killed men more than once i have watched them galloping up with waving swords and their fine faces ablaze with the joy of battle and all the time ones revolver went spit and the saddles were empty yet never once have i sent a brave man to his last account without regret enemy and fanatic though he was i am not a bloodthirsty man when i kill it is because necessity demands it as for that creature whom you found in the marshes well if there were a dozen such in this room now i would do my best to rid the earth of them take my advice dismiss the whole subject from your mind go back to braster and wait something may happen within the next twentyfour hours which will be very much to your benefit go back to braster and wait  you will tell me nothing then i asked it is treating me like a child i am not a sentimentalist if the man deserved death the matter is between you and your conscience but he came to rowchester to see me i want to know why  go back to rowchester and wait ray said i shall tell you nothing depend upon it that his business with you if he had any was evil business he and his whole brood left their mark for evil wherever they crawled  his name i asked  were there no papers upon him ray demanded  none  so much the better ray declared grimly now my young friend i have given you all the time i can spare beyond what i have said i shall say nothing if you had known me betteryou would not be here still  so i left him his words gave me no loophole of hope his silence was the silence of a strong man and i had no weapons with which to assail it i had wasted the money which i could ill afford on this journey to london certainly rays advice was good the sooner i was back in braster the better  from the station i had walked straight to rays house and from rays house i returned without any deviation direct to the great terminus for a man with less than fifty pounds in the world london is scarcely a hospitable city i caught a slow train and after four hours of jolting cold and the usual thirdclass miseries alighted at rowchester junction already i had started on the three mile tramp home my coat collar turned up as some slight protection against the drizzling rain when a twowheeled trap overtook me and mr moyat shouted out a gruff greeting he raised the waterproof apron and i clambered in by his side  been to sunbridge he inquired cheerfully  i have been to london i answered  you havent been long about it he remarked i saw you on the eighttwenty didnt i  i nodded  my business was soon over i said  ive been to sunbridge he told me went over with his grace my girl was talking about you the other night mr ducaine  i started  indeed i answered  seemed to think he continued that things had been growing a bit rough for you losing those pupils after youd been at the expense of taking the grange and all that you know  it was rather bad luck i admitted quietly  ive been wondering he continued with some diffidence whether youd care for a bit of work in my office just to carry you along till things looked up blanche she was set upon it that i should ask you anyway of course you being a college young gentleman might not care about it but theres times when any sort of a job is better than none eh  it is very kind of you mr moyat i answered and very kind of miss blanche to have thought of it a week ago i shouldnt have hesitated but within the last few days i have had a sort of offeri dont know whether it will come to anything but it may might i leave it open for the present  i think that mr moyat was a little disappointed he flicked the cob with the whip and looked straight ahead into the driving mist  just as you say he declared i aint particular in want of any one but im getting to find my own bookkeeping a bit hard especially now that my eyes aint what they were of course it would only be a thirty bob a week job but i suppose youd live on that all right unless you were thinking of getting married eh  i laughed derisively  married mr moyat i exclaimed why im next door to a pauper  theres such a thing he remarked thoughtfully if ones a steady sort of chap and means work as picking up a girl with a bit of brass now and then  i can assure you mr moyat i said as coolly as possible that anything of that sort is out of the question so far as i am concerned i should never dream of even thinking of getting married till i had a home of my own and an income  he seemed about to say something but checked himself we drove on in silence till we came to a dark pile of buildings standing a little way back from the road he moved his head towards it  they tell me braster grange is took after all he remarked mr hulshaw told me so this morning  i was very little interested but was prepared to welcome any change in the conversation  do you know who is coming there i asked  an american lady i believe name of lessing i dont know what strangers want coming to such a place im sure  i glanced involuntarily over my shoulder braster grange was a long grim pile of buildings which had been unoccupied for many years between it and the sea was nothing but empty marshland it was one of the bleakest spots along the coastto the casual observer nothing but an arid waste of sands in the summer a wilderness of desolation in the winter only those who have dwelt in those parts are able to feel the fascination of that great empty land a fascination potent enough but of slow growth mr moyats remark was justified  we drove into his stable yard and clambered down  youll come in and have a bit of supper mr moyat insisted  i hesitated i felt that it would be wiser to refuse but i was cold and wet and the thought of my fireless room depressed me so i was ushered into the long low diningroom with its old hunting prints and black oak furniture and best of all with its huge log fire mrs moyat greeted me with her usual negative courtesy i do not think that i was a favourite of hers but whatever her welcome lacked in impressiveness blanches made up for she kept looking at me as though anxious that i should remember our common secret more than once i was almost sorry that i had not let her speak  youve had swell callers again she remarked as we sat side by side at suppertime a carriage from rowchester was outside your door when i passed  ah hes a good sort is the duke mr moyat declared appreciatively a clever chap too hes a1 in politics and a firstclass business man chairman of the great southern railway company and on the board of several other city companies  i cant see what the gentry want to meddle with such things at all for mrs moyat said theres some as says as the dukes lost more than he can afford by speculations  the dukes a shrewd man mr moyat declared its easy to talk  if he hasnt lost money mrs moyat demanded why is rowchester castle let to that american millionaire why doesnt he live there himself  prefers the east coast mr moyat declared cheerfully more bracing and suits his constitution better ive heard him say so himself  that is all very well mrs moyat said but i cant see that rowchester is a fit country house for a nobleman what do you think mr ducaine  i was more interested in the discussion than anxious to be drawn into it so i returned an evasive reply mrs moyat nodded sympathetically  of course she said you havent seen the house except from the road but ive been over it many a time when mrs felton was housekeeper and the duke didnt come down so often and i say that its a poor place for a duke  well well mother we wont quarrel about it mr moyat declared rising from the table i must just have a look at the mare do you look after mr ducaine blanche  to my annoyance the retreat of mr and mrs moyat was evidently planned and accelerated by a frown from their daughter blanche and i were left alonewhereupon i too rose to my feet  i must be going i said looking at the clock  blanche only laughed and bade me sit down by her side  im so glad dad brought you in tonight she said did he say anything to you  what about  never mind she answered archly did he say anything at all  he remarked once or twice that it was a wet night i said  stupid she exclaimed you know what i mean  he did make me a very kind offer i admitted  she looked at me eagerly  well  i told him that i am expecting an offer of work of some sort from the duke of course it may not come in any case it was very kind of mr moyat  she drew a little closer to me  it was my idea she whispered i put it into his head  then it was very kind of you too i answered  she was apparently disappointed  we sat for several moments in silence  then she looked around with an air of mystery and whispered still more softly into my ear  i havent said a word about thatto anybody  thank you very much i answered i was quite sure that you wouldnt as you had promised  again there was silence she looked at me with some return of that half fearsome curiosity which had first come into her eyes when i made my request  wasnt the inquest horrid she said father says they were five hours decidingand theres old joe hassell even now he wont believe thatthathe came from the sea  it isnt a pleasant subject i said quietly let us talk of something else  she was swinging a very much beaded slipper backwards and forwards and gazing at it thoughtfully  i dont know she said i cant help thinking of it sometimes i suppose it is terribly wicked to keep anything back like that isnt it  if you feel that i answered you had better go and tell your father everything  she looked at me quickly  now youre cross she exclaimed im sure i dont know why  i am not cross i said but i do not wish you to feel unhappy about it  i dont mind that she answered lifting her eyes to mine if it is better for you  the door opened and mr moyat appeared blanche was obviously annoyed i was correspondingly relieved i rose at once and took my leave  blanche got you to change your mind he said looking at me closely  miss moyat hasnt tried i answered shaking him by the hand we were talking about something else  blanche pushed past her father and came to let me out we stood for a moment at the open door she pointed down the street  it was just there he stopped me she said in a low tone he was very pale and he had such a slow strange voice just like a foreigner it was in the shadow of the markethall there i wish id never seen him  a note of real fear seemed to have crept into her voice her eyes were straining through the darkness i forced a laugh as i lit my cigarette  you mustnt get fanciful i declared men die every day you know and i fancy that this one was on his last legs goodnight  her lips parted as though in an answering greeting but it was inaudible as i looked round at the top of the street i saw her still standing there in the little flood of yellow light gazing across towards the old markethall    chapter viii  a wonderful offer  on my little table lay the letter i expected large square and white i tore it open with trembling fingers the handwriting was firm and yet delicate i knew at once whose it was  rowchester tuesday  dear mr ducainemy father wishes me to say that he and lord chelsford will call upon you tomorrow morning between ten and eleven oclockwith best regards i am  yours sincerely  angela harberly  the letter slipped from my hands on to the table lord chelsford was a cabinet minister and a famous man what could he have to do with any appointment which the duke might offer me i read the few words over and over again the handwriting the very faint perfume which seemed to steal out of the envelope a moments swift retrospective thought and my fancy had conjured her into actual life she was there in the room with me slim and shadowy with her quiet voice and movements and with that haunting doubtful look in her dark eyes what had she meant by that curious warning what was the knowledge or the fear which inspired it if one could only understand  i sat down in my chair and tried to read but the effort was useless directly opposite to me was that black uncurtained window every time i looked up it seemed to become once more the frame for a white evil face at last i could bear it no longer i rose and left the house i wandered capless across the marshes to where the wet seaweed lay strewn about and the long waves came rolling shorewards a wilderness now indeed of grey mists of dark silent tongues of seawater cleaving the land there was no windno other sound than the steadfast monotonous lapping of the waves upon the sands along that road he had come the faintly burning light upon my table showed where he had pressed his face against the window then he had wandered on past the stormbent tree at the turn of the road pointing landwards a few yards farther was the creek from which we had dragged him the events of the night struggled to reconstruct themselves in my mind and i fought against their slow coalescence i did not wish to rememberto believe in my heart i felt that for some hidden reason ray was my friend this visit of the dukes with whatever it might portend was without doubt inspired by him and on the other hand there was the warning of lady angela so earnestly expressed so solemn almost sad how could i see light through all these things how could i hope to understand  the duke came punctually spruce and debonnair a small rose in his buttonhole his wizened cheeks aglow with the smart of the stinging east wind with him came lord chelsford whose face and figure were familiar enough to me from the pages of the illustrated papers dark spare and tall he spoke seldom but i felt all the while the merciless investigation of his searching eyes the duke on the other hand seemed to have thrown aside some part of his customary reserve he spoke at greater length and with more freedom than i had heard him  you see mr ducaine he began i am not a man who makes idle promises i am here to offer you employment if you are open to accept a post of some importance and also to be frank with you of some danger  if i am qualified for the post your grace i answered i shall be only too willing to do my best but you must excuse me if i express exactly what is in my mind i am almost a stranger to you i am a complete stranger to lord chelsford how can you rely upon my trustworthiness you must have so many young men to choose from who are personally known to you why do you come to me  the duke smiled grimly  in the first place he said we are only strangers from the personal point of view which is possibly an advantage i have in my pocket a close record of your days since you entered the university i know those who have been your friends your tastes how you have spent your time dont be foolish young sir he added sharply as he saw the colour rise in my cheeks you will have a trust reposed in you such as few men have ever borne before this prying into your life is from no motives of private curiosity wait until you hear the importance of the things which i am going to say to you i was impressed into silence the duke continuedyou have heard my young friend he said of the committee of national defence i have read of it i answered  good this committee has been formed and sanctioned by the war office in consequence of the shocking revelations of inefficiency which came to light during the recent war it occurred to the prime minister as i dare say it did to most of the thinking men in the country that if our unreadiness to take the offensive was so obvious it was possible that our defensive precautions had also been neglected a board was therefore formed to act independently of all existing institutions and composed chiefly of military and naval men the commanderinchief lord cheisford colonel ray and myself are amongst the members our mandate is to keep our attention solely fixed upon the defences of the country to elaborate different schemes for repelling different methods of attack and in short to make ourselves responsible to the country for the safety of the empire every harbour on the south and east coast is supposed to be known to us every yard of railway feeding the seaports from london all the secret fortifications and places south of london capable of being held by inferior forces the mobilization of troops to any one point has been gone thoroughly into and every possible movement and combination of the fleet these are only a few of the things which have become our care but they are sufficient for the purpose of illustration the importance of this board must be apparent to you also the importance of absolute secrecy as regards its doings and movements  i was fascinated by the greatness of time subject however i answered him as quickly as possible and emphatically  the board the duke continued has been meeting in london for the last few months we have had business of the utmost importance on hand but on january 10 that is just six weeks ago we came to a full stop the commanderinchief had no alternative but temporarily to dissolve the assembly we found ourselves in a terrible and disastrous position lord ronald matheson had been acting as secretary for us we met always with locked doors and the names of the twelve members of the board are the most honoured in england yet twentyfour hours after our meetings a verbatim report of them with full particulars of all our schemes was in the hands of the french secret service  good god i exclaimed startled for the moment out of my respectful silence  the duke himself seemed affected by the revelation which he had made he sat forward in his chair with puckered brows and bent head his voice which had been growing lower and lower had sunk almost to a whisper it seemed to me that he made a sign to lord chelsford to continue almost for the first time the man who had done little since his entrance save watch me spoke  my own political career mr ducaine he said has been a long one but i have never before found myself confronted with such a situation even you can doubtless realize its effect the whole good of our work is undone if we cannot recommence and with different results i am afraid as an englishman to say what may happen war between england and france today would be like a great game of chess between two masters of equal strengthone having a secret knowledge of his opponents each ensuing move you can guess what the end of that would be our only hope is at once to reconstruct our plans we are hard at it now by day and by night but the time has arrived when we can go no further without a meeting and the actual committal to paper and diagram of our new schemes we have discussed the whole matter most carefully and we have come to the following decision we have reduced the number of the board by half those who have resigned with certain exceptions having done so by ballot we have decided that instead of holding our meetings at the war office they shall take place down here at the dukes house and so far as possible secretly then as regards the secretaryship no shadow of suspicion rests upon lord ronald any more than upon his predecessors but as you may have read in the newspapers he has temporarily lost his reason owing to the shock and has been obliged to go to a private home we have decided to engage some one absolutely without political connexions and whose detachment from political life must be complete you have had a warm advocate in colonel mostyn ray and subject to some stringent and absolute conditions i may say that we have decided to offer you the post  i looked from one to the other i have no doubt that i looked as bewildered as i felt  i am a complete stranger to all of you i murmured i am not deserving in any way of such a position  lord chelsford smiled  you underrate yourself young man he said drily or your college professors have wandered from the truth still your surprise is natural i admit i will explain a little further our choice is more limited than you might think at least fifty names were proposed all of them of young men of the highest character each one however had some possibly doubtful relative or association or custom in life it is evident that there is treachery somewhere in the very highest quarters these young men were sure to be brought into contact with it now it was rays idea to seek for some one wholly outside the diplomatic world living in a spot remote from london with as few friends as possible who would have no sentimental objections to the surveillance of detectives you appear to us to be suitable  it is a wonderful offer i exclaimed  in a sense it is lord cheisford continued the remuneration of course will be high but the post itself may not be a permanency and you will live all the time at high pressure the duke will place a small house at your disposal and it will be required that you form no new acquaintances without reference to him nor must you leave this place on any account without permission you will virtually be a prisoner and if certain of my suspicions are correct you may even find the post one of great physical danger on the other hand you will have a thousand a year salary and a sum of five thousand pounds in two years time if all is well  excitement seemed to have steadied my nerves i forgot all the minor tragedies which had been real enough things to face only a few hours ago i spoke calmly and decisively  i accept lord cheisford i said i shall count my life a small thing indeed against my fidelity  he drummed idly with his forefinger upon the table his eyes were wandering around the room absently his face was calm and expressionless  very well then he said my business here is settled i shall leave it with the duke to acquaint you with the practical details of your work and our arrangement  he rose to his feet the duke glanced at his watch  you have only just time for the train he remarked the car shall take you there i prefer to walk back and i have something further to say to mr ducaine  lord chelsford took leave of me briefly and the duke after accompanying him outside returned to his former seat i ventured upon an incoherent attempt to express my gratitude which he at once waved aside he leaned over the table and he fixed his eyes steadfastly upon me  i am able now he said to ask you a question postponed from the other day it is concerning the man who was found dead in the creek  his merciless eyes noted my start  ah he continued i can see that you know something i have my suspicions about this man you can now understand my interest when i hear of strangers in the neighbourhood i do not believe that he was a derelict from the sea do you  no i answered  he nodded  am i right he said in presuming that you know he was not  i know that he was not i admitted  his fingers ceased their beating upon the table his face became white and masklike  go on he said  i know that he came through braster and he asked for me he looked in through the window of my cottage when colonel ray was with me i saw him no more after that until i found him dead  ray left you after you had seen this mans face at the window  yes  the wounds about the mans head and body if he was not thrown up by the sea can you explain them  no i answered with a shudder  at the inquest it was not mentioned i think that he had been seen in the village  it was not i admitted most of the people were at colonel rays lecture he spoke to one girl a miss moyat  she did not give evidence  i thought i said in a low tone that she had better not  did you hear anything after ray left he asked suddenly  i could have cried out but my tongue seemed dry in my throat  there was a sound i muttered i fancied that it was a cry but i could not tell the wind was blowing and the sea and rain no i could not tell  he rose up  you appear he said drily to have discretion cultivate it it is a great gift i shall look for you at eleven oclock in the morning i am having a large house party this week and amongst them will be our friends  he left me without any further farewell and turned slowly homewards when he reached the bend in the road he paused and remained there for several moments motionless his eyes were fixed upon the small creek he seemed to be measuring the distance between it and the road he was still lingering there when i closed the door    chapter ix  treachery  the sunlight was streaming through the window when at last my pen ceased to move i rubbed my eyes and looked out in momentary amazement morning had already broken across the sea my greenshaded lamp was burning with a sickly light the moon had turned pale and colourless whilst i sat at my desk  i stretched myself and lighting a cigarette commenced to collect my papers immediately a dark figure rose from a couch in the farther corner of the room and approached me  can i get you anything sir  i turned in my chair the manservant whom the duke had put in charge of the brand my present habitation and who remained with me always in the room while i worked stood at my elbow  i would like some coffee grooton i said i am going to walk up to the house with these papers and i shall want a bath and some breakfast directly i get back  very good sir it shall be ready  i folded up the sheets and maps and placing them in an oilskin case tied them round my body under my waistcoat then i withdrew all the cartridges save one from the revolver which had lain all night within easy reach of my right hand and slipped it into my pocket  coffee ready grooton  in one moment sir  i watched him bending over the stove pale darkvisaged with the subdued manners and voice which mark the aristocracy of servitude my employers confidence in him must be immense for while he watched over me i was practically in his power  have you been long with the duke grooton i asked him  twentyone years sir i left his grace to go to lord chelsford who found me some work in london  secret service work wasnt it grooton  yes sir  interesting  some parts of it very interesting sir  i nodded and drank my coffee grooton was watching me with an air of respectful interest  you will pardon my remarking it sir but i hope you will try and get some sleep during the day you are very pale this morning sir  i looked at the glass and was startled at my own reflection this was only my third day and the responsibilities of my work were heavy upon me my cheeks were sunken and there were black rings around my eyes  i will lie down when i come back grooton i answered  outside the fresh morning wind came like a sudden sweet tonic to my jaded nerves i paused for a moment to face bareheaded the rush of it from the sea as i stood there drinking it in i became suddenly aware of light approaching footsteps some one was coming towards the cottage from the park  i did not immediately turn my head but every nerve in my body seemed to stiffen into quivering curiosity  the pathway was a private one leading from the house only to the brand and down the cliff to braster it was barely seven oclock and the footsteps were no labouring mans i think that i knew very well who it was that came so softly down the conestrewn path  we faced one another with little of the mask of surprise she came like a shadow flitting between the slender tree trunks out into the sunshine where for a moment she seemed wan and white her dark eyes flashed a greeting at me i stood cap in hand before her it was the first time we had met since i had taken up my abode at the brand  goodmorning mr ducaine she said you need not look at me as though i were a ghost i always walk before breakfast in the country  there is no better time i answered  you look as though you had been up all night she remarked  i had work to finish i told her  she nodded  so you would have none of my advice mr secretary she said softly coming a little nearer to me you are already installed  already at work i asserted  she glanced towards the brand  i hope that you are comfortable she said a couple of hours is short notice in which to make a place habitable  grooton is a magician i told her he has arranged everything  he is a wonderful servant she said thoughtfully  a whitewinged bird floated over our heads and drifted away skywards she followed it with her eyes  you wonder at seeing me so early she murmured dont you think that it is worth while nothing ever seems so sweet as this first morning breeze  i bowed gravely she was standing bareheaded now at the edge of the cliff watching the flight of the bird it was delightful to see the faint pink come back to her cheeks with the sting of the salt wind nevertheless i had an idea in my mind that it was not wholly for her healths sake that lady angela walked abroad so early  tell me she said presently have you had a visitor this morning  what at this hour i exclaimed  there are other early risers besides you and me she said the spinney gate was open so some one has passed through  i shook my head  i have not seen or heard a soul i told her i have just finished some work and i am on my way up to the house with it  you really mean it she persisted  of course i do i answered her grooton is the only person i have spoken to for at least nine hours why do you ask  she hesitated  my window looks this way she said and i fancied that i saw some one cross the park while i was dressing the spinney gate was certainly open  then i fancy that it has been open all night i declared for to the best of my belief no one has passed through it save yourself may i walk with you back to the house lady angela there is something which i should very much like to ask you  she replaced her hat which she had been carrying in her hand i stood watching her deft white fingers flashing amongst the thick silky coils of her hair the extreme slimness of her figure seemed accentuated by her backward poise yet perhaps i had never before properly appreciated its perfect gracefulness  i was going farther along the cliffs she said but i will walk some of the way back with you one minute  she stood on the extreme edge and shading her eyes with her hand she looked up and down the broad expanse of sanda great untenanted wilderness i wondered for whom or what she was looking but i asked no question in a few moments she rejoined me and we turned inland  well she said what is it that you wish to say  lady angela i began a few weeks ago there was no one whose prospects were less hopeful than mine thanks to your father and colonel ray all that is changed today i have a position i am proud of and important work yet i cannot help always remembering this i am holding a post which you warned me against accepting  well  i am very curious i said i have never understood your warning i believe that you were in earnest was it that you believed me incapable or untrustworthy or  you appear to me she murmured to be rather a curious person  i bent forward and looked into her face there was in her wonderful eyes a glint of laughter which became her well she walked with slow graceful ease her hands behind her her head almost on a level with my own i found myself studying her with a new pleasure then our eyes met and i looked away momentarily confused was it my fancy or was there a certain measure of rebuke in her cool surprise a faint indication of her desire that i should remember that she was the lady angela harberly and i her fathers secretary i bit my lip she should not catch me offending again i determined  you must forgive me i said stiffly but your warning seemed a little singular if you do not choose to gratify my curiosity it is of no consequence  since you disregarded it she remarked lifting her dress from the dewladen grass on to which we had emerged it does not matter does it only you are very young and you know little of the world lord ronald was your predecessor and he is in a lunatic asylum no one knows what lies behind certain unfortunate things which have happened during the last months there is a mystery which is as yet unsolved  i smiled  in your heart you are thinking i said that such an unsophisticated person as myself will be an easy prey to whatever snares may be laid for me is it not so  she looked at me with uplifted eyebrows  others of more experience have been worsted she remarked calmly why not you  if that is a serious question i said i will answer it perhaps my very inexperience will be my best friend  yes  those before me i continued have thought that they knew whom to trust i knowing no one shall trust no one  not even me she asked half turning her head towards me  not even you i answered firmly  a mans figure suddenly appeared on the left i looked at him puzzled wondering whence he had come  here is your good friend colonel mostyn ray she remarked with a note of banter in her tone what about him  not even colonel mostyn ray i answered the notes which i take with me from each meeting are to be read over from my elaboration at the next nobody is permitted to hold a pen or to make a note whilst they are being read afterwards i have your fathers promise that not even he will ask for even a cursory glance at them i deliver them sealed to lord chelsford  ray came up to us his dark eyebrows were drawn close together and i noticed that his boots were clogged with sand he had the appearance of a man who had been walking far and fast  you keep up your good habits lady angela he said raising his cap  it is my only good one so i am loth to let it go she answered if you were as gallant as you appear to be energetic she added glancing at his boots you would have stopped when i called after you and taken me for a walk  his eyes shot dark lightnings at her  i did not hear you call he said  you had the appearance of a man who intended to hear nothing and see nothing she remarked coolly never mind there will be no breakfast for an hour yet you shall take me on to braster hill come  they left me at a turn in the path i saw their heads close together in earnest conversation i went on towards the house  i entered by the back and made my way across the great hall which was still invaded by domestics with brushes and brooms taking a small key from my watchchain i unfastened the door of a room almost behind the staircase and pushed it open the curtains were drawn and the room itself therefore almost in darkness i carefully locked myself in and turned up the electric light  the apartment was a small one and contained only a few pieces of heavy antique furniture behind the curtains were iron shutters in one corner was a strong safe i walked to it and for the first time i permitted myself to think of the combination word slowly i fitted it together and the great door swung open  there were several padlocked dispatchboxes and on a shelf above a bundle of folded papers i took this bundle carefully out and laid it on the table before me i was on the point of undoing the red tape with which it was tied when my fingers became suddenly rigid i stared at the packet with wideopen eyes i felt my breath come short and my brain reeling the papers were there sure enough but it was not at them that i was looking it was the double knot in the pink tape which fascinated me    chapter x  an expression of confidence  i have no exact recollection of how long i spent in that little room after a while i closed the door safe and reset the combination lock with trembling fingers then i searched all round but could find no traces of any recent intruder i undid the heavy shutters and let in a stream of sunshine outside ray and lady angela were strolling up and down the terrace i watched the latter with fascinated eyes it was from her that this strange warning had come to me this warning which as yet was only imperfectly explained what did she know whom did she suspect was it possible that she a mere child had even the glimmering of a suspicion as to the truth my eyes followed her every movement she walked with all the lightsome grace to which her young limbs and breeding entitled her her head elegantly poised on her slender neck her face mostly turned towards her companion to whom she was talking earnestly even at this distance i seemed to catch the inspiring flash of her dark eyes to follow the words which fell from her lips so gravely and as i watched a new idea came to me i turned slowly away and went in search of the duke  i found him sitting fully dressed in an anteroom leading from his bedroom with a great pile of letters before him and an empty postbag he was leaning forward his elbow upon the table his head resting upon his right hand engrossed as i was with my own terrible discovery i was yet powerfully impressed by his unfamiliar appearance in the clear light which came flooding in through the north window he seemed to me older and his face more deeply lined than any of my previous impressions of him had suggested his eyes were fixed upon the mass of correspondence before him most of which was as yet unopened and his expression was one of absolute aversion at my entrance he looked up inquiringly  what do you want ducaine he asked  i am sorry to have disturbed your grace i answered i have come to place my resignation in your hands  his face was expressive enough in its frowning contempt but he said nothing for a moment during which his eyes met mine mercilessly  so you find the work too hard eh he asked  the work is just what i should have chosen your grace i answered i like hard work and i expected it the trouble is that i have succeeded no better than lord ronald  my words were evidently a shock to him he half opened his lips but closed them again i saw the hand which he raised to his forehead shake  what do you mean ducaine speak out man  the safe in the study has been opened during the night i said our map of the secret fortifications on the surrey downs and plans for a camp at guilford have been examined  how do you know this  i tied the red tape round them in a peculiar way it has been undone and retied the papers have been put back in a different order  the duke was without doubt agitated he rose from his chair and paced the room restlessly  you are sure of what you say ducaine he demanded turning and facing me suddenly  absolutely sure your grace i answered  he turned away from me  in my own house under my own roof i heard him mutter good god  i had scarcely believed him capable of so much feeling when he resumed his seat and former attitude i could see that his face was almost gray  this is terrible news he said i am not at all sure though mr ducaine that any blame can attach itself to you  your grace i answered there were three men only who knew the secret of that combination one is yourself another colonel ray the third myself i set the lock last night i opened it this morning i ask you in the name of common sense upon whom the blame is likely to fall if i remain this will happen again i cannot escape suspicion it is not reasonable  the word was a common one the duke said half to himself some one may have guessed it  your grace i said is it likely that any one would admit the possibility of such a thing  it may have been overheard  it has never been spoken i reminded him it was written down glanced at by all of us and destroyed  the duke nodded  you are right he admitted the inference is positive enough the safe has been opened between the hours of ten at night and seven oclock this morning by  by either myself colonel ray or your grace i said  i am not sure that i am prepared to admit that the duke objected quietly  it is inevitable i declared  only the very young use that word the duke said drily  i spoke only of what others must say i answered  it is a cul de sac i admit the duke said nevertheless mr ducaine i am not prepared without consideration to accept your resignation i cannot see that our position would be improved in any way and in my own mind i may add that i hold you absolved from suspicion  i held myself a little more upright the duke spoke without enthusiasm but with conviction  your grace is very kind i answered gratefully but there are the others they know nothing of me it is inevitable that i should become an object of suspicion to them  the duke looked thoughtfully for several moments at the table before him then he looked up at me  ducaine he said i will tell you what i propose you have done your duty in reporting this thing to me your duty ends theremine begins the responsibility therefore for our future course of action remains with me you i presume are prepared to admit this  certainly your grace i answered  i see no useful purpose to be gained the duke continued in spreading this thing about i believe that we shall do better by keeping our own counsel you and i can work secretly in the matter i may have some suggestions to make when i have considered it more fully but for the present i propose that we treat the matter as a hallucination of yours we shall hear in due course if this stolen information goes across the water if it doeswell we shall know how to act  you mean this i asked breathlessly forgive me your grace but it means so much to me you believe that we are justified  why not the duke asked coldly it is i who am your employer it is i who am responsible to the country for these things you are responsible only to me i choose that you remain i choose that you speak of this matter only when i bid you speak  to me it was relief immeasurable the dukes manner was precise even cold yet i felt that he believed in me i scarcely doubted but that he had suspicions of his own i at any rate was not involved in them i could have wrung him by the hand but for the inappropriateness of such a proceeding so far as he was concerned i could see that the matter was already done with his attention was beginning to wander to the mass of letters before him  would you allow me to help your grace with your correspondence i suggested i have no work at present  the duke shook his head impatiently  i thank you he said my man of business will be here this morning and he will attend to them i will not detain you mr ducaine  i turned to leave the room but found myself face to face with a young man in the act of entering it  blenavon the duke exclaimed  how are you sir the newcomer answered sorry i didnt arrive in time to see you last night we motored from kings lynn and the whole of this respectable household was in bed  i knew at once who he was the duke looked towards me  ducaine he said this is my son lord blenavon  lord blenavons smile was evidently meant to be friendly but his expression belied it he was slightly taller than his father and his cast of features was altogether different his cheeks were pale almost sunken his eyes were too close together and they had the dimness of the roue or the habitual dyspeptic his lips were too full his chin too receding and he was almost bald  how are you mr ducaine he said awful hour to be out of bed isnt it and all for the slaying of a few fat and innocent birds let me see wasnt i at magdalen with you  i came up in your last year i reminded him  ah yes i remember he drawled terrible close worker you were too are you breakfasting down stairs sir  i think that i had better the duke said i suppose you brought some men with you  half a dozen lord blenavon answered including his royal highness  the duke thrust all his letters into his drawer and locked them up with a little exclamation of relief  i will come down with you he said mr ducaine you will join us  i would have excused myself for indeed i was weary and the thought of a bath and rest at home was more attractive but the duke had a way of expressing his wishes in a manner which it was scarcely possible to mistake and i gathered that he desired me to accept his invitation we all descended the stairs together    chapter xi  his royal highness  the long diningroom was almost filled with a troop of guests who had arrived on the previous day most of the men were gathered round the huge sideboard on which was a formidable array of silvercovered hotwater dishes places were laid along the flowerdecked table for thirty or forty i stood apart for a few moments whilst the duke was greeting some of his guests ray who was sitting alone motioned me to a place by him  come and sit here ducaine he said that is he added with a sudden sarcastic gleam in his dark eyes unless you still have what the novelists call an unconquerable antipathy to me i dont want to rob you of your appetite  i did not expect to see you down here again so soon colonel ray i answered gravely i congratulate you upon your nerves  ray laughed softly to himself  you would have me go shuddering past the fatal spot i suppose with shaking knees and averted head eh on the contrary i have been down on the sands for more than an hour this morning and have returned with an excellent appetite  i looked at him curiously  i saw you returning i said your boots looked as though you had been wading in the wet sand you were not there without a purpose  i was not he admitted i seldom do anything without a purpose  for a moment he abandoned the subject he proceeded calmly with his breakfast and addressed a few remarks to a man across the table a man with short cropped hair and beard and a shooting dress of sombre black  you are quite right he said turning towards me suddenly i had a purpose in going there i thought that the gentleman whose untimely fate has enlisted your sympathies might have dropped something which would have been useful to me  for the moment i forgot this mans kindness to me i looked at him with a shudder  if you are in earnest i said i trust that you were unsuccessful  i fancied that there was that in his glance which suggested the st bernard looking down on the terrier and i chafed at it  it would have been better for you he said grimly had my search met with better result  for me i repeated  for you yes the man came to see you if he had been alive you might have been in his toils by now he was a very cunning person and those who sent him were devils  how do you know these things i asked amazed  from the letters which i ripped from his coat he answered  he came to braster to see me then i exclaimed  precisely  and the letters which you took from himwere they addressed to me  they were  i was getting angry but ray remained imperturbable  i think i said you will admit that i have a right to them  not a shadow of a doubt of it he answered in fact it was so obvious that i destroyed them  destroyed my letters  precisely i chose that course rather than allow them to fall into your hands  you admit then i said that i had a right to them  indubitably but they do not exist  you read them without doubt you can acquaint me with their contents  some day he said i probably shall but not yet believe me or not as you choose but there are certain positions in which ignorance is the only possible safe state you are in such a position at the present moment  are you i asked my moral guardian  i have at least he said incurred certain responsibilities on your behalf you could no longer hold your present post and be in communication with the sender of those letters  my anger died away despite myself the mans strength and honesty of purpose were things which i could not bring myself to doubt i continued my breakfast in silence  bythebye he remarked presently you too my young friend were out early this morning  i was writing all night i answered i had documents to put in the safe  he shot a quick searching glance at me  you have been to the safe this morning then  i answered him with a composure at which i inwardly marvelled  certainly it was the object of my coming here  you entered the room with the duke was he in the study at that hour  no i went upstairs to him i had a question to ask  and you have met lord blenavon what do you think of him  we were at magdalen together for a term i answered he was good enough to remember me  ray smiled but he did not speak another word to me all the breakfasttime once i made a remark to him and his reply was curt almost rude i left the room a few minutes afterwards and came face to face in the hall with lady angela  i am glad mr ducaine she remarked that your early morning labours have given you an appetite you have been in to breakfast have you not  your father was good enough to insist upon it i answered  you have seen him already this morning then  for a few minutes only i explained i went up to his room  i trust so far that everything is going on satisfactorily she inquired raising her eyes to mine  i did not answer her at once i was engaged in marvelling at the wonderful pallor of her cheeks  so far as i am concerned i think so i said forgive me lady angela i added but i think that you must have walked too far this morning you are very pale  i am tired she admitted  there was a lounge close at hand she moved slowly towards it and sat down there was no spoken invitation but i understood that i was permitted to remain with her  do you know she said looking round to make sure that we were alone i dread these meetings of the council i have always the feeling that something terrible will happen i knew lord ronald very well and his mother was one of my dearest friends i am sure that he was perfectly innocent and today he is in a madhouse they say that he will never recover  i did not wish to speak about these things even with lady angela i tried to lead the conversation into other channels but she absolutely ignored my attempt  there is something about it all so grimly mysterious she said it seems almost as though there must be a traitor if not in the council itself in some special and privileged position  she looked up at me as though asking for confirmation of her views i shook my head  lady angela i said would you mind if i abstained from expressing any opinion at all it is a subject which i feel it is scarcely right for me to discuss  she looked at me with wideopen eyes a dash of insolence mingled with her surprise i do not know what she was about to say for at that moment the young man with the sombre shooting suit and closely cropped hair paused for a moment on his way out of the breakfastroom he glanced at me and i received a brief impression of an unwholesomelooking person with protuberant eyeballs thin lashes and supercilious mouth  i trust that the days entertainment will include something more than a glimpse of lady angela he said with a low bow  she raised her eyes it seemed to me who was watching her closely that she shrank a little back in her seat i was sure that she shared my instinctive dislike of the man  i think not she said perhaps you are expecting me to come down with the lunch and compliment you all upon your prowess  it would be delightful he murmured  she shook her head  there are too many of you and i am too few she said lightly besides shooting is one of the few sports with which i have no sympathy at all i shall try and get somewhere away from the sound of your guns  i myself he said am not what you call a devotee of the sport i wonder if part of the day one might play truant would lady angela take pity upon an unentertained guest  i should find it a shocking nuisance she said coolly besides it would not be allowed you will find that when my father has once marshalled you escape is a thing not to be dreamed of every one says that he is a perfect martinet where a days shooting is concerned  he smiled enigmatically we shall see he remarked as he turned away lady angela watched him disappear do you know who that is she asked me i shook my head some one french very french i remarked he should be she remarked that is prince henri de malors he represents the hopes of the royalists in france  it is very interesting i murmured may i ask is he an old family friend  our families have been connected by marriage she answered he and blenavon saw a great deal of one another in paris very much to the disadvantage of my brother i should think i believe that there was some trouble at the foreign office about it  it is very interesting i repeated  blenavon was very foolish she declared it was obviously a most indiscreet friendship for him and paris was his first appointment but i must go and speak to some of these people  she rose and left me a little abruptly i escaped by one of the side entrances and hurried back to my cottage    chapter xii  an accident  the prince accepted my most comfortable easy chair with an air of graceful condescension lady angela had already seated herself it was late in the afternoon and grooton was busy in the room behind preparing my tea  the prince did not care to shoot today lady angela explained and i have been showing him the neighbourhood incidentally i am dying for some tea and the prince has smoked all his cigarettes  the prince raised his hand in polite expostulation but he accepted a cigarette with a little sigh of relief  you have found a very lonely spot for your dwellinghouse mr ducaine he said you english are so fond of solitude  it suits me very well i answered for just now i have a great deal of work to do i am safely away from all distractions here  lady angela smiled at me  not quite so safe perhaps mr ducaine as you fondly imagined she remarked i am afraid that we disturbed you you look awfully busy  she glanced towards my writingtable it was covered with papers and a map of the southern counties leaned up against the wall the prince also was glancing curiously in the same direction  i have finished my work for the day i said rising if you will permit me i will put it away  grooton brought in tea the prince was politely curious as to the subject matter of those closely written sheets of paper  you are perhaps interested in literature mr ducaine he remarked  immensely i answered waving my hand towards my bookshelves  but you yourselfyou no doubt write  oh one tries i answered pouring out the tea  it may be permitted then to wish you success he remarked dryly  you are very good i answered  lady angela calmly interposed the prince ate buttered toast and drank tea with a bland affectation of enjoyment they rose almost immediately afterwards  you are coming up to the house this evening mr ducaine lady angela asked  i am due there now i answered if you will allow me i will walk back with you  the prince touched my arm as lady angela passed out before us  i am anxious mr ducaine he said looking me in the face for a few minutes private conversation with you i shall perhaps be fortunate enough to find you at home tomorrow  he did not wait for my answer for lady angela looked back and he hastened to her side he seemed in no hurry however to leave the place the evening was cloudy and unusually dark a north wind was tearing through the grove of stunted firs and the roar of the incoming sea filled the air with muffled thunder the prince looked about him with a little grimace  it is indeed a lonely spot he remarked one can imagine anything happening here did i not hear of a tragedy only the other daya man found dead  if you have a taste for horrors prince i remarked you can see the spot from the edge of the cliff here  the prince moved eagerly forward  i disclaim all such weakness he said but the little account which i read or did some one tell me of itah i forget but it interested me  i pointed downwards to where the creekriven marshes merged into the sands  it was therea little to the left of the white palings i said the man was supposed to have been cast up from the sea  he measured the distance with his eye i anticipated his remark  the tide is only halfway up now i said and on that particular night there was a terrible gale  nevertheless he murmured half to himself it is a long way was the man what you call identified mr ducaine  no  there were no letters or papers found upon him  none  the prince looked at me sharply  that he said softly was strange does it not suggest to you that he may have been robbed  i had not thought of it i answered the verdict i believe was simply found drowned  found drowned the prince repeated ah found drowned bythebye he added suddenly who did find him  i did i said coolly  you the prince peered at me closely through the dim light that he said reflectively is interesting  you find it so interesting i remarked that perhaps you could help to solve the question of the mans identity  he seemed startled  i he exclaimed but no why should you think that  i turned to join lady angela he did not immediately follow  why did you bring him i asked her softly you had some reason  he was making inquiries about you she answered secretly and openly i thought you ought to know and i could think of no other way of putting you on your guard  the prince of malors i murmured he surely would not stoop to play the spy  she was silent and moved a step or two farther away from the spot where he still stood as though absorbed his angular figure was clearly defined through the twilight against the empty background of space he was on the very edge of the cliff almost looking over  i know very little about him myself she said hurriedly but i have heard the others talk lord chelsford especially he is a man they say with a twofold reputation he has played a great part in the world of pleasure almost a theatrical part but you know the french people like that  it is true i murmured they love their heroes decked in tinsel she nodded  they say that it is part of a pose and that he has serious political ambitions he contemplates always some great scheme which shall make him the idol if only for a day of the french mob a day would be sufficient for he would strike whileprince be careful she called out ah  we heard a shrill cry and we saw the prince sway on the verge of the cliff he threw up his arms and clutched wildly at the air but he was too late to save himself we saw the ground crumble beneath his feet and with a second cry of despair he disappeared  grooton lady angela and i reached the edge of the cliff at about the same moment we peered over in breathless anxiety lady angela clutched my arm and for a moment i did not in the least care what had happened to the prince  dont be frightened i whispered the descent is not by any means sheer he cant possibly have got to the bottom i will clamber down and look for him  she shuddered  oh you mustnt she exclaimed it is not safe how terrible it looks down there  i raised my voice and shouted almost immediately there came an answer  i am here my friends in the middle of a bush i dare not move it is so dark i cannot see where to put my foot can you lower me a lantern and i will see if i can climb up  grooton hastened back to the cottage  i think you will be all right i cried out it is not half as steep as it looks  i believe he answered that i can see a path up but i will wait until the lantern comes  the lantern arrived almost immediately we lowered it to him by a rope and he examined the face of the cliff  i think that i can get up he cried out but i should like to help myself with the rope can you both hold it tightly  all right i answered weve got it  he clambered up with surprising agility but as he reached the edge of the cliff he groaned heavily  are you hurt lady angela asked  it is my foot he muttered my left foot i twisted it in falling  grooton and i helped him to the cottage he hobbled painfully along with tightly clenched lips  i shall have to ask for a pony cart to get up to the house i am afraid he said i am very sorry to give you so much trouble mr ducaine  the trouble is nothing i answered but i am wondering how on earth you managed to fall over the cliff  i myself i scarcely know he answered as he sipped the brandy which grooton had produced i am subject to fits of giddiness and one came over me as i stood there looking down i felt the ground sway and remember no more i am very sorry to give you tall this trouble but indeed i fear that i cannot walk  we will send you down a cart i declared you will have rather a rough drive across the grass but there is no other way  you are very kind he declared i am in despair at my clumsiness  i gave him my box of cigarettes lady angela hesitated  i think she said that i ought to stay with you prince while mr ducaine goes up for the cart  indeed lady angela you are very kind he answered but i could not permit it i regret to say that i am in some pain and i have a weakness for being alone when i suffer if i desire anything mr ducaines servant will be at hand  so we left him there at any other time the prospect of that walk with lady angela would have filled me with joy but from the first moment of leaving the cottage i was uneasy  what do you think of that man i asked her abruptly i mean personally  i hate him she answered coolly he is one of those creatures whose eyes and mouth and something underneath his most respectful words seem always to suggest offensive things i find it very hard indeed to be civil to him  do you happen to know what colonel ray thinks of him i asked her  i have no special knowledge of colonel rays likes or dislikes she answered  forgive me i said i thought that you and he were very intimate and that you might know i wonder whether he takes the prince seriously  colonel ray is one of my best friends she said but i am not in his confidence  a slight reserve had crept into her tone i stole a glance at her face paler and more delicate than ever it seemed in the gathering darkness her lips were firmly set but her eyes were kind a sudden desire for her sympathy weakened me  lady angela i said i must talk to some one i do not know whom to trust i do not know who is honest you are the only person whom i dare speak to at all  she looked round cautiously we were out of the plantation now in the open park where eavesdropping was impossible  you have a difficult post mr ducaine she said and you will remember  oh i remember i interrupted you warned me not to take it but think in what a position i was i had no career i was penniless how could i throw away such a chance  something has happenedthis morning has it not she asked  i nodded  yes  she waited for me to go on she was deeply interested i could hear her breath coming fast though we were walking at a snails pace i longed to confide in her absolutely but i dared not  do not ask me to tell you what it was i said the knowledge would only perplex and be a burden to you it is all the time like poison in my brain  we were walking very close together i felt her fingers suddenly upon my arm and her soft breath upon my cheek  but if you do not tell me everythinghow can you expect my sympathy perhaps my help  i may not ask you for either i answered sadly the knowledge of some things must remain between your father and myself  between my fatherand yourself she repeated  i was silent and then we both started apart behind us we could hear the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching soft quick footsteps muffled and almost noiseless upon the spongy turf we stood still    chapter xiii  a bribe  i wheeled round and peered into the darkness lady angelas fingers clutched my arm i could feel that she was trembling violently it was grooton whose figure loomed up almost immediately before usgrooton bareheaded and breathless what is it i exclaimed quickly i think sir that you had better return he panted  he pointed over his shoulder towards the brand and i understood in a moment i was on my way thither running as i had not done since my college days i stumbled over antheaps and more than once i set my foot in a rabbit hole but somehow i kept my balance as i neared the cottage i slackened my speed and proceeded more stealthily i drew close to the window and peered in grooton had been right indeed to fetch me the prince was standing before my desk with a bundle of papers in his hand i threw open the door and entered the room swift though my movement had been a seconds difficulty with the catch had given the prince his opportunity he was back in his easy chair when i entered reclining there with halfclosed eyes he looked up at me with well simulated surprise  you are soon back mr ducaine he remarked calmly did you forget something  i forgot i answered struggling to recover my breath to lock up my desk  an admirable precaution he admitted watching as i gathered my papers together especially if one has valuables it is an exposed spot this and very lonely  i am curious i said leaning against the table and facing him i am curious to know which of my poor possessions can possibly be of interest or value to the prince of malors  the calm hauteur of his answering stare was excellently done i had a glimpse now of the aristocrat  you speak in enigmas young man he said kindly be more explicit  my language can scarcely be more enigmatic than your actions i answered i was fool enough to trust you and i left you here alone but you were not unobserved prince my servant i am thankful to say is faithful it was he who summoned me back  indeed he murmured  i might add i continued that i took the liberty of looking in through the side window there before entering  if it amused you to do so or to set your servant to spy upon me he said i see no reason to object but your meaning is still unexplained  the onus of explanation i declared appears to me to rest with you prince i offered the hospitality of my room presumably to a gentlemannot to a person who would seize that opportunity to examine my private papers  you speak with assurance mr ducaine  the assurance of knowledge i answered i saw you at my desk from outside  you should consult an oculist he declared i have not left this chair my foot is still too painful  you lie well prince i answered but not well enough  he looked at me thoughtfully  i am endeavouring he said to accommodate myself to the customs of this wonderful country of yours in france one sends ones seconds what do you do here to a man who calls you a liar  we treat him i answered hotly as the man deserves to be treated who abuses the hospitality of a stranger and places himself in the position of a common thief  the prince shrugged his shoulders lightly and helped himself to one of my cigarettes  you are very young mr ducaine he said looking at me thoughtfully you have no doubt your career to make in the world so in a greater sense of the word have i i propose if you will allow me to be quite frank with you  i have no wish for your confidences prince i answered they cannot possibly concern or interest me  do not be too sure of that he said like all young men of your age you jump too readily at conclusions it is very possible that you and i may be of service to one another and i may add that those who have been of service to the prince of malors have seldom had cause to regret it  this conversation i interposed seems to me to be beside the point i have no desire to be of service to you my inclinations are rather the other way  the matter may become more clear to you if you will only curb your impatience my young friend the prince said it is only my ambition to serve my country to command the gratitude of a nation which today regards both me and mine with mingled doubt and suspicion i have ambitions and i should be an easy and generous master to serve  i am honoured with your confidence prince but i still fail to see how these matters concern me i said setting my teeth hard  with your permission i will make it quite clear he continued for years your war office has suffered from constant dread of an invasion by france the rumour of our great projected manoeuvres in the autumn have inspired your statesmen with an almost paralysing fear they see in these merely an excuse for marshalling and equipping an irresistible army within striking distance of your empire personally i believe that they are entirely mistaken in their estimate of my countrys intentions that however is beside the mark you follow me  perfectly i assured him this is most interesting although as yet it seems to me equally irrelevant  your war office the prince continued has established a secret council of defence whose only task it is to plan the successful resistance to that invasion if ever it should take place you mr ducaine are i believe practically the secretary of that council you have to elaborate the digests of the meetings to file schemes for the establishment of fortifications and camps in a word the result of these meetings passes through your hands i will not beat about the bush mr ducaine you can see that you have something in your keeping which if passed on to me would accomplish my whole aim the army would be forced to acknowledge my claim upon them the nation would hear of it  well i asked supposing all you say is true what then  you are a little obtuse mr ducaine the prince said softly if twenty thousand pounds would quicken your understanding  i picked up a small inkpot from the side of the table and hurled it at him he sprang aside but it caught the corner of his forehead and he gave a shrill cry of pain he struck a fierce blow at me which i parried and a moment later we were locked in one anothers arms i think that we must have been of equal strength for we swayed up and down the room neither gaining the advantage till i felt my breath come short and my head dizzy nevertheless i was slowly gaining the mastery my grasp upon his throat was tightening i had hold of his collar and tie and i could have strangled him with a turn of my wrist just then the door opened there was a quick exclamation of horrified surprise in a familiar tone i threw him from me to the ground and turned my head it was lady angela who stood upon the threshold    chapter xiv  a reluctant apology  lady angela looked at us both in cold surprise  mr ducaine prince she exclaimed what is the meaning of this extraordinary exhibition  the prince whose sangfroid was marvellous rose to his feet and began to wipe his forehead with a spotless cambric handkerchief  my dear lady angela he said i am most distressed that you should have been a witness of thisextraordinary incident i have been trying to adapt myself to the methods of your country but alas i cannot say that i am enamoured of them here it seems that gentlemen who differ must behave like dustmen will you pardon me if i turn my back to you for a moment i see a small mirror and i am convinced that my tie and collar need readjustment  but why quarrel at all she exclaimed mr ducaine she added turning coolly to me i trust you have remembered that the prince is my fathers guest  i was speechless but the prince himself intervened  the blame if any he declared was mine mr ducaine appeared to misunderstand me from the first i believe that his little ebullition arose altogether from too great zeal on behalf of his employers i congratulate him upon it while i am bound to deprecate his extreme measures  and you mr ducaine she asked turning towards me what have you to say  nothing i declared stung by her tone and manner as much as by his coolness except that i found the prince of malors meddling with my private papers and subsequently i interrupted him in the offer of a bribe  the prince smoothed his necktie which he had really tied very well complacently  the personal belongings of mr ducaine he said calmly are without interest to me i fancy that the prince of malors can ignore any suggestions to the contrary as for the bribe mr ducaine talks folly i am not aware that he has anything to sell and i decline to believe him a blackmailer i prefer to look upon him as a singularly hotheaded and not overintelligent person who takes very long jumps at conclusions lady angela i find my foot much better may i have the pleasure of escorting you to the house  i held my tongue knowing very well that the prince played his part solely that i might be entrapped into speech but lady angela seemed puzzled at my silence she looked at me for a moment inquiringly out of her soft dark eyes i made no sign she turned away to the prince  if you are sure that you can walk without pain she said we will not trouble you mr ducaine she added as i moved to open the door  so they left me alone and i was not sure whether the honours remained with him or with me he had never for a moment lost his dignity nor had he even looked ridiculous when calmly rearranging his tie and collar i laughed to myself bitterly as i prepared to follow them i was determined to lay the whole matter before the duke at once  as i reached the terrace i saw a man walking up and down smoking a pipe he stood at the top of the steps and waited for me it was colonel ray he took me by the arm  i have been waiting for you ducaine he said i was afraid that i might miss you or i should have come down  i am on my way to the duke i said and my business is urgent  so is mine he said grimly i want to know exactly what has passed between you and the prince of malors  i am not at all sure colonel ray i answered that i am at liberty to tell you at any rate i think that i ought to see the duke first  his face darkened his eyes seemed to flash threatening fires upon me he was smoking so furiously that little hot shreds of tobacco fell from his pipe  boy he exclaimed there are limits even to my forbearance you are where you are at my suggestion and i could as easily send you adrift i do not say this as a threat but i desire to be treated with common consideration i appeal to your reason is it well to treat me like an enemy  whether you are indeed my friend or my enemy i am not even now sure i answered i am learning to be suspicious of every person and thing which breathes but as for this matter between the prince and myself it can make little difference who knows the truth he shammed a fall over the cliff and a sprained ankle lady angela and i started for the house to send a cart for him but before we were halfway across the park grooton fetched me back i found the prince examining the papers on which i had been working and when i charged him with it he offered me a bribe  and you  i struck him  ray groaned  you struck him and you had him in your powerto play with as you would and you struck him oh ducaine you are very very young i am your friend boy or rather i would be if you would let me but i am afraid that you are a blunderer  i faced him with white face  i seem to have found my way into a strange place i answered i have neither wit nor cunning enough to know true men from false i would trust you but you are a murderer i would have trusted the prince of malors but he has proved himself a common adventurer so i have made up my mind that all shall be alike i will be neither friend nor foe to any mortal but true to my country i go my way and do my duty colonel ray  he blew out dense volumes of smoke puffing furiously at his pipe for several minutes there seemed to be many things which he had it in his mind to say to me but as though suddenly altering his purpose he stood on one side  you shall go your own way he said grimly the lord only knows where it will take you  it took me in the first place to the duke to whom i recounted briefly what had happened i could see that my story at once made a deep impression upon him when i had finished he sat for several minutes deep in thought for the first time since i had known him he seemed nervous and ill at ease he was unusually pale and there were deep lines engraven about his mouth one hand was resting upon the table and i fancied that his fingers were shaking  the prince of malors he said at last and his voice lacked altogether its usual ring of cool assurance is of royal blood he is not even in touch with the political powers of france today he may have been guilty of a moments idle curiosity  your grace must forgive me i interrupted but you are overlooking facts the fall over the cliff was premeditated the sprained foot was a sham the whole affair was clearly planned in order that he might be left alone in my room besides there is the bribe  the duke folded his hands nervously together he looked away from me into the fire  it is a very difficult position he declared very difficult indeed the prince has been more than a friend to blenavon he has been his benefactor of course he will deny this thing with contempt let me think it out ducaine  by all means your grace i answered a little nettled at his undecided air so far as i am concerned my duty in the matter ends here i have told you the exact truth concerning it and it seems to me by no means improbable that the prince has been in some way responsible for those former leakages  the duke shook his head slowly  it is impossible he said  your grace is the best judge i answered  the prince was not in the house last night when the safe was opened he objected  he probably has accomplices i answered besides how do we know that he was not here  even if he were the duke said raising his head how could he have known the cipher  i made no answer at all it seemed useless to argue with a man who had evidently made up his mind not to be convinced  have you mentioned this matter to any one the duke asked  to colonel ray only your grace i answered  ray the duke was silent for a moment he was looking steadily into the fire you told ray what you have told me  in substance yes your grace in detail perhaps not so fully  and he  he did not doubt my story your grace i said quietly  the duke frowned across at me  neither do i ducaine he declared it is not a question of veracity at all it is a question of construction you are young and these things are all new to you the prince might have been trying you or something which you did not hear or have forgotten might throw a different light upon his actions and suggestion i beg that you will leave the matter entirely in my hands  i abandoned the subject then and there but as i left the room i came face to face with blenavon who was loitering outside he at once detained me his manner since the morning had altered he addressed me now with hesitation almost with respect  can you spare me a few minutes mr ducaine he asked i will not detain you long  i am at your service lord blenavon i answered we will go into the hall and have a smoke he suggested leading the way to me it seems the only place in the house free from draughts  i followed him to where in a dark corner of the great domeshaped hall a wide cushioned lounge was set against the wall he seated himself and motioned me to follow his example for several moments he remained silent twisting a cigarette with thin nervous fingers stained yellow with nicotine every now and then he glanced furtively around i waited for him to speak he was lady angelas brother but i disliked and distrusted him  he finally got his cigarette alight and turned to me  mr ducaine he said i want you to apologize to my friend the prince of malors for your behaviour this afternoon  apologize to the prince i exclaimed why should i  because this is the only condition on which he will consent to remain here  i should have thought i said that his immediate departure was inevitable i detected him in behaviour  that is just where you are wrong blenavon interrupted eagerly you were mistaken entirely mistaken  i laughed a little impolitely i am afraid considering that this was the son of my employer  you know the circumstances i asked he nodded  the prince has explained them to me it was altogether a misunderstanding he felt his foot a little easier and he was simply looking for a newspaper or something to read until you returned inadvertently he turned over some of your manuscript and at that moment you entered  most inopportunely i am afraid i answered with an unwilling smile i am sorry lord blenavon that i cannot accept this explanation of the princes behaviour i am compelled to take the evidence of my eyes and ears as final  blenavon sucked at his cigarette fiercely for a minute threw it away and commenced to roll another  its all rot he exclaimed malors wouldnt do a mean action and besides what on earth has he to gain he is a fanatical royalist he is not even on speaking terms with the government of france today  i perceive i remarked looking at him closely that you are familiar with the nature of my secretarial work  he returned my glance and it seemed to me that there was some hidden meaning in his eyes which i failed to catch  i am in my fathers confidence he said slowly  there was a moments silence i was listening to a distant voice in the lower part of the hall  am i to take it mr ducaine then he said at last that you decline to apologize to the prince  i have nothing to apologize for i answered calmly the prince was attempting to obtain information in an illicit manner by the perusal of papers which were in my charge  blenavon rose slowly to his feet his eyes were fixed upon the opposite corner of the hall lady angela who had just descended the stairs was standing there pale and unsubstantial as a shadow and it seemed to me that her eyes as she looked across at me were full of trouble she came slowly towards us blenavon laid his hand upon her arm  angela he said mr ducaine will not accept my word i can make no impression upon him perhaps he will the more readily believe yours  lady angela will not ask me to disbelieve the evidence of my own senses i said confidently  she stood between us i was aware from the first of something unfamiliar in her manner something of which a glimmering had appeared on our way home through the wood  it is about malors angela he continued you were there you know all that happened malors is very reasonable about it he admits that his actions may have seemed suspicious he will accept an apology from mr ducaine and remain  she turned to me  and you she asked  the idea of an apology i answered appears to me ridiculous my own poor little possessions were wholly at his disposal i caught him however in the act of meddling with papers which are mine only on trust  lady angela played for a moment with the dainty trifles which hung from her bracelet when she spoke she did not look at me  the princes explanation she said is plausible and he is our guest i think perhaps it would be wisest to give him the benefit of the doubt  doubt i exclaimed bewildered there is no room for doubt in the matter  then she raised her eyes to mine and i saw there new things i saw trouble and appeal and behind both the shadow of mystery  have you spoken to my father she asked  yes i answered  did he acceptyour view  he did not i answered bitterly i could not convince him of what i saw with my own eyes  you have done your duty then she said softly why not let the rest go as you told us just now this is not a personal matter and there are reasons why he did not wish the prince to leave suddenly  i was staggered i held my peace and the two stood watching me then i heard footsteps approaching us and a familiar voice  what trio of conspirators is this talking so earnstly in the shadows ah  the prince had seen me and he stood still i faced him at once  prince i said it has been suggested to me that my eyesight is probably defective it is possible in that case that i have not seen you before today that the things with which i charge you are false that in all probability you were in some other place altogether if this is so i apologize for my remarks and behaviour towards you  he bowed with a faint mirthless smile  it is finished my young friend he declared i wipe it from my memory it seemed to me that i could hear blenavons sigh of relief that the shadow had fallen from lady angelas face there was a little murmur of satisfaction from both of them but i turned abruptly and with scarcely even an attempt at a conventional farewell i left the house and walked homewards across the park    chapter xv  two fair callers  after three days the house party at rowchester was somewhat unexpectedly broken up lord chelsford departed early one morning by special train and the duke himself and the remainder of his guests left for london later on in the day i remained behind with three weeks work and a fear which never left me by day or by night yet the relief of solitude after the mysteries of the last few days was in itself a thing to be thankful for  for nine days i spoke with no one save grooton for an hour every afternoon and for rather longer at night i walked on the cliffs or the sands here on these lonely stretches of empty land i met no one saw no living thing save the seagulls it was almost like a corner of some forgotten land these walks and an occasional few hours reading were my sole recreation  it was late in the afternoon when i saw a shadow pass my window and immediately afterwards there was a timid knock at the door grooton had gone on his daily pilgrimage with letters to the village so i was obliged to open it myself to my surprise it was blanche moyat who stood upon the threshold she laughed a little nervously  im no ghost mr ducaine she said and i shant bite  forgive me i answered i was hard at work and your knock startled me please come in  i ushered her into my sittingroom she was wearing what i recognized as her best clothes and not being entirely at her ease she talked loudly and rapidly  such a stranger as you are mr ducaine she exclaimed fancy its getting on for a month since we any of us saw a sign of you and im sure never a week used to pass but fatherd be looking for you to drop in we heard that you were living here all by yourself and this morning mother said perhaps hes ill we tried to get father to come up and see but hes off to downham market today and goodness knows when hed find time if we left it to him so i thought id come and find out for myself  i am quite well thanks miss moyat i answered but very busy the duke has been giving me some work to do and he has lent me this cottage so that i shall be close at hand i should have looked you up the first time i came to braster but as a matter of fact i have not been there since the night of my lecture  she was nervously playing with the fastening of her umbrella and it seemed to me that her silence was purposeful i ventured some remark about the weather which she interrupted ruthlessly  its a mile and a half to our house from here she said not a step farther i dont see why you shouldnt have made a purpose journey  i ignored the reproach in her eyes as i had every right to do but i began to understand the reason of her nervousness and her best clothes and i prayed for grootons return  if i had had an evening to myself i said i should certainly have paid your father a visit but as it happens the duke has required me at the house every night while he was here and he has left me enough work to do to keep me busy night and day till he comes back  she looked down upon the floor  i had to come and see you she said in a low tone sometimes i cant sleep for thinking of it i feel that i havent done right  i knew of course what she meant  i thought we had talked all that out long ago i answered a little wearily you would have been very foolish if you had acted differently i dont see how else you could have acted  oh i dont know she said we were always brought up very particularespecially about telling the truth  well you havent said anything that wasnt the truth i reminded her  oh i dont know i havent said what i ought to say she declared it seems all right when you are with me and talk about it she continued slowly raising her eyes to mine its when i dont see you for weeks and weeks that it seems to get on my mind and i get afraid i dont understand it i dont understand it even now  dont understand what i repeated  she looked around her air of troubled mystery was only half assumed  how that man died she whispered  i can assure you that i did not kill him if that is what you mean i told her coolly the matter is over and done with i think that you are very foolish to give it another thought  she shuddered  men can forget those things easier she said perhaps he had a wife and children perhaps they are wondering all this time what has become of him  people die away from their homes and families every day every hour i answered it is only morbid to brood over one particular example  father would never forgive me if he knew she murmured irrelevantly he hates us to do anything underhand  i heard grooton return with a sigh of relief  you will have some tea i suggested  she shook her head and stood up i did not press her  no i wont she said i am sorry i came i dont understand you mr ducaine you seem to have changed altogether just these last few weeks i can see that you are dying to get rid of me now but you were glad enough to see me or at any rate you pretended to be once  my breath was a little taken away i looked at her in surprise her cheeks were flushed her voice had shaken with something more like anger than any form of pathos i was at a loss how to answer her and while i hesitated the interruption which i had been praying for came though from a strange quarter my door was pushed a few inches open and i heard lady angelas clear young voice  are you there mr ducaine may i come in  before i could answer she stood upon the threshold i saw the delightful little smile fade from her lips as she looked in she hesitated and seemed for a moment about to retreat  please come in lady angela i begged eagerly  she came slowly forward  i must apologize for my abominable country manners she said resting the tips of her fingers for a moment in mine i saw your door was not latched and it never occurred to me to knock  it was not necessary i assured her a front door which does not boast a knocker or a bell must expect to be taken liberties with but it is a great surprise to see you here i had no idea that any one was at rowchester or expected there except lord blenavon has the duke returned  she shook her head  i came down alone she answered i found london dull let me see i am sure that i know your face do i not she added turning to blanche moyat with a smile you live in braster surely  i am miss moyat blanche answered quietly  of course dear me i ought to have recognized you we have been neighbours for a good many years  i will wish you goodafternoon mr ducaine blanche said turning to me goodafternoonyour ladyship she added a little awkwardly  i opened the door for her  i will come down and see your father the first evening i have to spare i said i hope you will tell him from me that i should have been before but for the luxury of having some work to do  i will tell him she said almost inaudibly  and thank you very much for coming to inquire after me i added goodafternoon  goodafternoon mr ducaine  i closed the door lady angela was lounging in my easy chair with a slight smile upon her lips  two lady callers in one afternoon mr ducaine she remarked quietly you will lose your head i am afraid  i can assure you lady angela i answered that there is not the slightest fear of such a catastrophe  she sat looking meditatively into the fire swinging her dogskin gloves in her hands she wore a plain pearl grey walking dress and deerstalker hat with a single quill in it the severe but immaculate simplicity of her toilette might have been designed to accentuate the barbarities of blanche moyats cheap finery  i understood that you would be in town for at least three weeks i remarked i trust that his grace is well  i trust that he is she answered i see nothing of him in london he has company meetings and political work every moment of his time i do not believe that there is any one who works harder  he has at least i remarked the compensation of success  you are wondering i suppose she said looking up at me quickly what has brought me back again so soon  i certainly did not expect you i admitted  she rose abruptly  come outside she said and i will show you bring your hat  we passed into the march twilight she led the way down the cliff and towards the great silent stretch of salt marshes an evening wind sharp with brine was blowing in from the ocean stirring the surface of the long creeks into silent ripples and bending landwards the thin streaks of white smoke rising amongst the redtiled roofs of the village i felt the delicate sting of it upon my cheeks lady angela half closed her eyes as she turned her face seawards  i came for this she murmured there is nothing like it anywhere else  we stood there in silence for several long minutes then she turned to me with a little sigh  i am content she said will you come up and dine with us tonight blenavon will be there you know i hesitated  i am afraid it is rather a bother to you to leave your work she continued but i am not offering you idle hospitality i really want you to come  in that case i answered of course i shall be delighted  she pointed to braster grange away on the other side of the village i noticed for the first time that it was all lit up  have you heard anything of our new neighbours she asked  only their names i answered i did not even know that they had arrived  there is only a woman i believe she said i have met her abroad and i dislike hergreatly i hear that my brother spends most of his time with her and that he has dined there the last three nights it is not safe or wise of him for many reasons i want to stop it that is why i have asked you to come to us  it is quite sufficient i told her if you want me for any reason i will come i am two days ahead of my work  we threaded our way amongst the creeks all the time the salt wind blew upon us and the smell of fresh seaweed seemed to fill the air with ozone just as we came in sight of the road we heard the thunder of hoofs behind we turned around it was blenavon riding side by side with a lady who was a stranger to me her figure was slim but elegant i caught a glimpse of her face as they flashed by and it puzzled me her hair was almost straw coloured her complexion was negative her features were certainly not good yet there was something about her attractive something which set me guessing at once as to the colour of her eyes the quality of her voice if she should speak blenavon reined in his horse  so you have turned up angela he remarked looking at her a little nervously you remember mrs smithlessing dont youdown at bordighera you know  angela shook her head but she never glanced towards the woman who sat there with expectant smile  i am afraid that i do not she said i remember a good many things about bordighera butnot mrs smithlessing i shall see you at dinnertime blenavon i have some messages for you  i saw the whip come down upon the womans horse but i did not dare to look into her face blenavon with a smothered oath and a black look at his sister galloped after her i rejoined lady angela who was already in the road  dear me she said what a magnificent nerve that woman must have to dare to imagine that i should receive her why she is known in every capital in europea police spy a creature whose brains and body and soul are to be bought by any ones gold  what on earth can such a woman want here i remarked  in hiding very likely lady angela remarked or perhaps she may be an additional complication for you  i laughed a little scornfully  you too are getting suspicious i declared the prince and mrs smithlessing are a strong combination  be careful then that they are not too strong for you she answered smiling i have heard a famous boast of mrs smithlessings that never a man nor a lock has yet resisted her  i thought of her face as i had seen it in the half lighta faint impression of delicate colourlessness and for the life of me i could not help a little shiver lady angela looked at me in surprise  are you cold she asked let us walk more quickly  it is always cold at this time in the evening i remarked it is the mist coming up from the marshes one feels it at unexpected moments  i am not going to take you any farther she declared especially as you are coming up tonight eight oclock remember go and salve your conscience with some work  i protested but she was firm so i stood by the gate and watched her slim young figure disappear in the gathering shadows    chapter xvi  lady angelas engagement  i dined that night at rowchester lord blenavon was sulky and lady angela was only fitfully gay it was not altogether a cheerful party lady angela left us the moment blenavon produced his cigarettecase  do not stay too long mr ducaine she said as i held the door open for her i want a lesson at billiards  i bowed and returned to my seat blenavon was leaning back in his chair smoking thoughtfully  my sister he remarked looking up at the ceiling and speaking as though to himself would make an admirable heroine for the psychological novelist she is a bundle of fancies one can never rely upon what she is going to do what other girl in the world would get engaged on the thursday and come down here on the friday to think it overleaving of course her fiance in town doesnt that strike you as singular  is it i asked calmly a genuine case  lord blenavon nodded  i do not think that it is a secret he said helping himself to wine and passing the decanter she has made up her mind at last to marry mostyn ray the affair has been hanging about for more than a year in fact i think that there was something said about it before ray went abroad personally i think that he is too old i dont mind saying so to you because that has been my opinion all along however i suppose it is all settled now  i kept my eyes fixed upon the wineglass in front of me but the things which i saw no four walls had ever enclosed one moment the rush of the sea was in my ears another i was lying upon the little horsehair couch in my sittingroom i felt her soft white fingers upon my pulse and forehead again i saw her leaning down from the saddle of her great brown horse and heard her voice slow emotionless yet always with its strange power to play upon my heartstrings and yet while the grey seas of despair were closing over my head i sat there with a stereotyped smile upon my lips fingering carelessly the stem of my wineglass unwilling guest of an unwilling host i do not know how long we sat there in silence but it seemed to me an eternity for all the time i knew that blenavon was watching me i felt like a victim upon the rack whilst he the executioner held the cords i do not think however that he learnt anything from my face  with a little shrug of the shoulders he abandoned the subject  bythebye ducaine he said i hope you wont mind my asking you a rather personal question  if it is only personal i answered quietly not at all as you know i may not discuss any subject connected with my work  quite so i only want to know whether your secretarial duties begin and end with your work on the council of defence or are you at all in my fathers confidence as regards his private affairs  i am temporary secretary to the council of defence only lord blenavon i answered i know nothing whatever of your fathers private affairs he has his own man of business  i am not sure whether he believed me he cracked some walnuts and commenced peeling them  my father will never listen to me he said but i feel sure that he makes a mistake in becoming a director of all these companies politics should be quite sufficient to engross his time and the money cannot be so much of an object to him i dont suppose his holdings are large but i am quite sure that one or two of those australian gold mines are dicky and you know he was an enormous holder of chartereds and wouldnt sell worse luck of course im not afraid of his losing in the long run but it isnt exactly a dignified thing to be associated with these concerns that arent exactly a1 his name might lead people into speculations who couldnt altogether afford it  i know nothing whatever of these matters i answered but from what i have seen of your father i should imagine that he is remarkably able to guard his own interests  blenavon nodded  i suppose that is true he admitted but when he is already a rich man with very simple tastes i am rather surprised that he should care to meddle with such things  playing at commerce i remarked has become rather a hobby with men of leisure lately  and women too blenavon assented rather an ugly hobby i call it  a servant entered and addressed blenavon the carriage is at the door your lordship he announced  blenavon glanced at his watch and rose  i shall have to ask you to excuse me ducaine he said i was to have dined out tonight and i must go and make my peace another glass of wine  i rose at once  nothing more thank you i said i will just say goodnight to your sister  shes probably in the drawingroom he remarked if not i will make your excuses when i see her  blenavon hurried out a few moments later i heard the wheels of his carriage pass the long front of the house and turn down the avenue i lingered for a moment where i was the small oak table at which we had dined seemed like an oasis of colour in the midst of an atmosphere of gloom the room was large and lofty and the lighting was altogether inadequate from the walls there frowned through the shadows the warlike faces of generations of rowchesters at the farther end of the apartment four armed giants stood grim and ghostlike in the twilight which seemed to supply their empty frames with the presentment of actual warriors i looked down upon the table all agleam with flowers and fruit and silver over which shone the red glow of the shaded lamps exactly opposite to me in that chair now pushed carelessly back she had sat so close that my hand could have touched hers at any moment so close that i had been able to wonder more than ever before at the marvellous whiteness of her skin the perfection of her small finelyshaped features the strange sphinxlike expression of her face always suggestive of some great selfrestraint mysterious and subtly stimulating and as i stood there she seemed again to be occupying the chair at first a faint shadowy presence but gaining with every second shape and outline until i could scarcely persuade myself that it was not she who sat there she whose eyes more than once during dinnertime had looked into mine with that curious and instinctive demand for sympathy even as regards the things of the moment the passing jest the most transitory of emotions a few minutes ago i had felt that i knew her better than ever before in my life and now the chair was empty my heart was beating at the imaginary presence of the vainest of shadows she was going to marry colonel mostyn ray  and then i stood as though suddenly turned to stone before me were the great front windows of the castle beyond eastwards stretched the salt marshes the salt marshes riven with creeks once more my unwilling hands touched that huddledup heap of extinct humanity i saw the dead white face which the sun could never warm again and i felt the hands cold clammy horrible ray was a soldier and life and death had become phrases to him but iit was the first dead man i had ever seen and the horror of it was cold in my blood ray had murdered him fought with him perhaps but killed him what would she say if she knew would his hands be clean to her or would the horror rise up like a red wall between them  will you take coffee sir  i set my teeth and turned slowly round i even took the cup from the tray without spilling it  what liqueur may i bring you sir the man asked  brandy i answered  in a few minutes i was laughing at myself not quite naturally perhaps but only i could know that i was getting to be a morbid nervous person it was the solitude i must get away from it all before long fate had been playing strange tricks with me life which a few months ago had been a cold and barren thing was suddenly pressed to my lips a fantastic intoxicating mixture i had drawn enough poison into my veins i would have no more i swore it                                       i tried to leave the castle unnoticed but the place was alive with servants one of them hurried up to me as i tried to reach my hat and coat  her ladyship desired me to say that she was in the billiardroom sir he announced  will you tell lady angela and then i stopped the door of the billiardroom was open and lady angela stood there the outline of her figure sharply de fined against a flood of light she had a cue in her hand and she looked across at me  you are a long time mr ducaine i am waiting for you to give me a lesson at billiards  i crossed the hall to her side  i thought that as lord blenavon had gone out  she shrugged her shoulders  that you would evade your duty which is clearly to stay and entertain your hostess  she closed the door and glanced at me curiously  what has happened to you she asked you look as though you had been with ghosts  is it so impossible i asked moving a little nearer to the huge log fire what company is more terrifying than the company of our dead thoughts and dead hopes and dead memories  really i am afraid that blenavon must have been a very depressing companion she said leaning her elbow upon the broad mantelpiece  it was absurd i tried to shake myself free from the miseries of the last hour  i am afraid it must have been the other way i said for your brother has gone out  yes she said quietly he has gone to that woman at braster grange i wish i knew what brought her into this part of the country  i looked round at the billiardtable  did you mean that you would like a game i asked i am rather out of practice but i used to fancy myself a little  i have no doubt she answered sinking into a low chair that you are an excellent player but i am willing to take it for granted i do not wish to play billiards draw that chair up to the fire and talk to me  it was of all things what i wished to avoid that night but there was no escape i obeyed her  what your brother has told me is i presume no secret i said i am to wish you happiness am i not  she looked up at me in quick surprise  did blenavon tell you  that you had promised to marry colonel mostyn ray yes  that is very strange she said thoughtfully blenavon is not as a rule needlessly communicative and at present it is almost a secret  nevertheless i said turning slowly towards her i presume that it is true  it is perfectly true she answered  there was silence between us for several minutes one of the footmen came softly in to see whether we required a marker and finding us talking withdrew i was determined that the onus of further speech should remain with her  you are surprised she asked at last  very  and why  i scarcely know i answered except that i have never associated the thought of marriage with colonel ray and he is very much older than you  yes he is a great deal older she answered i think that his history has been rather a sad one he was in love for many years with a woman who marriedsome one else i have always felt sorry for him ever since i was a little girl  do you know who that woman was  i have never heard her name she answered  i found courage to lift my eyes and look at her  may i ask when you are going to be married  her eyes fell the question did not seem to please her  i do not know she said we have not spoken of that yet everything is very vague  colonel ray is coming down here of course i remarked  not to my knowledge she declared not at any rate until the next meeting of the council i shall be back in town before then  i begin to believe i said with a grim smile that your brother was right  my brother right  he finds you enigmatic you become engaged to a man one day and you leave him the nextwithout apparent reason  she was obviously disturbed a slight wave of trouble passed over her face her eyes failed to meet mine  that i cannot altogether explain to you she said there are reasons why i should come but apart from them this place is very dear to me i think that whenever anything has happened to me i have wanted to be here you are a man and you will not altogether understand this  why not i protested we too have our sentiment the sentiment of places as well as of people if i could choose where to die i think that it would be here with my windows wide open and the roar of the incoming tide in my ears  for a young man she remarked looking across at me i should consider you rather a morbid person  there are times i answered when i feel inclined to agree with you tonight is one of them  that she said coolly is unfortunate you have been overworking  i am worried by a problem i told her tell me are you a great believer in the sanctity of human life  what a question she murmured my own life at any rate seems to me to be a terribly important thing  suppose you had a friend i said who was one night attacked in a quiet spot by a man who sought his life say for the purpose of robbery your friend was the stronger and easily defended himself then he saw that his antagonist was a man of ill repute an evildoer a man whose presence upon the earth did good to no one so he took him by the throat and deliberately crushed the life out of him was your friend a murderer  she smiled at methat quiet introspective smile which i knew so well  does the end justify the means no of course not i should have been very sorry for my friend but if indeed there is a creator it is he alone who has power to take back what he has given  your friend then  dont call him that  i rose up and moved towards the door i think that she saw something in my face which checked any attempt she might have made to detain me  you must forgive me i said i cannot stay  she said nothing i looked back at her from the door her eyes were fixed upon me a little distended full of mute questioning i only shook my head so i left her and passed out into the night    chapter xvii  more treachery  there followed for me a period of unremitting hard work days during which i never left my desk save at such hours when i knew that the chances of meeting any one scarcely existed several times i saw lady angela from my window on the sands below threading her way across the marshes to the sea once she passed my window very slowly and with a quick backward glance as she turned to descend the cliff but i sat still with clenched teeth i had nailed down my resolutions i had determined to hold fast to such threads of my common sense as remained only in the nighttime when sleep mocked me and all hope of escape was futile was i forced to grapple with this newborn monster of folly it drove me up across the park to where the house black and lightless rose a dark incongruous mass above the trees down to the sea where the wind came booming across the bare country northwards and the spray leaped white and phosphorescent into the night like flakes of windhurled snow i stood as close to the sea as i dared and i prayed once i saw morning lighten the mass of clouds eastwards and the grey dawn break over the empty waters i heard the winds die away and i watched the sea grow calm far across on the horizon there was faint glimmer of cold sunlight then i went back to my broken rest it was my solitude in those days which drove me to seek peace or some measure of it from these things  at last a break came a summons to london to a meeting of the council i was just able to catch my train and reach the war office at the appointed time there were two hours of important work and i noticed a general air of gravity on the faces of every one present after it was over ray came to my side  ducaine he said lord chelsford wishes to speak to you for a few moments come this way  he led me into a small barelyfurnished room with high windows and only one door it was empty when we entered it ray looked at me as he closed the door and i fancied that for him his expression was not unfriendly  ducaine he said there has been some more of this damned leakage chelsford will ask you questions answer him simply but tell him everythingeverything you understand  i should not dream of any concealment i answered  of course not but it is possibleah  he broke off and remained listening there was the sound of a quick footstep in the hall  now you will understand what i mean he whispered remember  it was not chelsford but the duke who entered and greeted me cordially with a farewell nod to me ray disappeared the duke looked round and watched him close the door then he turned to me  ducaine he said a copy of our proposed camp at winchester and the fortifications on bedlers hill has reached paris  your grace i answered it was i who pointed out to you that our papers dealing with those matters had been tampered with i am waiting now to be crossquestioned by lord cheisford i have done all that is humanly possible it goes without saying that my resignation is yours whenever you choose to ask for it  the duke sat down and looked at me thoughtfully  ducaine he said i believe in you  i drew a little breath of relief the duke was a hard man and a man of few words i felt that in making that speech he had departed a great deal from his usual course of action and i knew that he meant it  i am very much obliged to your grace i answered  i think he continued that lord cheisford and in fact all the others are inclined to accept you on my estimate we all of us feel that we are the victims of some unique and very marvellous piece of roguery on the part of some one or other i believe myself that we are on the eve of a discovery  thank heaven i murmured  we shall only succeed in unravelling this mystery the duke continued deliberately by very cautious and delicate manoeuvring i have an idea which i propose to carry out but its success depends largely upon you  upon me i repeated amazed  exactly upon your common sense and judgment the duke paused to listen for a moment then he continued speaking very slowly and leaning over towards me  lord chelsford proposes for his own satisfaction to crossexamine you it occurs to me that you will probably tell him of your fancied disturbance of those papers in the safe and of your little adventure with the prince of malors i looked at him in surprise have they not all been told of this i asked no  there was a moments dead silence i was a little staggered the duke remained imperturbable  they have not been told he repeated no one has been told the matter was one for my discretion and i exercised it  there seemed to be no remark which i could make so i kept silence  we have discussed this matter before the duke said and my firm conviction is that you were mistaken that safe could only have been opened by yourself ray or myself i think i am justified in saying that neither of us did open it  nevertheless that safe was opened i objected those were the very papers copies of which have found their way to paris  exactly the duke answered only you must remember that every member of the board was sufficiently acquainted with their contents to have sent those particulars to paris without opening the safe for a further investigation of them any statement of your suspicion would only result in attention being diverted from the proper quarters to members of my household i believe that even if you are right even if those papers were disturbed it was done simply to throw dust in your eyes do you follow me  yes your grace i answered  lord chelsford if you were able to convince him would most certainly be misled in this direction that is why i have kept your report to myself that is why my advice to you now is to say nothing about your imagined displacement of those papers that is my advice you understand  yes your grace i repeated  with regard to the prince of malors the duke continued my firm conviction is that you were mistaken malors is not a politician he has nothing whatever to gain or lose in this matter he is a member of one of the most ancient houses of europe a house which for generations has been closely connected with my own i absolutely decline to believe that whilst under my roof a malors could lower himself to the level of a common spy such an accusation brought against him would be regarded as a blot upon my hospitality further it would mean the breaking off of my ancient ties of friendship i am very anxious therefore that you should bring yourself to accept my view as to this episode also  your grace i answered you ask me very hard things  he looked at me with his clear cold eyes  surely not too hard mr ducaine he said i ask you to accept my judgment consider for a moment you are a young man little more than a boy i for forty years have been a servant of my country both in the field and as a lawmaker i am a cabinet minister i have a lifelong experience of men and their ways my judgment in this matter is that you were mistaken and much mischief is likely to ensue if the prince of malors should find himself an object of suspicion amongst us  your grace i said forgive me but why do you not say these things to the board or to lord chelsford and colonel ray after they have heard my story  because the duke answered i have no confidence in the judgment of either of them both in their way are excellent men but they are of this new generation who do not probe beneath the surface who form their opinions only from the obvious it is possible that after hearing your story they might consider the problem solved i am at any rate convinced that they would commence a search for its solution in altogether wrong quarters  your grace i said firmly i am very sorry indeed that i cannot take your advice i think it most important that lord cheisford should know that those papers were tampered with and as regards the prince of malors whatever his motive may have been i discovered him in the act of perusing the documents relating to the subway of portsmouth i cannot possibly withhold my knowledge of these things from lord chelsford in fact i think it is most important that he should know of them  the duke rose slowly to his feet he showed no sign of anger  if you prefer your own judgment to mine mr ducaine he said i have no more to say i have taken you into my confidence and i have endeavoured to show you your most politic course of behaviour if your views are so far opposed you must not consider it an injustice if i decide that a person of more judgment is required successfully to conduct the duties of secretary to the council  i can only thank your grace for your past kindness i answered with sinking heart  he looked across at me with still cold eyes  do not misunderstand me he said i do not dismiss you i shall leave that to the board if my colleagues are favourably disposed towards you i shall not interfere only so far as i am concerned you must take your chance  i quite understand your grace i declared i think that you are treating me very fairly  the duke leaned back in his chair  here they come he remarked    chapter xviii  in which i speak out  the door was thrown open lord chelsford and colonel ray entered together the commanderinchief accompanied them and there was also present a person who sat a little apart from the others and who i learned afterwards was a high official in the secret service more than ever perhaps i realized at that moment in the presence of these men the strangeness of the events which for a short space of time at any rate had brought me into association with persons and happenings of such importance  lord chelsford seated himself at the open desk opposite to the duke as was his custom he wasted no time in preliminaries  we wish for a few minutes conversation with you mr ducaine he said on the subject of this recent leakage of news concerning our proceedings on the council of defence i need not tell you that the subject is a very serious one  i quite appreciate its importance sir i answered  the particular documents of which we have news from paris lord chelsford continued are those having reference to the proposed camp at winchester and the subway at portsmouth i understand mr ducaine that these were drafted by you and placed in a safe in the library of rowchester on the evening of the eighteenth of this month  that is so sir i answered and early the next morning i reported to the duke that the papers had been tampered with  there was a dead silence for several moments lord chelsford glanced at the duke who sat there imperturbable with a chill mirthless smile at the corner of his lips then he looked again at me as though he had not heard aright  will you kindly repeat that mr ducaine he said  certainly sir i answered i had occasion to go to the safe again early on the morning of the nineteenth and i saw at once that the documents in question had been tampered with i reported the matter at once to his grace  the eyes of every one were bent upon the duke he nodded his head slowly  mr ducaine he said certainly came to me and made the statement which he has just repeated i considered the matter and i came to the conclusion that he was mistaken i was sure of it then i am equally sure of it now  tell us mr ducaine lord chelsford said what your reasons were for making such a statement  i took a piece of red tape and a newspaper from the table before which i stood i folded up the newspaper and tied the tape around it  when i put those documents away i said i tied them up with a knot like this of my own invention which i have never seen used by anybody else in the morning i found that my knot had been untied and that the tape around the papers had been retied in an ordinary bow  will you permit me for a moment the duke interposed the safe i believe mr ducaine was secured with a code lock the word of which was known towhom  yourself sir colonel ray and myself  the duke nodded  if i remember rightly he said the code word was never mentioned but was written on a piece of paper glanced at by each of us in turn and immediately destroyed  that is quite true sir  now do you believe mr ducaine the duke continued that it was possible for any one else except us the to have attained to the knowledge of that word  i do not sir i admitted  do you believe that it was possible for any one to have opened the safe without the knowledge of that word  without breaking it open no sir  there were no signs of the lock having been tampered with when you went to it in the morning none sir  it was set at the correct word the word known only to colonel ray myself and yourself yes sir  the duke leaned back in his chair and addressed lord cheisford  for the reasons which you have heard from mr ducaine himself he said drily i came to the conclusion that he was mistaken in his suggestion i think that you will probably be inclined to agree with me  these men had learnt well the art of masking their feelings from lord chelsfords polite bow i could gather nothing  i am forced to admit he said that no other conclusion seems possible now mr ducaine with regard to the execution of your work it is carried out altogether i believe at the brand  entirely sir  your only servant is the man grooton for whom the duke and i myself are prepared to vouch you are also watched by detectives residing in the village as i dare say you know i also understand that you have no private correspondence and receive practically no visitors now tell me the only persons who to your knowledge have entered the brand since you have been engaged in this work  i answered him at once  colonel ray lady angela harberly lord blenavon the prince of malors and a young lady called blanche moyat the daughter of a farmer in braster at whose house i used sometimes to visit  lord chelsford referred to some notes in his hand then he leaned back in his chair and looked at me steadfastly  is there any one he asked whom you suspect to have visited you for the purpose either direct or indirect of gaining information as to your work  yes sir i answered promptly  a little exclamation escaped from the commanderinchief lord chelsford never removed his eyes from my face the duke had still the appearance of a tolerant but slightly bored listener  who lord chelsford asked  the prince of malors i answered  there was a moments silence lord cheisford turned again to his notes then he looked up at me  your reasons he asked  i told them the story carefully and circumstantially when i had finished colonel ray left his seat and whispered something in lord chelsfords ear the duke interposed  i wish he said to add a brief remark to the story which you have just heard i have known malors since he was a boy my father knew his father and as you may know our families have been frequently connected in marriage i do not wish to impugn the good faith of this young man but the prince of malors was my guest and the accusation against him is one which i cannot believe  the story as i have told it sir is absolutely true i said to lord cheisford there was no room for any mistake or misapprehension on my part i am afraid that i havent been a great success as your secretary colonel ray gave me to understand of course that your object in engaging an utterly unknown person was to try and stop this leakage of information it is still going on and i cannot stop it i am quite prepared to give up my post at any moment  lord chelsford nodded towards the door  will you be so good as to step into the next room for a few minutes mr ducaine he said we will discuss this matter together  i departed at once and found my way into a bare waitingroom hung with a few maps and with uncarpeted floor the minutes dragged along slowly i hated the thought of dismissal i rebelled against it almost fiercely i had done my duty i had told the truth there was nothing against me save this obstinate and quixotic loyalty of the duke to an old family friend yet i scarcely dared hope that there was a chance for me  at last i heard the door open and the sound of friendly adieux in the passage lord cheisford came in to me alone he took up a position with his back to the fire and looked at me thoughtfully  well mr ducaine he said we have discussed this matter thoroughly and we are all practically agreed that there is no reason why we should ask you to give up your position  i was almost overcome it was a wonderful relief to me  but surely the duke i faltered  the duke is very loyal to his friends mr ducaine he said but he is also a man with a nice sense of justice you and he regard two incidents from entirely different points of view but he does not for a moment suggest that your account of them is not an honest one he looks upon you as a little nervous and overstrung by your responsibilities and disposed to be imaginative he will not hear anything against the prince of malors  my story is as true as gods word i declared  i am inclined to believe in it myself mr ducaine said lord chelsford there are indications of a strong revival of royalist sentiment amongst the french people and it is very possible that the prince of malors may wish to ingratiate himself by any means with the french army this sort of thing scarcely sounds like practical politics but one has to bear in mind the peculiar temperament of the man himself and the nation i personally believe that the prince of malors would consider himself justified in abusing the hospitality of his dearest friend in the cause of patriotism at any rate this is my view and i am acting upon it all danger from that source will now be at an end for in an hours time the prince will be under the surveillance of detectives for the remainder of his stay in england  i breathed a sigh of relief  i am to go back to braster then i asked  tonight if possible lord chelsford answered go on living as you have been living and listen if you should have further cause to suspect the prince of malors or anybody else communicate with me or with ray the duke is of course a man of ability and an honourable man but he is prejudiced in favour of his friends some of us others have had to learn our lessons of life and men in a sharper school you understand me mr ducaine i am sure  i perfectly understand sir i answered  there is nothing more which you wish to ask me  there is a suggestion i should like to make sir with regard to the disposal of my finished work i told him  go on mr ducaine i shall be glad to listen to it  there was a knock at the door lord chelsford held up his finger  send it me in writing he said in a low tone tomorrowcome in  ray entered    chapter xix  mrs smithlessing  ray and i left the building together as we turned into pall mall he glanced at his watch  you have missed the six oclock train he remarked i suppose you know that there is nothing now till the ninetwenty will you come to the club with me and have some dinner  it was less an invitation than a command i felt a momentary impulse of rebellion but the innate masterfulness of the man triumphed easily i found myself walking a little against my will down pall mall by his side a man of some note he was saluted every minute by passersby whom however he seemed seldom to notice in his town clothes his great height his bronzed face and black beard made him a sufficiently striking personality i myself though i was little short of six feet seemed almost insignificant by his side until we reached the club he maintained an unbroken silence he even ignored some passing comment of mine but when once inside the building he seemed to remember that he was my host and his manner became one of stiff kindness he ordered an excellent dinner and chose the wine with care then he leaned a little forward across the table and electrified me by his first remark  ducaine he said what relatives have you with whom you are in any sort of communication  none at all i answered  sir michael trogoldy was your mothers brother he remarked he is still alive  i believe so i admitted i have never approached him nor has he ever taken any notice of me  you did not write to him for instance when heathcote absconded and you had to leave college  certainly not i answered i did not choose to turn beggar  how much he asked do you know of your family history  i know i told him that my father was cashiered from the army for misconduct and committed suicide i know too that my mothers people treated her shamefully and that she died alone in paris and almost in poverty it was scarcely likely therefore that i was going to apply to them for help ray nodded  i thought so he remarked grimly i shall have to talk to you for a few minutes about your father  i said nothing my surprise indeed had bereft me of words he sipped his wine slowly and continued  fate has dealt a little hardly with you he said i am almost a stranger to you and there are even reasons why you and i could never be friends yet it apparently falls to my lot to supplement the little you know of a very unpleasant portion of your family history that rascal of a lawyer who absconded with your money should have told you on your twentyfirst birthday  a pleasant heritage i remarked bitterly yet i always wanted to know the whole truth  here goes then he said filling my glass with wine your father was second in command at gibraltar he sold a plan of the gallery forts to the french government and was dismissed from the army  i started as though i had been stung ray continued his stern matteroffact tone unshaken  he did not commit suicide as you were told he lived in paris a life of continual and painful degeneration your mother died of a broken heart there was another woman of course whose influence over your father was unbounded and at whose instigation he committed this disgraceful act this woman is now at braster  my brain was in a whirl i was quite incapable of speech  her real name he continued coolly god only knows for the moment she calls herself mrs smithlessing she is a francoamerican a political adventuress of the worst type living by her wits she is ugly enough to be satans mistress and shes fortyfive if shes a day yet she has but to hold up her finger and men tumble the gifts of their life into her lap gold and honour conscience and duty at present i think it highly probable that you are her next selected victim  for several minutes ray proceeded with his dinner i did my best to follow his example but my appetite was gone i could scarcely persuade myself that the whole affair was not a dreamthat the men who sat all round us in little groups the dark liveried servants passing noiselessly backwards and forwards were not figures in some shadowy nightmare and that i should not wake in a moment to find myself curled up in a railway carriage on my way home but there was no mistaking the visible presence of colonel mostyn ray strong stalwart he sat within a few feet of me calmly eating his dinner as though my agony were a thing of little account he at least was real  this woman he continued presently either is or would like to be mixed up with the treachery that is somewhere close upon us sooner or later she will approach you you are warned  yes i repeated vaguely i am warned  i have finished colonel ray remarked go on with your dinner and think i will answer any question presently  there were only two i put to him and that was when my hansom had been called and i was on the point of leaving  is hemy fatheralive now i asked  i have reason to believe ray answered that he may be dead  how is it i asked that you are so well acquainted with these things were you at any time my fathers friend  i was acquainted with him ray answered we were at one time in the same regiment my friendship waswith your mother  the answer was illuming but he never winced  indirectly i said i seem to have a good deal to thank you for why do you say that you can never be my friend  you are your fathers son he answered curtly  i am also my mothers son i objected  for which reason he said i have done what i could to give you a start in life  and with these words he dismissed me                                       i received rays warning concerning mrs smithlessing the new tenant of braster grange somewhere between seven and eight oclock and barely an hour later i found myself alone in a firstclass carriage with her and a four hours journey before us she had arrived at kings cross apparently only a few minutes before the departure of the train for the platform was almost deserted when i took my seat just as i had changed my hat for a cap however wrapped my rug around my knees and settled down for the journey the door of my carriage was thrown open and i saw two women looking in one of whom i recognized at once mrs smithlessing although the night was warm was wearing a heavy and magnificent fur coat and the guard of the train himself was attending her behind stood a plainly dressed woman evidently her maid carrying a flat dressingcase there was a brief colloquy between the three it ended in dressingcase a pile of books a reading lamp and a formidable array of hatboxes and milliners parcels being placed upon the rack and vacant seats in my compartment and immediately afterwards mrs smithlessing herself entered i heard her tell her maid to enter the carriage behind the door was closed and the guard touched off his hat a minute later and we were off  i was alone with the adventuress i had no doubt but that she had chosen my carriage with intent i placed my dispatchbox on the rack above my head and opened out a newspaper which i had no intention of reading she for her part arranged her travelling light and took out a novel she did not apparently even glance in my direction and seemed to become immersed at once in her reading so we travelled for half an hour or so  at the end of that time i was suddenly conscious that she had laid down her book and was regarding me through partiallyclosed eyes i too laid down my paper our eyes met and she smiled  forgive me she said but did i not see you one day last week upon the sands at braster with lady angela harberly  i believe so i answered you were riding i think with her brother  how fortunate that i should find myself travelling with a neighbour she murmured i rather dreaded this night journey i just missed the six oclock and i have been at the station ever since  i understood at once one of the charms of this woman her voice was deliciously soft and musical the words seemed to leave her lips slowly almost lingeringly and she spoke with the precision and slight accent of a welleducated foreigner her eyes seemed to be wandering all over me and my possessions yet her interest if it amounted to that never even suggested curiosity or inquisitiveness  it is scarcely a pleasant journey at this time of night i remarked  indeed no she assented i wonder if you know my name i am mrs smithlessing of braster grange and you  my name is guy ducaine i told her i live at a small cottage called the brand  that charming little place you can just see from the sands she exclaimed i thought the dukes headkeeper lived there  it was a keepers lodge before the duke was kind enough to let it to me i told her  she nodded  it is a very delightful abode she murmured  she picked up her book and after turning over the pages aimlessly for a few minutes she recommenced to read i followed her example but when a little later on i glanced across in her direction i found that her eyes were fixed upon me and that her novel lay in her lap  my book is so stupid she said apologetically i find mr ducaine she added with sudden earnestness the elements of a much stranger story closer at hand  that i remarked laying down my own book and looking steadily across at her sounds enigmatic  i think she said that i am very foolish to talk to you at all about it if you know who i am you are probably armed against me at all points you will weigh and measure my words you will say to yourself lies lies lies you will not believe in me or anything i say and again if you do not know the story is too painful a one for me to tell  then let us both avoid it i said reaching again for my paper we shall stop at ipswich in an hour i will change carriages there  she turned round in her seat towards the window as though to hide her face my own attempt at reading was a farce i watched her over the top of my paper she was looking out into the darkness and she seemed to me to be crying every now and then her shoulders heaved convulsively suddenly she faced me once more there were traces of tears on her face a small lace handkerchief was knotted up in her nervous fingers  oh i cannot she exclaimed plaintively i cannot sit here alone with you and say nothing i know that i am judged already it does not matter i am your fathers wife guy you owe me at least some recognition of that fact  i never knew my father i said except as the cause of my own miserable upbringing and friendless life  you never knew him she answered and therefore you believe the worst he was weak perhaps and exposed to a terrible temptation he fell but he was not a bad man he was never that  do you think mrs smithlessing i said struggling to keep my voice firm though i felt myself trembling that this is a profitable discussion for either of us  why not she exclaimed almost fiercely you have heard his story from enemies you have judged him from the report of those who were never his friends he sinned and he repented better and worse men than he have done that if he were wholly bad do you believe that after all these years i should care for him still  i held my peace the woman was leaning over towards me now she seemed to have lost the desire to attract her voice had grown sharper and less pleasant her carefully arranged hair was in some disorder and the telltale blue veins by her temples and the crows feet under her eyes were plainly visible her face seemed suddenly to have become pinched and wan the flaming light in her strangely coloured eyes was a convincing assertion of her earnestness she was not acting now though what lay behind the storm i could not tell  you seem afraid to talk to me she exclaimed why i have done you no harm  perhaps not i answered yet i cannot see what we gain by raking up this miserable history it is both painful and profitless  i will say no more she declared with a sudden note of dignity in her tone i can see that i am judged already in your mind after all it does not really matter no one likes to be thought worse of than they deserve and women are alla little foolish but at least you must answer me one question i have the right to ask it you must tell me where he is  where who is i asked  again her eyes flamed upon inc her lips parted a little and i could see the white glimmer of her teeth  oh you shall not fence with me like a baby she exclaimed tell me or lie to me or refuse to tell me which is it  upon my honour i said looking at her curiously i have no idea whom you mean  she looked at inc steadily for several moments her lips parted her breath seeming to come sharply between her teeth  i mean your father she said whom else should i mean    chapter xx  two to one  i looked across at the woman who was waiting my answer with every appearance of feverish interest  what should i know about him i said slowly i have been told that he is dead i know no more than that  she started as though my words had stung her  it is not possible she exclaimed i must have heard of it when he left meit was less than three months agohe seemed better than i had known him for years  all my life i said i have understood that my father died by his own hand after his disgrace tonight for the first time i was told that this was not the fact i understood from what my informant said that he had died recently  she drew a sharp breath between her teeth and suddenly struck the cushioned arm of the carriage by her side with her clenched hand  it is a lie she declared whoever told you so it is a lie  do you mean that he is not dead i exclaimed do you mean that you have not seen him yourselfwithin the last few months she demanded fiercely he left me to come to you on the first day of the new year  i have never seen him to my knowledge in my life i answered  she leaned back in her seat murmuring something to herself which i could not catch pastmistress of deceit though she may have been i was convinced that her consternation at my statement was honest she did not speak or look at me again for some time as for me i sat silent with the horror of a thought underneath the rug my limbs were cold and lifeless i sat looking out of the rainsplashed window into the darkness with fixed staring eyes and a hideous fancy in my brain every now and then i thought that i could see ita white evil face pressed close to the blurred glass grinning in upon me every shriek of the engineand there were many just then for we were passing through a network of tunnelsbrought beads of moisture on to my forehead made me start and shake like a criminal surely that was a cry i started in my seat only to see that my companion now her old self again was watching me intently  i am afraid she said softly that you are not very strong the excitement of talking of these things has been too much for you  i have never had a days illness in my life i answered i am perfectly well  i am glad she said simply i must finish what i was telling you your father was continually talking and thinking of you he knew all about you at college he knew about your degree of your cricket and rowing lately he began to get restless he lost sight of you after you left oxford and it worried him there were reasons as you know why it was not well for him to come to england but nevertheless he determined to brave it out it was to find you that he risked so much he left me on new years day and i have never heard a word from him since that is why i came to england  the whole reason i asked like a fool  the whole reason she affirmed simply  i do not wish to see my father i said if he comes to me i shall tell him so  he wants to tell you his story himself she murmured  i would never listen to it i answered she sighed  you are very young she said you do not know what temptation is you do not know how badly he was treated you have heard his history perhaps from his enemies he is getting old now guy i think that if you saw him now you would pity him  my pity i answered would never be strong enough to suffer me to open the door to himif he should come he has left me alone all these years the only favour i would ever ask of him would be that he continues to do so  you will believe the story of strangers  no one in the world could be a greater stranger to me than he she sighed  you will not even let me be your friend she pleaded you are young you are perhaps ambitious there may be many ways in which i could help you  as you helped my father perhaps i answered bitterly thank you i have no need of friendsthat sort of friends  her eyes seemed to narrow a little and the smile upon her lips was forced  is that kind of you she exclaimed your father was in a position of great trust it is different with you you are idle and you need a career england has so little to offer her young men but there are other countries  i interrupted her brusquely  thank you i said but i have employment and such ambitions as i have admit of nothing but an honest career  again i saw that contraction of her eyes but she never winced or changed her tone  you have employment she asked as though surprised  yes as you doubtless know i am in the service of the duke of rowchester i told her  it is news to me she replied you will forgive me at least for being interested guy but when you say in the service of the duke of rowchester you puzzle me in england what does that mean  i am one of the dukes secretaries i answered  is the duke then a politician she asked that he needs secretaries  not at all i answered drily his grace is president of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals or children whichever you like we have a large correspondence  she picked up her book  i am afraid that i understand you she said you have a good deal of the brutality of youth guy and i might add of its credulity also whose word is it i wonder that you have taken so abjectlywith such an open mouth if i have enemies i have not deserved them but after all it matters little  we did not speak again until we neared the junction then she began to gather up her things  how are you getting home she asked it is two oclock and raining  i am going to walk i answered  but that is absurd she protested i have a closed carriage here i insist that you let me drive you it is only common humanity and you have that great box too  i buttoned up my coat  mrs smithlessing i said you perhaps wish to force me into seeming ungracious you have even called me brutal it is your own fault you give me no chance of escape you even force me now to tell you that i do not desirethat i will not acceptany hospitality at your hands  she fastened her jacket with trembling fingers her face she kept averted from me  very well she said softly i shall not trouble you any more  at the junction i fetched the sleepylooking porter to see to her luggage and then left her my rug i left in the stationmasters office and with the dispatchbox in my hand i climbed the steps from the station and turned into the long straight road which led to braster i had barely gone a hundred yards when a small motor brougham with blazing lights and insistent horn came flying past me and on into the darkness i caught a momentary glimpse of mrs smithlessings pale face as the car flashed by a weird little silhouette come and gone in a second away ahead i saw the mud and rain from the pools fly up into the air in a constant stream caught in the broad white glare of the brilliant searchlamps then the car turned a corner and vanished  i was tired yet i found the change from the close railway carriage and the tension of the last few hours delightful the road along which i trudged ran straight to the sea the distant roar of which was already in my ears and the wet wind which blew in my face was salt and refreshing it was a little after two in the morning and the darkness would have been absolute but for a watery moon which every now and then gave a fitful light for a mile or more i walked with steady unflagging footsteps then suddenly i found myself slackening my pace i walked slower and slower at last i stopped  about fifty yards farther on my left was braster grange it stood a little way back from the road its gardens were enclosed by a thin stormbent hedge just thick enough to be a screen from the road the entrance was along a lane which branched off here from the main road and led on to the higher marshes and thence on to the road from braster village to rowchester and my cottage straight on the road which i was following led into braster but the lane to the left round past the grange saved me fully half a mile in an ordinary way i should never have hesitated for a moment as to my route i knew every inch of the lane and though it was rough walking there were no creeks or obstacles of any sort to be reckoned with and yet as i neared the corner i came to a full stop as i stood there in the road i felt my heart beating i seemed possessed by a curious nerve failure my breath came quickly i felt my heart thumping against my side i stood still and listened down on the shingles i could hear the sea come thundering in with a loud increasing roar dying monotonously away at regular intervals i could hear the harsh grinding of the pebbles the backward swirl of long waves thrown back from the land i heard the wind come booming across the waste lands rustling and creaking amongst the few stunted trees in the grounds of braster grange of slighter sounds there seemed to be none the village ahead was dark and silent the side of the house fronting the road was black and desolate it was a lonely spot a lonely hour yet as i stood there shivering with nameless apprehensions i felt absolutely certain that i was confronted by some hidden danger  in a moment or two i am thankful to say my courage returned i struck a match and lit a cigar one of a handful which ray had forced upon me then i crossed stealthily to the other side of the road and felt for the hedge i pricked my hands badly but after feeling about for some moments i was able to cut for myself a reasonably thick stick with this in my right hand and the dispatchbox under my left arm i proceeded on my way  i walked warily and when i had turned into the lane which passed the entrance to braster grange i walked in the middle of it instead of skirting the wall which enclosed the grounds i passed the entrance gates and had only about twenty yards farther to go before i emerged upon the open marshland here the darkness was almost impenetrable for the lane narrowed the hedge on the left was ten or twelve feet high and on the right were two long barns i clasped my stick tightly and walked almost stealthily i felt that if i could come safely to the end of these barn buildings i could afford to laugh at my fears  suddenly my strained hearing detected what i had been listening for all the time there was a faint but audible rustling in the shrubs overgrowing the wall on my left i made a quick dash forward tripped against some invisible obstacle stretched across the lane and went staggering sideways struggling to preserve my balance almost at the same moment two dark forms dropped from the shelter of the shrubs on to the lane by my side i felt the soft splash of a wet cloth upon my cheeks an arm round my neck and the sickening odour of chloroform in my nostrils but already i had regained by balance i wrenched myself free from the arm and was suddenly blinded by the glare of a small electric handlight within a foot of my face i struck a sweeping blow at it with my stick and from the soft impact it seemed to me that the blow must have descended upon the head of one of my assailants i heard a groan and i saw the shadowy form of the second man spring at me what followed was not i believe cowardice on my part for my blood was up and my sense of fear gone i dashed my stick straight at the approaching figure and i leaped forward and ran i had won the hundred yards and the quarter of a mile at oxford and i was in fair training i knew how to get off fast and after the first dozen yards i felt that i was safe the footsteps which had started in pursuit ceased in a few minutes breathless but with the dispatchbox safe under my arm i sprinted across the marsh and never paused till i reached the road then i looked back and listened i could see or hear nothing but from one of the top rooms in the grange a faint but steady light was shining out    chapter xxi  lady angela approves  it was the only breath of fresh air which i had allowed myself all the morning though the dazzling sunlight and the soft west wind had tempted me all the time and now as ill luck would have it i had walked straight into the presence of the one person in the world whom i wished most earnestly to avoid she was standing on the edge of the cliff her hands behind her gazing seawards and though i stopped short at the sight of her and for a moment entertained wild thoughts of flight it was not possible for me to carry them out a dry twig snapped beneath my feet and turning quickly round she had seen me she came forward at once and for some reason or other i knew that she was glad she smiled upon me almost gaily  so this sunshine has even tempted you out sir hermit she exclaimed is it not good to feel the spring coming  delightful i answered  she looked at me curiously  how pale you are she said you are working too hard mr ducaine  i came down from london by the mail last night i said i saw colonel rayhad dinner with him in fact  she nodded but asked me no questions  i think she said abruptly that they are all coming down here in a few days i heard from my father this morning  i sighed  i have been very unfortunate lady angela i said your father is displeased with me i think that but for colonel ray i should have been dismissed yesterday  is it aboutthe prince of malors she asked in a low tone  partly i was forced to tell what i knew she hesitated for a moment then she turned impulsively toward me  you were right to tell them mr ducaine she said i have hated myself ever since the other night when i seemed to side against you there are things going on about us which i cannot fathom and sometimes i have fears terrible fears but your course at least is a clear one dont let yourself be turned aside by any one my father has prejudices which might lead him into grievous errors trust colonel rayno one else yours is a dangerous position but it is a splendid one it means a career and independence if there should come a time even  she broke off abruptly in her speech i could see that she was agitated and i thought that i knew the cause  lady angela i said slowly would it not be possible for you and colonel ray to persuade lord blenavon to go abroad  she swayed for a moment as though she would have fallen and her eyes looked at me full of fear  you thinkthat it would be better  i do  it would break my fathers heart she murmured if ever he could be brought to believe it  the more reason why lord blenavon should go i said he is set between dangerous influences here lady angela can you tell me where your brother was last night  how should i she answered slowly he tells me nothing  he was not at home  he dined at home i think that he went out afterwards  i nodded  and if he returned at all i said i think you will find that it was after three oclock  she came a little nearer to me although indeed we were in a spot where there was no danger of being overheard  what do you know about it  am i not right i asked  he did not return at all she answered he is not home yet  i had believed from the first that blenavon was one of my two assailants now i was sure of it  when he does come back i remarked grimly you may find him more or less damaged  mr ducaine she said you must explain yourself  i saw no reason why i should not do so i told her the story of my early morning adventure she listened with quivering lips  you were not hurt then she asked eagerly  i was not hurt i assured her i was fortunate  tell me what measures you are taking she begged  what can i do i asked it was pitch dark and i could identify no one i am writing colonel ray that is all  that hateful woman she murmured mr ducaine i believe that if blenavon is really concerned in this it is entirely through her influence  very likely i answered i have heard strange things about her she is a dangerous woman  we were both silent for a moment then lady angela whose eyes were fixed seawards suddenly turned to me  oh she cried i am weary of all these bothers and problems and anxieties let us put them away for one hour of this glorious morning dare you play truant for a little while and walk on the sands  i think so i answered readily if you will wait while i go and put grooton in charge  i will be scrambling down she declared it is not a difficult operation  i joined her a few minutes later and we set our faces toward the point of the bay over our heads the seagulls were lazily drifting and wheeling the quiet sea stole almost noiselessly up the firm yellow sands farther over the marshes the larks were singing inland men like tiny specks in the distance were working upon their farms we walked for a while in silence and i found myself watching my companion her head was thrown slightly back she walked with all the delightful grace of youth and strength yet there was a cloud which still lingered upon her face  these i said abruptly should be the happiest days of your life lady angela after all is it worth while to spoil them by worrying about other peoples doings  other peoples doings she murmured  i shrugged my shoulders  selfishness you know is the permitted vice of the youngand of lovers  blenavon can scarcely rank amongst the other people with me she said he is my only brother  colonel ray is to be your husband i reminded her which is far more important  she turned upon me with flaming cheeks  you do not understand what you are talking about mr ducaine she said stiffly colonel ray and i are not lovers you have no right to assume anything of the sort  if you are not lovers i said what right have you to marry  she seemed a little staggered as indeed she might be by my boldness  you are very mediaeval she remarked  the mediaeval sometimes survives it is as true now as then that loveless marriages are a curse and a sin i answered it is the one thing which remains now as it was in the beginning  she looked at me furtively almost timidly  i should like to know why you are speaking to me like this she said i do not want to seem unkind but do you think that the length of our acquaintance warrants it  i do not know how long i have known you i answered i do not remember the time when i did not know you you are one of those people to whom i must say the things which come into my mind i think that if you do not love colonel ray you have no right to marry him  she looked me in the face her cheeks were flushed with walking and the wind had blown her hair into becoming confusion  mr ducaine she said do you consider that colonel ray is your friend  he has been very good to me i answered  there is something between you two what is it  it is not my secret i told her  there is a secret then she murmured i knew it is this why you do not wish me to marry him  i have not said that i do not wish you to marry him i reminded her  not in words you had no need to put it into words  you are very young i said to marry any one for any other reason save the only true one some day there might be some one else  she watched the flight of a seagull for a few momentswatched it till its wings shone like burnished silver as it lit upon the sungilded sea  i do not think so she said dreamily i have never fancied myself caring very much for any one it is not easy you know for some of us  and for some i murmured it is too easy  she looked at me curiously but she had no suspicion as to the meaning of my words  i want you to tell me something she said in a few minutes have you any other reason beyond this for objecting to my marriage with colonel ray  if i have i answered slowly i cannot tell it you it is his secret not mine  you are mysterious she remarked  if i am i objected you must remember that you are asking me strange questions  colonel ray is too honest she said thoughtfully to keep anything from me which i ought to know  i changed the conversation after all i was a fool to have blundered into it we talked of other and lighter things i exerted myself to shake off the depression against which i had been struggling all the morning by degrees i think we both forgot some part of our troubles we walked home across the sandhills climbing gradually higher and higher until we reached the cliffs on all sides of us the coming change in the seasons seemed to be vigorously asserting itself the plovers were crying over the freshlyturned ploughed fields a whole world of wild birds and insects seemed to have imparted a sense of movement and life to what only a few days ago had been a land of desolation a country silent and winterbound colour was asserting itself in all manner of placesin the green of the sprouting grass the shimmer of the sun upon the seastained sands in the silvery blue of the braster creeks lady angela drew a long breath of content as we paused for a moment at the summit of the cliffs  and you wonder she murmured that i left london for this  yes i still wonder i answered the beauties of this place are for the lonelyi mean the lonely in disposition for you life in the busy places should just be opening all her fascinations it is only when one is disappointed in the more human life that one comes back to nature  perhaps then she said a little vaguely i too must be suffering from disappointments i have never realized  we had taken the last turn my cottage was in sight to my surprise a man was standing there as though waiting he turned round as we approached his face was very pale and the back of his head was bandaged he carried his arm too in a sling it was colonel mostyn ray    chapter xxii  miss moyat makes a scene  ray was smoking his customary enormous pipe which he deliberately emptied as lady angela and i approached the sight of him and the significance of his wounds reduced me to a state of astonishment which could find no outlet in words i simply stood and stared at him lady angela however after her first exclamation of surprise went up and greeted him  why my dear mostyn she exclaimed wherever have you sprung from and what have you been doing to yourself  i came from londonnewspaper train he answered  and your head and arm  thrown out of a hansom last night he said grimly  we were all silent for a moment so far as i was concerned speech was altogether beyond me lady angela too seemed to find something disconcerting in rays searching gaze  my welcome he remarked quietly does not seem to be overpowering  lady angela laughed but there was a note of unreality in her mirth  you must expect people to be amazed mostyn she said if you treat them to such surprises of course i am glad to see you have you seen blenavon yet  i have not been to the house he answered i came straight here  and your luggage she asked  lost he answered tersely i only just caught the train and the porter seems to have missed me  you appear to have passed through a complete chapter of mishaps she remarked never mind you must want your lunch very badly or do you want to talk to mr ducaine  next to the walk up to the house with you he answered i think that i want my lunch more than anything in the world  lady angela smiled her farewells at me and ray nodded curtly i watched them pass through the plantation and stroll across the park there was nothing very loverlike in their attitude ray seemed scarcely to be glancing towards his companion lady angela had the air of one absorbed in thought i watched them until they disappeared and then i entered my own abode and sat down mechanically before the lunch which grooton had prepared i ate and drank as one in a dream only last night ray had said nothing about coming to braster yet there he was without luggage with his arm and head bound up just like this i expected to see the man whom i had struck last night  now though rays attitude towards me was often puzzling an absolute faith in his honesty was the one foundation which i had felt solid beneath my feet during these last few weeks of strange happenings this was the first blow which my faith had received and i felt that at any cost i must know the truth after lunch i finished the papers which when complete it was my duty to lock away in the library safe up at the house and secured them in my breastpocket but instead of going at once to the house i set out for braster junction  there was a porter there whom i had spoken to once or twice i called him on one side  can you tell me i asked what passengers there were from london by the newspaper train this morning  none at all sir the man answered readily  are you quite sure i asked  the man smiled  im more than sure sir the man answered because she never stopped she only sets down by signal now and we had the message no passengers from wells she went through here at forty miles an hour  i was expecting colonel ray by that train i remarked the gentleman who lectured on the war you know at the village hall  the man looked at me curiously  why he came down last night same train as you sir i know because he only got out just as the train was going on and he stepped into the station masters house to light his pipe  thank you i said giving the man a shilling i must have just missed him then  i left the station and walked home now indeed all my convictions were upset colonel ray had left me outside his clubhouse last night twenty minutes before the train started without a word of coming to braster yet he travelled down by the same train avoided me lied to lady angela and myself this morning and had exactly the sort of wounds which i had inflicted upon that unknown assailant who attacked me in the darkness if circumstantial evidence went for anything ray himself had been my aggressor  i avoided the turn by braster grange and went straight on to the village coming out of the post office i found myself face to face with blanche moyat she held out her hand eagerly  were you coming in she asked  well not today i answered i am on my way to rowchester and i am late already  she kept by my side  come in for a few moments she begged in a low tone i want to talk to you  not the old subject i hope i remarked  she looked around with an air of mystery  do you know that some one is making inquiries aboutthat man  i always thought it possible i answered that his friends might turn up some time or other  we were opposite the front of the moyats house she opened the door and beckoned me to follow i hesitated but eventually did so she led the way into the drawingroom and carefully closed the door after us  mr ducaine she said i mean it really there is some one in the village making inquiriesaboutthe man who was found dead  well i said that is not very surprising is it his friends were almost certain to turn up sooner or later  his friends but do you know who it is she asked  i sank resignedly into one of mrs moyats woolwork covered chairs an absurd little canary was singing itself hoarse almost over my head i half closed my eyes how many more problems was i to be confronted with during these longdrawnout days of mystery  oh i do not know i declared i am sure i do not care i am sorry that i ever asked you for one moment to keep your counsel about the fellow i never saw him i do not know who he was i know nothing about him and i dont want to miss moyat he may have been prince or pedlar for anything i care  well he wasnt an ordinary person after all she declared with an air of mystery have you heard of the lady whos taken braster grange shes a friend of lord blenavons hes always there  i have heard that there is such a person i answered wearily  shes been making inquiries right and lefteverywhere theres a notice in yesterdays wells gazette and a reward of fifty pounds for any one who can give any information about him sufficient to lead to identification  if you think i said that you can earn the pounds pray do not let me stand in your way  she looked at me with a fixed intentness which i found peculiarly irritating  you dont think that i care about the fifty pounds she said coming over and standing by my chair  then why take any notice of the matter at all i said all that you can disclose is that he came from the land and not from the sea and that he asked where i lived why trouble yourself or me about the matter at all there really isnt any necessity some one else probably saw him besides you and they will soon find their way to this woman  it was only to me she murmured that he spoke of you  do you believe i asked that i murdered him  she shuddered  no of course i dont she declared  then why all this nervousness and mystery i asked i have no fear of anything which might happen why should you be afraid  i am not afraid she said slowly but there is something about it which i do not understand ever since that morning you have avoided me  nonsense i exclaimed  it is not nonsense she answered it is the truth you used to come sometimes to see fatherand now you never come near the place it istoo bad of you she went on with a little sob i thought that after that morning and my promising to do what you asked that we should be greater friends than ever instead of that you have never been near us since and i dont care who knows it i am miserable  she was leaning against the arm of my chair it was clearly my duty to administer the consolation which the situation demanded i realized however that the occasion was critical and i ignored her proximity  miss moyat i said i am sorry if asking you to tell that harmless little fib has made you miserable i simply desired  it isnt altogether that she interrupted you know it isnt  you give me credit for greater powers of divination than i possess i answered calmly your father was always very kind to me and i can assure you that i have not forgotten it but i have work to do now and i have scarcely an hour to spare mr moyat would understand it i am sure  the door was suddenly opened mrs moyat fat and comely came in she surveyed us both with a friendly and meaning smile which somehow made my cheeks burn it was no fault of mine that blanche had been hanging over my chair  come she said im sure im very glad to see you once more mr ducaine such a stranger as you are too but you dont mean to sit in here without a fire all the afternoon i suppose blanche tea is just ready in the diningroom bring mr ducaine along blanche  i held out my hand  i am sorry that i cannot stop mrs moyat i said goodafternoon miss moyat  she looked me in the eyes  you are not going she murmured  i am afraid i answered that it is imperative i ought to have been at rowchester long ago we are too near neighbours though not to see something of one another again before long  well im sure theres no need to hurry so mrs moyat declared backing out of the room blanche you see if you cant persuade mr ducaine fatherll be home early this evening too  i think blanche said that mr ducaine has made up his mind  she walked with me to the hall door but she declined to shake hands with me her appearance was little short of tragic i think that at another time i might have been amused for never in my life had i spoken more than a few courteous words to the girl but my nerves were all on edge and i took her seriously i walked down the street leaving her standing in the threshold with the door open as though anxious to give me a chance to return if i would i looked back at the corner and waved my hand there was something almost threatening in the grim irresponsive figure standing watching me and making no pretence at returning my farewellwatching me with steady eyes and closedrawn brows    chapter xxiii  mostyn ray explains  i walked straight to the house and locked up my papers in the great safe i had hoped to escape without seeing either ray or lady angela but as i crossed the hall they issued from the billiardroom lady angela turned towards me eagerly  mr ducaine she exclaimed have you seen anything of lord blenavon today  i shook my head  i have not seen him for several days lady angela i answered  ray said something to her which i could not hear she nodded and left us together  it seems he said that this amiable young gentleman is more or less in the clutches of our siren friend at braster grange i think that you and i had better go and dig him out  thank you i answered but i had all i wanted of braster grange last night  pooh he answered lightly you are not even scratched they are clumsy conspirators there i think that you and i are a match for them come along  you must excuse me colonel ray i said but i have no desire to visit braster grange even with you  lady angela whose crossing the hall had been noiseless suddenly interposed  you are quite right mr ducaine she said but this is no visit of courtesy is it i am sure that my brother would never stay there voluntarily something must have happened to him  we will go and see ray declared come along ducaine  i hesitated but a glance from lady angela settled the matter for another such i would have walked into hell ray and i started off together and i was not long before i spoke of the things which were in my mind  colonel ray i said when i saw you this morning you made two statements both of which were false  ray brought out his pipe and began to fill it in leisurely fashion  go on he said what were they  the first was that you had come down from london by the newspaper train this morning and the second was that you had received your injuries in a hansom cab accident  his pipe was started and he puffed out dense volumes of smoke with an air of keen enjoyment  worst of having a woman for your hostess he remarked one cant smoke except a sickly cigarette or two you should take to a pipe ducaine  will you be good enough to explain those two misstatements colonel ray  lies both of them he answered with grim cheerfulness rotten lies and i hate telling em the hansom cab accident must have sounded a bit thin  it did i assured him  he removed his pipe from his teeth and pushed down the tobacco with the end of his finger  i came down from town by the same train that you did he said and as for my broken head and smashed arm you did it yourself  i imagined so i answered perhaps you will admit that you owe me some explanation he laughed a deep bass laugh and looked down at me with a gleam of humour in his black eyes  come he said i think that the boot is on the other leg my head is exceedingly painful and my leg is very stiff for a young man of your build you have a most surprising muscle  i am to understand then that it was you who committed an unprovoked assault upon mewho planned to have me waylaid in that dastardly fashion  do you think ray asked quietly that i should be such a damned fool  what am i to think then what am i to believe i asked with a sudden anger you found me starving and you gave me employment but ever since i started my work life has become a huge ugly riddle are you my friend or my enemy i do not know there is a drama being played out before my very eyes the figures in it move about me continually yet i alone am blindfolded i am trusted to almost an incredible extent great issues are confided to me i have been given such a post as a man might work for a lifetime to secure yet where a little confidence would give me zest for my workwould take away this horrible sense of moving always in the darknessit is withheld from me  ray smoked on in silence for several moments  well he said i am not sure that you are altogether unreasonable but on the other hand you must not forget that there is method and a good deal of it in the very things of which you complain there are certain positions in which a man may find himself where a measure of ignorance is a blessed thing believe me that if you understood your difficulties would increase instead of diminish  i shrugged my shoulders  but between you and me at least colonel ray i said there is a plain issue you can explain the events of last night to me  i will do that he answered since you have asked it briefly then i parted from you on the steps of my club at a few minutes past nine last night  yes  i saw from the moment we appeared that you were being watched i saw the man who was loitering on the pavement lean over to hear the address you gave to the cabman and you were scarcely away before he was following you but it was only just as he drove by leaning a little forward in his hansom that i saw his face i recognized him for one of that womans most dangerous confederates and i knew then that some villainy was on foot to cut a long story short i came down unobserved in your train followed you to braster grange and was only a yard or two behind when this fellow who acts as the womans chauffeur sprang out upon you i was unfortunately a little two quick to the rescue and received a smash on the head from your stick then you bolted and i found myself engaged with a pair of them on the whole i think that they got the worst of it  the other onewas lord blenavon i exclaimed  it was  then he is concerned in the plots which are going on against us i continued i felt certain of it what a blackguard  for his sisters sake colonel ray said softly i want to keep him out of it if i can therefore i hit him a little harder than was necessary he should be hors de combat for some time  but why didnt you cry out to me i said i should not have run if i had known that i had an ally there  to run was exactly what i wanted you to do ray answered you had the dispatchbox and i wanted to see you safe away  i glanced at his bandaged head and arm  i suppose that i ought to apologize to you i said  under the circumstances he declared we will cry quits  then as we walked together in the glittering spring sunshine this big silent man and i there came upon me a swift poignant impulse the keener perhaps because of the loneliness of my days to implore him to unravel all the things which lay between us i wanted the story of that night of my concern in it stripped bare already my lips were opened when round the corner of the rough lane by which braster grange was approached on this side came a doctors gig ray shaded his eyes and gazed at its occupant  is this bouriggs ducaine he asked the man who shot with us  it is dr bouriggs i answered  ray stopped the gig and exchanged greetings with the big sandyhaired man who held a rein in each hand as though he were driving a market wagon they chatted for a moment or two idly enough as it seemed to me  any one ill at the grange doctor ray asked at length  the doctor looked at him curiously  i have just come from there he answered there is nothing very seriously wrong  can you tell me if lord blenavon is there ray asked  the doctor hesitated  it was hinted to me colonel ray he said that my visit to the grange was not to be spoken of you will understand of course that the etiquette of our profession  quite right ray interrupted the fact is lady angela is very anxious about her brother who did not return to rowchester last night and she has sent us out as a search party of course if you were able to help us she would be very gratified  the doctor hesitated  the duke and in fact all the family have always been exceedingly kind to me he remarked looking straight between his horses ears under the circumstances you mention if you were to assert that lord blenavon was at braster grange i do not think that i should contradict you  ray smiled  thank you doctor he said good morning  the doctor drove on and we pursued our way  it was a very dark night ray said half to himself but if blenavon was the man i hit he ought to have a cracked skull  after all our interrogation of the doctor was quite unnecessary we were admitted at once to the grange by a neatlydressed parlourmaid mrs smithlessing was at home and the girl did not for a moment seem to doubt her mistresss willingness to receive us as she busied herself poking the fire and opening wider the thick curtains ray asked her another question  do you know if lord blenavon is here  yes sir the girl answered promptly he was brought in last night rather badly hurt but he is much better this morning i will let mrs smithlessing know that you are here sir  she hurried out with the rustle of stiff starch and the quick lightfootedness of the welltrained servant ray and i exchanged glances  after all this is not such a home of mystery as we expected i remarked  apparently not he answered the little woman is playing a bold game  then mrs smithlessing came in    chapter xxiv  lord blenavons surrender  she came in very quietly a little pale and wan in this cold evening light she held out her hand to me with a subdued but charming smile of welcome  i am so glad that you have come to see me she said softly you can help me too about this unfortunate young man who has been thrown upon my hands i  then she saw ray and the words seemed to die away upon her lips i had to steel my heart against her to shut out the pity which i could scarcely help feeling she was white to the lips she stood as one turned to stone with her distended eyes fixed upon him it was like a trapped bird watching its impending fate she faltered a little on her feet andi could not help iti hurried to her side with a chair as she sank into it she thanked me with a very plaintive smile  thank you she said simply i am not very strong and i did not know that man was with you  ray broke in his voice sounded harsh his manner i thought was unnecessarily brutal  i can understand he said that you find my presence a little unwelcome i need scarcely say that this is not a visit of courtesy you know very well that willingly i would never spend a moment under the same roof as you i am here to speak a few plain words to which you will do well to listen  she raised her eyes to his her courage seemed to be returning at the note of battle in his tone her small wellshaped head was thrown back the hands which grasped the sides of her chair ceased to tremble  go on she said  we will not play at cheap diplomacy he said sneeringly i know you by a dozen names which you alter and adopt to suit the occasion you are a creature of the french police one of those parasitical creatures who live by sucking the honesty out of simpler persons you are here because the more private meetings of the english council of defence are being held at rowchester it is your object by bribery or theft or robbery or the seductive use of those wonderful charms of yours to gain possession of copies of any particulars whatever about the english autumn manoeuvres which curiously enough have been arranged as a sort of addendum to those on your side of the channel you have an ally i regret to say in the dukes son you are seeking to gain for yourself a far more valuable one in the person of this boy you say to yourself no doubt like father like son you ruined and disgraced the one you think perhaps the other will be as easy  stop she cried  he looked at her curiously her face was drawn with pain in her eyes was the look of a being stricken to death  it is terrible she murmured that men so coarse and brutal as you should have the gift of speech i do not wish to ask for any mercy from you but if i am to stay here and listen you will speak only of facts  he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously  you should be hardened by this time he said but i forgot that we had an audience it is always worth while to play a little to the gallery isnt it well facts then the boy is warned against you and from today this house is watched by picked detectives blenavon can avail you nothing for he knows nothing such clumsy schemes as last nights are foredoomed to failure and will only get you into trouble you will waste your time here take my advice and go  she rose to her feet smaller and frailer than ever she seemed as she stood before ray dark and massive  your story is plausible she said coldly it may even be true but apart from that i had another and a greater reason for coming to england for coming to braster i came to seek my husbandthe father of this boy i am even now in search of him  i held my breath and gazed at ray for the moment it seemed as though the tables were turned no signs of emotion were present in his face but he seemed to have no words he simply looked at her  he left me in january she continued determined at least to have speech with his son he heard then for the first time of the absconding trustee he came to england if not to implore his sons forgiveness at least to place him above want and in this country he has never been heard of he has disappeared i am here to find him perhaps she added leaning a little over towards ray and in a slightly altered tone perhaps you can help me  again it seemed to me that ray was troubled by a certain speechlessness when at last he found words they and his tone were alike harsh almost violent  do you think he said that i would stretch out the little finger of my hand to help you or him you know very well that i would not the pair of you in my opinion were long since outside the pale of consideration from any living being if he is lost so much the better if he is dead so much the better still  it is because i know how you feel towards him she said slowly that i wonderedyes i wondered  well  whether you could not if you chose solve for me the mystery of his disappearance  there was as much as a dozen seconds or so of tense silence between them she never once flinched the cold question of her eyes seemed to burn its way into the mans composure a fierce exclamation broke from his lips  if he were dead he said and if it were my hand which had removed him i should count it amongst the best actions of my life  she looked at him curiouslyas one might regard a wild beast  you can speak like this before his son  i veil my words at no time and for no man he answered the truth is always best  then the door opened and blenavon entered his arm and head were bandaged and he walked with a limp he was deathly pale and apparently very nervous he attempted a casual greeting with ray but it was a poor pretence ray for his part had evidently no mind to beat about the bush  lord blenavon he said this house is no fit place for your fathers son i have warned you before but the time for advice is past your hostess here is a creature of the french police and her business here is to suborn you and others whom she can buy or cajole into a treasonable breach of confidence it is very possible that you know all this and more but i appeal to you as an englishman and the representative of a great english family are you willing to leave at once with us and to depart altogether from this part of the country or will you face the consequences  blenavon was a coward he shook and stammered he was not even master of his voice  i do not understand you he faltered you have no right to speak to me like this  right or no right i do ray answered if you refuse i shall not spare you last night was only one incident of many i break my faith as a soldier by giving you this opportunity will you come  i am waiting now for a carriage blenavon answered i have sent to the house for one  you will not return to the house ray said shortly you will leave here for the station the station for london and london for the continent you do this and i hold my peace you refuse and i see lord chelsford and your father tonight  from the first i knew that he would yield but he did it with an ill grace  i dont see why i should go he said sulkily  either you and i together or i alone are going to catch the six oclock train to london ray said if i go alone you will be an exile from england for the rest of your life your name will be removed from every club to which you belong and you will have brought irreparable disgrace upon your family the choice is yours  blenavon turned towards the woman as though for aid but she stood with her back to him pale and with a thin scornful smile upon her lips  the choice ray repeated glancing at his watch is yours but the time is short  i will go blenavon said i was off in a day or two anyway of what you suspect me i dont know and i dont care but i will go  ray put his watch into his pocket he turned to mrs smithlessing  better come too he said quietly you have no more chance here every one knows now who and what you are  she looked at him with white expressionless face  it does not suit me to leave the neighbourhood at present she said calmly  if she had been a man ray would have struck her i could see his white teeth clenched fiercely together  it does not suit me he said in a low tone vibrate with suppressed passion to have you here you are a plague spot upon the place you have been a plague spot all your life whatever you touch you corrupt  she shrank away for a moment after all she was a woman and i hated ray for his brutality  what a butcher you are she said looking at him curiously if ever you should marrygod help the woman  there are women and women he answered roughly as for you you do not count in the sex at all   she turned away from him with a little shudder and for the first time during the interview she hid her face in her hands it was all i could do to avoid speech  come he said do you agree will you leave this place i promise you that your schemes here at any rate are at an end  she turned to me perhaps something in my face had spoken the sympathy which i could not wholly suppress  guy she said i want to be rid of this man because every word he speakshurts but i cannot even look at him any more at this war of words he has won i am beaten i admit it i am crushed i am not going away i spoke truthfully when i said that i came to england in search of your father we may both of us be the creatures that man would have you believe but we have been husband and wife for eighteen years and it is my duty to find out what has become of him therefore i stay  i could see rays black eyes flashing he almost gripped my arm as he drew me away we three left the house together at the bottom of the drive we met a carriage sent down from rowchester ray stopped it  blenavon and i will take this carriage to the station he said will you ducaine return to lady angela and tell her exactly what has happened  oh come im not going to have that blenavon exclaimed  it will not be unexpected news ray said sternly your sister suspects already  im not going to be bundled away and leave you to concoct any precious story you think fit blenavon declared doggedly i  ray opened the carriage door and gripped blenavons arm get in he said in a low suppressed tone there was something almost animal in the fury of rays voice i looked away with a shudder blenavon stepped quietly into the carriage then ray came over to me and as he looked searchingly into my face he pointed up the carriage drive  boy he said you are young and in hell itself there cannot be many such as she you think me brutal it is because i rememberyour mother  he stepped into the carriage i turned round and set out for rowchester    chapter xxv  my secret  there followed for me another three days of unremitting work then midway through one morning i threw my pen from me with a great sense of relief they might come or send for me when they chose i had finished my eyes were hot and my brain weary instinctively i threw open my front door and it seemed to me that the sun and the wind and the birds were calling  so i walked northwards down on the beach across the grasssprinkled sandhills and the mudbottomed marshes i walked with my cap stuffed in my pocket my head bared to the freshening wind and all the way i met no living creature as i walked my thoughts which had been concentrated for these last few days upon my work went back to that terrible halfhour at braster grange i thought of ray i realized now that for days past i had been striving not to think of him the mans sheer brutality appalled me i believed in him now wholly i believed at least in his honesty his vigorous and trenchant loyalty but the ways of the man were surely brutal to torture even vermin caught in the trap and that woman adventuress though she might be had flinched before him in agony as though her very nerves were being hacked out of her body and blenavon too surely he might have remembered that he was her brother he might have helped him to retain just a portion of his selfrespect was he as severe on every measure of wrongdoing i fancied to myself the meeting on that lonely road between the poor whitefaced creature who had looked in upon my window and this strong merciless man warmed with exercise as i was i shivered ray reminded me of those grim figures of the old testament an eye for an eye a life for a life were precepts with him indeed he was as inexorable as fate itself i feared him and i knew why i feared him when i thought of angela almost oversensitive so delicate a flower to be held in his strong merciless grasp i walked faster and faster for thoughts were crowding in upon me such a tangled web such bitter sweetness as they held for me these were the thoughts which in those days it was the struggle of my life to keep from coming to fruition i knew very well that if once i gave way to them flight alone could save me for the love of her was in my nerves in every beat of my pulse a wild and beautiful dream against which i was fighting always a hopeless battle  far away coming towards me along the sands i saw her i stopped short for a moment my heart was hot with joy then i looked wildly around thinking of flight it was not possible already she had seen me she waved her hand and increased her pace walking with the swift effortless grace of her beautiful young limbs her head thrown back a welcoming smile already parting her lips i set my teeth and prepared myself for the meeting afterwards would come the pain but for the present the joy of seeing her of being with her was everything i hastened forward  i could not stay indoors she said as she turned by my side although i have an old aunt and some very uninteresting visitors to entertain besides i have news my father is coming down today and i think some of the others we have just had a telegram  i am glad i answered i have just finished my work and i want some more  you are insatiable she declared smiling you have written for three days days and nights too i believe and you look like a ghost you ought to take a rest now you ought to want one at any rate  then the smile faded from her lips and the anxiety of a sudden thought possessed her  i have not heard a word from colonel ray she said it terrifies me to think that he may have told my father about blenavon  you must insist upon it that he does not i declared your brother has left england has he not  he is at ostend  then colonel ray will keep his word i assured her besides you have written to him have you not  i have written she answered still i am afraid he will do what he thinks right whatever it may be  he will respect your wishes i said  she smiled a little bitterly  he is not an easy person to influence she murmured i doubt whether my wishes even my prayers would weigh with him a particle against his own judgment and he is severevery severe  i said nothing and we walked for some time in silence  next week she said abruptly i must go back to london  it was too sudden i could not keep back the little exclamation of despair she walked for some time with her head turned away from me as though something on the dark clear horizon across the waters had fascinated her but i caught a glimpse of her face and i knew that my secret had escaped me whether i was glad or sorry i could not tell my thoughts were all in hopeless confusions when she spoke there was a certain reserve in her tone i knew that things would never again be exactly the same between us yet she was not angry i hugged that thought to myself she was startled and serious but she was not angry  one season is very much like another she said but it is not possible to absent oneself altogether then afterwards there is cowes and homburg and i always have a plan for at least three weeks in scotland i believe we shall close rowchester altogether  the duke i asked  he never spends the summer here she answered we are generally together after july so perhaps she added you may have to endure more of my company than you think  she looked at me with a faint provoking smile how dare she i was master of myself now and i answered her coldly  i shall be very sorry to leave here i said i hope if my work lasts so long that i shall be able to go on with it at the brand  she made no answer to that but in a moment or two she turned and looked at me thoughtfully  you are rather a surprising person she remarked in many ways and you certainly have strange tastes  is it a strange taste to love this place i asked  of course not but on time other hand it is strange that you should be content to remain here indefinitely solitude is all very well at times but at your age i think that the vigorous life of a great city should have many attractions for you life here after all must become something of an abstraction  it contents me i declared shortly  then i am not sure that you are in an altogether healthy frame of mind she answered coolly have you no ambitions  such as i have i muttered are hopeless they were built on sandand they have fallen  then reconstruct them she said you are far too young to speak with such a note of finality  some day i answered i suppose i shall at present i am content to live on amongst the fragments one needs only imagination the things one dreams about are always more beautiful and perhaps more satisfying than the things one does  again our eyes met and i fancied that this time she was looking a little frightened at any rate she knew i was sure of that  what an ineffective sort of proceeding she murmured  a creek separated us for a few minutes when we came together again i asked her a question  there is something lady angela i said which if you would forgive the impertinence of it i should very much like to ask you  she moved her head slowly as though giving a tacit consent but i do not think that she was quite prepared for what i asked her  when are you going to marry colonel ray  she looked at me quickly almost furtively and i saw that her cheeks were flushed there was a look in her eyes too which i could not fathom  the date is not decided yet she said you know there is some talk of trouble in egypt and if so he might have to leave at a moments notice  it will not be at any rate before the autumn then i persisted  no  i drew a little breath of relief i was reckless whether she heard it or not suddenly she paused  who is that she asked  i recognized him at oncea small grey figure standing on the top of a sandhill a little way off and regarding us steadily it was the duke  your father i said  we quickened our pace if lady angela was in any way discomposed she showed no signs of it she waved her hand and the duke solemnly removed his hat  i am so glad that he has come down before the others she said i am longing to have a talk with him and i dont believe he knows anything about blenavon no hes far too cheerful  she went straight up to him and passed her arm through his he greeted me stiffly but not unkindly  i am so glad that you have come she said if i had not heard i should have telegraphed to you ive seen it in all the papers  you approve i heard him ask quietly  approve is not the word she declared eagerly it is magnificent  i wonder he asked if you realize what it means  it simply doesnt matter she answered with a delightful smile i can make my own dresses if you like annette is a shocking nuisance to me  i am afraid he remarked with an odd little smile that blenavon will scarcely regard the matter in the same light  bother blenavon she answered lightly i suppose you know that hes gone off abroad somewhere  i had a hurried line from him with information to that effect the duke answered i think that it would have been more respectful if he had called to see me on his way through london  i heard her sigh of relief  now tell me she begged where shall we begin cowes homburg town house or annette im ready  the duke looked at her for a moment as i had never seen him look at any living person  you must not exaggerate to yourself the importance of this affair angela he said i do not think we need interfere for the present with any existing arrangements  she took his arm and they walked on ahead to the clearing in front of my cottage talking earnestly together i had no clue to the meaning of those first few sentences which had passed between them and needless to say i now lingered far enough behind to be out of earshot when they reached the turn in the path they halted and waited for me  i am anxious for a few minutes conversation inside with you ducaine the duke said angela you had better perhaps not wait for me  she nodded her farewell a brief imperious little gesture it seemed to me with very little of kindliness in it then the duke followed me into my sittingroom i waited anxiously to hear what he had to say    chapter xxvi  noblesse oblige  the duke selected my most comfortable easy chair and remained silent for several minutes looking thoughtfully out of the window notwithstanding the fresh colour which he seldom lost and the trim perfection of his dress i could see at once that there was a change in him the lines about his mouth were deeper his eyes had lost much of their keen brightness i found myself wondering whether after all some suspicion of lord blenavons doings had found its way to him  you are well forward with your work i trust mr ducaine he said at last  it is completed your grace i answered  the proposed subway fortifications as well as the new battery stations  yes your grace  what about the maps  i have done them also to the best of my ability sir i answered i am not a very expert draughtsman i am afraid but these are at least accurate if you would care to look them over they are in the library safe  and the code word  in accordance with our usual custom i scribbled it upon a piece of paper and held it for a moment before his eyes then i carefully destroyed it  tomorrow he said perhaps tonight we have some railway men coming down to thoroughly discuss the most efficient method of moving troops from aldershot and london to different points and to inaugurate a fresh system you had better hold yourself in readiness to come up to the house at any moment they are business men and their time is valuable they will probably want to work from the moment of their arrival until they go  very good your grace i answered  he turned his head and looked at me for a moment reflectively  you remember our conversation at the war office mr ducaine  yes your grace  i do not wish you to have a false impression as to my meaning at that time he said coldly i do not i have never doubted your trustworthiness my feeling was and is that you are somewhat young and of an impetuous disposition for a post of such importance that feeling was increased of course by the fact that i considered your story with reference to the prince of malors improbable to the last degree in justice to you he continued more slowly i must now admit the possibility that your description of that incident may after all be in accordance with the facts certain facts have come to my knowledge which tend somewhat in that direction i shall consider it a favour therefore if you will consider my remarks at that interview retracted  i thank your grace very much i answered  with reference to the other matter he continued there my opinion remains unaltered i do not believe that the papers in the safe were touched after you yourself deposited them there and i consider your statement to the contrary a most unfortunate one but the fact remains that you have done your work faithfully and the council is satisfied with your services that being so you may rely upon it that any feeling i may have in the matter i shall keep to myself  i would have expressed my gratitude to him but he checked me  there is he said one other a more personal matter concerning which i desired a few words with you i have had a visit from a relative of yours who is also an old friend of my own i refer to sir michael trogoldy  i looked at him in amazement i was in fact so surprised that i said nothing at all  sir michael it seems has been making inquiries about you and learned of your present position the duke continued he asked me certain questions which i was glad to be able to answer on your behalf he also entrusted me with a note which i have here in my pocket  he produced it and laid it upon the table i made no movement to take it  the details of your family history the duke said are unknown to me but if the advice of an old man is in any way acceptable to you i should strongly recommend you to accept any offer of friendship which sir michael may make he is an old man and he is possessed of considerable wealth further i gather that you are his nearest relative  sir michael was very cruel to my mother sir i said slowly  you have nothing to gain by the harbouring of ancient grievances the duke replied i have always known sir michael as a just if a somewhat stern man please however do not look upon me in any way as a wouldbe mediator my interest in this matter ceases with the delivery of that letter  the duke rose to his feet i followed him to the door  in any case sir i said i am very much obliged to you for your advice and for bringing me this letter  bythebye the duke said pausing on the threshold i fear that we may lose the help of colonel ray upon the council there are rumours of serious trouble in the soudan and if these are in any way substantiated he will be certainly sent there good afternoon mr ducaine  good afternoon your grace  so he left me stiff formal having satisfied his conscience though i felt in my heart that his opinion of me once formed was not likely to be changed directly i was alone i opened my uncles letter  127 grosvenor square  london w  dear guy  it has been on my mind more than once during the last few yearsever since in fact i heard of you at collegeto write and inform myself as to your prospects in life you are the son of my only sister although i regret to say that you are the son also of a man who disgraced himself and his profession you have a claim upon me which you have made no effort to press perhaps i do not think the worse of you for that in any case i wish you to accept an allowance of which my lawyers will advise you and if you will call upon me when you are in town i shall be glad to make your acquaintance i may say that it was a pleasure to me to learn that you have succeeded in obtaining a responsible and honourable post  i am yours sincerely  michael trogoldy  i took pen and paper and answered this letter at once  my dear sir michael  as i am your nephew and i understand almost your nearest relative i see no reason why i should not accept the allowance which you are good enough to offer me i shall also be glad to come and see you next time i am in london if it is your wish  yours sincerely  guy ducaine  grooton brought in my tea also a london morning paper which he had secured in the village  i thought that you might be interested in the news about the duke sir he said respectfully  what news grooton i asked stretching out my hand for the paper  you will find a leading article on the second page sir and another in the money news it reads quite extraordinary sir  i opened the paper eagerly i read every word of the leading article which was entitled noblesse oblige and all the paragraphs in the money column what i read did not surprise me in the least when once i had read the circumstances it was just what i should have expected from the duke it seemed that he had lent his name to the prospectus of a company formed for the purpose of working some worthless patent designed to revolutionize the silk weaving trade the dukes reason for going on the board was purely philanthropic he had hoped to restore an ancient industry in a decaying neighbourhood the whole thing turned out to be a swindle one angry shareholder stated plainly at the meeting that he had taken his shares on account of the dukes name upon the prospectus and hinted ugly things the duke had risen calmly in his place he assured them that he fully recognized his responsibilities in the matter if the person who had last spoken was in earnest when he stated that the dukes name had induced him to take shares in this company then he was prepared to relieve him of those shares at the price which he had paid for them further if there was any other persons who were able honestly to say that the name of the duke of rowchester upon the prospectus had induced them to invest their money in this concern his offer extended also to them  there were roars of applause wild enthusiasm it was magnificent but the lowest estimate of what it would cost the duke was a hundred thousand pounds  i put down the paper and my cheeks were flushed with enthusiasm i think that if the duke had been there at that moment i could have kissed his hand i passed with much less interest to the letter which grooton had brought in with the paper it was from a firm of solicitors in lincolns inn and it informed me in a few precise sentences that they had the authority of their client sir michael trogoldy to pay me yearly the sum of five hundred pounds    chapter xxvii  friend or enemy  there came no summons from rowchester and i dined alone i must have dozed over my afterdinner cigarette for at first that soft rapping seemed to come to me from a long way off then i sat up in my chair with a start my cigarette had burnt out my coffee was cold i had been asleep and outside some one was knocking at my front door  i had sent grooton to the village with letters and i was alone in the place i sprang from my chair just as the handle of the door was turned and a woman stepped quietly in she was wrapped from head to foot in a long cloak and she was thickly veiled but i knew her at once it was mrs smithlessing  my first impulse was one of anger it seemed to me that she was taking advantage of the sympathy which rays brutality during our last interview had forced from me i spoke to her coldly almost angrily  mrs smithlessing i said i regret that i cannot receive you here my position just now does not allow me to receive visitors  she simply raised her veil and sank into the nearest chair i was staggered when i saw her face it was positively haggard and her eyes were burning she looked at me almost with horror  i had to come she said i could not keep away a moment longer tell me the truth guy ducaine the truth mind she repeated fearfully  what do you mean i asked bewildered i do not understand you  tell me the truth about that man who came to see you on the seventh of january  i shook my head  i have nothing to tell you i said firmly when i found him on the marshes he was dead i did not hear till afterwards that he had ever asked for me  this is the truth she asked eagerly  it is the truth i answered  i could see the relief shine in her face she was still anxious however  is it true she asked that you told a girl in the village blanche moyat to keep secret the fact that this man inquired in the village for the way to your cottage  that also is true i admitted she did not tell me until afterwards and i saw no purpose in publishing the fact that the man had been on his way to see me  you have been very foolish she said you have quarrelled with the girl she is telling this against you and there will be trouble  i cannot help it i answered i never spoke to the man i saw nothing of him until i found him dead  guy she cried this is an awful thing i am not sure but i believe that the man was your father  as often as the thought had comae to me i had thrust it away this time however there was no escape the whole hideous scene spread itself out again before my eyes i saw the doubledup body limp and nerveless i felt again the thrill of horror with which one looks for the first time on death the mockery of the sunlight filling the air gleaming far and wide upon the creekriven marshes and wet sands the singing of the birds the slow tramp of the wagon horses all these things went to fill up that one terrible picture i looked at the woman opposite to me and in her face was some reflection of the horror which i as surely felt  for your sake she murmured we must find out how he met with his death  the verdict was found drowned i murmured  people will change their opinion now she answered besides you and i know that he was not drowned  you are sure of that i asked  quite she answered he had letters with him i know and papers for you besides he carried always with him a number of trifles by which he could have been identified when he was searched at the police station his pockets were empty he had been robbed guy he had as i have had one unflinching relentless enemy tell me was colonel ray in braster at the time  no i answered hoarsely i cannot tell you i will have no more to do with it the matter is overlet it rest  but my poor boy she said quietly it will not be allowed to rest cant you see that this girls statement does away with the theory that he was washed up from the sea he met with his death there on the sands he left braster to visit you and he was found within a few yards of your cottage dead and with marks of violence upon him you will be suspected perhaps charged it is inevitable now tell me the truth was mostyn ray in braster at the time  he lectured that night in the village i answered  her eyes gleamed with a strange fire  i knew it she exclaimed i have him at last then i saw him falter when i spoke of your father guy i will save you but i would give the rest of my days to bring this home to mostyn ray  i shook my head  you will never do it i declared there might be suspicion but there will never be any proof if there was any murder done at all it was done without witnesses  we shall see about that she muttered there is what you call circumstantial evidence it has hanged people before now  we remained silent for several moments all this time she was watching me  guy she said softly you are very like what he wasat your age  her cloak had fallen back she was wearing a black evening gown with a string of pearls around her neck the excitement had given her a faint colour and something like tears softened her eyes as she looked across at me but the more i looked at her the more anxious i was to see her no more her words reminded me of the past i remembered that it was she who had been my fathers evil genius she who had brought this terrible disgrace upon him and this cloud over my own life i rose to my feet  i do not wish to ask for any favours from you i said but i will ask you to remember that if you are seen here i shall certainly lose my post  what does it matter she answered contemptuously i am not a rich woman guy but i know how to earn money mostyn ray would not believe it perhaps but i loved your father yours has been a miserable little life come with me and i promise that i will show you how to make it great you have no relatives or any ties i promise you that i will be a model stepmother  i looked at her bewildered  it is not possible for me to do anything of the sort i told her i do not wish to seem unkind but nothing in this world would induce me to consider such a thing for a moment i have chosen my life and the manner of it do you think that i can ever forget that you and my father between you broke my mothers heart and made it necessary for me to be brought up without friends ashamed of my name and of my history one does not forget these things i bear you no ill will but i wish that you would go away  she sat there quite quietly listening to me  guy she said when i had finished all that you speak of happened many years ago there is forgiveness for everybody isnt there you and i are almost alone in the world i want to be your friend you might find me a more powerful one than you think try me i will make your future mine you shall have your own way in all things i know the hills and the valleys of life the underneath and the matchless places if you accept my offer you will never regret it i can be a faithful friend or a relentless enemy between you and me guy there can be no middle course i want to be your friend dont make me your enemy  the woman puzzled me she had every appearance of being in earnest yet the things which she proposed were absurd  this is folly i answered her i cannot count it anything else do you suppose that i want to creep through life at a womans apronstrings i am old enough and strong enough i hope to think and act for myself my career is my own to make or to mar i do not wish for enmity from any one but your friendship i cannot accept our ways lie aparta long way apart  do not be too sure of that she said quietly i think that you and i may come together again very soon and it is possible that you may need my help  all that i need now i answered impatiently is your absence  she rose at once from her chair  very well she said i will go only let me warn you that i am a persistent woman i think that it will not be very long before you will see things differently will you shake hands with me guy  her small white fingers came hesitatingly out from under her cloak i did not stop to think to what my action might commit me whether indeed it was seemly that i should accept any measure of friendship from this woman i took her hand and held it for a moment in mine  you cannot go back alone i said doubtfully as i opened the door  i have a servant waiting close by she answered and i am not at all afraid think over what i have said to youand goodbye  she drew her cloak around her and flitted away into the darkness    chapter xxviii  a womans tongue  grooton returned a few minutes later from the village he begged the favour of a few words with me he was a man of impassive features and singular quietness of demeanour yet it was obvious that something had happened to disturb him  i think it only right sir that you should know of the reports which are circulating in the neighbourhood he said fixing his dark grave eyes respectfully upon me i called for a few minutes at the inn and made it my business to listen  do these reports concern me grooton i asked  they do sir  go ahead then i told him  they refer also sir he said to the man who was found dead near the cottage where you used to live in january last he was supposed to have been washed up from the sea but it has recently been stated that he was seen on the evening of the day before his body was found in the village and it is also stated that he inquired from a certain person as to the whereabouts of your cottage he set out with the intention of calling upon you and he was found dead in the morning by you sir within a hundred yards of where you were living  anything else grooton  there is a lot of foolish talk sir he is said to have been a relative of yours with whom you were not on good terms and the young lady who has just given this information to the police through her father states that she has remained silent up to now at your request  i am supposed then i said to be concerned in this fellows death  i have heard that opinion openly expressed sir grooton assented respectfully  i nodded  thank you grooton i said i shall be prepared then for anything that may happen if you hear anything further let me know  i shall not fail to do so sir he answered  he bowed and withdrew then as i lit my pipe and resumed my seat it suddenly occurred to me that the man who was chiefly concerned in this matter should at least be warned i sat down at my desk and wrote to ray i had scarcely finished when i heard footsteps outside followed by an imperious knocking at my front door i opened it at once the duke and lady angela entered i saw at once from her disturbed expression that something had happened  the duke wore a long cape over his dinner clothes and he had evidently walked fast he looked at me sharply as i rose to my feet  mr ducaine he said i have come to ask you to explain the sudden departure of my son for abroad  i was taken aback and i dare say i showed it  i have already told lady angelaall that i know i said  my daughters story the duke answered is incoherent it tells me only enough to make me sure that something is being concealed  i glanced at lady angela she was looking white and troubled  i have told my father she said all that i know  then i must discover the rest for myself the duke replied i know that blenavon is uncertain and unstable to a degree when i heard that he had left for the continent i was not particularly surprised or interested i have only just discovered the manner of his leaving it puts an entirely different complexion upon the affair i understand that he left with colonel ray without luggage or explanations of any sort his own servant had no warning and was left behind my daughter informs me that such information as she has she gained from you i require you to supplement it  i am afraid that the only person who can enlighten you further sir is colonel ray i answered i understood you to say i believe that he would be here shortly  i insist upon it the duke said sternly that you tell me what you know at once and without further prevarication  i was in a dilemma from which there seemed to be no escape lady angela had seated herself in my easy chair and was keeping her face averted from me the duke stood between us  i know very little sir except what i overheard i declared colonel ray was i believe responsible for lord blenavons abrupt departure and i would rather that your information came from him  colonel ray is not here and you are the duke answered remember that i am no trifler with words i have said that i insist i repeat it  there seemed to be no escape for me lady angela remained silent the duke was plainly insistent i did not dare to trifle with him  very good your grace i said i will tell you what i know it dates from last monday when you will remember that i was in london to attend a meeting of the council  go on  i returned here by the last train bringing with me the notes and instructions taken at that meeting outside braster grange an attack was made upon me evidently with the intention of securing these i escaped with the assistance of colonel ray who had come down from london by the same train unknown to me  well  the attack was made from the grounds of braster grange it seems that lord blenavon spent the night there the next morning colonel ray insisted upon my accompanying him to braster grange lord blenavon was still there and we saw him he was suffering from wounds such as in the darkness i had inflicted upon my assailant of the night before  it seemed to me that even then the duke would not or could not understand his brows were knitted into a heavy frown and he was evidently following my story with close attention but exactly where i was going to lead he seemed to have no idea  the tenant of braster grange i continued is a mrs smithlessing whom colonel ray has told me is a servant of the french secret police i am afraid that lord blenavon has been a good deal under her influence  then the duke blazed out which was very much what i expected from him horror amazement and scornful disbelief were all expressed in his transfigured face and angry words  blenavon my son the confederate of a french spy what nonsense who dares to suggest such a thing angelaii beg your pardon  he stopped short making an effort to regain his selfcontrol he continued in a more collected manner but his voice still shook with inexpressible scorn  angela he said turning to her is it within your knowledge that blenavon had any acquaintance with this person  i think that her face might well have answered him very white it was and very sorrowful  blenavon met mrs smithlessing i believe at bordighera she said i have seen them together several times  here the duke asked sharply  yes i have seen them riding on the sands and blenavon dined there on the nightmr ducaine has been speaking of  blenavon is a fool the duke said this is to my mind convincing proof that he was ignorant of the womans antecedents at the worst he probably regarded her as an ordinary adventuress as for the rest i look upon it as the most extraordinary mares nest which the mind of man could possibly conceive do you mean to tell me mr ducaine that colonel ray went so far as to charge blenavon to his face with being in league with this person  he certainly did sir  and blenavon oh ray is mad stark mad  your son denied it sir i answered  denied it of course he did what followed  colonel ray was very forcible and very imperative sir i answered he insisted upon lord blenavon leaving england at once  well  lord blenavon consented to do so sir i said quietly  i saw the veins in the dukes forehead stand out like whipcord he began a sentence and left it unfinished he was in that condition when words are impotent  can you tell me mr ducaine he asked what possible argument colonel ray could have made use of to induce my son to consent to this extraordinary proceeding  i know no more about the matter your grace i answered perhaps lord blenavon felt that his intimacy with mrs smithlessing had compromised himthat appearances were against him  pshaw the duke interrupted blenavons intrigues are foolish enough but they are beside the mark i want to know what further argument or inducement colonel ray used i understand neither why ray desired to get rid of my son nor why my son obeyed his ridiculous request  colonel ray will doubtless have some further explanation to offer you sir i said  he had better the duke answered grimly i shall wire him to come here at once with your permission mr ducaine i will sit down for a moment this affair has shaken me  indeed as the excitement passed away i could see that he was looking ill and worn lady angela made him take the easy chair and he accepted a liqueur glass full of brandy which i poured out he remained for several minutes sipping it and looking thoughtfully into the fire he seemed to me to have aged by a dozen years the brisk alertness of his manner had all departed he was an old man limp and querulous  this unfortunate affair mr ducaine he said looking up at last remains of course between ourselves and rayand the woman  it is unnecessary for you to ask me that sir i answered quietly colonel ray will doubtless have some explanation he is a man of vigorous temper and i fancy that lord blenavon was not quite himself  the duke rose to his feet  if you are ready angela he said we will not detain mr ducaine further  you will allow me to walk with you to the house sir i begged  he shook his head  i am quite recovered i thank you he said my daughter will give me her arm  i let them out myself and held the lamp over my head to light them on their way with slow uncertain steps and leaning heavily upon lady angelas arm i watched him disappear in the blackness of the plantation    chapter xxix  the link in the chain  practically for three days and three nights the council sat continually there was no pretence now at recreation no other guests we worked all of us from the duke downwards unflaggingly and with very little respite when at last the end came my padlocked notebook with its hundreds of pages of hieroglyphics held the principal material for three schemes of coast defence each one considered separately and supported by a mass of detail as to transport commissariat and many minor points  the principal members of the council departed by special train early on monday morning i myself a little dizzy and hoteyed walked across the park an hour after dawn and flung myself upon my bed with a deep sigh of relief before i had closed my eyes however grooton appeared with apologies for his dishabille  i have been up to the house twice sir he said but they would not let me see you or even send in a message i thought it only right to let you know at once sir that the police have been here rummaging about they had what they called a search warrant i believe i came up to the house immediately but i could not induce any of the servants to bring word in to you mr jesson the dukes own man told me that it was as much as his place was worth to allow any one to enter the library  all right grooton i muttered hang the police  i believe he said something else but i never heard it i was already fast asleep                                       about midday i was awakened by the dazzling sunshine which seemed to fill the room i called for a bath dressed and made an excellent breakfast then i brought out my notebook and prepared for work i had scarcely dipped my pen in the ink however when a shadow darkened the window i looked up quickly it was ray  he entered without knocking and i saw at once that he was in a strange condition he scarcely greeted me but sank into my easy chair and drawing out his pipe began to fill it then i saw too what i had never seen before his fingers were shaking  boy he said have you any wine  the duke sent me some claret i answered will that do  i summoned grooton and ordered the wine and some biscuits ray was a man who ate and drunk sparingly yet he filled a tumbler and drank it straight off  you and i he remarked are the only two who sat the whole show out it was a grind wasnt it  it was i answered but i have slept and i feel none the worse for it lord cheisford carried us on splendidly there is solid work here i said something worth the planning  i touched my notebook almost affectionately for the work was fascinating now that it had attained coherent form ray smoked on and said nothing for several minutes then he looked up at me  have you a spare bedroom ducaine  one or two i answered they are not all furnished but one at any rate is decent  will you put me up for a dayperhaps two  of course i answered but  he answered my unspoken question  the duke has turned me out he said grimly who would have suspected the old man of such folly he believes in blenavon i told him the plain truth and he told me that i was a liar  i thought that he would be difficult to convince i remarked  he has all the magnificent pigheadedness of his race ray answered blenavon is blenavon and he can do no wrong he would summon him home again but fortunately the young man himself is no fool he will not come you told lady angela  everything  she believed you  i think that she did i answered  his face softened  the duke showed me from the door himself he said you will not object to my sending a note to lady angela by your servant  make whatever use of him you choose i answered there are pen and ink and notepaper upon the table  then i settled down to my work ray wrote his note and went upstairs to sleep in an hours time he was down again there were black rims under his eyes and i could see at once that he had had no rest grooton had brought his bag from the house and a note from lady angela he read it with unchanging face and placed it carefully in his breast coatpocket  i am off to the village to send some telegrams he said and afterwards i shall go on for a walk what about lunch i asked glancing at the clock none for me he answered some tea at four oclock if i may have it i will be back by then he swung off and i was thankful for my work demanded my whole attention and very careful thought at a few minutes after four he returned and grooton brought us some tea directly we were alone ray looked across at me with a black frown upon his face  you know what they are saying in the village about you young man  i can guess i answered  who is this girl blanche moyat  a farmers daughter i answered it seems that i paid her too much or too little attention i am not sure which at any rate she has an imaginary grievance against me and this is the result  she tells the truth  i have not heard her story i answered but it is true that i encouraged her to suppress the fact that she bad seen the man in the village and that he had asked for me  what folly  perhaps i answered you see i thought that a verdict of found drowned would save trouble  this accursed woman at the grange is in it i know ray remarked slowly filling his pipe i wonder if she knew that i was about that would give her a zest for the job  she knows that you were at braster at the time i said it was the night of your lecture  ray began to blow out dense clouds of smoke  were safe he said thoughtfully both of us theres just a link in the chain missing  the police have been here with a warrant in search of that link i remarked  theyll never find it for its in my pocket he remarked grimly  colonel ray i said suddenly nerving myself to risk his anger there is a question which i must ask you  i saw his lips come firmly together he neither encouraged nor checked me  who was that man  you are better ignorant  was it my father  if he did not answer my question it at least seemed to suggest something to him  has that woman been here he asked  yes  she believes that it was your father  she does  he removed his pipe from his teeth and looked at it thoughtfully  ah he said  you have not answered my question i reminded him  nor am i going to he replied coolly you know already as much as is good for you  he rose and threw open the door of my cottage for several moments he stood bareheaded looking up towards the house looking and listening he glanced at his watch and walked several times backwards and forwards from the edge of the cliff to my door then he came in for his hat and stick  i am going down to the sea he said if lady angela comes will you call me i shall not be out of hearing  you are expecting her i asked looking down at my work  yes it was necessary for me to see her somewhere so i asked her to come here perhaps the duke has found out and stopped her anyhow call me if she comes  he stepped outside and i heard him scrambling down the cliff i set my teeth and turned to my work it was a hard thing to have my little room with its store of memories turned into a meetingplace for these two i at least would take care to be far enough away and then i began wondering whether she would come i was still wondering when i heard her footsteps  she came in unaccustomed garb to me she wore a grey dress of some soft material and a large black hat with feathers her skirts were gathered up in her hand and i heard the jingling of harness at the corner of the avenue where her carriage was waiting i opened the door and she entered with a soft swish of silk and a gentle rustling the room seemed instantly full of perfume of neapolitan violets a great bunch of which were in her bosom  she looked swiftly around and i fancied that it was a relief to her to find me alone  is colonel ray here she asked  he is waiting for you i answered on the sands i promised to call him directly you came  i moved toward the door but she checked me with an imperative gesture  wait she said  i came slowly back and stood by my table she was sitting with her hands clasped together looking into the fire she looked very girlish and frail  i want to thinkfor a moment she said everything seems confusion my father has commanded me to break my engagement with colonel ray  i remained silent what was there indeed for me to say  in my heart she went on slowly i know that my father is wrong and that colonel ray is right he has simply done his duty blenavon was being sorely tempted he is better awayout of the country oh i am sure of that  colonel ray has done what he believed to be his duty i said slowly it is hard that he should suffer for that  often she murmured one has to suffer for doing the right thing my father has made himself a poor man because of his sense of what was right i do not know what to do  i glanced out of the window for many reasons i did not wish to prolong this interview  he is waiting i reminded her  i must do one of two things she murmured i must break my faith with my fatheror with him  then she lifted her eyes to mine  tell me what you think mr ducaine she asked  i opened my lips to speak but i could not was it fair that she should ask me my little room was peopled with dreams of her with delightful but impossible visions my very nerves were full of the joy of her presence it was madness to ask for my judgment when the very poetry of my life was an unreasoning and hopeless love for her  i cannot i muttered you must not ask me  she seemed surprised after all i had guarded my secret well then  you will not refuse to help me she pleaded  i set my teeth hard i longed for ray but there were no signs of him  your father has ordered you to break your engagement with colonel ray i said but he has done so under a misapprehension of the facts you owe obedience to your father but you owe moretothe man whose wife you have promised to be i do not think you should give him up  she listened eagerly was it my fancy or was she indeed a little paler her eyes seemed to gleam with a strange softness in the twilight her head drooped a a little as she resumed her former thoughtful attitude  thank you she said simply i believe that you are right  i caught up a bundle of papers from my desk and stole softly from the room ray was close at hand and i called to him  she is in there waiting for you i said i have some transcribed matter which i am taking up to the safe  ray nodded abruptly and i heard the door of my cottage open and close behind him    chapter xxx  mostyn rays love story  in a dark corner of the library sitting motionless before a small writingdesk i found the duke the table was littered all over with papers a ledger or two and various documents i had met mr hulshaw the agent to the estates in the drive so i judged that the two had had business together  the duke had not greeted me on my entrance and he seemed to be asleep in his chair but at the sound of the electric bell which announced the opening of the safe he turned sharply round  is that you ducaine  yes your grace i answered  what are you doing there  i have brought up the first batch of copy sir i answered  you have sealed it properly  with lord chelsfords seal sir i told him  he turned round in his chair sharply  whats that he asked  lord chelsford gave me an old signet ring before he left sir i said with a very peculiar design i wear it attached by a chain to an iron bracelet round my arm  let me see it the duke ordered  i took off my coat and baring my arm showed him the ring hanging by a few inches of strong chain from the bracelet he examined the design curiously  how do you detach it he asked  i cannot detach it sir i answered the bracelet has a bramah lock and lord chelsford has the key he used to wear it many years ago when he was queens messenger  the duke examined the ring long and searchingly then he looked from it into my face  you mean to say that you cannot take that off  a locksmith might sir i certainly could not  the duke shrugged his shoulders  chelsfords methods seem to me to savour a little of opera bouffe he remarked drily for my own part i believe that these marvellous documents would be perfectly safe in the unlocked drawer of my desk i do not believe any of these stories which come from paris about copies of our work being in existence i do not wish you to be careless of course but dont overdo your precautions this place is scarcely so much a nest of conspirators as faddists like chelsford and ray would have us believe  i am glad to hear that you think so sir i answered our precautions do seem a little elaborate but it is quite certain that the winchester papers were disturbed  i do not choose to believe it ducaine the duke said irritably kindly remember that  very good sir i answered there is nothing else you wish to say to me  there is something else the duke answered coldly i understand that the police yesterday on a sworn affidavit were granted a search warrant to examine your premises for stolen property what the devil is the meaning of this  i think sir i answered that the stolen property was a pretext it seems that during the last few days has come to light that the man whose body i found on the sands was not washed in from the sea but was a stranger who had arrived in braster the previous evening and had made inquiries as to where i lived it seems to be the desire of the police therefore to connect me in some way with the affair  the duke looked at me searchingly  i presume he said that they had something in the nature of evidence or they would scarcely have been able to swear the affidavit for the search warrant  they have nothing more direct sir than that the body was found close to my cottage that he had presumably left braster to see me and that i was foolish enough to persuade the person of whom the dead man made these inquiries in braster not to come forward at the inquest  stop stop the duke said irritably you did what  the young woman of whom he inquired was close at hand when i discovered the body of the man i said she told me about him i was a little upset and i suggested that there was no necessity for her to disclose the fact of having seen him  it was a remarkably foolish thing of you to do the duke said  i am realizing it now sir i answered  did this person call on you at all the duke asked  no sir you may remember that it was the night of colonel rays lecture he called to see me on his way back and found me ill i believe that this person looked in at the window and went away i saw no more of him alive after this  you have some idea i presume as to his identity  i have no definite information your grace i answered  the duke did not look at me for several moments  i am afraid he said stiffly that you may experience some inconvenience from this most illadvised attempt of yours to suppress evidence which should most certainly have been given at the inquest however i have no doubt that your story is true i have some inquiries now before me from the police station i will do what i can for you goodevening ducaine  goodevening sir i answered i am much obliged to you  i walked homewards across the park the carriage had gone from the private road and ray was alone when i entered it was impossible to tell what had happened from his expression he sat stretched out in my easy chair smoking furiously and his face was impassive grooton served us with dinner and he ate and drank with only a few curt remarks but afterwards when i was deep in my work he suddenly addressed me  boy he then said turn round and listen to me  i obeyed him at once  listen well he said for i am not given to confidences yet i am going to speak to you of the secret places of my life  i laid down the pen which i had been holding between my fingers and turned my chair i judged that it was not necessary for me to speak nor apparently did he think so  i have been soldiering all my days he said since i was a child almost it is a glorious life god knows i have never grudged a single month of it but when one comes back once more to dwell amongst civilians one realizes that there is another side to life it is so with me i am not given to doubts or to asking advice from any man but the time has come when i have the one and need of the other  he paused knocked out some ashes from his pipe and relighted it  i have loved two women in my life guy he went on slowly the first was your mother  i started a little but i still held my peace he looked hard into the ashes of the fire and continued  i tried my best he said to be a friend to her after her marriage and i hope i think that i succeeded i even did my best to fight that womans influence with your father at gibraltar there i failed i was foredoomed to failure she had the trick of playing what tune she cared to on a mans heartstrings after it was all over and your father and she had left the place i spent years trying to persuade your mother to get a divorce and marry me but she was the daughter of a bishop a high churchwoman and a holy woman she died with your fathers name upon her lips  i shuddered the words were spoken so deliberately and yet with such vibrant force  after that ray continued came egypt then india and afterwards khartoum i came home before the last war and i met lady angela i am so little of a womans man that i suppose the girl whom i thought of at all became like an angel a creature altogether apart from that sex of whom i know so little however that may be she was the second woman to hold any place in myheartas she most surely will be the last then the war broke out luck came my way and i returned with a greater reputation than i deserved the very night of my return i asked lady angela to marry me and she consented  he puffed vigorously at his pipe but he seemed wholly ignorant of the fact that it was out his face was set in its grimmest lines he looked steadily at a certain spot in the fire and went on  there are things he said which troubled me little at the time but which just lately have been on my mind the first is that i am nearly fifty and lady angela is twentyone the second is that i came home with all the tinsel and glamour of a popular hero heaven knows i loathed it but the fact remains the kings reception the vc and all that sort of thing i suppose accounted for it anyhow i am troubled with this reflection lady angela was very young and i fear that her imagination was touched she accepted my offer and she has been very loyal until tonight no word of disagreement has passed between us but there have been times lately when i have fancied that i have noticed a change a time has come now when i could give her back her freedom without reproach on either side i want to know whether it is my duty to give it her back  then ray looked straight into my face and the colour flamed there for i saw now why he had made me his confidant  what do you think guy you are only a boy but you are of her age and you have seen a little of her lately you are only a boy but then only boys and novelists understand women speak up and tell me what is in your mind  i will tell you this i answered hotly if i were you and lady angela had promised to be my wife i would not sit and hatch scruples about marrying her i would marry her first and make her happy afterwards and as for the restfor the questions which you have asked me and yet not put into wordsi have never heard or seen in lady angela the slightest sign that you were not her lover as well as the man whom she was engaged to marry as for my own folly since you seem to have noticed it no one knows better than i that it is the rankest most absurd presumption but with me it begins and ends that is a most absolute and certain fact  ray rapped his pipe upon the table  listen he said i found you nameless and practically lost yet you have powerful relatives and your family is equal to the dukes there may be money too some day bear these things in mind can you repeat what you have said  it was a wild dreama wonderful one but before me i saw the stern white face of the man eager for his share of happiness after all these magnificent years of dauntless service i forgot my own distrust of him his coldness his brutality i remembered only those other and greater things  even were i in such a position i said it would make no difference i am sure that lady angela is loyal she has no ideaand it is not worth while that she should have  you would have me marry her then he asked slowly  there is only one thing i said taking my courage into my hands  and that he asked sharply  that i answered lies between you and your conscience  he rose to his feet  wait here he said and i will show you my justification    chapter xxxi  my fathers letter  i heard rays heavy footsteps ascending the stairs to his room in a few moments he returned bearing in his hand a letter  guy he said thoughtfully i am a man who is slow to place trust in any one for that reason and perhaps because ignorance was better for you i have told you little of the events of that night now my first opinion of you has undergone some modifications you are stronger than i thought you have shown faith in me too or i should not be here practically a guest under your roof tonight listen the man whom you found dead in the marshes was not your father  i was not surprised always i had doubted it  who was he then i asked calmly  when your father went mad at gibraltar ray said he needed help this man clery by name supplied it when i knew them both he was your fathers valet since then he has been his confederate in many schemes your father on many occasions manifested the remnants of a sense of honour this creature set himself deliberately and successfully to corrupt it he was a parasite a nerveless bloodless thing without a single human attribute he and that woman were alike responsible for your fathers ruined life  once before ray continued after a moments pause i had told him that if ever we should meet where his life would cost me nothing i would kill him as i would set my heel upon an adderand he only smiled as though i had paid him some delicate compliment and that night guy a hundred yards from your cottage he sidled up to me in that lonely road and bade me direct him to the abode of mr guy ducaine a moment after he recognized me  a grim smile parted rays lips but i could not repress a shudder invariably at any reference to that awful night the old fear came back  he seemed at first paralyzed with fear ray continued he tried to slip away into the marshes but i caught him easily and held him so that he could not escape he admitted that he had come to find you with a message from your father he denied at first having a letter but i searched him until i found it as you see it is addressed to you nevertheless i struck matches opened it and with some difficulty managed to read it all the time this creature was doubling about like an eel trying to get away read the letter  i drew it from the envelope it was dated from the savoy hotel   my dear soni do not deserve that you should read beyond these three words i have as little right to call you my son as you can have desire to claim me for your father i am here however purely on an errand of justice i have learned that you have been robbed of the sum set aside to give you a start in life i am here to endeavor to replace it for which purpose i desire that you will grant me a business interview within the next few days i beg your reply by clery my faithful companion and servant i am known here as  richard drew foster  i laid the letter down without remark ray had filled his pipe whilst i had been reading and was sitting now on the arm of his easy chair facing me  i understood the letter and its meaning he continued i knew that the whole neighbourhood was under the observation of the french secret service and the man who signed himself richard drew foster saw in you an excellent tool ready to his hand it is very certain also that the matter would probably have presented itself to you in a wholly different light accordingly i placed the letter in my own pocket and i released my hold of clery  you can go back to your master i said and tell him that you have seen me and that i have his letter it will be sufficient and you can tell him that i shall be in london tomorrow night and if any such person as mr drew foster is staying at the savoy hotel he will know the inside of a military prison before midnight  the man slunk away i suppose he realized that with me in the way their game was up but afterwards he must have hesitated and then made up his mind to attempt what was probably the bravest action of his life he followed me stole up softly behind and with an old trick which they teach them on the other side of the seine he as nearly as possible throttled me however i got my finger inside the slipknot and i held him by the throat when i could breathe i lifted him up and threw him into the marshes there i left him it seems the fall killed him that is the whole story it was absolutely gods justice but i am quite aware that the laws of the country do not exactly favour such summary treatment accordingly i held my peace i am sorry for it now  and mr drew foster  had left the savoy hotel when i reached there ray said drily and had omitted to leave an address  you might have trusted me i remarked thoughtfully  if i had known you as well then as i do now ray answered i would have risked it  then as we sat in silence there came a low tapping at the door ray looked at me keenly  who visits you at this hour he asked  we will see i answered  i had meant to be careful whom i admitted but i had scarcely withdrawn the latch when the door was pushed open and a slim thicklycloaked figure glided past me into the room i knew her by the supple swiftness of her movements ray sat still and smoked with the face of a sphinx  i think that at first she did not see him she swept round upon me and raised her veil  guy she cried forgive me but i could not help it i have made a mummy of myself and i have walked along those awful sands that i might not be seen but there is a question  she saw ray the words died from her lips she stood and shivered like a trapped bird he removed his pipe from his teeth  go on he said mildly dont mind me perhaps i can help mr ducaine to answer it  she sank into a chair her eyes seemed to implore me to protect her i heard rays little snort of contempt but i answered her kindly i could not help it  i am sorry that you came i said but of course i will answer any question you want to ask me dont hurry you are out of breath let me give you some wine  my own untasted liqueur was on the table by the side of my empty coffee cup i made her drink it and her teeth ceased to chatter she was rather a pathetic object one of her little black satin slippers was cut to shreds and the other was clogged with wet sand the fear of ray too was in her white face she caught hold of my hand impulsively  the man she murmured whom you foundwhat was he like  he was a small dark man  she laughed hysterically  he she exclaimed was over six feet and broad it was not he it may have been some one whom he sent but it was not he guy have you heard from him do you know where he is  i shook my head ray interposed  i think he said roughly that youll find him at home when you get there madam wherever that may be if he were in this country it would be within the four walls of a prison  she looked across at him  you have set them onthe policethen she said you would hunt him down still after all these years  ay he answeredtell me where he is hiding in this country and i will promise you that his days of freedom are over  she pointed to me  his father  ay were he his father a hundred times over  she turned to me as though in protest but my face gave her no encouragement she rose wearily to her feet  i will go she muttered guy she added turning to me you are honest you will always be honest you have nothing to fear so you do not hesitate to speak if necessary to those whom nevertheless you do not trust but there are other things in the world to fear besides dishonesty there is animal brutality coarse indifference to pain in others there is the triumph of the beast over the man there he sits he who can teach you these things she added pointing to ray do not choose him for your friend guy you will grow to see life to judge others through his eyesand then god help you  ray laughed and again to me there seemed to be a note of coarseness in his strident and unconcealed contempt of the woman she took no notice of him whatever she opened the door and passed out so quickly that though i tried to intercept her and called out after her i was powerless to prevent her going she had flitted away into the shadows i could not even hear her retreating footsteps    chapter xxxii  a painful encounter  more work a week of it ceaseless and unremitting the police seemed to have abandoned their watch over my cottage and i heard a whisper that a statement by the duke had at any rate partially cleared me from suspicion ray had declined to leave england i knew quite well that it was on my account he with the others was now in london  then came my own summons thither i was told to report myself immediately on arrival at rowchester house and to my surprise was informed by the servant who answered my inquiries that a room was reserved for me there i had no sooner reached it than lady angelas own maid arrived with a message her ladyship would be glad if i could spare her a few moments in the drawingroom as soon as possible  lady angela was standing upon the hearthrug i stepped a little way across the threshold and stopped short she held out her hand to me with a quiet laugh  have you forgotten me she asked or am i so alarming  i set my teeth and moved towards her  you took my breath away i said with an ease which i was very far from feeling remember that i have come from braster  i do not know what she wore her gown seemed to me to be of some soft crepe or silk and the colour of it was a smoky misty blue there were pearls around her neck and her hair arranged with exquisite simplicity seemed to be drawn back from her face and arranged low down on the back of her neck she had still the fresh delightful colour which had been in her cheeks when she left braster and the smile with which she welcomed me was as delightful as ever  this is a charming arrangement she declared you know that you are such an important person and have to be watched so closely that you are to stay here i went up myself with the housekeeper to see to your rooms i do hope that you will be comfortable  comfortable is not the word i answered i have never been used to such luxury  she laughed  dear me she said i have so much to tell you and the carriage is waiting already thank goodness we dine alone tomorrow night but there is one thing which i must tell you at once sir michael trogoldy is in town you know he took me in to dinner at amberley house last night and we talked about you  i had a letter from sir michael a few days ago i answered he made a proposition to meand asked me to call and see him  something in my voice i suppose betrayed my feelings she laid her hand upon my arm  mr ducaine she said i do hope that you mean to be reasonable sir michael is a dear old man  he is my mothers brother i answered and he left me to starve  he had not the least idea she declared that you were not reasonably well off he is most interested in hearing about you and he was delighted to have you accept the allowance he offered you you will go and see him  yes i shall go i promised i scarcely see the use of it but i will go  you must not be foolish she said softly sir michael is very rich and you are his only near relative besides you have had such a lonely time and it is quite time that you saw a little of the other side of life sir michael is a particular friend of mine and i promised him that i would talk to you about this i am most anxious to hear that you get on well together you can be amiable if you like you know and you can be very much the other thing  i will try i assured her not to be the other thing she smiled  and tell me all about braster  there is not much to tell i answered i have been hard at work all the time and i have scarcely seen a soul  the womanmrs smithlessing  she left braster before you i have not seen her since the evening of the day i saw her last  she appeared relieved  may i ask you a question i asked she nodded about colonel ray has the duke forgiven him  on the contrary he is more bitter than ever lady angela answered i have seen him once or twice only he does not come here i saw in the paper i said that your engage  it is not true she interrupted everything is as it was but it is shockingly indefinite of course i scarcely know whether i am to consider myself an engaged person or not colonel ray offered to release me but we agreed to wait for a little time  lady angela  she looked at me with a soft flush upon her cheeks but my words were never spoken the duke entered the room brilliant in sash and orders  good evening ducaine he said looking at me with slightly lifted eyebrows  good evening your grace i answered in some embarrassment  i sent for mr ducaine lady angela remarked stooping that her maid who had followed the duke might arrange her cloak i wanted to hear all about braster and i had a message for him from sir michael trogoldy  the duke made no remark  i shall require you ducaine at ten oclock tomorrow morning in my study he said afterwards we go over to the war office you have brought all the papers with youif you are quite ready angela  the duke without saying a word had managed to make me feel that he considered my presence in the drawingroom with lady angela superfluous but her smile and farewell were quite sufficient recompense for me still i knew that this living together under the same roof was to be no unmixed blessing for me i shut myself in the dainty little sittingroom which i was told was mine and turned the key in the door i felt the need of solitude                                       later in the evening i became mundane again i remembered that i had sent dinner away and though i had only to ring the bell and order something i felt the need of fresh air so i took up my hat and stick and left the house  after a while i found my way into piccadilly i knew very little of london but after my solitary evening walks at braster along the sandhills and across the marshes the contrast was in itself suggestive and almost exciting i watched the people the stream of carriages i listened to the low ceaseless hum of this wonderful life and i found it fascinating the glow in the sky was marvellous to methe faces of the passersby the laughter and the whining the tears and the cursing the pleasureseekers and the pleasuresatiated how they all told their story as they swept by in one unceasing stream for a while i forgot even my appetite the sight of a restaurant however at last reminded me that i was desperately hungry  i knew it by namea huge cosmopolitan place of the lower middle class and entering i found a quiet seat where my country clothes were not conspicuous there were few people about me and those few uninteresting so i kept my attention divided between my dinner and the evening paper but just as i was drawing towards the close of my meal something happened to change all that  a woman followed by a man passed my table and the two seated themselves diagonally opposite to me something in the womans light footsteps her free movements and the graceful carriage of her head struck me instantly as being familiar she was dressed very plainly and she was closely veiled their entrance too had been unobtrusive almost furtive but when she raised her veil and took the cartedujour in her hand i knew her at once it was mrs smithlessing  she had not seen me and my first impulse was to pay my bill and step quietly out then by chance i glanced at her companion and my heart stood still he was a tall man over six feet but he stooped badly and his walk had been almost the walk of an invalid he had the appearance of a man who had once been stout and well built but who was now barely recovered from a long illness the flesh hung in little bags underneath his bloodshot eyes his mouth twitched continually and the hand which rested on the table trembled he wore a scanty grey moustache which failed to hide a weak thin mouth and a very obvious wig concealed his baldness his clothes had seen plenty of service and his linen was doubtful he had evidently ordered some brandy immediately on his entrance and his eyes met mine just as he was in the act of raising the glass to his lips i am convinced that he had no idea then who i was but the earnestness of my gaze seemed to disturb him he set down his glass with shaking fingers and directed his companions attention towards me  they talked together earnestly for several moments i fancied that she was reproving him for showing alarm at my notice very soon however she herself after giving an order to a waiter turned slightly round in her chair and glanced with wellaffected carelessness across at me i saw her start and look apprehensively at her companion he took the alarm at once and i heard his eager question  who is it who is it maud  she made him some reassuring answer and rising to her feet came over to my table i rose to greet her and she slipped quietly into the chair opposite to me  what are you doing here she asked quickly  i have just arrived from braster i answered i came here by accident to get something to eat is that  i could not go on but she finished the sentence for me  yes  i set my teeth hard and looked steadily down at the tablecloth i felt rather than saw that her regard was compassionate  i am sorry she murmured i would not have brought him here if i had known you two are better apart talk to me as naturally as you can he has no idea who you are  has he been ill i asked  very i found him in a hospital he has been ill and the rest you can guess  even while we were talking i saw him toss off another glass of brandy which the waiter had brought him and all the time his eyes never left my face  i thought i said that he had money  it has all gone she answered andwell things are not very flourishing with him our mission over here has been unsuccessful and they have stopped sending us money from paris how queer that i should be telling you this she added with a hard little laugh you of all people in the world guy take my advice get up and go if he guesses who you are he will come and speak to youand you are better apart  it was too late with fascinated eyes i watched him leave his place and come towards us i was absolutely powerless to move mrs smithlessing had left the outside chair vacant he sank into it and leaned across the table towards me  it is guy he said in a shaking voice i am sure that it is guy she has told you who i am eh  yes i answered i know who you are  he extended a shaking hand across the table i could not take it  well well he said nervously perhaps you are right but i came to england to see you yes guy that is the truth i have been a bad father but i may be able to make amends i think i know a way waiter a glass of brandy  i am afraid i said rising to my feet that you must excuse meif you have anything to say to me sir we can meet another time  he almost dragged me down  stop stop he said irritably you do not seem to understand i had an important matter of business to discuss with you i may make your fortune yet my boy i have powerful friends abroad very powerful  i looked at him steadily  well  she laid her hand upon his arm and whispered in his ear he only shook his head angrily  nonsense maud he exclaimed you do not understand this is my son guy of course we must talk together it is a wonderful meetingyes a wonderful meeting  well i repeated  i am glad to hear he continued that you are holding such an important position clerk to the military defence board eh quite an important position of course but it might be madeyes with care it might be made he added watching me with nervous alertness a very lucrative one  i am quite satisfied with my salary i remarked calmly  pooh my dear boy that is nonsense he continued you do not understand me it is an open secret maud are we overheard here do you think is it safe to discuss an important matter with guy here  i rose to my feet and took up my hat again she whispered in his ear and this time he seemed to assent  quite right quite right he said nodding his head guy my boy you shall come and see us no 29 bloomsbury streetpoor rooms but our remittances have gone astray and i have been ill tomorrow eh or the next day we shall expect you guy we do not go out except in the evenings you will not fail guy  i looked down into his flushed face his lips were shaking and his eyes were fixed anxiously upon mine i was miserably ashamed and unhappy  i do not think that i shall care to hear what you have to say i answered but i will come to see you  i left them there as i went out she was gently countermanding his order for more brandy    chapter xxxiii  the dukes message  it was late but i felt that i must see ray i went to his house little expecting to find him there i was shown however into the study where he was hard at work with a pile of correspondence he wore an ancient shooting jacket and his feet were encased in slippers as usual his pipe was between his teeth and the tobacco smoke hung about him in little clouds  well he said gruffly what do you want of me i am busy speak to the point  i have come to ask your advice i said i am afraid that i must resign my post  why  my father is in london i have seen and spoken with him  with that woman  yes  and you have spoken to him in a public place perhaps  ray was silent for a moment then he looked at me keenly  do you want to give it up he asked  no i answered but do you suppose lord chelsford and the others would be willing for me to continueunder the circumstances  probably not he admitted the duke would not at any rate  then what am i to do i asked  i dont know he answered shortly it requires consideration i will see lord cheisford you shall hear from me in the morning  that was all the consolation i had from colonel mostyn ray  at ten oclock the next morning the duke came to me in the study where i was already at work he was looking even for him particularly trim and smart and he wore a carefullyselected pink rosebud in his buttonhole his greeting was almost cordial he gave me a few instructions and then lit a cigarette  what is this about your resignation ducaine he asked  i do not wish to resign sir i answered i have explained certain circumstances to colonel ray which it seemed to me might make my resignation necessary he promised to confer with lord cheisford and let me know the result  the urbanity slowly faded from the dukes face  i am your employer he said coldly i do not understand why you thought it necessary to go to colonel ray  it was entirely owing to colonel ray sir i answered that i received the appointment and he has practically made himself responsible for me  you are mistaken the duke answered the responsibility is shared by all of us your unfortunate family history was known to the whole board  then i am less indebted to colonel ray sir than i imagined i answered i am very glad however that it is known perhaps lord cheisford may not consider my resignation necessary  the circumstances being  i have seen and spoken with my father in london i answered  the duke was silent  i presume he said after a short pause that you must yourself realize the indiscretion of this  i went at once to colonel ray and offered my resignation i answered  the duke nodded  your father he said slowly is in london yes sir  alone  i hesitated yet perhaps the duke had a right to know the truth  he is with the lady who occupied braster grange sir until last week i answered she passed under the name of mrs smithlessing but i believe that she is in reality my stepmother  the duke stood a few paces from me looking out of the window he held his cigarette between his fingers and he stood sideways to me nothing about his attitude or face was unusual yet i felt myself watching him curiously there was something about his manner which seemed to me to suggest some powerful emotion only kept in check by the exercise of a strong will  this is the person i believe he said in a slow measured tone with whom my son lord blenavon was said to have been intimate  lord blenavon was certainly a constant visitor at braster grange i answered  you know her address in london the duke asked  yes  he turned and faced me he was certainly paler than he had been a few minutes ago  i should be glad he said if you would arrange for me to have an interview with her  an interview with mrs smithlessing i repeated incredulously  the duke inclined his head  there are a few questions he said which i wish to ask her  i can give you her address i said  i wish you to see her and arrange for the interview personally the duke answered  you will see that my visiting her does not prejudice me further with the board sir i ventured to say you can take that for granted the duke said so that afternoon i called at no 29 bloomsbury street and in a shabby back room of a gloomy smokebegrimed lodginghouse i found my father and mrs smithlessing he was lying upon a horsehair sofa apparently dozing she was gazing negligently out of the window and drumming upon the window pane with her fingers my arrival seemed to act like an electric shock upon both of them it struck me that to her it was not altogether welcome but my father was nervously anxious to impress upon me his satisfaction at my visit  now he said drawing his chair up to the table we can discuss this little matter in a businesslike way i am delighted to see you guy quite delighted  what matter i asked quietly  my father coughed and looked towards my stepmother as though for guidance but her face was a blank  guy he said i am sure that you are a young man of common sense you will prefer that i speak to you plainly there are some fools at our endi mean at pariswho think they will be better off for a glance at the doings of your military board up to now we have kept them supplied with a little general information lord blenavon who is a remarkably sensible young man lent us his assistance i tell you this quite frankly i believe that it is best  he was watching me furtively i did my best to keep my features immovable  with lord blenavons assistance my father continued we did at first very well since hiserdeparture we have not been so fortunate i will be quite candid we have not succeeded at all our friends pay generously but they pay by results as a consequence your stepmother and i are nearly penniless this fact induces me to make you a speciala very specialoffer  my stepmother seemed about to speak she checked herself however  go on i said  my father coughed there was a bottle upon the table and he helped himself from it  my nerves he remarked are in a shocking state this morning can i offer you anything  i shook my head my father poured out nearly a glass full of the raw spirit diluted it with a little a very little water and drank it off  your labours my dear boy he continued i refer of course to the labours of the military council are i believe concentrated upon a general scheme of defence against any possible invasion on the part of france quite a scare you people seem to be in not that one can wonder at it these military manoeuvres of our friends across the water are just a little obvious even to john bull eh you dont answer quite right quite right never commit yourself uselessly it is very good diplomacy let me see where was i ah the general scheme of defence is of course known to you  naturally i admitted  with a list of the places to be fortified eh the positions to be held and the general distribution of troops no doubt too you have gone into the railway and commissariat arrangements  all these details i assented have gone through my hands  he dabbed his forehead with a corner of his handkerchief there was a streak of purple colour in his checks he kept his bloodshot eyes fixed upon me  i will tell you something guy he said which will astonish you you realize for yourself of course that such details as you have spoken of can never be kept altogether secret there are always leakages sometimes very considerable leakages yes guy he added there are people friends of mine in paris who are willing to pay a very large sum of moneysuch a large sum of money that it is worth dividing guyfor just a bare outline of the whole scheme foolish of course it is foolish but with them money is no object they think they are getting value for it absurd but guy what should you say to five thousand pounds  it is a large sum i answered  he plucked me by the sleeve his eyes were hungering already for the gold  we can get it he whispered hoarsely no trouble to youno risk i can make all the arrangements you have only to hand me the documents  i must think it over i said  he leaned back in his chair  why he asked what need is there to hesitate the chance may slip by there are many others on the look out  there is no one outside the military board save myself who could give these particulars i said slowly  but my friends he said sharply theirs is a foolish offer they may change their minds guy my boy i know the world well let me give you a word of advice when a good thing turns up dont play with it the men who decide quickly are the men who do things  i thrust my hand into my breastpocket and drew out a roll of papers  supposing i have already decided i said  his eyes gleamed with excitement he almost snatched at the papers but i held them out of his reach then with a sharp little cry the woman stood suddenly between us there was a look almost of horror on her pale strained face as she held out her hand as though to push me away  guy are you mad she cried  the veins stood out upon my fathers forehead he regarded her with mingled anger and surprise  what do you mean maud he exclaimed how dare you interfere guy give me the papers  he shall not she exclaimed fiercely guy have you lost your senses do you want to ruin your whole life  do you mean i asked incredulously that you do not wish me to join you  join us for heavens sake no she answered fiercely look at your father an outcast all his life do you want to become like him do you want to turn the other way whenever you meet an englishman to skulk all your days in hiding to be the scorn even of the men who employ you guy i would sooner see you dead than part with those papers  you damned fool my father muttered take no notice of her guy five thousand pounds i will see it paid to you every penny of it and not a soul will ever know  my father stood over her and there was a threat in his face she did not shrink from him for a moment she laid her white hands upon my shoulders and she looked earnestly into my eyes  guy she said even now i do not believe that you meant to be so very very foolish but i want you to go away at once you should never have come it is not good for you to come near either of us  i rose obediently i think that if i had not been there my father would have struck her he was almost speechless with fury he poured himself out another glass of brandy with shaking fingers  thank you i said to her simply i do not think that these papers are worth five thousand let me tell you what i came here for i am a messenger from the duke of rowchester  my father dropped his glass mrs smithlessing looked bewildered  the duke i said to her desires to see you can you come to cavendish square this afternoon  the duke she murmured  he wishes to see you i repeated shall i tell him that you will call at four oclock this afternoon or will you go back with me  do you mean this she asked in a low tone i do not understand it i have never seen the duke in my life  i understand no more than you do i assured her that is the message  i do not promise to come she said i must think it over  my father pushed her roughly away  come theres been enough of this fooling he declared roughly guy sit down again my boy we must have another talk about this matter  i turned upon him in a momentary fit of passion  i have no more to say sir i declared it seems that you are not content with ruining your own life and overshadowing mine you want to drag me too down into the slough  you dont understand my dear boy  the door opened and ray entered my bundle of papers slipped from my fingers on to the floor in the excitement of the moment    chapter xxxiv  myself and my stepmother  i saw then what a mans face may look like when he is stricken with a sudden paralysing fear i saw my father sit in his chair and shake from head to foot rays black eyes seemed to be flashing upon us all the most unutterable scorn  what is this pleasant meeting which i seem to have interrupted eh he asked with fierce sarcasm quite a family reunion  my stepmother very pale but very calm answered him  to which you she said come an uninvited guest  he laughed harshly  you shall have others other uninvited guests before many hours are past he declared you remember my warning ducaine  my father seemed to me to be on the eve of a collapse his lips moved and he mumbled something but the words were wholly unintelligible ray turned to my stepmother  when that man he continued had the effrontery to return to this country he sent his cursed jackal with letters to his son i intercepted those letters and i burned them but i came straight to london and i found him out i told him then that i spared him only for the sake of his son i told him that if ever again he attempted in any way to communicate with him personally or by letter nothing should stay my hand he had a very clear warning he has chosen to defy me i only regret madam that the law has no hold upon you also  she turned from him scornfully and laid her hand upon my fathers shoulder her very touch seemed to impart life to him his words were not very coherent but they were comprehensible  i kept my word ray yes i kept my word he said i never sent for him ask him ask her we met by accident i told him my address that is all he came here this afternoon with a message from the duke  ray laughed bitterly there was about his manner a cold and singular aloofness we were all judged and condemned  an invitation to dinner i presume he remarked  the duke sent for me my stepmother said quietly  she did not for a moment quail before the scornful disbelief which ray took no pains to hide  you can see for yourself if you like she continued that in a few minutes i shall leave this house with you if you are gallant enough to offer me your escort and i shall go straight to cavendish square you have no imagination colonel ray or you would not be so utterly surprised think for a moment does no reason occur to you why the duke might wish to see me  it obviously did he frowned heavily  if this absurd story is true he said and the duke has really sent to ask news of blenavon from youwell he is a bigger fool than i took him for but there remains something else to be explained what are those papers  my father laid his trembling hands upon them  they have nothing to do with you he explained nothing at all it is a little family matterbetween guy and me nothing more they belong to me damn you ray why are you always interfering in my concerns  ray turned to me there was a look in his eyes which i readily understood at that moment i think that i hated him  what are those papers he asked  take them and see i answered if i told you you would not believe me  he moved a few steps towards them and then paused i saw that my father was leaning forward and in his shaking hand was a tiny gleaming revolver a certain desperate courage seemed to have come to him  ray he cried hoarsely touch them at your peril  there was a moments breathless silence then with an incredibly swift movement my stepmother stepped in between and snatched up the little roll she glanced behind at the grate but the fire was almost extinct with a little gesture of despair she held them out to me take them guy she cried  ray stood by my side and i felt his hand descend like a vice upon my shoulder  give me those papers he demanded  i hesitated for a moment then i obeyed him i heard a little sob from behind the pistol had fallen from my fathers shaking fingers his head had fallen forwards upon his hands a tardy remorse seemed for a moment to have pierced the husk of his colossal selfishness  it is all my fault my fault he muttered  my stepmother turned upon him pale to the lips with blazing eyes  you are out of your senses she exclaimed guy this man is a bully all his life it has been his pleasure to persecute the weak and defenceless the papers are yours i do not know what they are nor does he she added pointing to where my father still crouched before the table dont let him frighten you into giving them up he is trying to drag you into the mesh with us dont let him you have nothing to do with us thank heaven  she stopped suddenly and snatched the pistol from my fathers nerveless grasp then her hand flashed out ray was covered and her white fingers never quivered even ray took a quick step backwards  give him back those papers she commanded  i intervened stepping into the line of fire  i gave them to him willingly i told her i do not wish to have them back he is one of my employers and he has a right to claim them  i spoke firmly and she saw that i was at any rate in earnest yet the look which she threw upon me was a strange one i felt that she was disappointed that a certain measure of contempt too was mingled with her disappointment she threw the pistol on to the sofa and shrugged her shoulders  after all she said i suppose you are right the whole affair is not worth these heroics i am ready to go with you to the duke guy unless colonel ray has any contrary orders for us  ray turned to me  you must come with me at once to my rooms he said coldly this person can find the duke by herself if indeed the duke has sent for her  i understood then why people hated ray there was a vein of positive brutality somewhere in the mans nature  i am sorry i answered him but i cannot come to your rooms at present the duke is my present employer and i am here to take mrs smithlessing to him as long as she is willing to accept my escort i shall certainly carry out my instructions  dont be a fool boy ray exclaimed sharply i want to give you a last chance before i go to lord chelsford  i do not think i answered that i care about accepting any favours from you just now colonel ray nor am i at all sure that i need them i added  he turned on his heel but at the door he hesitated again  guy he said in a low tone will you speak to me for a moment outside  i stood on the landing with him he closed the door leading into the sittingroom  guy he said you know that if i leave you behind you link your lot withthem you will be an outcast and a fugitive all your days you will have to avoid every place where the english language is spoken you will never be able to recover your honour you will be the scorn of all englishmen and englishwomen i speak to you for your mothers sake boy you have started life with a cursed heritage i want to make allowance for it  i looked him straight in the face  i am afraid colonel ray i said that you are not inclined to give me credit for very much common sense take those papers to lord chelsford i will come round to your rooms as soon as possible  he looked at me with eager searching gaze  you mean this  certainly i answered  he seemed about to say something but changed his mind he left me without another word i stepped back into the sittingroom my father with an empty tumbler in his hand was crouched forward over the table breathing heavily my stepmother with marble face and hard set eyes was leaning forward in her chair looking into the dying fire she scarcely glanced at me as i entered  has he gone she asked  yes i answered will you get ready please i want to take you to the duke  she rose to her feet at once and moved towards the door i was left alone with my father but he never stirred during her absence nor did i speak to him she returned in a few minutes dressed very quietly and wearing a veil which completely obscured her features we walked to the corner of the square and then i called a hansom  i know nothing about lord blenavon she said a little wearily i suppose the duke will not believe that but it is true  you can do no more than tell the truth i remarked  tell me what he is likethe duke she asked abruptly  he is a typical man of his class i answered he is stiff obstinate punctilious with an extreme sense of honour to gratify which bythebye he has just deliberately pauperized himself he will not remind you in the least of lord blenavon  i should imagine not she answered  then there was a short silence and i could see that she was crying under her veil i laid my hand upon hers  i am afraid i said gently that i have misled you a little you are worrying about me and it isnt half so necessary as you imagine you thought me mad to listen to my fathers offer and a coward to give up those papers to ray isnt that so  my words seemed to electrify her she pushed up her veil and looked at me eagerly  well go on she exclaimed  there are some things i said which i have made up my mind to tell no one but at least i can assure you of this i am not nearly in so desperate a position as you and colonel ray seem to think  she caught hold of my hand and grasped it convulsively the hard lines seemed to have fallen away from her face she smiled tremulously  oh i am glad she declared i am glad  just then a carriage passed us and i saw lady angela lean a little forward in her seat as though to gain a better view of us    chapter xxxv  angelas confession  the duke was in his study awaiting our arrival i saw him rise and bow stiffly to my stepmother then i closed the door and left them alone  i wandered through the house a little at a loss to know what to do with myself it was too soon to go to ray and the work on which i was engaged was all in the study just as i passed the drawingroom door however it opened suddenly and lady angela came out talking to a whitehaired old gentleman who carried a stick on which he leaned heavily he looked at me rather curiously and then began to hobble down the hall at a great pace but lady angela laid her hand upon his arm  why sir michael she exclaimed this wont do at all you cant look him in the face and run mr ducaine this is sir michael trogoldy  he swung round and held out his hand his eyes searched my face eagerly  nephew he said i wanted to meet you and i didnt want to meet you god bless my soul youve got muriels eyes and mouth come and dine with me one night next weekany night let me know goodbye goodbye lady angela god bless you here james give me your arm down the steps and whistle for my fellow to draw up there he is in the middle of the road the blockhead  lady angela and i exchanged glances i think that we should both have laughed but for the tears which we had seen in his eyes  poor old man she murmured he is very nervous and very sensitive i know that he dreaded seeing you and yet he came this afternoon for no other purpose will you come into the drawingroom for a moment  there was a certain stiffness in her manner which was new to me she remained standing and her soft dark eyes were full of grave inquiry  mr ducaine she said i passed you just now driving in a hansom with a personof whom i disapprove may i knowis it any secret why you were with her  it is no secret at all lady angela i answered i was sent to fetch her by your father  by my father she repeated incredulously do you mean that she is in this house  certainly i answered your father is anxious i believe about lord blenavon it occurred to me that he perhaps hoped to get news of him from mrs smithlessing at any rate he sent me for her  she seemed to me to be trembling a little her eyes sought mine almost pathetically she was afraid of something in the halflights she appeared to me then so frail and girlish that a great wave of tenderness swept in upon me i longed to take her into my armseven to hold her hands and try to comfort her surely to do these things was the privilege of the man who loved her and i loved herloved her so that the pain and joy of it were woven together like live things in my heart fighting always against the grim silence which lay like a seal upon my lips but there were moments when i was sorely tried and this was one of them my eyes fell from hers i dared not look her in the face  is thisall she asked falteringly  it is all that i know i answered  then we were silent with a little sigh she sank down in the corner of a highbacked easy chair it seemed to me that she was thinner that something of the delicate childishness of her appearance had passed away since her coming to london i knew that she was in trouble and i dared not ask her the cause of it  i wish that we were going back to braster tomorrow she said suddenly everything and everybody is different here you seem to spend most of your time trying to avoid me andcolonel ray i do not know what is the matter with him but he has become like a walking tragedy  i have not tried to avoid you i said i  then i stopped short her eyes were fixed upon mine and the lie stuck in my throat i went on desperately  i think i said that if you fancy colonel ray is different you should ask him about it  she shook her head dejectedly  i cannot she said sometimes i am frightened of colonel ray it is like that just now  but you should try and get over it i said gently he has strange moods but you should always remember that he is the man whom you are going to marry there ought to be every confidence between you and i knowyes i know that he is very fond of you  she leaned a little forward her hair was a little dishevelled her face was almost haggard her under lip was quivering like a childs  i am afraid of him she sobbed out suddenly i am afraid of him and i have promised to marry him cant somebodyhelp me  her head fell suddenly forward and was buried in her hands her whole frame shook with convulsive weeping and then suddenly a little white hand shot out towards me she did not look up but the hand was there timid yet inviting i dropped on my knee by her side and i held it in mine  dear lady angela i murmured you must not give way like this you must not ray is not used to women and you are very young but he loves you i know that he loves you  i dontwant him to love me she sobbed oh i know that i am foolish and wicked and childish but i am afraid of him  i kept silence for my own battle was a hard one the little hand was holding fast to mine she lay curled up in the corner of the chair her face hidden her slim delicate figure shaking every now and then with sobs all the while i longed passionately to take her into my arms and comfort her  dont i begged oh dont ray has told me his story he has made me his confidant he has told me how unhappy he has been and how he loves you oh lady angela what is there i can say what can i do  i was losing my head a little i think for her fingers were gripping mine convulsively warm and tender little fingers which seemed to be drawing me all the while closer to her  i am so miserable she murmured  then suddenly her other arm was around my neck her wet tearstained face was pressed to mine i scarcely knew how it happened but i knew that she was in my arms and my lips were pressed to hers a sudden beautiful wave of colour flooded her cheeks she smiled gladly up at me she gave a delicious little sigh of satisfaction and then buried her face on my shoulder almost at the same moment ray entered the room  she did not at once raise her head although she pushed me gently away from her at the sound of the opening door but i who was standing facing that direction saw him from the first a dark stern figure standing as though rooted to the ground with the doorhandle still in his hand for the second time in one day he seemed to have intervened at the precise psychological moment he did not speak to me nor i to him lady angela as though wondering at the silence turned her head at last and a little gasping cry broke from her lips  mostyn she exclaimed is that you  for answer he turned towards the wall and flooded the room with electric light then he looked at us both intently and mercilessly only this time i saw that much of his wonderful selfcontrol was wanting he did not answer lady angela he did not glance towards her  you cur he cried twice in a day am i to be brought face to face with your cursed treachery twice in a day lady angela may i beg that you will leave us  she stood up and faced him slim and whitefaced yet with her head thrown back and her voice steady  mostyn she said this is my fault i do not ask for your forgiveness i have behaved shamefully but i was miserable and i forgot mr ducaine is blameless it was my fault  you will pardon the keenness of my observation he answered but the attitude in which i was unfortunate enough to find you tells its own story you will oblige me lady angela by leaving us alone  i would have spoken but she held out her hand  i think you forget colonel ray she said that this is my house i am not disposed to leave you and mr ducaine here together in your present mood  he laughed harshly  are you afraid for your lover he asked i promise you that i will hold his person sacred  lady angela i begged please leave us i  then came an interruption so unexpected and yet so natural that the whole scene seemed at once to dissolve into bathos the door was thrown open and a footman ushered in callers  lady chelsford and the marchioness of cardenne your ladyship he announced mrs and the misses colquhoun sir george treherne  it was a transformation the room with its dull note of tragedy was suddenly filled with faint perfumes shaken from the rustling draperies of half a dozen women a little chorus of light voices started the babel of smalltalk lady angela had taken her place behind the large round teatable and was talking nonsense with the tall young guardsman who had drawn his chair up to her side and i with a plate of sandwiches in my hand nearly ran into ray who was carrying a cup of tea for a quarter of an hour or so we played our parts in the comedy then a servant entered the room and whispered in my ear  his grace would be glad to see you in the library sir  i rose at once angelas eyes were fixed upon mine questioningly as i passed the table i spoke to her and purposely raised my voice so that ray should hear  your father has sent for me lady angela he is terribly industrious today  she smiled back to me quietly i lingered in the hall for a minute and ray joined me there he did not speak a word but he motioned me fiercely to precede him to the library directly we entered it was clear that something unusual had happened the great safe door stood open lord chelsford and the duke were both awaiting our coming    chapter xxxvi  i lose my post  the duke solemnly closed the door ray he said i am glad that you are here something serious has happened mr ducaine lord chelsford and i desire to ask you a few questions  i bowed what was coming i could not indeed imagine unless ray had already made the disclosure  the word code for the safe today was magenta i believe the duke asked  that is correct sir i answered  and it was known to whom  to lord chelsford yourself colonel ray and myself i answered  and what was there in the safe the duke asked  the plans for the guildford camp the new map of surrey pricked for fortifications and one or two transport schemes i answered  exactly those documents are now all missing  i strode to the safe and looked in it was as the duke had said the safe was practically empty  they were there this morning i said it was arranged that i should examine the contents of the safe the first thing and take any finished work over to the war office do you remember who has been in the room today sir  yourself myself and the woman whom you brought here an hour or so ago  mrs smithlessing i exclaimed  precisely the duke remarked drily  did you leave her alone here i asked  for two minutes only the duke answered i was called up on the telephone from the house of lords i did not imagine that there could be the slightest risk in leaving her for without the knowledge of that word magenta the safe would defy a professional locksmith  you will forgive my suggesting it your grace i said with some hesitation but you have not i presume had occasion to go to the safe during the day  i have not the duke answered tersely  then i cannot suggest any explanation of the opening of the safe i admitted it was impossible for mrs smithlessing to have opened it unless she knew the code word  the question is the duke said quietly did she know it  then i realized the object of this crossexamination the colour flared suddenly into my cheeks and as suddenly left them the absence of those papers was extraordinary to me i utterly failed to understand it  i think i know what you mean sir i said it is true that mrs smithlessing is my stepmother i believe it is true too that she is connected with the french secret police i was there this afternoonyou yourself sent me but i did not tell mrs smithlessing the code word and i know nothing of the disappearance of those documents  then ray moved forward and placed deliberately upon the table the roll of papers which i had given up to him a few hours ago  what about these he asked with biting scorn tell the duke and lord cheisford where i found them let us hear your glib young tongue telling the truth for once sir  both the duke and lord chelsford were obviously startled ray had always been my friend and upholder he spoke now with very apparent enmity  perhaps you would prefer to tell the story yourself i answered i will correct you if it is necessary  very well he answered i will tell the story and a pitiful one it is this boy is watched as we all know for owing to my folly in ignoring his antecedents a great trust has been reposed in him news was brought to me that he had been seen with his father and mrs smithlessing in gattinis restaurant later that he had found his way to their lodging i followed him there he may have gone there with an errand from you duke but when i arrived he was doing a little business on his own account and these papers were in the act of passing from him to his father  what are they lord chelsford asked  your lordship may recognize them i answered quietly they are a summary of the schemes of defence of the southern ports i was at that moment the moment when colonel ray entered considering an offer of five thousand pounds for them  even ray was staggered at my admission and the duke looked as though he could scarcely believe his ears lord chelsford was busy looking through the papers  you young blackguard ray muttered through his teeth after that admission do you still deny that you told mrs smithlessing or whatever the woman calls herself the code word for that safe  most certainly i deny it i answered firmly the two things are wholly disconnected  the duke sat down heavily in his chair i knew very well that of the three men he was the most surprised lord cheisford carefully placed the papers which he had been reading in his breastpocket ray leaned over towards him  lord chelsford he said and you duke you took this young man on trust and i pledged my word for him like many a better man i made a mistake for all that we know he has secret copies of all the work he has done for us ready to dispose of what in gods name are we going to do with him  what do you suggest lord chelsford asked softly  my way would not be yours ray answered with a hard laugh i am only half civilized you know and if he and i were alone in the desert at this moment i would shoot him without remorse such a breach of trust as this deserves death  we are unfortunately lord cheisford remarked not in a position to adopt such extreme measures it would not even be wise for us to attempt to formulate a legal charge against him the position is somewhat embarrassing what do you suggest duke  i glanced towards the duke and i was surprised to see that his hands were shaking for a man who rarely displayed feeling the duke seemed to be wonderfully affected  i can suggest nothing he answered in a low tone i must confess that i am bewildered these matters have developed so rapidly  lord cheisford looked thoughtful for a moment  i have a plan in my mind he said slowly duke should i be taking a liberty if i asked to be left alone with this young man for five minutes  the duke rose slowly to his feet he had the air of one not altogether approving of the suggestion ray glowered upon us both but offered no objection they left the room together lord cheisford at once turned to me  ducaine he said forgive me that i did not come to your aid i will see that you do not suffer later on but what in heavens name is the meaning of this last abstraction from the safe  i shook my head  the woman could never have guessed the word i said  impossible he agreed ducaine do you know why lord blenavon left england so suddenly  colonel ray knows sir i answered ask him  lord chelsford became very thoughtful  ducaine he said we are in a fix so far your plan has worked to perfection paris has plenty of false information and your real copies have all reached me safely but if you leave how is this to be carried on i do not know whom i mistrust but if the days work of the board is really to be left in the safe either here or at braster  you must choose my successor yourself sir i interrupted  the duke has always opposed my selections besides you have prepared your false copies with rare skill even i was deceived for a moment just now by your summary you dont overdo it everything is just a little wrong i am not sure even now whether i should not do better to tell ray and the duke the truth  i am in your hands sir i answered you must do as you think best  they will be back in a moment it is absurd to doubt either of them ducaine yet i shall keep silent i have an idea agree to everything i say  the duke and ray returned together lord chelsford turned to them  mr ducaine he said coldly persists in his denial of any knowledge of todays affair with regard to the future i have offered him his choice of an arrest on the charge of espionage or a twelve months cruise on the ajax which leaves tomorrow for china he has chosen the latter i shall take steps of course to see that he is not allowed to land at any callingplace or dispatch letters  ray smiled a little cruelly  the idea is an excellent one chelsford he said when did you say that the ajax sailed  tomorrow lord cheisford answered i propose to take mr ducaine to my house tonight and to hand him over to the charge of a person on whom i can thoroughly rely  the duke looked at me curiously  mr ducaine consents to go he asked  it is a voyage which i have long desired to take i answered coolly though i never expected to enjoy it at my countrys expense  the duke rang the bell  will you have mr ducaines things packed and sent acrossdid you say to your house lord chelsford  to my house lord chelsford assented  to no 19 grosvenor square the duke ordered mr ducaine will not be returning  lord chelsford rose i followed his example neither the duke nor ray attempted any form of farewell the former however laid some notes upon the table  i believe mr ducaine he said that there is a months salary due to you i have added something to the amount until today i have always considered your duties admirably fulfilled  i looked at the notes and at the duke  i thank your grace i answered i will take the liberty of declining your gift my salary has been fully paid  for a moment i fancied i caught a softer gleam in rays eyes he seemed about to speak but checked himself lord chelsford hurried me from the room and into his little brougham which was waiting  do you really mean me to go to china sir i asked him anxiously  not i he answered i am going to send you to braster    chapter xxxvii  lord chelsfords diplomacy  i dined alone with lord and lady chelsford from the moment of our arrival at chelsford house my host had encouraged nothing but the most general conversation it happened that they were alone as a great dinner party had been postponed at the last moment owing to some royal indisposition lord chelsford in his wifes presence was careful to treat me as an ordinary guest but directly she had left the room and we were alone he abandoned his reticence  mr ducaine he said from the time of our last conversation at the war office and our subsequent teteatete i have reposed in you the most implicit confidence  i have done my best sir i answered to deserve it  i believe you he declared i am going now to extend it i am going to tell you something which will probably surprise you very much since the first time when you found your documents tampered with every map and every word of writing entrusted to the safe either at braster house or cavendish square has been got at exact copies of them are in paris today  i looked at him in blank amazement the thing seemed impossible  but in very many cases i protested the code word for opening the safe has been known only to colonel ray the duke and myself  the fact remains as i have stated it lord chelsford said slowly my information is positive when you came to me and suggested that you should make two copies of everything one correct one a mass of incorrectness i must admit that i thought the idea farfetched and unworkable events however have proved otherwise i have safely received everything which you sent me and up to the present with the exception of that first plan of the winchester forts our secrets are unknown but now we have come to a deadlock  if you do not mind telling me lord chelsford i should very much like to know why you did not explain the exact circumstances to ray and the duke this afternoon  lord chelsford nodded  i thought that you would ask that he said it is not altogether an easy question to answer remember this the french war office are today in possession of an altogether false scheme of our proposed defencesa scheme which if they continue to regard it as genuine should prove nothing short of disastrous to them only you and i are in the secret at present positively i did not feel that i cared to extend that knowledge to a single other person  but you might have told colonel ray and the duke separately i remarked the duke has never been my friend and ray has other causes for being angry with me just at present but between them they rescued me from something like starvation and it is terrible for them to think of me as they are doing now  lord chelsford poured himself out a glass of wine and held it up to the light for a moment  mr ducaine he said a secret is a very subtle thing though the people who handle it are men of the most unblemished honour and reputation still the fewer they are the safer the life of that secret  but the duke and colonel ray i protested  i might remind you lord chelsford said smiling that those are precisely the two persons who shared with you the knowledge of the word which opened the safe  i laughed  i presume that you do not suspect either of them i remarked  the absurdity is obvious lord cheisford answered but the force of my former remark remains i like that secret better when it rests between you and me it means i know that for a timei promise you that it shall be only for a timeyou must lose your friends but the cause is great enough and it should be within our power to reward you later on  oh i am willing enough i answered but may i ask what you are going to do with me  lord chelsford smoked in silence for several moments  mr ducaine he said who is there in the household of the duke who opens that safe and copies those papers who is the traitor  god only knows i answered it is a hopeless mystery  yet we must solve it lord chelsford said and quickly if a single batch of genuine maps and plans were tampered with disparities would certainly appear and the thing might be suspected besides upon the face of it the thing is terribly serious  you have a plan i said  i have lord chelsford answered calmly you remember grooton  certainly he was a servant at braster  and the very faithful servant of his country also lord chelsford remarked you know i believe that he was a secret service man he is entirely safe and i have sent for him now i imagine that the duke will wish our new secretary to live still at the brandhe preferred it in your case as you will remember our new secretary is going to be my nephew he is very stolid and honest and fortunately not a chatterbox he is going to be the nominal secretary but i want you to be the one who really does the work  i am afraid i dont understand i was forced to admit  it will mean lord cheisford said some privation and a great deal of inconvenience for you but i am going to ask you to face it for the end to be gained is worth it i want you also to be at the brand but to lie hidden all the day time you can have one of the upstair rooms fitted as a writing room then you and my nephew can do the transposition and beyond all that i want you to thinkto think and to watch  my heart leaped with joy to think that after all i was not to go into exile then the quiet significance of lord chelsfords last words were further impressed upon me by the added gravity of his manner  mr ducaine he said you must see for yourself that i am running a very serious risk in making these plans with you behind the backs of the duke of rowchester and colonel ray the duke is a man of the keenest sense of honour as his recent commercial transactions have shown he has parted with a hundred thousand pounds rather than that the shadow of a stigma should rest upon his name he is also my personal friend and very sensitive of any advice or criticism then raya vc and one of the most popular soldiers in england todayhe also is quick tempered and he also is my friend you can see for yourself that in acting as i am behind the backs of these men i am laying myself open to very grave trouble yet i see no alternative there is a rank traitor either on the military board or closely connected with the dukes household he does not know it nor do they know it but everyone of his servants has been vigorously and zealously watched without avail the circle has been drawn closer and closer mr ducaine down in braster you may be able to help me in narrowing it down till only one person is within it listen  lady chelsford entered gorgeous in white satin and a flaming tiara she looked at me i thought a little gravely  morton she said i want you to spare me a minute mr ducaine will excuse you i am sure  lord cheisford and she left the room together i feeling the heat of the apartment walked to the window and raising the sash looked out into the cool dark evening at the door drawn up in front of lord cheisfords brougham was a carriage with a tall footman standing facing me i recognized him and the liveries in a moment it was the rowchester carriage some one from rowchester house was even now with lord and lady chelsford  fresh complications then had the duke come to see me off or had his suspicions been aroused was he even now insisting upon an explanation with lord cheisford the minutes passed and i began to get restless and anxious then the door opened and lord chelsford entered alone he came over at once to my side he was looking perplexed and a little annoyed  ducaine he said lady angela harberly is here  i started and i suppose my face betrayed me  lady angelahere  and she wishes to see you he continued lady chelsford is chaperoning her tonight to suffolk house but she says that she should have come here in any case she believes that you are going to china  did you tell her i asked  i have told her nothing he answered the question is what you are to tell her i understand ducaine that lady angela was engaged to be married to colonel ray  i believe that she is i admitted  then i do not understand her desire to see you lord chelsford said the duke of rowchester is my friend and relative ducaine and i do not see how i can permit this interview  and i said a quiet thrilling voice behind his back do not know how you are going to prevent it  she closed the door behind her she was so frail and so delicately beautiful in her white gown with the ropes of pearls around her neck the simply parted hair and her dark eyes were so plaintive and yet so tender that the angry exclamation died away on lord cheisfords lips  angela he said mr ducaine is here you can speak with him if you will but it must be in my presence you must not think that i do not trust youboth of you but i owe this condition to your father  she came over to me very timidly she seemed to me so beautiful so exquisitely childish that i touched the fingers of the hand she gave me with a feeling of positive reverence  you have come to wish me godspeed i murmured i shall never forget it  you are really going then  i am going for a little time out of your life lady angela i answered it is necessary lord chelsford knows that but i am not going in disgrace i am very thankful to be able to tell you that  it was not necessary to tell me she answered am i not here  i bent low over her hand which rested still in mine  mine is not a purposeless exilenor altogether an unhappy onenow i said i have work to do lady angela and i am going to it with a good heart when we meet again i hope that it may be differently your comingthe memory of it will stand often between me and loneliness it will sweeten the very bitterest of my days  you are really goingto china she murmured  i glanced towards lord chelsford his back was turned to us if he understood the meaning of my pause he made no sign  i may not tell you where i am going or why i answered but i will tell you this lady angela i shall come back and as you have come to see me tonight so shall i come to you before long if you will trust me i will prove myself worthy of it  she did not answer me with any word at all but with a sudden little forward movement of both her hands and i saw that her eyes were swimming in tears yet they shone into mine like stars and i saw heaven there  i am sorry lord chelsford said gravely interposing but lady chelsford will be waiting for you angela and i think that i must ask you to remember that i cannot sanction or appear by my silence to sanction anything of this sort  so he led her away but what did i care my heart was beating with the rapture of her backward glance i cared neither for ray nor the duke nor any living person for with me it was the one supreme moment of a mans lifetime come too at the very moment of my despair i was no longer at the bottom of the pit the wonderful gates stood open    chapter xxxviii  a terrible discovery  i called softly to grooton from my room upstairs  grooton  yes sir  you are alone  yes sir  is mr hill still up at the court  he will be there until midnight sir  a gust of wind came suddenly roaring through the wood drowning even the muffled thunder of the sea below the rain beat upon the window panes the little house strongly built though it was seemed to quiver from its very foundations i caught up my overcoat and boldly descended the narrow staircase grooton stood at the bottom holding a lamp in his hand  you are quite safe tonight sir he said therell be no one about in such a storm  i stood still for a moment the raging and tearing of the sea below had momentarily triumphed over the north wind  the trees in the spinney are snapping like twigs sir grooton remarked theres one lying right across the path outside but youll excuse me siryoure not going out  i think so grooton i answered for a few minutes remember that i have been a prisoner here for three days im dying for some fresh air  i dont think its hardly safe sir he protested deprecatingly not that theres any fear of your being seen the winds enough to carry you over the cliff  i shall risk it grooton i answered i think that the wind is going down and there wont be a soul about its too good a chance to miss  i waited for a momentary lull and then i opened the door and slipped out the first breath of cold strong air was like wine to me after my confinement but a moment later i felt my breath taken away and i was lifted almost from my feet by a sudden gust i linked my arm around the trunk of a swaying pine tree and hung there till the lull came up into the darkness from that unseen gulf below came showers of spray white as snow falling like rain all about me it was a night to remember  presently i turned inland and reached the park i left the footpath so that i should avoid all risk of meeting any one and followed the wire fencing which divided the park from the belt of fir trees bordering the road i walked for a few hundred yards and then stopped short  i had reached the point where that long straight road from braster turned sharply away inland for the second time at a point about a quarter of a mile away and rapidly approaching me came a twin pair of flaring eyes i knew at once what they werethe head lights of a motor car without a moments hesitation i doubled back to the brand  grooton i called sharply  grooton appeared  is any one at braster grange i asked  not that i have heard of sir he answered  you do not know whether mrs smithlessing is expected back  i have not heard sir they left no servants therenot even a caretaker  i stepped back again into the night and took the shortest cut across the park to the house as i neared the entrance gates i left the path and crept up close to the plantation which bordered the road my heart gave a jump as i listened i could hear the low level throbbing of a motor somewhere quite close at hand the lights had been extinguished but it was there waiting i did not hesitate any longer i kept on the turf by the side of the avenue and made my way up to the house  the library alone and one small window on the ground floor were lit i crept up on the terrace and tried to peer in but across each of the library windows the curtains were too closely drawn there remained the small window at the end of the terrace i crept on tiptoe towards this feeling my way through the darkness by the front of the house suddenly i came to a full stop i flattened myself against the stonework and held my breath some one else was on the terrace what i had heard was unmistakable it was the wind blowing amongst a womans skirts and the woman was very close at hand  i almost felt her warm breath as she stole past me i caught a gleam of a pale face sufficient to tell me who she was she passed on and took up her stand outside that small end window  i too crept nearer to itabout a yard away there was a projection of the front i stole into the deep corner and waited a few feet from me i knew that she too was waiting  half an hour perhaps an hour passed my ears became trained to all sounds that were not absolutely deadened by the roar of the wind i heard the crash of falling boughs in the wood the more distant but unchanging thunder of the sea the sharp spitting of the rain upon the stone walk and i heard the opening of the window by the side of which i was leaning  i was only just in time through the raised sash there came a hand holding a packet of some sort and out of the darkness came another hand eagerly stretched out to receive it i brushed it ruthlessly aside tore the packet from the fingers which suddenly strove to retain it and with my other hand i caught the arm a little above the wrist i heard the flying footsteps of my fellowwatcher but i did not even turn round a fierce joy was in my heart now i was to know the veil of mystery which had hung over the doings at braster was to be swept aside i stooped down till my eyes were within a few inches of the hand i passed my fingers over it i felt the ring  then i remember only that mad headlong flight back across the park where the very air seemed full of sobbing mocking voices and the ground beneath my feet swayed and heaved i could not even think coherently i heard the motor go tearing down the road past me and come to a standstill at the turn still i had no thought of any danger it never occurred to me to leave the footpath and make my way back to the brand as i might well have done by a more circuitous route i kept on the footpath and just as i reached the little iron gate which led into the spinney i felt a mans arm suddenly flung around my neck and with a jerk i was thrown almost off my feet  he is here madame i heard a low voice say take the papers from him i have him safe  i think that my desperate humour lent me more than my usual strength with a fierce effort i wrenched myself free almost immediately i heard the click of a revolver if you move a low voice said i fire what do you want i asked the papers i laughed bitterly are they worth my life i asked the life of a dozen such as you the man answered quick hand them over  then i heard a little cry from the woman who had been standing a few feet off in the struggle i had lost my cap and a faint watery moon half hidden by a ragged bank of black clouds was shining weakly down upon us  guy she cried and her voice was shaking as though with terror guy is that you  i lost my selfcontrol i forgot her sex i forgot everything except that she was responsible for this unspeakable corruption i said terrible things to her and she listened whitecalmspeechless when i had finished she signed to the man to leave us he hesitated but with a more peremptory gesture she dismissed him  guy she said you have not spared me perhaps i do not deserve it now listen the whole thing is at an end those few papers are all we want your father is already in france i am leaving at once give me those papers and you will be rid of us for ever if you do not i must stay on until i have received copies of a portion of them at any rate you know very well now that i can do this give me those that you have it will be saferin every way  give them to you i answered scornfully are you serious  very serious guy do you not see that the sooner it is all overthe betterthe saferup there  she pointed towards the house i could have struck the white fingers with their loathsome meaning  i shall take this packet to lord chelsford i said i am down here as a spya spy upon spies he is up at the house now and tomorrow this packet will be in his hands i shall tell him how i secured it i think that after that you will not have many opportunities for plying your cursed trade  you know the consequences  they are not my concern i answered coldly  she looked over her shoulder  if i she said were as unwavering in my duty as you i should call jean back  i am indifferent i answered i do not value my life enough to shrink from fighting for it  she turned away  you are very young guy she said and you talk like a very young man you must go your own way send for lord chelsford if you will but remember all that it will mean cant you see that such stern morality as yours is the most exquisite form of selfishness goodbye guy  she glided away i reached the brand undisturbed    chapter xxxix  the traitor  i do not understand you ducaine lord chelsford said slowly you have been a faithful and valuable servant to your country and you know very well that your services are not likely to be forgotten i want you only to be consistent i must know from whom you received this packet  i cannot tell you sir i answered it was a terribly dark night and it is not easy to identify a hand besides it was snatched away almost at once  in your own mind ducaine chelsford said have you hazarded a guess as to who that unseen person might be  it is too serious a matter to hazard guesses about sir i answered  nevertheless lord chelsford continued eyeing me closely in your own mind you know very well who that person was you are a bad liar ducaine there was something about the hand which told you the trutha ring perhaps at any rate something  i had no time to feel for such things sir i answered  ducaine lord chelsford said i am forced to connect your refusal to hazard even a surmise as to the identity of that hand with your sudden desire to break off all connection with this matter i am forced to come to a conclusion ducaine you have discovered the truth you know the traitor  on the contrary lord chelsford i answered i know nothing  later in the day he came to me again i could see that he had made no fresh discovery  ducaine he said what time did you say that you left here last night  at midnight sir  and you were back  before one  that corresponds exactly with grootons statement lord chelsford said and yet i have certain information that from a few minutes before eleven till two oclock not one member of the military board quitted the library  i bowed  that is conclusive i remarked  it is remarkably inconclusive to me lord chelsford remarked grimly whom else save one of your friends who are all upon the board could you possibly wish to shield  that i even wish to do so i answered is purely an assumption  you are fencing with me young man lord chelsford said grimly and it is not worth while hush  there was a rap at the door downstairs we heard the dukes measured tones  i understood that lord chelsford was here he said  lord chelsford has left your grace grooton answered  and mr hill  he has been at the house all day your grace  the duke appeared to hesitate for a moment  grooton he said i rely upon you to see that lord cheisford has this note shortly i am going for a little walk and shall probably return this way i wish you to understand that this note is for lord chelsfords own hand  certainly your grace  not only that grooton but the fact that i called here and left a communication for lord chelsford is alsoto be forgotten  i quite understand your grace grooton assured him  the duke struck a match and a moment or two later we saw him strolling along the cliff side smoking a cigarette his hands behind him prim carefully dressed walking with the measured ease of a man seeking an appetite for his dinner he was scarcely out of sight and lord chelsford was on the point of descending for his note when my heart gave a great leap lady angela emerged from the plantation and crossed the open space in front of the cottage with swift footsteps her hair was streaming in the breeze as though she had been running but there was not a vestige of colour in her cheeks her eyes too were like the eyes of a frightened child  lord chelsford descended the stairs and himself admitted her  why angela he exclaimed you look as though you had seen a ghost is anything the matter  oh i am afraid so she answered have you seen my father  why he asked fingering the note which grooton had silently laid upon the table  something has happened she exclaimed i am sure of it last night he came to me before dinner he told me that blenavon was in trouble it was necessary to send him money by a special messenger by the only person who knew his whereabouts he gave me a packet and he told me that at a quarterpast twelve last night i was to be in my musicroom and directly the stable clock struck that i was to open the window and some one would be there on the terrace and take the packet i did exactly as he told me and there was someone there but i had just held out the packet when a third person snatches it away and held my hand close to his eyes as though to try and guess who i was i managed to get it away and close the window but i think that the wrong person must have taken the packet i told my father today andyou know that terribly still look of his i thought that he was never going to speak again when i asked him if there was a good deal of money in ithe only groaned  up on the top of the stairs i was shaking with excitement i heard lord cheisford speak and his voice was hoarse  since then he asked what  a man came to see father he drove from wells he looked like a frenchman but he gave no name he was in the library for an hour when he left he walked straight out of the house and drove away again i went into the library andyou know how strong father ishe was crouching forward across the table muttering to himself it was like some sort of a fit he did not know me when i spoke to him lord chelsford what does it all mean  go on he answered tell me the rest  there is nothing else she faltered he got better presently and he kissed me i have never known him to do such a thing before except at morning or night and then he locked himself in the study and wrote about an hour afterwards i heard himasking everywhere for you the servants thought that you had come here i saw him crossing the park so i followed  lord chelsford came to the bottom of the stairs and called me by name i heard lady angelas little cry of surprise i was downstairs in a moment and she came straight into my arms her dear tearstained little face buried itself upon my shoulder  i am so thankful so thankful that you are here she murmured  and all the while with the face of a man forced into the presence of tragedy lord chelsford was reading that letter when he had finished his hands were shaking and his face was grey he moved over to the fireplace and without a moments hesitation he thrust the letter into the flames not content with that he stood over it poker in hand and beat the ashes into powder then he turned to the door  take care of angela ducaine he exclaimed and hurried out  but lady angela had taken alarm she hastened after him dragging me with her lord cheisford was past middle age but he was running along the cliff path like a boy we followed lady angela would have passed him but i held her back she did not speak a word some vague prescience of the truth even then i think had dawned upon her  we must have gone a mile before we came in sight of him he was strolling along only dimly visible in the gathering twilight still apparently smoking and with the air of a man taking a leisurely promenade he was toiling up the side of the highest cliff in the neighbourhood and once we saw him turn seaward and take off his hat as though enjoying the breeze just as he neared the summit he looked round lord chelsford waved his hand and shouted  rowchester he cried hi wait for me  the duke waved his hand as though in salute and turned apparently with the object of coming to meet us but at that moment without any apparent cause he lurched over towards the cliff side and we saw him fall lady angelas cry of frenzied horror was the most awful thing i had ever heard lord chelsford took her into his arms  climb down ducaine he gasped im done  i found the duke on the shingles curiously unmangled he had the appearance of a man who had found death restful    chapter xl  the theories of a novelist  the novelist smiled he had been buttonholed by a very great man which pleased him he raised his voice a little there were others standing around he fancied himself already the centre of the group he forgot the greatness of the great man  in common with many other people my dear marquis he said you labour under a great mistake human character is governed by as exact laws as the physical world give me a mans characteristics and i will undertake to tell you exactly how he will act under any given circumstances it is a question of mathematics we all carry with us inherited or acquired a certain amount of resistance to evil influence certain predilections towards good and vice versa according as we are decent fellows or blackguards some natures are more complex than others of coursethat only means that the weighing up of the good and evil in them is a more difficult matter there are experts who can tell you the weight of a haystack by looking at it and there are others who are able at christmastime to indulge in an unquenchable thirst by accurately computing the weight down to ounces of the pig or turkey raffled for at their favourite publichouse so the trained student of his fellows can also diagnose his subjects and anticipate their actions  the marquis smiled  you analytical novelists would destroy for us the whole romance of life he declared i will not listen to you any longer i fear ignorance less than disillusion  he
