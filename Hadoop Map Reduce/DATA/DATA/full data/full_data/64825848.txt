64825848	the tempting of tavernake   by e phillips oppenheim      book one     chapter i despair and interest  they stood upon the roof of a london boardinghouse in the neighborhood of russell squareone of those grim shelters the refuge of transatlantic curiosity and british penury the girlshe represented the former race was leaning against the frail palisading with gloomy expression and eyes set as though in fixed contemplation of the uninspiring panorama the young manunmistakably uncompromisingly englishstood with his back to the chimney a few feet away watching his companion the silence between them was as yet unbroken had lasted indeed since she had stolen away from the shabby drawingroom below where a florid lady with a raucous voice had been shouting a musichall ditty close upon her heels but without speech of any sort he had followed they were almost strangers except for the occasional word or two of greeting which the etiquette of the establishment demanded yet she had accepted his espionage without any protest of word or look he had followed her with a very definite object had she surmised it he wondered she had not turned her head or vouchsafed even a single question or remark to him since he had pushed his way through the trapdoor almost at her heels and stepped out on to the leads yet it seemed to him that she must guess  below them what seemed to be the phantasm of a painted city a wilderness of housetops of smokewreathed spires and chimneys stretched away to a murky bloodred horizon even as they stood there a deeper color stained the sky an angry sun began to sink into the piled up masses of thick vaporous clouds the girl watched with an air of sullen yet absorbed interest her companions eyes were still fixed wholly and critically upon her who was she he wondered why had she left her own country to come to a city where she seemed to have no friends no manner of interest in that caravansary of the worlds stricken ones she had been an almost unnoticed figure silent indisposed for conversation not in any obvious manner attractive her clothes notwithstanding their air of having come from a firstclass dressmaker were shabby and out of fashion their extreme neatness in itself pathetic she was thin yet not without a certain buoyant lightness of movement always at variance with her tired eyes her ceaseless air of dejection and withal she was a rebel it was written in her attitude it was evident in her lowering militant expression the smouldering fire in her eyes proclaimed it her long rather narrow face was gripped between her hands her elbows rested upon the brick parapet she gazed at that world of bloodred mists of unshapely grotesque buildings of strange tawdry colors she listened to the medley of soundscrude shrill insistent something like the groaning of a world stripped nakedand she had all the time the air of one who hates the thing she looks upon  tavernake whose curiosity concerning his companion remained unappeased decided that the moment for speech had arrived he took a step forward upon the soft pulpy leads even then he hesitated before he finally committed himself about his appearance little was remarkable save the general air of determination which gave character to his undistinguished features he was something above the medium height broadset and with rather more thick black hair than he knew how to arrange advantageously he wore a shirt which was somewhat frayed and an indifferent tie his boots were heavy and clumsy he wore also a suit of readymade clothes with the air of one who knew that they were readymade and was satisfied with them people of a nervous or sensitive disposition would without doubt have found him irritating but for a certain nameless giftan almost napoleonic concentration upon the things of the passing moment which was in itself impressive and which somehow disarmed criticism  about that bracelet he said at last  she moved her head and looked at him a young man of less assurance would have turned and fled not so tavernake once sure of his ground he was immovable there was murder in her eyes but he was not even disturbed  i saw you take it from the little table by the piano you know he continued it was rather a rash thing to do mrs fitzgerald was looking for it before i reached the stairs i expect she has called the police in by now  slowly her hand stole into the depths of her pocket and emerged something flashed for a moment high over her head the young man caught her wrist just in time caught it in a veritable grip of iron then indeed the evil fires flashed from her eyes her teeth gleamed white her bosom rose and fell in a storm of angry unuttered sobs she was dryeyed and still speechless but for all that she was a tigress a strangelycut silhouette they formed there upon the housetops with a background of empty sky their feet sinking in the warm leads  i think i had better take it he said let go  her fingers yielded the braceleta tawdry illdesigned affair of rubies and diamonds he looked at it disapprovingly  thats an ugly thing to go to prison for he remarked slipping it into his pocket it was a stupid thing to do anyhow you know you couldnt have got away with itunless he added looking over the parapet as though struck with a sudden idea unless you had a confederate below  he heard the rush of her skirts and he was only just in time nothing in fact but a considerable amount of presence of mind and the full exercise of a strength which was continually providing surprises for his acquaintances was sufficient to save her their struggles upon the very edge of the roof dislodged a brick from the palisading which went hurtling down into the street they both paused to watch it his arms still gripping her and one foot pressed against an iron rod it was immediately after they had seen it pitch harmlessly into the road that a new sensation came to this phlegmatic young man for the first time in his life he realized that it was possible to feel a certain pleasurable emotion in the close grasp of a being of the opposite sex consequently although she had now ceased to struggle he kept his arms locked around her looking into her face with an interest intense enough but more analytical than emotional as though seeking to discover the meaning of this curious throbbing of his pulses she herself as though exhausted remained quite passive shivering a little in his grasp and breathing like a hunted animal whose last hour has come their eyes met then she tore herself away  you are a hateful person she said deliberately a hateful interfering person i detest you  i think that we will go down now he replied  he raised the trapdoor and glanced at her significantly she held her skirts closely together and passed through it without looking at him she stepped lightly down the ladder and without hesitation descended also a flight of uncarpeted attic stairs here however upon the landing she awaited him with obvious reluctance  are you going to send for the police she asked without looking at him  no he answered  why not  if i had meant to give you away i should have told mrs fitzgerald at once that i had seen you take her bracelet instead of following you out on to the roof  do you mind telling me what you do propose to do then she continued still without looking at him still without the slightest note of appeal in her tone  he withdrew the bracelet from his pocket and balanced it upon his finger  i am going to say that i took it for a joke he declared  she hesitated  mrs fitzgeralds sense of humor is not elastic she warned him  she will be very angry of course he assented but she will not believe that i meant to steal it  the girl moved slowly a few steps away  i suppose that i ought to thank you she said still with averted face and sullen manner you have really been very decent i am much obliged  are you not coming down he asked  not at present she answered i am going to my room  he looked around the landing on which they stood at the miserable uncarpeted floor the illpainted doors on which the longforgotten varnish stood out in blisters the jumble of dilapidated hotwater cans a mop and a medley of brooms and rags all thrown down together in a corner  but these are the servants quarters surely he remarked  they are good enough for me my room is here she told him turning the handle of one of the doors and disappearing the prompt turning of the key sounded he thought a little ungracious  with the bracelet in his hand tavernake descended three more flights of stairs and entered the drawingroom of the private hotel conducted by mrs raithby lawrence whose husband one learned from her frequent reiteration of the fact had once occupied a distinguished post in the merchant service of his country the disturbance following upon the disappearance of the bracelet was evidently at its height there were at least a dozen people in the room most of whom were standing up the central figure of them all was mrs fitzgerald large and florid whose yellow hair with its varied shades frankly admitted its indebtedness to peroxide a lady of the dashing type who had once made her mark in the musichalls but was now happily married to a commercial traveler who was seldom visible mrs fitzgerald was talking  in respectable boardinghouses mrs lawrence she declared with great emphasis thefts may sometimes take place i will admit in the servants quarters and with all their temptations poor things its not so much to be wondered at but no such thing as this has ever happened to me beforeto have jewelry taken almost from my person in the drawingroom of what should be a wellconducted establishment not a servant in the room remember from the moment i took it off until i got up from the piano and found it missing its your guests youve got to look after mrs lawrence sorry to say it though i am  mrs lawrence managed here through sheer loss of breath on the part of her assailant to interpose a tearful protest  i am quite sure she protested feebly that there is not a person in this house who would dream of stealing anything however valuable it was i am most particular always about references  valuable indeed mrs fitzgerald continued with increased volubility id have you understand that i am not one of those who wear trumpery jewelry thirtyfive guineas that bracelet cost me if it cost a penny and if my husband were only at home i could show you the receipt  then there came an interruption of almost tragical interest mrs fitzgerald her mouth still open her stream of eloquence suddenly arrested stood with her artificially darkened eyes riveted upon the stolid selfcomposed figure in the doorway every one else was gazing in the same direction tavernake was holding the bracelet in the palm of his hand  thirtyfive guineas he repeated if i had known that it was worth as much as that i do not think that i should have dared to touch it  youyou took it mrs fitzgerald gasped  i am afraid he admitted that it was rather a clumsy joke i apologize mrs fitzgerald i hope you did not really imagine that it had been stolen  one was conscious of the little thrill of emotion which marked the termination of the episode most of the people not directly concerned were disappointed they were being robbed of their excitement their hopes of a tragical denouement were frustrated mrs lawrences worn face plainly showed her relief the lady with the yellow hair on the other hand who had now succeeded in working herself up into a towering rage snatched the bracelet from the young mans fingers and with a purple flush in her cheeks was obviously struggling with an intense desire to box his ears  thats not good enough for a tale she exclaimed harshly i tell you i dont believe a word of it took it for a joke indeed i only wish my husband were here hed know what to do  your husband couldnt do much more than get your bracelet back maam mrs lawrence replied with acerbity such a fuss and calling every one thieves too id be ashamed to be so suspicious  mrs fitzgerald glared haughtily at her hostess  its all very well for those that dont possess any jewelry and dont know the value of it to talk she declared with her eyes fixed upon a black jet ornament which hung from the other womans neck what i say is this and you may just as well hear it from me now as later i dont believe this cockandbull story of mr tavernakes them as took my bracelet from that table meant keeping it only they hadnt the courage and im not referring to you mr tavernake the lady continued vigorously because i dont believe you took it for all your talk about a joke and whom you may be shielding it wouldnt take me two guesses to name and your motive must be clear to every one the common hussy  you are exciting yourself unnecessarily mrs fitzgerald tavernake remarked let me assure you that it was i who took your bracelet from that table  mrs fitzgerald regarded him scornfully  do you expect me to believe a tale like that she demanded  why not tavernake replied it is the truth i am sorry that you have been so upset  it is not the truth  more sensation another unexpected entrance once more interest in the affair was revived after all the lookerson felt that they were not to be robbed of their tragedy an old lady with yellow cheeks and jet black eyes leaned forward with her hand to her ear anxious not to miss a syllable of what was coming tavernake bit his lip it was the girl from the roof who had entered the room  i have no doubt she continued in a cool clear tone that mrs fitzgeralds first guess would have been correct i took the bracelet i did not take it for a joke i did not take it because i admire iti think it is hideously ugly i took it because i had no money  she paused and looked around at them all quietly yet with something in her face from which they all shrank she stood where the light fell full upon her shabby black gown and dejectedlooking hat the hollows in her pale cheeks and the faint rims under her eyes were clearly manifest but notwithstanding her fragile appearance she held herself with composure and even dignity twentythirty seconds must have passed whilst she stood there slowly finishing the buttoning of her gloves no one attempted to break the silence she dominated them allthey felt that she had something more to say even mrs fitzgerald felt a weight upon her tongue  it was a clumsy attempt she went on i should have had no idea where to raise money upon the thing but i apologize to you nevertheless mrs fitzgerald for the anxiety which my removal of your valuable property must have caused you she added turning to the owner of the bracelet whose cheeks were once more hot with anger at the contempt in the girls tone i suppose i ought to thank you mr tavernake also for your wellmeant effort to preserve my character in future that shall be my sole charge has any one anything more to say to me before i go  somehow or other no one had mrs fitzgerald was irritated and fuming but she contented herself with a snort her speech was ready enough as a rule but there was a look in this girls eyes from which she was glad enough to turn away mrs lawrence made a weak attempt at a farewell  i am sure she began we are all sorry for whats occurred and that you must gonot that perhaps it isnt better under the circumstances she added hastily as regards  there is nothing owing to you the girl interrupted calmly you may congratulate yourself upon that for if there were you would not get it nor have i stolen anything else  about your luggage mrs lawrence asked  when i need it i will send for it the girl replied  she turned her back upon them and before they realized it she was gone she had indeed something of the grand manner she had come to plead guilty to a theft and she had left them all feeling a little like snubbed children mrs fitzgerald as soon as the spell of the girls presence was removed was one of the first to recover herself she felt herself beginning to grow hot with renewed indignation  a thief she exclaimed looking around the room just an ordinary selfconvicted thief thats what i call her and nothing else and here we all stood like a lot of ninnies why if id done my duty id have locked the door and sent for a policeman  too late now anyway mrs lawrence declared shes gone for good and no mistake walked right out of the house i heard her slam the front door  and a good job too mrs fitzgerald armed we dont want any of her sort herenot those whove got things of value about them i bet she didnt leave america for nothing  a little grayhaired lady who had not as yet spoken and who very seldom took part in any discussion at all looked up from her knitting she was desperately poor but she had charitable instincts  i wonder what made her want to steal she remarked quietly  a born thief mrs fitzgerald declared with convictiona real bad lot one of your slylooking ones i call her  the little lady sighed  when i was better off she continued i used to help at a soup kitchen in poplar i have never forgotten a certain look we used to see occasionally in the faces of some of the men and women i found out what it meantit was hunger once or twice lately i have passed the girl who has just gone out upon the stairs and she almost frightened me she had just the same look in her eyes i noticed it yesterdayit was just before dinner toobut she never came down  she paid so much for her room and extra for meals mrs lawrence said thoughtfully she never would have a meal unless she paid for it at the time to tell you the truth i was feeling a bit uneasy about her she hasnt been in the diningroom for two days and from what they tell me theres no signs of her having eaten anything in her room as for getting anything out why should she it would be cheaper for her here than anywhere if shed got any money at all  there was an uncomfortable silence the little old lady with the knitting looked down the street into the sultry darkness which had swallowed up the girl  i wonder whether mr tavernake knows anything about her some one suggested  but tavernake was not in the room     chapter ii a teteatete supper  tavernake caught her up in new oxford street and fell at once into step with her he wasted no time whatever upon preliminaries  i should be glad he said if you would tell me your name  her first glance at him was fierce enough to have terrified a different sort of man upon tavernake it had absolutely no effect  you need not unless you like of course he went on but i wish to talk to you for a few moments and i thought that it would be more convenient if i addressed you by name i do not remember to have heard it mentioned at blenheim house and mrs lawrence as you know does not introduce her guests  by this time they had walked a score or so of paces together the girl after her first furious glance had taken absolutely no notice of him except to quicken her pace a little tavernake remained by her side however showing not the slightest sense of embarrassment or annoyance he seemed perfectly content to wait and he had not in the least the appearance of a man who could be easily shaken off from a fit of furious anger she passed suddenly and without warning to a state of half hysterical amusement  you are a foolish absurd person she declared please go away i do not wish you to walk with me  tavernake remained imperturbable she remembered suddenly his intervention on her behalf  if you insist upon knowing she said my name at blenheim house was beatrice burnay i am much obliged to you for what you did for me there but that is finished i do not wish to have any conversation with you and i absolutely object to your company please leave me at once  i am sorry he answered but that is not possible  not possible she repeated wonderingly  he shook his head  you have no money you have eaten no dinner and i do not believe that you have any idea where you are going he declared deliberately  her face was once more dark with anger  even if that were the truth she insisted tell me what concern it is of yours your reminding me of these facts is simply an impertinence  i am sorry that you look upon it in that light he remarked still without the least sign of discomposure we will if you do not mind waive the discussion for the moment do you prefer a small restaurant or a corner in a big one there is music at frascatis but there are not so many people in the smaller ones  she turned half around upon the pavement and looked at him steadfastly his personality was at last beginning to interest her his square jaw and measured speech were indices of a character at least unusual she recognized certain invincible qualities under an exterior absolutely commonplace  are you as persistent about everything in life she asked him  why not he replied i try always to be consistent  what is your name  leonard tavernake he answered promptly  are you well offi mean moderately well off  i have a quite sufficient income  have you any one dependent upon you  not a soul he declared i am my own master in every sense of the word  she laughed in an odd sort of way  then you shall pay for your persistence she saidi mean that i may as well rob you of a sovereign as the restaurant people  you must tell me now where you would like to go to he insisted it is getting late  i do not like these foreign places she replied i should prefer to go to the grillroom of a good restaurant  we will take a taxicab he announced you have no objection  she shrugged her shoulders  if you have the money and dont mind spending it she said i will admit that i have had all the walking i want besides the toe of my boot is worn through and i find it painful yesterday i tramped ten miles trying to find a man who was getting up a concert party for the provinces  and did you find him he asked hailing a cab  yes i found him she answered indifferently we went through the usual programme he heard me sing tried to kiss me and promised to let me know nobody ever refuses anything in my profession you see they promise to let you know  are you a singer then or an actress  i am neither she told him i said my profession because it is the only one to which i have ever tried to belong i have never succeeded in obtaining an engagement in this country i do not suppose that even if i had persevered i should ever have had one  you have given up the idea then he remarked  i have given it up she admitted a little curtly please do not think because i am allowing you to be my companion for a short time that you may ask me questions how fast these taxies go  they drew up at their destinationa wellknown restaurant in regent street he paid the cabman and they descended a flight of stairs into the grillroom  i hope that this place will suit you he said i have not much experience of restaurants  she looked around and nodded  yes she replied i think that it will do  she was very shabbily dressed and he although his appearance was by no means ordinary was certainly not of the type which inspires immediate respect in even the grillroom of a fashionable restaurant nevertheless they received prompt and almost officious service tavernake as he watched his companions air her manner of seating herself and accepting the attentions of the head waiter felt that nameless impulse which was responsible for his having followed her from blenheim house and which he could only call curiosity becoming stronger an exceedingly matteroffact person he was also by instinct and habit observant he never doubted but that she belonged to a class of society from which the guests at the boardinghouse where they had both lived were seldom recruited and of which he himself knew little he was not in the least a snob this young man but he found the fact interesting life with him was already very much the same as a ledger accounta matter of debits and credits and he had never failed to include among the latter that curious gift of breeding for which he himself denied it by heritage had somehow substituted a complete and exceedingly rare naturalness  i should like she announced laying down the carte a fried sole some cutlets an ice and black coffee  the waiter bowed  and for monsieur  tavernake glanced at his watch it was already ten oclock  i will take the same he declared  and to drink  she seemed indifferent  any light wine she answered carelessly white or red  tavernake took up the wine list and ordered sauterne they were left alone in their corner for a few minutes almost the only occupants of the place  you are sure that you can afford this she asked looking at him critically it may cost you a sovereign or thirty shillings  he studied the prices on the menu  i can afford it quite well and i have plenty of money with me he assured her but i do not think that it will cost more than eighteen shillings while we are waiting for the sole shall we talk i can tell you if you choose to hear why i followed you from the boardinghouse  i dont mind listening to you she told him or i will talk with you about anything you like there is only one subject which i cannot discuss that subject is myself and my own doings  tavernake was silent for a moment  that makes conversation a bit difficult he remarked she leaned back in her chair  after this evening she said i go out of your life as completely and finally as though i had never existed i have a fancy to take my poor secrets with me if you wish to talk tell me about yourself you have gone out of your way to be kind to me i wonder why it doesnt seem to be your role  he smiled slowly his face was fashioned upon broad lines and the relaxing of his lips lightened it wonderfully he had good teeth clear gray eyes and coarse black hair which he wore a trifle long his forehead was too massive for good looks  no he admitted i do not think that benevolence is one of my characteristics  her dark eyes were turned full upon him her red lips redder than ever they seemed against the pallor of her cheeks and her deep brown hair curled slightly there was something almost insolent in her tone  you understand i hope she continued that you have nothing whatever to look for from me in return for this sum which you propose to expend for my entertainment  i understand that he replied  not even gratitude she persisted i really do not feel grateful to you you are probably doing this to gratify some selfish interest or curiosity i warn you that i am quite incapable of any of the proper sentiments of life  your gratitude would be of no value to me whatever he assured her  she was still not wholly satisfied his complete stolidity frustrated every effort she made to penetrate beneath the surface  if i believed she went on that you were one of those menthe world is full of them you knowwho will help a woman with a reasonable appearance so long as it does not seriously interfere with their own comfort  your sex has nothing whatever to do with it he interrupted as to your appearance i have not even considered it i could not tell you whether you are beautiful or uglyi am no judge of these matters what i have done i have done because it pleased me to do it  do you always do what pleases you she asked  nearly always  she looked him over again attentively with an interest obviously impersonal a trifle supercilious  i suppose she remarked you consider yourself one of the strong people of the world  i do not know about that he answered i do not often think about myself  i mean she explained that you are one of those people who struggle hard to get just what they want in life  his jaw suddenly tightened and she saw the likeness to napoleon  i do more than struggle he affirmed i succeed if i make up my mind to do a thing i do it if i make up my mind to get a thing i get it it means hard work sometimes but that is all  for the first time a really natural interest shone out of her eyes the half sulky contempt with which she had received his advances passed away she became at that moment a human being selfforgetting the heritage of her charmsfor she really had a curious but very poignant attractivenesssuddenly evident it was only a momentary lapse and it was entirely wasted not even one of the waiters happened to be looking that way and tavernake was thinking wholly of himself  it is a good deal to saythat she remarked reflectively  it is a good deal but it is not too much he declared every man who takes life seriously should say it  then she laughedactually laughedand he had a vision of flashing white teeth of a mouth breaking into pleasant curves of dark mirthlit eyes lustreless no longer provocative inspiring a vague impression as of something pleasant warmed his blood it was a rare thing for him to be so stirred but even then it was not sufficient to disturb the focus of his thoughts  tell me she demanded what do you do what is your profession or work  i am with a firm of auctioneers and estate agents he answered readilymessrs dowling spence  company the name is our offices are in waterloo place  you find it interesting  of course he answered interesting why not i work at it  are you a partner  no he admitted six years ago i was a carpenter then i became an errand boy in mr dowlings office i had to learn the business you see today i am a sort of manager in eighteen months timeperhaps before that if they do not offer me a partnershipi shall start for myself  once more the subtlest of smiles flickered at the corners of her lips  do they know yet she asked with faint irony  not yet he replied with absolute seriousness they might tell me to go and i have a few things to learn yet i would rather make experiments for some one else than for myself i can use the results later they will help me to make money  she laughed softly and wiped the tears out of her eyes they were really very beautiful eyes notwithstanding the dark rims encircling them  if only i had met you before she murmured  why he asked  she shook her head  dont ask me she begged it would not be good for your conceit if you have any to tell you  i have no conceit and i am not inquisitive he said but i do not see why you laughed  their period of waiting came to an end at this point the fish was brought and their conversation became disjointed in the silence which followed the old shadow crept over her face once only it lifted it was while they were waiting for the cutlets she leaned towards him her elbows upon the tablecloth her face supported by her fingers  i think that it is time we left these generalities she insisted and you told me something rather more personal something which i am very anxious to know tell me exactly why so selfcentered a person as yourself should interest himself in a fellowcreature at all it seems odd to me  it is odd he admitted frankly i will try to explain it to you but it will sound very bald and i do not think that you will understand i watched you a few nights ago out on the roof at blenheim house you were looking across the housetops and you didnt seem to be seeing anything at all really and yet all the time i knew that you were seeing things i couldnt you were understanding and appreciating something which i knew nothing of and it worried me i tried to talk to you that evening but you were rude  you really are a curious person she remarked are you always worried then if you find that some one else is seeing things or understanding things which are outside your comprehension  always he replied promptly  you are too farreaching she affirmed you want to gather everything into your life you cannot you will only be unhappy if you try no man can do it you must learn your limitations or suffer all your days  limitations he repeated the words with measureless scorn if i learn them at all he declared with unexpected force it will be with scars and bruises for nothing else will content me  we are i should say almost the same age she remarked slowly  i am twentyfive he told her  i am twentytwo she said it seems strange that two people whose ideas of life are as far apart as the poles should have come together like this even for a moment i do not understand it at all did you expect that i should tell you just what i saw in the clouds that night  no he answered not exactly i have spoken of my first interest in you only there are other things i told a lie about the bracelet and i followed you out of the boardinghouse and i brought you here for some other for quite a different reason  tell me what it was she demanded  i do not know it myself he declared solemnly i really and honestly do not know it it is because i hoped that it might come to me while we were together that i am here with you at this moment i do not like impulses which i do not understand  she laughed at him a little scornfully  after all she said although it may not have dawned upon you yet it is probably the same wretched reason you are a man and you have the poison somewhere in your blood i am really not badlooking you know  he looked at her critically she was a little overslim perhaps but she was certainly wonderfully graceful even the poise of her head the manner in which she leaned back in her chair had its individuality her features too were good though her mouth had grown a trifle hard for the first time the dead pallor of her cheeks was relieved by a touch of color even tavernake realized that there were great possibilities about her nevertheless he shook his head  i do not agree with you in the least he asserted firmly your looks have nothing to do with it i am sure that it is not that  let me crossexamine you she suggested think carefully now does it give you no pleasure at all to be sitting here alone with me  he answered her deliberately it was obvious that he was speaking the truth  i am not conscious that it does he declared the only feeling i am aware of at the present moment in connection with you is the curiosity of which i have already spoken  she leaned a little towards him extending her very shapely fingers once more the smile at her lips transformed her face  look at my hand she said tell mewouldnt you like to hold it just for a minute if i gave it you  her eyes challenged his softly and yet imperiously his whole attention however seemed to be absorbed by her fingernails it seemed strange to him that a girl in her straits should have devoted so much care to her hands  no he answered deliberately i have no wish to hold your hand why should i  look at me she insisted  he did so without embarrassment or hesitationit was more than ever apparent that he was entirely truthful she leaned back in her chair laughing softly to herself  oh my friend mr leonard tavernake she exclaimed if you were not so crudely so adorably so miraculously truthful what a prig prig prig you would be the cutlets at last thank goodness your crossexamination is over i pronounce you not guilty  during the progress of the rest of the meal they talked very little at its conclusion tavernake discharged the bill having carefully checked each item and tipped the waiter the exact amount which the man had the right to expect they ascended the stairs together to the street the girl lingering a few steps behind on the pavement her fingers touched his arm  i wonder would you mind driving me down to the embankment she asked almost humbly it was so close down there and i want some air  this was an extravagance which he had scarcely contemplated but he did not hesitate he called a taxicab and seated himself by her side her manner seemed to have grown quieter and more subdued her tone was no longer semibelligerent  i will not keep you much longer she promised i suppose i am not so strong as i used to be i have had scarcely anything to eat for two days and conversation has become an unknown luxury i thinkit seems absurdbut i think that i am feeling a little faint  the air will soon revive you he said as to our conversation i am disappointed i think that you are very foolish not to tell me more about yourself  she closed her eyes ignoring his remark they turned presently into a narrower thoroughfare she leaned towards him  you have been very good to me she admitted almost timidly and i am afraid that i have not been very gracious we shall not see one another again after this evening i wonderwould you care to kiss me  he opened his lips and closed them again he sat quite still his eyes fixed upon the road ahead until he had strangled something absolutely absurd something unrecognizable  i would rather not he decided quietly i know you mean to be kind but that sort of thingwell i dont think i understand it besides he added with a sudden naive relief as he clutched at a fugitive but plausible thought if i did you would not believe the things which i have been telling you  he had a curious idea that she was disappointed as she turned her head away but she said nothing arrived at the embankment the cab came slowly to a standstill the girl descended there was something new in her manner she looked away from him when she spoke  you had better leave me here she said i am going to sit upon that seat  then came those few seconds hesitation which were to count for a great deal in his life the impulse which bade him stay with her was unaccountable but it conquered  if you do not object he remarked with some stiffness i should like to sit here with you for a little time there is certainly a breeze  she made no comment but walked on he paid the man and followed her to the empty seat opposite some illuminated advertisements blazed their unsightly message across the murky sky between the two curving rows of yellow lights the river flowedblack turgid hopeless even here though they had escaped from its absolute thrall the faraway roar of the city beat upon their ears she listened to it for a moment and then pressed her hands to the side of her head  oh how i hate it she moaned the voices always the voices calling threatening beating you away take my hands leonard tavernakehold me  he did as she bade him clumsily as yet without comprehension  you are not well he muttered  her eyes opened and a flash of her old manner returned she smiled at him feebly but derisively  you foolish boy she cried cant you see that i am dying hold my hands tightly and watchwatch here is one more thing you can seethat you cannot understand  he saw the empty phial slip from her sleeve and fall on to the pavement with a cry he sprang up and carrying her in his arms rushed out into the road     chapter iii an unpleasant meeting  it was a quarter past eleven and the theatres were disgorging their usual nightly crowds the most human thoroughfare in any of the worlds great cities was at its best and brightest everywhere commissionaires were blowing their whistles the streets were thronged with slowlymoving vehicles the pavements were stirring with life the little crowd which had gathered in front of the chemists shop was swept away after all none of them knew exactly what they had been waiting for there was a rumor that a woman had fainted or had met with an accident certainly she had been carried into the shop and into the inner room the door of which was still closed a few passersby had gathered together and stared and waited for a few minutes but had finally lost interest and melted away a human thoroughfare this indeed one of the pulses of the great city beating time night and day to the tragedies of life the chemists assistant with impassive features was serving a couple of casual customers from behind the counter only a few yards away beyond the closed door the chemist himself and a hastily summoned doctor fought with death for the body of the girl who lay upon the floor faint moans coming every now and then from her blue lips  tavernake whose forced inaction during that terrible struggle had become a burden to him slipped softly from the room as soon as the doctor had whispered that the acute crisis was over and passed through the shop out into the street a solemn dazed figure among the lighthearted crowd even in those grim moments the mans individualism spoke up to him he was puzzled at his own action he asked himself a questionnot indeed with regret but with something more than curiosity and actual selfprobingas though by concentrating his mind upon his recent course of action he would be able to understand the motives which had influenced him why had he chosen to burden himself with the care of this desperate young woman supposing she lived what was to become of her he had acquired a certain definite responsibility with regard to her future for whatever the doctor and his assistant might do it was his own promptitude and presence of mind which had given her the first chance of life without a doubt he had behaved foolishly why not vanish into the crowd and have done with it what was it to him after all whether this girl lived or died he had done his dutymore than his duty why not disappear now and let her take her chance his common sense spoke to him loudly such thoughts as these beat upon his brain  just for once in his life however his common sense exercised an altogether subordinate position he knew very well even while he listened to these voices that he was only counting the minutes until he could return having absolutely decided that the only reasonable course left for him to pursue was to return home and leave the girl to her fate he found himself back inside the shop within a quarter of an hour the chemist had just come out from the inner room and looked up at his entrance  shell do now he announced  tavernake nodded he was amazed at his own sense of relief  i am glad he declared  the doctor joined them his black bag in his hand prepared for departure he addressed himself to tavernake as the responsible person  the young lady will be all right now he said but she may be rather queer for a day or two fortunately she made the usual mistake of people who are ignorant of medicine and its effectsshe took enough poison to kill a whole household you had better take care of her young man he added dryly shell be getting into trouble if she tries this sort of thing again  will she need any special attention during the next few days tavernake asked the circumstances under which i brought her here are a little unusual and i am not quite sure  take her home to bed the doctor interrupted and youll find shell sleep it off she seems to have a splendid constitution although she has let herself run down if you need any further advice and your own medical man is not available i will come and see her if you send for me camden my name is telephone number 734 gerrard  i should be glad to know the amount of your fee if you please tavernake said  my fee is two guineas the doctor answered  tavernake paid him and he went away already the shadow of the tragedy was passing the chemist had joined his assistant and was busy dispensing drugs behind his counter  you can go in to the young lady if you like he remarked to tavernake i dare say shell feel better to have some one with her  tavernake passed slowly into the inner room closing the door behind him he was scarcely prepared for so piteous a sight the girls face was white and drawn as she lay upon the couch to which they had lifted her the fighting spirit was dead she was in a state of absolute and complete collapse she opened her eyes at his coning but closed them again almost immediatelyless it seemed from any consciousness of his presence than from sheer exhaustion  i am glad that you are better he whispered crossing the room to her side  thank you she murmured almost inaudibly  tavernake stood looking down upon her and his sense of perplexity increased stretched on the hard horsehair couch she seemed indeed pitifully thin and younger than her years the scowl which had passed from her face had served in some measure as a disguise  we shall have to leave here in a few minutes he said softly they will want to close the shop  i am so sorry she faltered to have given you all this trouble you must send me to a hospital or the workhouseanywhere  you are sure that there are no friends to whom i can send he asked  there is no one  she closed her eyes and tavernake sat quite still on the end of her couch his elbow upon his knee his head resting upon his hand presently the rush of customers having ceased the chemist came in  i think if i were you i should take her home now he remarked shell probably drop off to sleep very soon and wake up much stronger i have made up a prescription here in case of exhaustion  tavernake stared at the man take her home his sense of humor was faint enough but he found himself trying to imagine the faces of mrs lawrence or mrs fitzgerald if he should return with her to the boardinghouse at such an hour  i suppose you know where she lives the chemist inquired curiously  of course tavernake assented you are quite right i dare say she is strong enough now to walk as far as the pavement  he paid the bill for the medicines and they lifted her from the couch between them she walked slowly into the outer shop then she began to drag on their arms and she looked up at the chemist a little piteously  may i sit down for a moment she begged i feel faint  they placed her in one of the cane chairs facing the door the chemist mixed her some sal volatile  i am sorry she murmured so sorry in a few minutesi shall be better  outside the throng of pedestrians had grown less but from the great restaurant opposite a constant stream of motorcars and carriages was slowly bringing away the supper guests tavernake stood at the door watching them idly the traffic was momentarily blocked and almost opposite to him a motorcar the simple magnificence of which filled him with wonder had come to a standstill the chauffeur and footman both wore livery which was almost white inside a swinging vase of flowers was suspended from the roof a man and a woman leaned back in luxurious easychairs the man was dark and had the look of a foreigner the woman was very fair she wore a long ermine cloak and a tiara of pearls  tavernake whose interest in the passing throngs was entirely superficial found himself for some reason curiously attracted by this glimpse into a world of luxury of which he knew nothing attracted too by the womans delicate face with its uncommon type of beauty their eyes met as he stood there stolid and motionless framed in the doorway tavernake continued to stare unmindful perhaps unconscious of the rudeness of his action the woman after a moment glanced away at the shopwindow a sudden thought seemed to strike her she spoke through the tube at her side and turned to her companion meanwhile the footman leaning from his place held out his arm in warning and the car was slowly backed to the side of the pavement the lady felt for a moment in a bag of white satin which lay upon the round table in front of her and handed a slip of paper through the open window to the servant who had already descended and was standing waiting he came at once towards the shop passing tavernake who remained in the doorway  will you make this up at once please he directed handing the paper across to the chemist  the chemist took it in his hand and turned away mechanically toward the dispensing room suddenly he paused and looking back shook his head  for whom is this prescription required he asked  for my mistress the man answered her name is there  where is she  outside she is waiting for it  if she really wants this made up tonight the chemist declared she must come in and sign the book  the footman looked across the counter for a moment a little blankly  am i to tell her that he inquired its only a sleeping draught her regular chemist makes it up all right  that may be the man behind the counter replied but you see i am not her regular chemist you had better go and tell her so  the footman departed upon his errand without a glance at the girl who was sitting within a few feet of him  i am very sorry madam he announced to his mistress that the chemist declines to make up the prescription unless you sign the book  very well then i will come she declared  the woman handed from the automobile by her servant lifted her white satin skirts in both hands and stepped lightly across the pavement tavernake stood on one side to let her pass she seemed to him to be indeed a creature of that other world of which he knew nothing her slow graceful movements the shimmer of her skirt her silk stockings the flashing of the diamond buckles upon her shoes the faint perfume from her clothes the soft touch of her ermine as she swept byall these things were indeed strange to him his eyes followed her with rapt interest as she approached the counter  you wish me to sign for my prescription she asked the chemist i will do so with pleasure if it is necessary only you must not keep me waiting long  her voice was very low and very musical the slight smile which had parted her tired lips was almost pathetic even the chemist felt himself to be a human being he turned at once to his shelves and began to prepare the drug  i am sorry madam that it should have been necessary to fetch you in he said apologetically my assistant will give you the book if you will kindly sign it  the assistant dived beneath the counter reappearing almost immediately with a black volume and a pen and ink the chemist was engrossed upon his task tavernakes eyes were still riveted upon this woman who seemed to him the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in life no one was watching the girl the chemist was the first to see her face and that only in a looking glass he stopped in the act of mixing his drug and turned slowly round his expression was such that they all followed his eyes the girl was sitting up in her chair with a sudden spot of color burning in her cheeks her fingers gripping the counter as though for support her eyes dilated unnatural burning in their white setting with an unholy fire the lady was the last to turn her head and the bottle of eaudecologne which she had taken up from the counter slipped with a crash to the floor all expression seemed to pass from her face the very life seemed drawn from it those who were watching her saw suddenly an old woman looking at something of which she was afraid  the girl seemed to find an unnatural strength she dragged herself up and turned wildly to tavernake  take me away she cried in a low voice take me away at once  the woman at the counter did not speak tavernake stepped quickly forward and then hesitated the girl was on her feet now and she clutched at his arms her eyes besought him  you must take me away please she begged hoarsely i am well nowquite well i can walk  tavernakes lack of imagination stood him in good stead then he simply did what he was told did it in perfectly mechanical fashion without asking any questions with the girl leaning heavily upon his arm he stepped into the street and almost immediately into a passing taxicab which he had hailed from the threshold of the shop as he closed the door he glanced behind him the woman was standing there half turned towards him still with that strange stony look upon her lifeless face the chemist was bending across the counter towards her wondering perhaps if another incident were to be drawn into his nights work the eaudecologne was running in a little stream across the floor  where to sir the taxicab driver asked tavernake  where to tavernake repeated  the girl was clinging to his arm  tell him to drive away from here she whispered to drive anywhere but away from here  drive straight on tavernake directed along fleet street and up holborn i will give you the address later on  the man changed his speed and their pace increased tavernake sat quite still dumfounded by these amazing happenings the girl by his side was clutching his arm sobbing a little hysterically holding him all the time as though in terror     chapter iv breakfast with beatrice   the girl awakened perhaps by the passing of some heavy cart along the street below or by the touch of the sunbeam which lay across her pillow first opened her eyes and then after a preliminary stare around sat up in bed the events of the previous night slowly shaped themselves in her mind she remembered everything up to the commencement of that drive in the taxicab sometime after that she must have fainted and nowwhat had become of her where was she  she looked around her in everincreasing surprise certainly it was the strangest room she had ever been in the floor was dusty and innocent of any carpet the window was bare and uncurtained the walls were unpapered but covered here and there with strangelooking plans one of them taking up nearly the whole side of the rooma very rough piece of work with little dabs of blue paint here and there and shadings and diagrams which were absolutely unintelligible she herself was lying upon a battered iron bedstead and she was wearing a very coarse nightdress her own clothes were folded up and lay upon a piece of brown paper on the floor by the side of the bed to all appearance the room was entirely unfurnished except that in the middle of it was a hideous papier mache screen  after her first bewildered inspection of her surroundings it was upon this screen that her attention was naturally directed obviously it must be there to conceal something very carefully she leaned out of bed until she was able to see around the corner of it then her heart gave a little jump and she was only just able to stifle an exclamation of fear some one was sitting therea mansitting on a battered cane chair bending over a roll of papers which were stretched upon a rude deal table she felt her cheeks grow hot it must be tavernake where had he brought her what did his presence in the room mean  the bed creaked heavily as she regained her former position a voice came to her from behind the screen she knew it at once it was tavernakes  are you awake he asked  yes she answeredyes i am awake is that mr tavernake where am i please  first of all are you better he inquired  i am better she assured him sitting up in bed and pulling the clothes to her chin i am quite well now tell me at once where i am and what you are doing over there  there is nothing to be terrified about tavernake answered to all effects and purposes i am in another room when i move to the door as i shall do directly i shall drag the screen with me i can promise you  please explain everything she begged quickly i am mostuncomfortable  at halfpast twelve this morning tavernake said i found myself alone in a taxicab with you without any luggage or any idea where to go to to make matters worse you fainted i tried two hotels but they refused to take you in they were probably afraid that you were going to be ill then i thought of this room i am employed as you know by a firm of estate agents i do a great deal of work on my own account however which i prefer to do in secret and unknown to any one for that reason i hired this room a year ago and i come here most evenings to work sometimes i stay late so last month i bought a small bedstead and had it fixed up here there is a woman who comes in to clean the room i went to her house last night and persuaded her to come here she undressed you and put you to bed i am sorry that my presence here distresses you but it is a large building and quite empty at nighttime i thought you might wake up and be frightened so i borrowed this screen from the woman and have been sitting here  what all night she gasped  certainly he answered the woman could not stop herself and this is not a residential building at all all the lower floors are let for offices and warehouses and there is no one else in the place until eight oclock  she put her hands to her head and sat quite still for a moment or two it was really hard to take everything in  arent you very sleepy she asked irrelevantly  not very he replied i dozed for an hour a little time ago since then i have been looking through some plans which interest me very much  can i get up she inquired timidly  if you feel strong enough please do he answered with manifest relief i shall move towards the door dragging the screen in front of me you will find a brush and comb and some hairpins on your clothes i could not think of anything else to get for you but if you will dress we will walk to london bridge station which is just across the way and while i order some breakfast you can go into the ladies room and do your hair properly i did my best to get hold of a lookingglass but it was quite impossible  the girls sense of humor was suddenly awake she had hard work not to scream he had evidently thought out all these details in painstaking fashion one by one  thank you she said i will get up immediately if you will do as you say  he clutched the screen from the inside and dragged it towards the door on the threshold he spoke to her once more  i shall sit upon the stairs just outside he announced  i shant be more than five minutes she assured him  she sprang out of bed and dressed quickly there was nothing beyond where the screen had been except a table covered with plans and a particularly hard cane chair which she dragged over for her own use as she dressed she began to realize how much this matteroffact unimpressionable young man had done for her during the last few hours the reflection affected her in a curious manner she became afflicted with a shyness which she had not felt when he was in the room when at last she had finished her toilette and opened the door she was almost tonguetied he was sitting on the top step with his back against the landing and his eyes were closed he opened them with a little start however as soon as he heard her approach  i am glad you have not been long he remarked i want to be at my office at nine oclock and i must go and have a bath somewhere these stairs are rather steep please walk carefully  she followed him in silence down three flights of stone steps on each landing there were names upon the doorstwo firms of hop merchants a solicitor and a commission agent the ground floor was some sort of warehouse from which came a strong smell of leather  tavernake opened the outside door with a small key and they passed into the street  london bridge station is just across the way he said the refreshment room will be open and we can get some breakfast at once  what time is it she asked  about halfpast seven  she walked by his side quite meekly and although there were many things which she was longing to say she remained absolutely without the power of speech except that he was looking a little crumpled there was nothing whatever in his appearance to indicate that he had been up all night he looked exactly as he had done on the previous day he seemed even quite unconscious that there was anything unusual in their relations as soon as they arrived at the station he pointed to the ladies waitingroom  if you will go in and arrange your hair there he said i will go and order breakfast and have a shave i will be back here in about twenty minutes you had better take this  he offered her a shilling and she accepted it without hesitation as soon as he had gone however she looked at the coin in her hand in blank wonder she had accepted it from him with perfect naturalness and without even saying thank you with a queer little laugh she pushed open the swinging doors and made her way into the waitingroom  in hardly more than a quarter of an hour she emerged to find tavernake waiting for her he had retied his tie bought a fresh collar had been shaved she too had improved her appearance  breakfast is waiting this way he announced  she followed him obediently and they sat down at a small table in the station refreshmentroom  mr tavernake she asked suddenly i must ask you something has anything like this ever happened to you before  nothing he assured her with some emphasis  you seem to take everything so much as a matter of course she protested  why not  oh i dont know she replied a little feebly only  she found relief in a sudden and perfectly natural laugh  come he said that is better i am glad that you feel like laughing  as a matter of fact she declared i feel much more like crying dont you know that you were very foolish last night you ought to have left me alone why didnt you you would have saved yourself a great deal of trouble  he nodded as though that point of view did in some degree commend itself to him  yes he admitted i suppose i should i do not even now understand why i interfered i can only remember that it didnt seem possible not to at the time i suppose one must have impulses he added with a little frown  the reflection she remarked helping herself to another roll seems to annoy you  it does he confessed i do not like to feel impelled to do anything the reason for which is not apparent i like to do just the things which seem likely to work out best for myself  how you must hate me she murmured  no i do not hate you he replied but on the other hand you have certainly been a trouble to me first of all i told a falsehood at the boardinghouse and i prefer always to tell the truth when i can then i followed you out of the house which i disliked doing very much and i seem to have spent a considerable portion of the time since in your company under somewhat extraordinary circumstances i do not understand why i have done this  i suppose it is because you are a very goodhearted person she remarked  but i am not he assured her calmly i am nothing of the sort i have very little sympathy with goodhearted people i think the world goes very much better when every one looks after himself and the people who are not competent to do so go to the wall  it sounds a trifle selfish she murmured  perhaps it is i have an idea that if i could phrase it differently it would become philosophy  perhaps she suggested smiling across the table at him you have really done all this because you like me  i am quite sure that it is not that he declared i feel an interest in you for which i cannot account but it does not seem to me to be a personal one last night he continued when i was sitting there waiting i tried to puzzle it all out i came to the conclusion that it was because you represent something which i do not understand i am very curious and it always interests me to learn i believe that must be the secret of my interest in you  you are very complimentary she told him mockingly i wonder what there is in the world which i could teach so superior a person as mr tavernake  he took her question quite seriously  i wonder what there is myself he answered and yet in a way i think i know  your imagination should come to the rescue she remarked  i have no imagination he declared gloomily  they were silent for several minutes she was still studying him  i wonder you dont ask me any questions about myself she said abruptly  there is only one thing he answered concerning which i am in the least curious last night in the chemists shop  dont she begged him with suddenly whitening face dont speak of that  very well he replied indifferently i thought that you were rather inviting my questions you need not be afraid of any more i really am not curious about personal matters i find that my own life absorbs all my interests  they had finished breakfast and he paid the bill she began to put on her gloves  whatever happens to me she said i shall never forget that you have been very kind  she hesitated for a moment and then she seemed to realize more completely how really kind he had been there had been a certain crude delicacy about his actions which she had underappreciated she leaned towards him there was nothing left this morning of that disfiguring sullenness her mouth was soft her eyes were bright almost appealing if tavernake had been a judge of womans looks he must certainly have found her attractive  i am very very grateful to you she continued holding out her hand i shall always remember how kind you were goodbye  you are not going he asked  she laughed  why you didnt imagine that you had taken the care of me upon your shoulders for the rest of your life she demanded  no i didnt imagine that he answered at the same time what plans have you made where are you going  oh i shall think of something she declared indifferently  he caught the gleam in her eyes the sudden hopelessness which fell like a cloud upon her face he spoke promptly and with decision  as a matter of fact he remarked you do not know yourself you are just going to drift out of this place and very likely find your way to a seat on the embankment again  her lips quivered she had tried to be brave but it was hard  not necessarily she replied something may turn up  he leaned a little across the table towards her  listen he said deliberately i will make a proposition to you it has come to me during the last few minutes i am tired of the boardinghouse and i wish to leave it the work which i do at night is becoming more and more important i should like to take two rooms somewhere if i take a third would you care to call yourself what i called you to the charwoman last nightmy sister i should expect you to look after the meals and my clothes and help me in certain other ways i cannot give you much of a salary he continued but you would have an opportunity during the daytime of looking out for some work if that is what you want and you would at least have a roof and plenty to eat and drink  she looked at him in blank amazement it was obvious that his proposition was entirely honest  but mr tavernake she protested you forget that i am not really your sister  does that matter he asked without flinching i think you understand the sort of person i am you would have nothing to fear from any admiration on my partor anything of that sort he added with some show of clumsiness those things do not come in my life i am ambitious to get on to succeed and become wealthy other things i do not even think about  she was speechless after a short pause he went on  i am proposing this arrangement as much for my own sake as for yours i am very well read and i know most of what there is to be known in my profession but there are other things concerning which i am ignorant some of these things i believe you could teach me  still speechless she sat and looked at him for several moments outside the station now was filled with a hurrying throng on their way to the days work engines were shrieking bells ringing the press of footsteps was unceasing in the dark illventilated room itself there was the rattle of crockery the yawning of discontentedlooking young women behind the bar young women with their hair still in curlpapers as yet unprepared for their weak little assaults upon the goodnature or susceptibility of their customers a queer corner of life it seemed she looked at her companion and realized how fragmentary was her knowledge of him there was nothing to be gathered from his face he seemed to have no expression he was simply waiting for her reply with his thoughts already half engrossed upon the business of the day  really she began i  he came back from his momentary wandering and looked at her she suddenly altered the manner of her speech it was a strange proposition perhaps but this was one of the strangest of men  i am quite willing to try it she decided will you tell me where i can meet you later on  i have an hour and a half for luncheon at one oclock he said meet me exactly at the southeast corner of trafalgar square would you like a little money he added rising  i have plenty thank you she answered  he laid halfacrown upon the table and made an entry in a small memorandum book which he drew from his pocket  you had better keep this he said in case you want it i am going to leave you alone here you can find your way anywhere i am sure and i am in a hurry at one oclock remember i hope you will still be feeling better  he put on his hat and went away without a backward glance beatrice sat in her chair and watched him out of sight     chapter v introducing mrs wenham gardner   a very distinguished client was engaging the attention of mr dowling senior of messrs dowling spence  company auctioneers and estate agents whose offices were situated in waterloo place pall mall mr dowling was a fussy little man of between fifty and sixty years who spent most of his time playing golf and who although he studiously contrived to ignore the fact had long since lost touch with the details of his business consequently in the absence of mr dowling junior who had developed a marked partiality for a certain bar in the locality tavernake was hastily summoned to the rescue from another part of the building by a small boy violently out of breath  never see the governor in such a fuss the latter declared confidentially shes asking no end of questions and he dont know a thing  who is the lady tavernake asked on the way downstairs  didnt hear her name the boy replied shes all right though i can tell youa regular slapup beauty such a motorcar too flowers and tables and all sorts of things inside by jove wont the governor tear his hair if she goes before you get there  tavernake quickened his steps and in a few moments knocked at the door of the private office and entered  his chief welcomed him with a gesture of relief the distinguished client of the firm whose attention he was endeavoring to engage had glanced toward the newcomer at his first appearance with an air of somewhat bored unconcern her eyes however did not immediately leave his face on the contrary from the moment of his entrance she watched him steadfastly tavernake stolid unruffled at that time without comprehension approached the desk  this isermr tavernake our manager mr dowling announced obsequiously in the absence of my son he is in charge of the letting department i have no doubt that he will be able to suggest something suitable tavernake he continued this ladyhe glanced at a card in front of himmrs wenham gardner of new york is looking for a town house and has been kind enough to favor us with an inquiry  tavernake made no immediate reply mr dowling was shortsighted and in any case it would never have occurred to him to associate nervousness or any form of emotion with his responsible manager the beautiful lady leaned back in her chair her lips were parted in a slight but very curious smile her fingers supported her cheek her eyelids were contracted as she looked into his face tavernake felt that their recognition was mutual once more he was back again in the tragic atmosphere of that chemists shop with beatrice half fainting in his arms the beautiful lady turned to stone it was an odd tableau that so vividly imprinted upon his memory that it was there before him at this very moment there was mystery in this womans eyes mystery and something else  i dont seem to have come across anything down here whicherparticularly attracts mrsmrs wenham gardner mr dowling went on taking up a little sheaf of papers from the desk i thought perhaps that the bryanston square house might have suited but it seems that it is too small far too small mrs gardner is used to entertaining and has explained to me that she has a great many friends always coming and going from the other side of the water she requires apparently twelve bedrooms besides servants quarters  your list is scarcely up to date sir tavernake reminded him if the rent is of no particular object there is grantham house  mr dowlings face was suddenly illuminated  grantham house he exclaimed precisely now i declare that it had absolutely slipped my memory for the momentonly for the moment mindthat we have just had placed upon our books one of the most desirable mansions in the west end of london a most valued client too one whom we are most anxious to oblige dear dear me it is very fortunatevery fortunate indeed that i happened to think of it especially as it seems that no one had had the sense to place it upon my list tavernake get the plans at once and show them toerto mrs gardner  tavernake crossed the room in silence opened a drawer and returned with a stiff roll of papers which he spread carefully out in front of this unexpected client she spoke then for the first time since he had entered the room her voice was low and marvelously sweet there was very little of the american accent about it but something in the intonation especially toward the end of her sentences was just a trifle unenglish  where is this grantham house she inquired  within a stones throw of grosvenor square tavernake answered briskly it is really one of the most central spots in the west end if you will allow me  for the next few minutes he was very fluent indeed with pencil in hand he explained the plans dwelt on the advantages of the location and from the very reserve of his praise created an impression that the house he was describing was the one absolutely perfect domicile in the whole of london  can i look over the place she asked when he had finished  by all means mr dowling declared by all means i was on the point of suggesting it it will be by far the most satisfactory proceeding you will not be disappointed my dear madam i can assure you  i should like to do so if i may without delay she said  there is no opportunity like the present mr dowling replied if you will permit me he added rising it will give me the greatest pleasure to escort you personally my engagements for the rest of the day happen to be unimportant tavernake let me have the keys of the rooms that are locked up the caretaker of course is there in possession  the beautiful visitor rose to her feet and even that slight movement was accomplished with a grace unlike anything which tavernake had ever seen before  i could not think of troubling you so far mr dowling she protested it is not in the least necessary for you to come yourself your manager can perhaps spare me a few minutes he seems to be so thoroughly posted in all the details she added apologetically as she noticed the cloud on mr dowlings brow  just as you like of course he declared mr tavernake can go by all means now i come to think of it it certainly would be inconvenient for me to be away from the office for more than a few minutes mr tavernake has all the details at his fingers ends and i only hope mrs gardner that he will be able to persuade you to take the house our client he added with a bow would i am sure be delighted to hear that we had secured for him so distinguished a tenant  she smiled at him a delightful mixture of graciousness and condescension  you are very good she answered the house sounds rather large for me but it depends so much upon circumstances if you are ready mr  tavernake he told her  mr tavernake she continued my car is waiting outside and we might go on at once  he bowed and held open the door for her an office which he performed a little awkwardly mr dowling himself escorted her out on to the pavement tavernake stopped behind to get his hat and passing out a moment afterwards would have seated himself in front beside the chauffeur but that she held the door of the car open and beckoned to him  will you come inside please she insisted there are one or two questions which i might ask you as we go along please direct the chauffeur  he obeyed without a word the car glided off as they swung round the first corner she leaned forward from among the cushions of her seat and looked at him then tavernake was conscious of new things as though by inspiration he knew that her visit to the office of messrs dowling spence  company had been no chance one  she remembered him remembered him as the companion of beatrice during that strange brief meeting it was an incomprehensible world this into which he had wandered the womans face had lost her languid gracious expression there was something there almost akin to tragedy her fingers fell upon his arm and her touch was no light one she was gripping him almost fiercely  mr tavernake she said i have a memory for faces which seldom fails me i have seen you before quite lately you remember where of course tell me the truth quickly please  the words seemed to leap from her lips beautiful and young though she undoubtedly was her intense seriousness had suddenly aged her face tavernake was bewildered he too was conscious of a curious emotional disturbance  the truth what truth do you mean he demanded  it was you whom i saw with beatrice  you saw me one night about three weeks ago he admitted slowly i was in a chemists shop in the strand you were signing his book for a sleeping draught i think  she shivered all over  yes yes she cried of course i remember all about it the young lady who was with youwhat was she doing there where is she now  the young lady was my sister tavernake answered stiffly  mrs wenham gardner looked for a moment as though she would have struck him  you need not lie to me she exclaimed it is not worth while tell me where you met her why you were with her at all in that intimate fashion and where she is now  tavernake realized at once that so far as this woman was concerned the fable of his relationship with beatrice was hopeless she knew  madam he replied i made the acquaintance of the young lady with whom i was that evening at the boardinghouse where we both lived  what were you doing in the chemists shop she demanded  the young lady had been ill he proceeded deliberately wondering how much to tell she had been taken very ill indeed she was just recovering when you entered  where is she now the woman asked eagerly is she still at that boardinghouse of which you spoke  no he answered  her fingers gripped his arm once more  why do you answer me always in monosyllables dont you understand that you must tell me everything that you know about her you must tell me where i can find her at once  tavernake remained silent the womans voice had still that note of wonderful sweetness but she had altogether lost her air of complete and aristocratic indifference she was a very altered person now from the distinguished client who had first enlisted his services for some reason or other he knew that she was suffering from a terrible anxiety  i am not sure he said at last whether i can do as you ask  what do you mean she exclaimed sharply  the young lady he continued seemed on the occasion to which you have referred to be particularly anxious to avoid recognition she hurried out of the place without speaking to you and she has avoided the subject ever since i do not know what her motives may have been but i think that i should like to ask her first before i tell you where she is to be found  mrs wenham gardner leaned towards him it was certainly the first time that a woman in her apparent rank of life had looked upon tavernake in such a manner her forehead was a little wrinkled her lips were parted her eyes were pathetically delightfully eloquent  mr tavernake you must notyou must not refuse me she pleaded if you only knew the importance of it you would not hesitate for a moment this is no idle curiosity on my part i have reasons very serious reasons indeed for wishing to discover that poor girls whereabouts at once there is a possible danger of which she must be warned no one can do it except myself  are you her friend or her enemy tavernake asked  why do you ask such a question she demanded  i am only going by her expression when she saw you come into the chemists shop tavernake persisted doggedly  it is a cruel suggestion that the woman cried i wish to be her friend i am her friend if i could only tell you everything you would understand at once what a terrible situation what a hideous quandary i am in  once more tavernake paused for a few moments he was never a quick thinker and the situation was certainly an embarrassing one for him  madam he replied at length i beg that you will tell me nothing the young lady of whom you have spoken permits me to call myself her friend and what she has not told me herself i do not wish to learn from others i will tell her of this meeting with you and if it is her desire i will bring you her address myself within a few hours i cannot do more than that  her face was suddenly cold and hard  you mean that you will not she exclaimed angrily you are obstinate i do not know how you dare to refuse what i ask  the car had come to a standstill he stepped out on to the pavement  this is grantham house madam he announced will you descend  he heard her draw a quick breath between her teeth and he caught a gleam in her eyes which made him feel vaguely uneasy she was very angry indeed  i do not think that it is necessary for me to do so she said frigidly i do not like the look of the house at all i do not believe that it will suit me  at least now that you are here he protested you will if you please go over it i should like you to see the ballroom the decorations are supposed to be quite exceptional  she hesitated for a moment and then with a slight shrug of the shoulders she yielded there was a note in his tone not exactly insistent and yet dominant a note which she obeyed although secretly she wondered at herself for doing so they passed inside the house and she followed him from room to room leaving him to do all the talking she seemed very little interested but every now and then she asked a languid question  i do not think that it is in the least likely to suit me she decided at last it is all very magnificent of course but i consider that the rent is exorbitant  tavernake regarded her thoughtfully  i believe he said that our client might be disposed to consider some reduction in the event of your seriously entertaining taking the house if you like i will see him on the subject i feel sure that the amount i have mentioned could be reduced if the other conditions were satisfactory  there would be no harm in your doing so she assented how soon can you come and let me know  i might be able to ring you up this evening certainly tomorrow morning he answered  she shook her head  i will not speak upon the telephone she declared i only allow it in my rooms under protest you must come and tell me what your client says when can you see him  it is doubtful whether i shall be able to find him this evening he replied it would probably be tomorrow morning  you might go and try at once she suggested  he was a little surprised  you are really interested in the matter then he inquired  yes yes she told him of course i am interested i want you to come and see me directly you have heard it is important supposing you are able to find your client tonight shall you have seen the young lady before then  i am afraid not he answered  you must try she begged laying her fingers upon his shoulder mr tavernake do please try you cant realize what all this anxiety means to me i am not at all well and i am seriously worried aboutabout that young lady i tell you that i must have an interview with her it is not for my sake so much as hers she must be warned  warned tavernake repeated i really dont understand  of course you dont she exclaimed impatiently why should you understand i dont want to offend you mr tavernake she went on hurriedly i would like to treat you quite frankly it really isnt your place to make difficulties like this what is this young lady to you that you should presume to consider yourself her guardian  she is a boardinghouse acquaintance tavernake confessed nothing more  then why did you tell me only a moment ago that she was your sister mrs gardner demanded  tavernake threw open the door before which they had been standing  this he said is the famous dancing gallery lord clumber is quite willing to allow the pictures to remain and i may tell you that they are insured for over sixty thousand pounds there is no finer dancing room than this in all london  her eyes swept around it carelessly  i have no doubt she admitted coldly that it is very beautiful i prefer to continue our discussion  the diningroom he went on is almost as large lord clumber tells us that he has frequently entertained eighty guests for dinner the system of ventilation in this room is as you see entirely modern  she took him by the arm and led him to a seat at the further end of the apartment  mr tavernake she said making an obvious attempt to control her temper you seem like a very sensible young man if you will allow me to say so and i want to convince you that it is your duty to answer my questions in the first placedont be offended will youbut i cannot possibly see what interest you and that young lady can have in one another you belong to put it baldly to altogether different social stations and it is not easy to imagine what you could have in common  she paused but tavernake had nothing to say his gift of silence amounted sometimes almost to genius she leaned so close to him while she waited in vain for his reply that the ermine about her neck brushed his cheek the perfume of her clothes and hair the pleading of her deep violetblue eyes all helped to keep him tonguetied nothing of this sort had ever happened to him before he did not in the least understand what it could possibly mean  i am speaking to you now mr tavernake she continued earnestly for your own good when you tell the young lady as you have promised to this evening that you have seen me and that i am very very anxious to find out where she is she will very likely go down on her knees and beg you to give me no information whatever about her she will do her best to make you promise to keep us apart and yet that is all because she does not understand believe me it is better that you should tell me the truth you cannot know her very well mr tavernake but she is not very wise that young lady she is very obstinate and she has some strange ideas it is not well for her that she should be left in the world alone you must see that for yourself mr tavernake  she seems a very sensible young lady he declared slowly i should have thought that she would have been old enough to know for herself what she wanted and what was best for her  the woman at his side wrung her hands with a little gesture of despair  oh why cant i make you understand she exclaimed the emotion once more quivering in her tone how can ihow can i possibly make you believe me listen something has happened of which she does not knowsomething terrible it is absolutely necessary in her own interests as well as mine that i see her and that very shortly  i shall tell her exactly what you say tavernake answered apparently unmoved perhaps it would be as well now if we went on to view the sleeping apartments  never mind about the sleeping apartments she cried quickly you must do more than tell her you cant believe that i want to bring harm upon any one do i look like it have i the appearance of a person of evil disposition you can be that young ladys best friend mr tavernake if you will take me to her now this minute believe me if you do that you will never regret it as long as you live  tavernake studied the pattern of the parquet floor for several moments it was a difficult problem this putting his own extraordinary sensations into the background he was face to face with something which he did not comprehend and he disliked the position intensely after all delay seemed safest  madam he protested a few hours more or less can make but little difference  that is for me to judge she exclaimed you say that because you do not understand a few hours may make all the difference in the world  he shook his head  i will tell you exactly what is in my mind he said deliberately the young lady was terrified when she saw you that night accidentally in the chemists shop she almost dragged me away and although she was almost fainting when we reached the taxicab her greatest and chief anxiety was that we should get away before you could follow us i cannot forget this until i have received her permission therefore to disclose her whereabouts we will if you please speak of something else  he rose to his feet and glancing around was just in time to see the change in the face of his companion that eloquently pleading smile had died away from her lips her teeth were clenched she looked like a woman struggling hard to control some overwhelming passion without the smile her lips seemed hard even cruel there were evil things shining out of her eyes tavernake felt chilled almost afraid  we will see the rest of the house she declared coldly  they went on from room to room tavernake recovering himself rapidly master of his subject was fluent and practical the woman listened with only a terse remark here and there once more they stood in the hall  is there anything else you would like to see he asked  nothing she replied but there is one thing more i have to say  he waited in stolid silence  only a week ago she went on looking him in the face i told a man who is what you call i think an inquiry agent that i would give a hundred pounds if he could discover that young woman for me within twentyfour hours  tavernake started and the smile came back to the lips of mrs wenham gardner after all perhaps she had found the way  a hundred pounds is a great deal of money he said thoughtfully  she shrugged her shoulders  not so very much she replied about a fortnights rent of this house mr tavernake  is the offer still open he asked  she looked into his eyes and her face had once more the beautiful ingenuousness of a child  mr tavernake she said the offer is still open get into the car with me and drive back to my rooms at the milan court and i will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds at once it will be very easily earned and you may just as well take it for now i know where you are employed i could have you followed day by day until i discover for myself what you are so foolishly concealing be reasonable mr tavernake  tavernake stood quite still his arms were folded he was looking out of the hall window at the smoky vista of roofs and chimneys from the soles of his readymade boots to his illbrushed hair he was a commonplace young man a hundred pounds was to him a vast sum of money it represented a years strenuous savings perhaps more the woman who watched him imagined that he was hesitating tavernake however had no such thought in his mind he stood there instead wondering what strange thing had come to him that the mention of a hundred pounds delightful sum though it was never tempted him for a single second what this woman had said might be true she would probably be able to discover the address easily enough without his help yet no such reflection seemed to make the least difference from the days of his earliest boyhood from the time when he had flung himself into the struggle money had always meant much to him money not for its own sake but as the key to those things which he coveted in life yet at that moment something stronger seemed to have asserted itself  you will come she whispered passing her arm through his we will be there in less than five minutes and i will write you the cheque before you tell me anything  he moved towards the door indeed but he drew a little away from her  madam he said i am sorry to seem so obstinate but i thought i had made you understand some time ago i do not feel at liberty to tell you anything without that young ladys permission  you refuse she cried incredulously you refuse a hundred pounds  he opened the door of the car he seemed scarcely to have heard her  at about eleven oclock tomorrow morning he announced i shall have the pleasure of calling upon you i trust that you will have decided to take the house     chapter vi questions and answers   tavernake sat a few hours later at his evening meal in the tiny sittingroom of an apartment house in chelsea he wore a black tie and although he had not yet aspired to a dinner coat the details of his person and toilet showed signs of a new attention opposite to him was beatrice  tell me she asked as soon as the small maidservant who brought in their first dish had disappeared what have you been doing all day have you been letting houses or surveying land or bookkeeping or have you been out to marston rise  it was her customary question this she really took an interest in his work  i have been attending a rich american client he announced a compatriot of your own i went with her to grantham house in her own motorcar i believe she thinks of taking it  american beatrice remarked what was her name  tavernake looked up from his plate across the little table across the bowl of simple flowers which was its sole decoration  she called herself mrs wenham garner  away like a flash went the newfound peace in the girls face she caught at her breath her fingers gripped the table in front of her once more she was as he had known her firstpale with great terrified eyes shining out of a haggard face  she has been to you beatrice gasped for a house you are sure  i am quite sure tavernake declared calmly  you recognized her  he assented gravely  it was the woman who stood in the chemists shop that night signing her name in a book he said  he did not apologize in any way for the shock he had given her he had done it deliberately from that very first morning when they had breakfasted together at london bridge he had felt that he deserved her confidence and in a sense it was a grievance with him that she had withheld it  did she recognize you  yes he admitted i was sent for into the office and found her there with the chief i felt sure that she recognized me from the first and when she agreed to look at grantham house she insisted upon it that i should accompany her while we were in the motorcar she asked me about you she wished for your address  did you give it to her the girl cried breathlessly  no i said that i must consult you first  she drew a little sigh of relief nevertheless she was looking white and shaken  did she say what she wanted me for  she was very mysterious tavernake answered she spoke of some danger of which you knew nothing before i came away she offered me a hundred pounds to let her know where you were  beatrice laughed softly  that is just like elizabeth she declared you must have made her very angry when she wants anything she wants it very badly indeed and she will never believe that every person has not his price money means everything to her if she had it she would buy buy buy all the time  on the face of it tavernake remarked soberly her offer seemed rather an absurd one if she is in earnest if she is really so anxious to discover your whereabouts she will certainly be able to do so without my help  i am not so sure beatrice replied london is a great hiding place  a private detective he began  beatrice shook her head  i do not think she said that elizabeth will care to employ a private detective tell me have you to see her upon this business again  i am going to her flat at the milan court tomorrow morning at eleven oclock  beatrice leaned back in her chair presently she recommenced her dinner she had the air of one to whom a respite has been granted tavernake in a way began to resent this continued silence of hers he had certainly hoped that she would at least have gone so far as to explain her anxiety to keep her whereabouts secret  you must remember he went on after a short pause that i am in a somewhat peculiar position with regard to you beatrice i know so little that i do not even know how to answer in your interests such questions as mrs wenham gardner asked me i am not complaining but is this state of absolute ignorance necessary  a new thought seemed to come to beatrice she looked at her companion curiously  tell me she asked what did you think of mrs wenham gardner  tavernake answered deliberately and after a moments reflection  i thought her he said one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen in my life that is not saying very much perhaps but to me it meant a good deal she was exceedingly gracious and her interest in you seemed quite real and even affectionate i do not understand why you should wish to hide from such a woman  you found her attractive beatrice persisted  i found her very attractive indeed tavernake admitted without hesitation she had an air with her she was quite different from all the women i have ever met at the boardinghouse or anywhere else she has a face which reminded me somehow of the madonnas you took me to see in the national gallery the other day  beatrice shivered slightly for some reason his remark seemed to have distressed her  i am very very sorry she declared that elizabeth ever came to your office i want you to promise me leonard that you will be careful whenever you are with her  tavernake laughed  careful he repeated she isnt likely to be even civil to me tomorrow when i tell her that i have seen you and i refuse to give her your address careful indeed what has a poor clerk in a houseagents office to fear from such a personage  the servant had reappeared with their second and last course for a few moments they spoke of casual subjects afterwards however tavernake asked a question  by the way he said we are hoping to let grantham house to mrs wenham gardner i suppose she must be very wealthy  beatrice looked at him curiously  why do you come to me for information she demanded i suppose that she brought you references  we havent quite got to that stage yet he answered somehow or other from her manner of talking and general appearance i do not think that either mr dowling or i doubted her financial position  i should never have thought you so credulous a person remarked beatrice with a smile  tavernake was genuinely disturbed his business instincts were aroused  do you really mean that this mrs wenham gardner is not a person of substance he inquired  beatrice shrugged her shoulders  she is the wife of a man who had the reputation of being very wealthy she replied she has no money of her own i am sure  she still lives with her husband i suppose tavernake asked  beatrice closed her eyes  i know very little about her she declared last time i heard he had disappeared gone away or something of the sort  and she has no money tavernake persisted except what she gets from him no settlement even or anything of that sort  nothing at all beatrice answered  this is very bad news tavernake remarked thinking gloomily of his wasted day it will be a great disappointment to mr dowling why her motorcar was magnificent and she talked as though money were no object at all i suppose you are quite sure of what you are saying  beatrice shrugged her shoulders  i ought to know she answered grimly for she is my sister  tavernake remained quite motionless for a minute without speech it was his way of showing surprise when he was sure that he had grasped the import of her words he spoke again  your sister he repeated there is a likeness of course you are dark and she is fair but there is a likeness that would account he continued for her anxiety to find you  it also accounts beatrice replied with a little break of the lips for my anxiety that she should not find me leonard she added touching his hand for a moment with hers i wish that i could tell you everything but there are things behind things so terrible that even to you my dear brother i could not speak of them  tavernake rose to his feet and lit a cigarettea new habit with him while beatrice busied herself with a small coffeemaking machine he sat in an easychair and smoked slowly he was still wearing his readymade clothes but his collar was of the fashionable shape his tie well chosen and neatly adjusted he seemed somehow to have developed  beatrice he asked what am i to tell your sister tomorrow  she shivered as she set his coffeecup down by his side  tell her if you will that i am well and not in want she answered tell her too that i refuse to send my address tell her that the one aim of my life is to keep the knowledge of my whereabouts a secret from her  tavernake relapsed into silence he was thinking mysteries had no attraction for himhe loathed them against this one especially he felt a distinct grudge nevertheless some instinct forbade his questioning the girl  apart from more personal matters then he asked after some time you would not advise me to enter into any business negotiations with this lady  you must not think of it beatrice replied firmly so far as money is concerned elizabeth has no conscience whatever the things she wants in life she will have somehow but it is all the time at other peoples expense some day she will have to pay for it  tavernake sighed  it is very unfortunate he declared the commission on the letting of grantham house would have been worth having  after all it is only your firms loss she reminded him  it does not appeal to me like that he continued so long as i am manager for dowling  spence i feel these things personally however that does not matter i am afraid it is a disagreeable subject for you and we will not talk about it any longer  she lit a cigarette with a little gesture of relief she came once more to his side  leonard she said i know that i am treating you badly in telling you nothing but it is simply because i do not want to descend to half truths i should like to tell you all or nothing at present i cannot tell you all  very well he replied i am quite content to leave it with you to do as you think best  leonard she continued of course you think me unreasonable i cant help it there are things between my sister and myself the knowledge of which is a constant nightmare to me during the last few months of my life it has grown to be a perfect terror it sent me into hiding at blenheim house it reconciled me even to the decision i came to that night on the embankment i had decided that sooner than go back sooner than ask help from her or any one connected with her i would do what i tried to do the time when you saved my life  tavernake looked at her wonderingly she was indeed under the spell of some deep emotion her memory seemed to have carried her back into another world somewhere far away from this dingy little sittingroom which they two were sharing together back into a world where life and death were matters of small moment where the great passions were unchained and men and women moved among the naked things of life almost he felt the thrill of it it was something new to him the touch of a magic finger upon his eyelids then the moment passed and he was himself again matteroffact prosaic  let us dismiss the subject finally he said i must see your sister on business tomorrow but it shall be for the last time  i think she murmured that you will be wise  he crossed the room and returned with a newspaper  i saw your music in the hall as i came in he remarked are you singing tonight  the question was entirely in his ordinary tone it brought her back to the world of everyday things as nothing else could have done  yes isnt it luck she told him three in one week i only heard an hour ago  a city dinner he inquired  something of the sort she replied i am to be at the whitehall rooms at ten oclock if you are tired leonard please let me go alone i really do not mind i can get a bus to the door there and back again  i am not tired he declared to tell you the truth i scarcely know what it is to be tired i shall go with you of course  she looked at him with a momentary admiration of his powerful frame his strong forceful face  it seems too bad she remarked after a long days work to drag you out again  he smiled  i really like to come he assured her besides he added after a moments pause i like to hear you sing  i wonder if you mean that she asked looking at him curiously i have watched you once or twice when i have been singing to you do you really care for it  certainly i do how can you doubt it i do not he continued slowly understand music or anything of that sort of course any more than i do the pictures you take me to see and some of the books you talk about there are lots of things i cant get the hang of entirely but they all leave a sort of pleasure behind one feels it even if one only half appreciates  she came over to his chair  i am glad she said a little wistfully that there is one thing i do which you like  he looked at her reprovingly  my dear beatrice he said i often wish i could make you understand how extraordinarily helpful and useful to me you have been  tell me in what way she begged  you have given me he assured her an insight into many things in life which i had found most perplexing you see you have traveled and i havent you have mixed with all classes of people and i have gone steadily on in one groove you have told me many things which i shall find very useful indeed later on  dear me she laughed you are making me quite conceited  anyhow he replied i dont want you to look upon me beatrice in any way as a benefactor i am much more comfortable here than at the boardinghouse and it is costing no more money especially since you began to get those singing engagements by the way hadnt you better go and get ready  she smothered a sigh as she turned away and went slowly upstairs to all appearance no person who ever breathed was more ordinary than this strongfeatured selfcentered young man who had put out his arm and snatched her from the maelstrom yet it seemed to her that there was something almost unnatural about his unapproachability she was convinced that he was entirely honest not only with regard to his actual relations toward her but with regard to all his purposes her sex did not even seem to exist for him the fact that she was goodlooking and with her renewed health daily becoming more so seemed to be of no account to him whatever he showed interest in her appearance sometimes but it was interest of an entirely impersonal sort he simply expressed himself as satisfied or dissatisfied as a matter of taste it came to her at that moment that she had never seen him really relax only when he sat opposite to that great map which hung now in the further room and wandered about from section to section with a pencil in one hand and a piece of rubber in another did he show anything which in any way approached enthusiasm and even then it was always the unmistakable enthusiasm born of dead things suddenly she laughed at herself in the little mirror laughed softly but heartily this was the guardian whom fate had sent for her if elizabeth had only understood     chapter vii mr pritchard of new york   later in the evening beatrice and tavernake traveled together in a motor omnibus from their rooms at chelsea to northumberland avenue tavernake was getting quite used to the programme by now they sat in a dimlylit waitingroom until the time came for beatrice to sing every now and then an excitable little person who was the secretary to some institution or other would run in and offer them refreshments and tell them in what order they were to appear tonight there was no departure from the ordinary course of things except that there was slightly more stir the dinner was a larger one than usual it came to beatrices turn very soon after their arrival and tavernake squeezing his way a few steps into the diningroom stood with the waiters against the wall he looked with curious eyes upon a scene with which he had no manner of sympathy  a hundred or so of men had dined together in the cause of some charity the odor of their dinner mingled with the more aromatic perfume of the tobacco smoke which was already ascending in little blue clouds from the various tables hung about the overheated room seeming indeed the fitting atmosphere for the long rows of guests the majority of them were in a state of expansiveness their faces were redder than when they had sat down a certain stiffness had departed from their shirtfronts and their manners their faces were flushed their eyes watery there were a few exceptionspalerfaced men who sat there with the air of endeavoring to bring themselves into accord with surroundings in which they had no real concern two of these looked up with interest at the first note of beatrices song the one was sitting within a few places of the chairman and he was too far away for his little start to be noticed by either tavernake or beatrice the nearer one however tavernake happened to be watching and he saw the change in his expression the man was in his way ugly his face was certainly not a good one although he did not appear to share the immediate weaknesses of his neighbors to every note of the song he listened intently when it was over he rose and came toward tavernake  i beg your pardon he said but did i not see you come in with the young lady who has just been singing  you may have tavernake answered i certainly did come with her  may i ask if you are related to her  tavernake had got over his hesitation in replying to such questions by now he answered promptly  i am her brother he declared  the man produced a card  please introduce me to her he begged laconically  why should i tavernake asked i have no reason to suppose that she desires to know you  the man stared at him for a moment and then laughed  well he said you had better show your sister my card she is i presume a professional as she is singing here my desire to make her acquaintance is purely actuated by business motives  tavernake moved away toward the waitingroom  the man who according to his card was mr sidney grier would have followed him in but tavernake stopped him  if you will wait here he suggested i will see whether my sister desires to meet you  once more mr sidney grier looked surprised but after a second glance at tavernake he accepted his suggestion and remained outside tavernake took the card to beatrice  beatrice he announced there is a man outside who has heard you sing and who wants to be introduced  she took the card and her eyes opened wide  do you know who he is tavernake asked  of course she answered he is a great producer of musical comedies let me think  she stood with the card in her hand some one else was singing nowan ordinary modern ballad of love and roses rapture and despair they heard the rising and falling of the womans voice the clatter of the dinner had ceased beatrice stood still thinking her fingers clinching the card of mr sidney grier  you must bring him in she said to tavernake finally  tavernake went outside  my sister will see you he remarked with the air of one who brings good news  mr sidney grier grunted he was not used to being kept waiting even for a second tavernake ushered him into the retiring room and the other two musicians who were there stared at him as at a god  this is the gentleman whose card you have beatrice tavernake announced mr sidney griermiss tavernake  the man smiled  your brother seems to be suspicious of me he declared i found it quite difficult to persuade him that you might find it interesting to talk to me for a few minutes  he does not quite understand beatrice answered he has not much experience of musical affairs or the stage and your name would not have any significance for him  tavernake went outside and listened idly to the song which was proceeding it was a class of music which secretly he preferred to the stranger and more haunting notes of beatrices melodies apparently the audience was of his opinion for they received it with a vociferous encore to which the young lady generously replied with a musichall song about a french lady from over the water towards the close of the applause which marked the conclusion of this effort tavernake felt himself touched lightly upon the arm he turned round by his side was standing the other dinner guest who had shown some interest in beatrice he was a man apparently of about forty years of age tall and broadshouldered with black moustache and dark piercing eyes unlike most of the guests he wore a short dinnercoat and black tie from which and his slight accent tavernake concluded that he was probably an american  say youll forgive my speaking to you he said touching tavernake on the arm my name is pritchard i saw you come in with the young lady who was singing a few minutes ago and if you wont consider it a liberty ill be very glad indeed if youll answer me one question  tavernake stiffened insensibly  it depends upon the question he replied shortly  well its about the young lady and thats a fact mr pritchard admitted i see that her name upon the programme is given as miss tavernake i was seated at the other end of the room but she seemed to me remarkably like a young lady from the other side of the atlantic whom i am very anxious to meet  perhaps you will kindly put your question in plain words tavernake said  why thats easy mr pritchard declared is miss tavernake really her name or an assumed one i expect its the same over here as in my countrya singer very often sings under another name than her own you know he added noting tavernakes gathering frown  the young lady in question is my sister and i do not care to discuss her with strangers tavernake announced  mr pritchard nodded pleasantly  why of course that ends the matter he remarked sorry to have troubled you anyway  he strolled off back to his seat and tavernake returned thoughtfully to the dressingroom he found beatrice alone and waiting for him  youve got rid of that fellow then he inquired  beatrice assented  yes he didnt stay very long she replied  who was he tavernake asked curiously  from a musical comedy point of view she said he was the most important person in london he is the emperor of stageland he can make the fortune of any girl in london who is reasonably goodlooking and who can sing and dance ever so little  what did he want with you tavernake demanded suspiciously  he asked me whether i would like to go upon the stage what do you think about it leonard  tavernake for some reason or other was displeased  would you earn much more money than by singing at these dinners he asked  very very much more she assured him  and you would like the life  she laughed softly  why not it isnt so bad i was on the stage in new york for some time under much worse conditions  he remained silent for a few minutes they had made their way into the street now and were waiting for an omnibus  what did you tell him he asked abruptly  she was looking down toward the embankment her eyes filled once more with the things which he could not understand  i have told him nothing yet she murmured  you would like to accept  she nodded  i am not sure she replied if onlyi dared     chapter viii womans wiles   at eleven oclock the next morning tavernake presented himself at the milan court and inquired for mrs wenham gardner he was sent at once to her apartments in charge of a page she was lying upon a sofa piled up with cushions wrapped in a wonderful blue garment which seemed somehow to deepen the color of her eyes by her side was a small table on which was some chocolate a bowl of roses and a roll of newspapers she held out her hand toward tavernake but did not rise there was something almost spiritual about her pallor the delicate outline of her figure so imperfectly concealed by the thin silk dressinggown the faint tired smile with which she welcomed him  you will forgive my receiving you like this mr tavernake she begged today i have a headache i have been anxious for your coming you must sit by my side please and tell me at once whether you have seen beatrice  tavernake did exactly as he was bidden the chair toward which she had pointed was quite close to the sofa but there was no other unoccupied in the room she raised herself a little on the couch and turned towards him her eyes were fixed anxiously upon his her forehead slightly wrinkled her voice tremulous with eagerness  you have seen her  i have he admitted looking steadily into the lining of his hat  she has been cruel elizabeth declared i can tell it from your face you have bad news for me  i do not know tavernake replied whether she has been cruel or not she refuses to allow me to tell you her address she begged me indeed to keep away from you altogether  why did she tell you why  she says that you are her sister that you have no money of your own and that your husband has left you tavernake answered deliberately  is that all  no it is not all he continued as to the rest she told me nothing definite it is quite clear however that she is very anxious to keep away from you  but her reason elizabeth persisted did she give you no reason  tavernake looked her in the face  she gave me no reason he said  do you believe that she is justified in treating me like this elizabeth asked playing nervously with a pendant which hung from her smooth bare neck  of course i do he replied i am quite sure that she would not feel as she does unless you had been guilty of something very terrible indeed  the woman on the couch winced as though some one had struck her a more susceptible man than tavernake must have felt a little remorseful at the tears which dimmed for a moment her beautiful eyes tavernake however although he felt a moments uneasiness although he felt himself assailed all the time by a curious new emotion which he utterly failed to understand was nevertheless still immune the things which were to happen to him had not yet arrived  of course he continued i was very much disappointed to hear this because i had hoped that we might have been able to let grantham house to you we cannot consider the matter at all now unless you pay for everything in advance  she uncovered her eyes and looked at him people so direct of speech as this had come very seldom into her life she was conscious of a thrill of interest the study of men was a passion with her here was indeed a new type  so you think that i am an adventuress she murmured  he reflected for a moment  i suppose he admitted that it comes to that i should not have returned at all if i had not promised if there is any message which you wish me to give your sister i will take it but i cannot tell you her address  she laid her hand suddenly upon his and raising herself a little on the couch leaned towards him her eyes and her lips both pleaded with him  mr tavernake she said slowly beatrice is such a dear obstinate creature but she does not quite appreciate my position do me a favor please if you have promised not to give me her address let me at least know some way or some place in which i could come across her i am sure she will be glad afterwards and ii shall be very grateful  tavernake felt that he was enveloped by something which he did not understand but his lack of experience was so great that he did not even wonder at his insensibility  i shall keep my word to your sister he announced in the spirit as well as the letter it is quite useless to ask me to do otherwise  elizabeth was at first amazed then angry how angry she scarcely knew even herself she had been a spoilt child she had grown into a spoilt woman men at least had been ready enough to do her bidding all her life her beauty was of that peculiar kind half seductive half pathetic wholly irresistible and now there had come this strange almost impossible person against the armor of whose indifference she had spent herself in vain her eyes filled with tears once more as she looked at him and tavernake became uneasy he glanced at the clock and again toward the door  i think if you will excuse me he began  mr tavernake she interrupted you are very unkind to me very unkind indeed  i cannot help it he answered  if you knew everything she continued you would not be so obstinate if beatrice herself were here if i could whisper something in her ear she would be only too thankful that i had found her out beatrice has always misunderstood me mr tavernake it is a little hard upon me for we are both so far away from home from our friends  you can send her any message you like by me tavernake declared if you like i will wait while you write a letter if you really have anything to say to her which might change her opinion you can write it cant you  she looked down at her handsvery beautiful and wellkept handsand sighed this young man with his unusual imperturbability and hateful common sense was getting on her nerves  it is so hard to write things mr tavernake she said but of course it is something to know that if the worst happens i can send her a letter i shall think about that for a short time meanwhile there is so much about her i would love to have you tell me she has no money has she how does she support herself  she sings occasionally at concerts tavernake replied after a moments pause i suppose there is no harm in telling you that  elizabeth leaned towards him she was very loth indeed to acknowledge defeat once more her voice was deliciously soft her forehead delicately wrinkled her blue eyes filled with alluring light  mr tavernake she murmured do you know that you are not in the least kind to me beatrice and i are sisters after all even she has admitted that she left me most unkindly at a critical time in my life she misunderstood things if i were to see her i could explain everything i feel it very much that she is living apart from me in this city where we are both strangers i am anxious about her mr tavernake does she want money if so will you take her some from me cant you suggest any way in which i could help her do be my friend please and advise me  life was certainly opening out for tavernake the atmosphere by which he was surrounded which she was deliberately creating around him was the atmosphere of an unknown world it was a position this entirely novel to him nevertheless he did his best to cope with it intelligently he reflected carefully before he made any reply he refused absolutely to listen to the strange voices singing in his ears and he delivered his decision with his usual air of finality  i am afraid he said that since beatrice refuses even to let you know her whereabouts she would not wish to accept anything from you it seems a pity he went on the instincts of the moneysaver stirring within him she is certainly none too well off  the lady on the couch sighed  beatrice has at least a friend she murmured it is a great deal to have a friend it is more than i have we are both so far from home here often i am sorry that we ever left america england is not a hospitable country mr tavernake  again this painfully literal young man spoke out what was in his mind  there was a gentleman in the motorcar with you the other night he reminded her  she bit her lip  he was just an acquaintance she answered a man whom i used to know in new york passing through london he called on me and asked me to go to the theatre and supper why not i have had a terrible time during the last few months mr tavernake and i am very lonelylonelier than ever since my sister deserted me  tavernake began to feel ridiculous though it seemed that in some subtle and inexplicable fashion he was in danger at any rate he was hopelessly bewildered he did not understand why this very beautiful lady should look at him as though they were old friends why her eyes should appeal to him so often for sympathy why her fingers which a moment ago were resting lightly upon his hand and which she had drawn away with reluctance should have burned him like pinpricks of fire the woman who wishes to allure may be as subtle as possible in her methods but a sense of her purpose however vague it may be is generally communicated to her would be victim tavernake was becoming distinctly uneasy he had no vanity he knew from the first that this beautiful creature belonged to a world far removed from any of which he had any knowledge the only solution of the situation which presented itself to him was that she might be thinking of borrowing money from him  there was never a time in my life she continued softly when i felt that i needed a friend more i am afraid that my sister has prejudiced you against me mr tavernake beatrice is very young and the young are not always sympathetic you know they do not make allowances they do not understand  why did you tell mr dowling things which were not true he asked bluntly  she sighed and looked down at the handkerchief with which she had been toying  it was a very silly piece of conceit she admitted but you see i had to tell him something  why did you come to the office at all he continued  do you really want to know that she whispered softly  well  i will tell you she went on suddenly it sounds foolish in a way and yet it wasnt really because you seeshe smiled at himi was anxious about beatrice i saw you come out of the office that morning and i recognized you at once i knew that it was you who had been with beatrice i made an excuse about the house to come and see whether i could find you out  tavernake in whom the vanity was not yet born missed wholly the significance of her smile her trifling hesitation  all that he declared is no reason why you should have told mr dowling that your husband was a millionaire and had given you carte blanche about taking a house  did i mentionmy husband  distinctly he assured her  for the first time she had faltered in her speech tavernake felt that she herself was shaken by some emotion her eyes for a moment were strangelylit something had come into her face which he did not understand then it passed the delightful smile half deprecating half appealing once more parted her lips the gleam of horror no longer shone in her blue eyes  i am always so foolish about money she declared so ignorant that i never know how i stand but really i think that i have plenty and a hundred or two more or less for rent didnt seem to matter much  it was a point of view this which tavernake utterly failed to comprehend he looked at her in surprise  i suppose he protested you know how much a year you have to live on  she shook her head  it seems to vary all the time she sighed there are so many complications  he looked at her in amazement  after all he admitted you dont look as though you had much of a head for figures  if only i had some one to help me she murmured  tavernake moved uneasily in his chair his sense of danger was growing  if you will excuse me now he said i think that i must be getting back i am an employee at dowling spence  companys you know and my time is not quite my own i only came because i promised to  mr tavernake she begged looking at him full out of those wonderful blue eyes please do me a great favor  what is it he asked with clumsy ungraciousness  come and see me every now and then and let me know how my sister is perhaps you may be able to suggest some way in which i can help her  tavernake considered the question for a moment he was angry with himself for the unaccountable sense of pleasure which her suggestion had given him  i am not quite sure he said whether i had better come beatrice seemed quite anxious that i should not talk about her to you at all she did not like my coming today  you seem to know a great deal about my sister elizabeth declared reflectively you call her by her christian name and you appear to see her frequently perhaps even you are fond of her  tavernake met his questioners inquiring gaze blankly he was almost indignant  fond of her he exclaimed i have never been fond of any one in my life or anythingexcept my work he added  she looked at him a little bewildered at first  oh you strange person she cried her lips breaking into a delightful smile dont you know that you havent begun to live at all yet you dont even know anything about life and at the back of it all you have capacity yes she went on i think that you have the capacity for living  her hand fell upon his with a little gesture which was half a caress he looked around him as though seeking for escape he was on his feet now and he clutched at his hat  i must go he insisted almost roughly  am i keeping you she asked innocently well you shall go as soon as you please only you must promise me one thing you must come back say within a week and let me know how my sister is i am not half so brutal as you think i really am anxious about her please  i will promise that he answered  wait one moment then she begged turning to the letters by her side there is just something i want to ask you dont be impatientit is entirely a matter of business  all the time he was acutely conscious of that restless desire to get out of the room the womans white arms from which the sleeves of her blue gown had fallen back were stretched towards him as she lazily turned over her pile of correspondence they were very beautiful arms and tavernake although he had had no experience was dimly aware of the fact her eyes too seemed always to be trying to reach some part of him which was dead or as yet unborn he could feel her striving to get there beating against the walls of his indifference why should a woman wear blue stockings because she had a blue gown he wondered idly she was not like beatrice this alluring beautiful woman who lay there talking to him in a manner whose meaning came to him only in strange bewildering flashes he could be with beatrice and feel the truth of what he had once told herthat her sex was a thing which need not even be taken into account between them with this woman it was different he felt that she wished it to be different  perhaps you had better tell me about that matter of business next time i am here he suggested with an abruptness which was almost brusque i must go now i do not know why i have stayed so long  she held out her fingers  you are a very sudden person she declared smiling at his discomfiture if you must go  he scarcely touched her hand anxious only to get away and then the door opened and a man of somewhat remarkable appearance entered the room with the air of a privileged person he was oddly dressed with little regard to the fashion of the moment his black coat was cut after the mode of a past generation his collar was of the type affected by gladstone and his fellowstatesmen his black bow was arranged with studied negligence and he showed more frilled white shirtfront than is usual in the daytime his silk hat was glossy but broadbrimmed his masses of gray hair brushed back from a high broad forehead gave him almost a patriarchal aspect his features were large and fairly wellshaped but his mouth was weak and his cheeks lacked the color of a healthy life tavernake stared at him openmouthed he for his part looked at tavernake as he might have looked at some strange wild animal  a thousand apologies dear elizabeth he exclaimed i knocked but i imagine that you did not hear me knowing your habits it did not occur to me that you might be engaged at this hour of the morning  it is a young man from the house agents she announced indifferently come to see me about a flat  in that case he suggested amiably i am perhaps not in the way  elizabeth turned her head slightly and looked at him he backed precipitately toward the door  in a few minutes he said i will return in a few minutes  tavernake attempted to follow his example  there is no occasion for your friend to leave he protested if you have any instructions for us a note to the office will always bring some one here to see you  she sat up on the couch and smiled at him his obvious embarrassment amused her it was a new sort of game this altogether  come mr tavernake she said three minutes more wont matter will it i will not keep you longer than that i promise  he came reluctantly a few steps back  i am sorry he explained but we really are busy this morning  this is business she declared still smiling at him pleasantly my sister has filled you with suspicions about me some of them may be justifiable some are not i am not so rich as i should like some people to believe it is so much easier to live well you know when people believe that you are rolling in money still i am by no means a pauper i cannot afford to take grantham house but neither can i afford to go on living here i have decided to make a change to try and economize to try and live within my means now will you bring me a list of small houses or flats something at not more than say two or three hundred a year it shall be strictly a business proceeding i will pay you for your time if that is necessary and your commission in advance there you cant refuse my offer on those terms can you  tavernake remained silent he was conscious that his lack of response seemed both sullen and awkward but he was for the moment tonguetied his habit of inopportune selfanalysis had once more asserted itself he could not understand the curious nature of his mistrust of this woman nor could he understand the pleasure which her suggestion gave him he wanted to refuse and yet he was glad to be able to tell himself that he was after all but an employee of his firm and not in a position to decline business on their behalf  she leaned a little towards him her tone was almost beseeching  you are not going to be unkind you will not refuse me she pleaded  i will bring you a list he answered heavily on the terms you suggest  tomorrow morning she begged  as soon as i am able he promised  then he escaped outside in the corridor the man who had interrupted his interview was walking backwards and forwards tavernake passed him without responding to his bland greeting he forgot all about the lift and descended five flights of stairs  a few minutes later he presented himself at the office and reported that mrs wenham gardner had decided unfavorably about grantham house and that she was not disposed indeed to take premises of anything like such a rental mr dowling was disappointed and inclined to think that his employee had mismanaged the affair  i wish that i had gone myself he declared she obviously wished me to but it happened to be inconvenient bythebye tavernake close the door will you there is another matter concerning which i should like to speak to you  tavernake did as he was bidden at once without any disquietude his own services to the firm were of such a nature that he had no misgiving whatever as to his employers desire for a private interview  it is about the marston rise estate mr dowling explained arranging his pince nez i believe that the time is coming when some sort of overtures should be made you know what has been in my mind for a very considerable time  tavernake nodded  yes he admitted i know quite well  i did hear a rumor mr dowling continued that some one had bought one small plot on the outskirts of the estate i dare say it is not true and in any case it is not worth while troubling about but it shows that the public is beginning to nibble i am of opinion that the time is almostyes almost ripe for a move  do you wish me to do anything in the matter sir tavernake asked  in the first place mr dowling declared i should like you to try to find out whether any of the plots have really been sold and if so to whom and what would be their price can you do this during the week  i think so tavernake answered  say monday morning mr dowling suggested taking down his hat i shall be playing golf tomorrow and friday and of course saturday monday morning you might let me have a report  tavernake went back to his office after all then things were to come to a crisis a little earlier than he had thought he knew quite well that that report if he made it honestly and no other idea was likely to occur to him would effectually sever his connection with messrs dowling spence  company     chapter ix the plot thickens   the man whom tavernake had left walking up and down the corridor lost no time in presenting himself once more at the apartments of mrs wenham gardner he entered the suite without ceremony carefully closing both doors behind him it became obvious then that his deportment on the occasion of his previous appearance had been in the nature of a bluff the air with which he looked across the room at the woman who watched him was furtive the hand which laid his hat upon the table was shaking there was a gleam almost of terror in his eyes the woman remained impassive inscrutable simply watching him after a moment or two however she spokea single monosyllable  well  the man broke down  elizabeth he exclaimed you are tootoo ghastly i cant stand it you are unnatural  she stretched herself upon the couch and turned towards him  unnatural am i she remarked and what are you  he sank into a chair he had become very flabby indeed  what you are always calling me i suppose he muttereda coward you have so little consideration elizabeth my health isnt what it was  his eyes had wandered longingly toward the cupboard at the further end of the apartment the woman upon the couch smiled  you may help yourself she directed carelessly perhaps then you will be able to tell me why you have come in such a state  he crossed the room in a few hasty steps his head and shoulders disappeared inside the cupboard there was the sound of the withdrawal of a cork the fizz of a sodawater syphon he returned to his place a different man  you must remember my age elizabeth dear he said apologetically i havent your nerveit isnt likely that i should have when i was twentyfive there was nothing in the world of which i was afraid  she looked him over critically  perhaps i am not so absolutely courageous as you think she remarked to tell you the truth there are a good many things of which i am afraid when you come to me in such a state i am afraid of you of what you will do or say  you need not be he assured her hastily when i am away from you i am dumb what i suffer no one knows i keep it to myself  she nodded a little contemptuously  i suppose you do your best she declared tell me now what is this fresh thing which has disturbed you  her visitor stared at her  does there need to be any fresh thing he muttered  i suppose it is something about wenham she asked  the man shivered he opened his lips and closed them again the womans tone if possible grew colder  i hope you are not going to tell me that you have disobeyed my orders she said  no he protested no i was there yesterday i came back by the mail from penzance i had to motor thirty miles to catch it  something has happened of course she went on something which you are afraid to tell me sit up like a man my dear father and let me have the truth  nothing fresh has happened at all he assured her it is simply that the memory of the day i spent at that place and that the sight of him has got on my nerves till i cant sleep or think of anything else  what rubbish she exclaimed  you have only seen the place in fine weather he continued dropping his voice a little elizabeth you have no idea what it is really like yesterday morning i got out of the train at bodmin and i motored through to the village of clawes after that there were five miles to walk theres no road only a sort of broken track and for the whole of that five miles there isnt even a farm building to be seen and i didnt meet a human soul there was a sort of pall of whitegray mists everywhere over the moor sometimes so dense that i couldnt see my way and you could stop and listen and there wasnt a thing to be heard not even a sheep bell  she laughed softly  my dear foolish father she murmured you dont understand what a rest cure is this is quite all right quite as it should be poor wenham has been seeing too many people all his lifethat is why we have to keep him quiet for a time you can skip the scenery i suppose you got to the house at last  yes i got there continued her father you know what a bleaklooking place it is right on the side of a bare hilla square gray stone place just the color of the hillside well i got there and walked in there was ted mathers half dressed no collar with a bottle of whiskey on the table playing some wretched game of cards by himself elizabeth what a brute that man is  she shook her head  go on she said what about wenham  he was there in a corner gazing out of the window when i came he sprang up but when he saw who it was hehe tried to hide he was afraid of me  why she asked  he said that ii reminded him of you  absurd she murmured tell me how did he look  ill wretched paler and thinner than ever and wilder looking  what did mathers say about him she demanded  what could he he told me that he cried all day and begged to be taken back to america  no one goes near the place i suppose she asked  not a soul a man comes from the village to sell things once a week mathers knows when to expect him and takes care that wenham is not around they are out of the world thereno road no paths nothing to bring even a tourist i could have imagined such a spot in arizona elizabeth but in englandno  has he any amusements at all she inquired  the mans hands were shaking once more his eyes went longingly toward the cupboard  he has madea doll he said carved it out of a piece of wood and dressed it in oddments from his ties mathers showed it to me as a joke elizabeth it was wonderfulhorrible  why she asked him  it is you he continued moistening his lips with his tongue you in a blue gownyour favorite shade he has even made blue stockings and strange little shoes he has got some hair from somewhere and parted it just like yours  it sounds very touching she remarked  the man was shivering again  elizabeth he said i do not think that he means it kindly mathers took me up into his room he has made something there which looks like a scaffold the doll was hanging by a piece of string from the gallows elizabethmy god but it was like you he cried suddenly dropping his head upon his arms  for a moment a reflection of the terror which had seized him flashed in her own face it passed quickly away she laughed mockingly  my dear father she protested you are certainly not yourself this morning  i saw you swinging he muttered swinging by that piece of cord there was a great black pin through your heart elizabeth if he should get away sometime if some one should come over from america and discover where he was if he should find us out oh my god if he should find us out  elizabeth had risen to her feet she was standing now before the fire her left elbow resting upon the mantelpiece a trifle of silver gleaming in her right hand  father she said there is no danger in life for those who know no fear look at me  his eyes sought hers fascinated  if he should find me out she continued it would be no such terrible thing after all it would be the end  her fingers disclosed the little ornament she was carryinga tiny pistol she slipped it back into her pocket the man was wondering how such a thing as this came to be his daughter  you have courage elizabeth he whispered  i have courage she assented because i have brains i never allow myself to be in a position where i should be likely to get the worst of it ever since the day when he turned so suddenly against me i have been careful  her father leaned towards her  elizabeth he said i never really understood what was it that came over him so suddenly one day he was your slave the next i think he would have murdered you if he could  she shrugged her shoulders  honestly she replied i felt it impossible to keep up the sham any longer i married wenham gardner in new york because he was supposed to be a millionaire and because it seemed to be the best thing to do but as to living with him i never meant that you know how ridiculous his behavior was on the boat he never let me out of his sight but swore that he was going to give up smoking and drinking and lead a new life for my sake i really believe he meant it too  wouldnt it have been better dear her father suggested timidly to have encouraged him  she shook her head  he was absolutely hopeless she declared you say that i have no nerves that is because i do not allow myself to suffer if i had gone on living with wenham it would have driven me mad his habits his manner of life everything disgusted me until i came to see so much of him i never understood what the term decadent really can mean the very touch of him grew to be hateful no woman could live with such a man by the way he signed the draft i suppose  her father handed her a slip of paper which she looked at and locked in her drawer  did he make any trouble about it she asked  the professor shivered  he refused to sign it he said in a low tone swore he would never sign it mathers sent me out for a few minutes made me go into another room when i came back he gave me the draft i heard him calling out  mathers certainly earns his money she remarked drily  he gazed at her with grudging admiration this was his daughter his own flesh and blood back through the years for a moment he seemed to see her a child with hair down her back sitting on his knee listening to his stories wondering at the little arts and tricks by which he had wrested their pennies and sixpennies from a credulous public phrenologist hypnotist conjurerall these things the great professor franklin had called himself often from the rude stage where he had given his performance he had terrified to death the women and children of his audience it flashed upon him at that moment that never even in the days of her childhood had he seen fear in elizabeths face  you should have been a man elizabeth he muttered  she shook her head smiling as though not illpleased at the compliment  the power of a man is so limited she declared a woman has more weapons  more weapons indeed the professor agreed as his eyes traveled over the slim yet wonderful perfection of her form lingered for a moment at the little knot of lace at her throat wrestled with the delicate sweetness of her features struggling hard to think from whom among his ancestors could have come a creature so physically attractive  more weapons indeed he repeated elizabeth what a giftwhat a gift  you speak she replied as though it were an evil one  i was only thinking he said that it seems a pity you are so wonderful we might have found an easier and a less dangerous way to fortune  she smiled  the bohemian blood in me i suppose she remarked the crooked ways attract you know when one has been brought up as i was  your poor mother had no love for them he reminded her  beatrice has inherited everything that belonged to my mother i am your own daughter father you ought to be proud of me but there i gave you another commission is it true that jerry is really here  he arrived in england on wednesday on the lusitania he has been in town all the time since  a distinct frown darkened her face  he must have had my letter then she murmured half to herself  without a doubt her father admitted elizabeth why do you take chances about seeing this man he was fond of you in new york i know but then he was fond of his brother too he may not believe your story it may be dangerous  she smiled  i think i can convince jerry gardner of anything i choose to tell him she said besides it is absolutely necessary that i have some information about wenhams affairs he must have a great deal more money somewhere and i must find out how we are to get at it  the professor shook his head  i dont like it he muttered supposing he finds beatrice  elizabeth shrugged her shoulders  beatrice is made of silent stuff she declared i should never be afraid of her all the same i wish i could find out just where she is it would look better if we were living together  the professor shook his head sadly  she left us of her own free will he said and i dont believe elizabeth that she would ever come back again she knew very well what she was doing she knew that our views of life were not hers she didnt know half but she knew enough you were quite right in what you said just now beatrice was more like her mother and her mother was a good woman  really elizabeth remarked insolently  dont answer like that he blustered striking the table she was your mother too  the womans face was inscrutable hard and flawless behind the little cloud of tobacco smoke the man began to tremble once more every time he ventured to assert himself a single look from her was sufficient to quell him  elizabeth he muttered you havent a heart you havent a soul you havent a conscience i wonderwhat sort of a woman you are  i am your daughter she reminded him pleasantly  i was never quite so bad as that he went on taking a large silk handkerchief from his pocket and dabbing his forehead i had to live and times were hard i have cheated the public perhaps i havent been above playing at cards a little cleverly or making something where i could out of the weaker men but elizabeth i am afraid of you  men are generally afraid of the big stakes she remarked flicking the ash from her cigarette they will cheat and lie for halfpennies but they are bad gamblers when life or deaththe big things are in the balance bah she went on father i want jerry gardner to come and see me  if you cant make him come my dear the professor said i am sure it will be of no use my trying  he has had my letter she continued half to herself he has had my letter and he does not come  there is nothing to be done but wait her father decided  and meanwhile she went on supposing he were to discover beatrice supposing they two were to come together supposing he were to tell her what he knows and she were to tell him what she guessed  the professor buried his face in his hands elizabeth threw her cigarette away with an impatient gesture  what an idiot i am she declared what is the use of wasting time like this  there was a knock at the door a trimlooking french maid presented herself she addressed her mistress in voluble french a coiffeur and a manicurist were waiting in the next apartment it was time that madame habited herself the professor listened to these announcements with an air of halfadmiring wonder  i suppose i must be going he said rising to his feet there is just one thing i should like to ask you elizabeth if i may before i go  well  who was the young man whom i met here just now  why do you ask that she demanded  i really do not know her father replied thoughtfully except that his appearance seemed a little singular in some respects he appeared so commonplace his clothes and bearing in fact were so ordinary that i was surprised to find him here with you and on the other hand his faceyou must remember my dear that this is entirely a professional instinct i am still interested in faces  quite so she admitted go on the young man rather puzzles me myself i should like to hear what you make of him what did you think of his face  there was something powerful about it he declared something dogged splendid narrow impossiblethe sort of face which belongs to a man who achieves great things because he is too stupid to recognize failure even when it has him in its arms and its fingers are upon his throat that young man has qualities my dear i am sure mind you at present they are dormant but he has qualities  she led him to the door  my dear father she said sometimes i really respect you if you should come across that young man again keep your eye upon him he knows one thing at least which i wish he would tell ushe knows where beatrice is  her father looked at her in amazement  he knows where beatrice is and he has not told you  she nodded  you tried to have him tell you and he refused the professor persisted  exactly she admitted  her father put on his hat  i knew that young man was something out of the common     chapter x the joy of battle   they sat on the trunk of a fallen tree in the topmost corner of the field in the hedge close at hand was a commotion of birds in the elm tree a little further away a thrush was singing a soft west wind blew in their faces the air immediately around them was filled with sunlight yet almost to their feet stretched one of those great arms of the citya suburb with its miles of villas its clanging of electric cars its waste plots its rows of struggling shops and only a little further away still the body itselfthe huge city throbbing beneath its pall of smoke and cloud the girl who had been gazing steadily downwards for several moments turned at last to her companion  do you know she said that this makes me think of the first night you spoke to me you remember itup on the roof at blenheim house  tavernake did not answer for a moment he was looking through a queerlyshaped instrument that he had brought with him at halfadozen stakes that he had laboriously driven into the ground some distance away he was absolutely absorbed in his task  the main avenue he muttered softly to himself yes it must be a trifle more to the left then we get all the offshoots parallel and the better houses have their southern aspect i beg your pardon beatrice did you say anything he broke off suddenly  she smiled  nothing worth mentioning i was just thinking that it reminded me a little up here of the first time you and i ever talked together  he glanced down at the panorama below with its odd jumble of hideous buildings softened here and there with wreaths of sunstained smoke its great blots of ugliness irredeemable insistent  its different of course she went on i remember even now the view from the housetop that night in a sense it was finer than this everything was more lurid and yet more chaotic one simply felt that underneath all those mysterious places was some great being toiling and strugglinglife itself groaning through space with human cogwheels up here one sees too much oh my dear leonard she continued to think that you too should be one of the devastators  he fitted his instrument into its case and replaced it in his pocket  come he said you mustnt call me hard names i shall remind you of the man whose works you are making me read you know what he saysthe aesthete is after all only a dallier the world lives and progresses by reason of its utilitarians this hill represents to me most of the things that are worth having in life  she laughed shortly  you will cut down those hedges and drive away the birds to find a fresh home you will plough up the green grass cut out a street and lay down granite stones then i see your ugly little houses coming up like mushrooms all over the place you are a vandal my dear leonard  i am simply obeying the law he answered after all even from your own point of view i do not think that it is so bad look closer and you will find that the hedges are blackened here and there with smuts the birds will find a better dwelling place further away see how the smoke from those factory chimneys is sending its smuts across these fields they are no longer country they are better gathered in  she shivered  there is something about life she said sadly which terrifies me every force that counts seems to be destructive  up the steep hill behind them came the puffing and groaning of a small motorcar they both turned their heads to watch it come into view it was an insignificant affair of an almost extinct pattern a single cylinder machine with a round tonneau back the engine was knocking badly as the driver brought it to a standstill a few yards away from them involuntarily tavernake stiffened as he saw the two men who descended from it and who were already passing through the gate close to where they were one was mr dowling the other the manager of the bank where they kept their account mr dowling recognized his manager with surprise but much cordiality  dear me he exclaimed dear me this is most fortunate you know mr tavernake of course belton my manager mr tavernakemr belton of the london  westminster bank i have brought mr belton up here tavernake to have a look round so that he may know what we mean to do with all the money we shall have to come and borrow eh  the bank manager smiled  it is a very fine situation he remarked  the eyes of the two men fell upon beatrice who had drawn a little to one side  may we have the pleasure tavernake mr dowling said graciously you are not married i believe  no this is my sister tavernake answered slowlymr belton and mr dowling  the two men acknowledged the salute with some slight surprise beatrice although her clothes were simple had always the air of belonging to a different world  your brother my dear miss tavernake mr dowling declared is a perfect genius at discovering these desirable sites this one i honestly consider to be the find of our lifetime we have now he proceeded turning to mr belton certain information that the cars will run to whatever point we desire in this vicinity and the metropolitan railway has also arranged for an extension of its system tomorrow i propose mr dowling continued holding the sides of his coat and assuming a somewhat pompous manner to make an offer for the whole of this site it will involve a very large sum of money indeed but i am convinced that it will be a remunerative speculation  tavernake remained grimly silent this was scarcely the time or the place which he would have selected for an explanation with his employer there were signs however that the thing was to be forced upon him  i am very pleased indeed to meet you here tavernake mr dowling went on pleased both for personal reasons and because it shows if i may be allowed to say so the interest which you take in the firms business that you should devote your holiday to coming andersurveying the scene of our exploits so to speak perhaps now that you are here you would be able to explain to mr belton better than i should just what it is that we propose  tavernake hesitated for a moment finally however he proceeded to make clear a very elaborate and carefully thought out building scheme to which both men listened with much attention when he had finished however he turned round to mr dowling facing him squarely  you will understand sir he concluded that a scheme such as i have pointed out could only be carried through if the whole of the property were in one persons hands i may say that the information to which you referred a few days ago was perfectly correct a considerable portion of the south side of the hill has already been purchased besides certain other plots which would interfere considerably with any comprehensive scheme of building  mr dowlings face fell at once his tone was one of annoyance mingled with irritation  come come he declared this sounds very bad mr tavernake very neglectful very careless as to the interests of the firm why did we not keep our eye upon it why did we not forestall this other purchaser eh it appears to me that we have been slack very slack indeed  tavernake took a small book from his pocket  you will remember sir he said that it was on the eleventh of may last year when i first spoke to you of this site  well well mr dowling exclaimed sharply what of it  you were starting out for a fortnights golf somewhere tavernake continued and you promised to look into the affair when you returned i spoke to you again but you declared that you were far too busy to go into the matter at all for the present you didnt care about this side of london you considered that we had enough on handin fact you threw cold water upon the idea  i may not have been very enthusiastic at first mr dowling admitted grudgingly latterly however i have come round to your views  there have been several articles in various newspapers and a good deal of talk tavernake remarked which have been more effectual i think in bringing you round than my advice however what i wish to say to you is this sir that when i found myself unable to interest you in this scheme i went into it myself to some extent  went into it yourself mr dowling repeated incredulously what do you mean tavernake what do you mean sir  i mean that i have invested my savings in the purchase of several plots of land upon this hillside tavernake explained  on your own account mr dowling demanded your savings indeed  certainly tavernake answered why not  but its the firms business sirthe firms not yours  the firm had the opportunity tavernake pointed out and were not inclined to avail themselves of it if i had not bought the land when i did some one else would have bought the whole of it long ago  mr dowling was obviously in a furious temper  do you mean to tell me sir he exclaimed that you dared to enter into private speculations while still an employee of the firm it is a most unheardof thing unwarranted ridiculous i shall require you sir to at once make over the plots of land to usto the firm you understand we shall give you your price of course although i expect you paid much more for it than we should have done still we must give you what you paid and four per cent interest for your money  i am sorry tavernake replied but i am afraid that i should require better terms than that in fact he continued i do not wish to sell i have given a great deal of thought and time to this matter and i intend to carry it out as a personal speculation  then you will carry it out sir from some other place than from within the walls of my office mr dowling declared furiously you understand that tavernake  perfectly tavernake answered you wish me to leave you it is very unwise of you to suggest it but i am quite prepared to go  you will either resell me those plots at cost price or you shall not set foot within the office again mr dowling insisted it is a gross breach of faith this i never heard of such a thing in all my life most unprofessional impossible behavior  tavernake showed no signs of angerhe simply turned a little away  i shall not sell you my land mr dowling he said and it will suit me very well to leave your employ you appear he continued to expect some one else to do the whole of the work for you while you reap the entire profits those days have gone by my business in the world is to make a fortune for myself and not for you  how dare you sir mr dowling cried i never heard such impertinence in my life  you havent done a stroke of work for five years tavernake went on unmoved and my efforts have supplied you with a fairly good income in future those efforts will be directed towards my own advancement  mr dowling turned back toward the car  young man he said you can brazen it out as much as you like but you have been guilty of a gross breach of faith i shall take care that the exact situation is made known in all responsible quarters youll get no situation with any firm with whom i am acquaintedi can promise you that if you have anything more to say to dowling spence  company let it be in writing  they parted company there and then tavernake and beatrice went down the hill in silence  does this bother you at all she inquired presently  nothing to speak of tavernake answered it had to come i wasnt quite ready but that doesnt matter  what shall you do now she asked  borrow enough to buy the whole of the hill he replied  she looked back  wont that mean a great deal of money  he nodded  it will be a big thing of course he admitted never mind i dare say i shall be able to interest some one in it in any case i never meant mr dowling to make a fortune out of this  they walked on in silence a little further then she spoke again with some hesitation  i suppose that what you have done is quite fair leonard  he answered her promptly without any sign of offence at her question  as a matter of fact he confessed it is an unusual thing for any one in the employ of a firm of estate agents to make speculations on their own account in land in this case however i consider that i was justified i have opened up three building speculations for the firm on each one of which they have made a great deal of money and i have not even had my salary increased or any recognition whatever offered me there is a debt of course which an employee owes to his employer there is also a debt however which the employer owes to his employee in my case i have never been treated with the slightest consideration of any sort what i have done i shall stick to after all i am more interested in making money for myself than for other people  they had reached the corner of the field now and turning into the lane commenced the steep descent it was sunday evening and from all the little conventicles and tin churches below the bells began their unmusical summons from further away in the distance came the more melodious chiming from the cathedral and the city churches the shriller and nearer note however prevailed the whole medley of sound was a discord as they descended they could see the blackcoated throngs slowly moving towards the different places of worship there was something uninspiring about it all she shuddered  leonard she said i wonder why you are so anxious to get on in the world why do you want to be rich  he was glancing back toward the hill the light of calculations in his eyes once more he was measuring out those plots of land calculating rent deducting interest  we all seek different things he replied tolerantlysome fame some pleasure mr dowling for instance has no other ambition than to muddle round the golf links a few strokes better than his partner  and you she asked  it is success i seek he answered women as a rule do not understand you for instance beatrice are too sentimental i am very practical it is money that i want i want money because money means success  and afterwards she whispered  he was attending to her no longer they were turning now into the broad thoroughfare at the bottom of the lane at the end of which a tramcar was waiting he scribbled a few final notes into his pocketbook  tomorrow he exclaimed with the joy of battle in his tone tomorrow the fight begins in earnest  beatrice passed her hand through his arm  not only for you dear friend but for me she said for you what do you mean he asked quickly  i have been trying to tell you all day she continued but you have been too engrossed yesterday afternoon i went to see mr grier at the atlas theatre i had my voice tried and tomorrow night i am going to take a small part in the new musical comedy  tavernake stared at her in something like consternation his ideas as to the stage and all that belonged to it were of a primitive order mrs fitzgerald was perhaps as near as possible to his idea of the type he glanced incredulously at beatriceslim quietly dressed yet with the unmistakable to him mysterious distinction of breeding  you an actress he exclaimed  she laughed softly  dear leonard she said this is going to be a part of your education tomorrow night you shall come to the theatre and wait for me at the stagedoor     chapter xi a bewildering offer   elizabeth stood with her hands behind her back leaning slightly against the writingtable the professor with his broadbrimmed hat clinched in his fingers walked restlessly up and down the little room the discussion had not been altogether a pleasant one elizabeth was composed but serious her father nervous and excited  you are mad elizabeth he declared is it that you do not understand or will not i tell you that we must go  she shrugged her shoulders  where would you drag me to she asked we certainly cant go back to new york  he turned fiercely upon her  whose fault is it that we cant he demanded if it werent for you and your confounded schemes i could be walking down broadway next week gods own city it is too he muttered i wish wed never seen those two young men  it was a pity perhaps she admitted yet we had to do something we were absolutely stonybroke as they say over here  anyway weve got to get out of this the professor declared  my dear father she replied i will agree that if a new city or a new world could arise from the bottom of the sea where professor franklin was unknown and his beautiful daughter elizabeth had neyer been heard of it might perhaps be advisable for us to go there  as it is  there is rome he exclaimed or some of the smaller places we have money for a time we could get another draft perhaps from wenham  she shook her head we are just as safe here as anywhere on the continent she remarked  once more he struck the table then he threw out his hands above his head with the melodramatic instinct which had always been strong in his blood  do you think that i am a fool he cried do you think i do not know that if there were not something moving in your brain you would think no more of that clerk that bourgeois estate agent than of the doormat beneath your feet it is what i always complain about you make use of me as a tool there are always things which i do not understand he comes here this young man under a pretext whether he knows it or not you talk to him for an hour at a time there should be nothing in your life which i do not know of elizabeth he continued his voice suddenly hoarse as he leaned towards her cant you see that there is danger in friendships for you and for me there is danger in intimacies of any sort i share the danger i have a right to share the knowledge this young man has no money of his own i take it of what use is he to us  you are too hasty my dear father she replied let me assure you that there is nothing at all mysterious about mr tavernake the simple truth is that the young man rather attracts me  the professor gazed at her incredulously  attracts you he  you have never perfectly understood me my dear parent she murmured you have never appreciated that trait in my character that strange preference if you like for the absolutely original now in all my life i never met such a young man as this he wears the clothes and he has the features and speech of just such a person as you have described but there is a difference  a difference indeed the professor interrupted roughly what difference i should like to know  she shrugged her shoulders lightly  he is stolid without being stupid she explained he is entirely selfcentered i smile at him and he waits patiently until i have finished to get on with our business i have said quite nice things to him and he has stared at me without change of expression absolutely without pleasure or emotion of any sort  you are too vain elizabeth her father declared you have been spoilt there are a few people in the world whom even you might fail to charm no doubt this young man is one of them  she sighed gently  it really does seem she admitted as though you were right but we shall see bythebye hadnt you better go the five minutes are nearly up  he came over to her side his hat and gloves in his hand prepared for departure  will you tell me upon your honor elizabeth he begged that there is no other reason for your interest that you are not engaged in any fresh schemes of which i know nothing things are bad enough as they are i cannot sleep i cannot rest for thinking of our position if i thought that you had any fresh plans on hand  she flicked the ash from her cigarette and checked him with a little gesture  he knows where beatrice is she remarked thoughtfully and i cant get him to tell me there is nothing beyondabsolutely nothing  when tavernake was announced elizabeth was still smoking sitting in an easychair and looking into the fire something in her attitude the droop of her head as it rested upon her fingers reminded him suddenly of beatrice he showed no other emotion than a sudden pause in his walk across the room even that however in a person whose machinelike attitude towards her provoked her resentment was noticeable  good morning my friend she said pleasantly you have brought me the fresh list  unfortunately no madam tavernake answered i have called simply to announce that i am not able to be of any further assistance to you in the matter  she looked at him for a moment without remark  are you serious mr tavernake she asked  yes he replied the fact is i am not in a position to help you i have left the employ of messrs dowling spence  company  of your own accord she inquired quietly  no i was dismissed he confessed i should have been compelled to leave in a very short time but mr dowling forestalled me  wont you sit down and tell me about it she invited  he looked her in the eyes square and unflinching he was still able to do that  it could not possibly interest you he said  andmy sister you have seen her  i have seen your sister tavernake answered without hesitation  you have a message for me  none he declared  she refusesto be reconciled then  i am afraid she has no friendly feelings towards you  she gave you no reason  no direct reason he admitted but her attitude isquite uncompromising  she rose and swept across the floor towards him with firm but gentle fingers she took his worn bowler hat and mended gloves from his hand her gesture guided him towards a sofa  beatrice has prejudiced you against me she murmured it is not fair please come and sit downfor five minutes she pleaded i want you to tell me why you have quarrelled with that funny little man mr dowling  but madam he protested  if you refuse i shall think that my sister has been telling you stories about me she declared watching him closely  tavernake drew a little away from her but seated himself on the sofa which she had indicated he took up as much room as possible and to his relief she did not persist in her first intention which was obviously to seat herself beside him  your sister has told me nothing about you whatsoever he said deliberately at the same time she asked me not to give you her address  we will talk about that presently she interrupted in the first place tell me why you have left your place  mr dowling discovered he told her in a matteroffact tone that i had been doing some business on my own account he was quite right to disapprove i have not been back to the office since he found it out  what sort of business she asked  the business of the firm is to buy property in undeveloped districts and sell it for building estate he explained i have been very successful hitherto in finding sites for their operations a short time ago i discovered one so good that i invested all my own savings in buying certain lots and have an option upon the whole mr dowling found it out and dismissed me  but it seems most unfair she declared  not at all he answered in mr dowlings place i should have done the same thing every one with his way in life to make must look out for himself strictly speaking what i did was wrong i wish however that i had done it before one must think of ones self first  and now she inquired what are you going to do now  i am going to find a capitalist or float a company to buy the rest of the site he announced after that we must see about building there is no hurry about that though the first thing is to secure the site  how much money does it require  about twelve thousand pounds he told her  it seems very little she murmured  the need for money comes afterwards he explained we want to drain and plan and build without mortgages as soon as we are sure of the site one can think of that my option only extends for a week or so  do you really think that it is a good speculation she asked  i do not think about such matters he answered drily i know  she leaned back in her chair watching him for several secondsadmiring him as a matter of fact the profound conviction of his words was almost inspiring in her presence and she knew that she was a very beautiful woman he appeared notwithstanding his absence of any knowledge of her sex and his lack of social status unmoved wholly undisturbed he sat there in perfect naturalness it did not seem to him even unaccountable that she should be interested in his concerns he was not conceited or aggressive in any way his complete selfconfidence lacked any militant impulse he washimself impervious to surroundings however unusual  why should i not be your capitalist she inquired slowly  have you as much as twelve thousand pounds that you want to invest he asked incredulously  she rose to her feet and moved across to her desk he sat quite still watching her without any apparent curiosity she unlocked a drawer and returned to him with a bankbook in her hand  add that up she directed and tell me how much i have  he drew a lead pencil from his pocket and quickly added up the total  if you have not given any cheques since this was made up he said calmly you have a credit balance of thirteen thousand one hundred and eighteen pounds nine shillings and fourpence it is very foolish of you to keep so much money on current account you are absolutely losing about eight pounds a week  she smiled  it is foolish of me i suppose she admitted but i have no one to advise me just now my father knows no more about money than a child and i have just had quite a large amount paid to me in cash i only wish we could get beatrice to share some of this mr tavernake  he made no remark to all appearance he had never heard of her sister she came and sat down by his side again  will you have me for a partner mr tavernake she whispered  then indeed for a moment the impassivity of his features relaxed he was frankly amazed  you cannot mean this he declared you know nothing about the value of the property nothing about the affair at all it is quite impossible  i know what you have told me she said is not that enough you are sure that it will make money and you have just told me how foolish i am to keep so much money in my bank very well then i give it to you to invest you must pay me quite a good deal of interest  but you know nothing about me he protested nothing about the property  one must trust somebody she replied why shouldnt i trust you  he was nonplussed this woman seemed to have an answer for everything besides when once he had got over the unexpectedness of the thing it was of course a wonderful stroke of fortune for him then came a whole rush of thoughts a glow which he thrust back sternly it would mean seeing her often it would mean coming here to her rooms it would mean perhaps that she might come to look upon him as a friend he set his teeth hard this was folly  have you any idea about terms he inquired  she laughed softly  my dear friend she said why do you ask me such a question you know quite well that i am not competent to discuss terms with you listen you are engaged in a speculation to carry out which you want the loan of twelve thousand pounds draw up a paper in which you state what my share will be of the profits what interest i shall get for my money and give particulars of the property then i will take it to my solicitor if you insist upon it although i am willing to accept what you think is fair  you must take it to a solicitor of course he answered thoughtfully i may as well tell you at once however that he will probably advise you against investing it in such a way  that will make no difference at all she declared solicitors hate all investments i know except their horrid mortgages there are only two conditions that i shall make  what are they he asked  the first is that you must not say a word of this to my sister  tavernake frowned  that is a little difficult he remarked it happens that your sister knows something about the estate and my plans  there is no need to tell her the name of your partner elizabeth said i want this to be our secret entirely yours and mine  her hand fell upon his he gripped the sides of his chair again he was conscious of this bewildering incomprehensible sensation  and the other condition he demanded hoarsely  that you come sometimes and tell me how things are going on  come here he repeated  she nodded  please i am very lonely i shall look forward to your visits  tavernake rose slowly to his feet he held out his handshe knew better than to attempt to keep him he made a speech which was for him gallant but while he made it he looked into her eyes with a directness to which she was indeed unaccustomed  i shall come he said i should have wanted to come anyhow  then he turned abruptly away and left the room it was the first speech of its sort which he had ever made in his life     chapter xii tavernake blunders   tavernake felt that he had indeed wandered into an alien world as he took his place the following evening among the little crowd of people who were waiting outside the stagedoor of the atlas theatre these were surroundings to which he was totally unaccustomed two very handsome motorcars were drawn up against the curb and behind them a string of electric broughams and taxicabs proving conclusively that the young ladies of the atlas theatre were popular in other than purely theatrical circles  the handful of young men by whom tavernake was surrounded were of a genus unknown to him they were all dressed exactly alike they all seemed to breathe the same atmosphere to exhibit the same indifference towards the other loungers one or two more privileged passed in through the stagedoor and disappeared tavernake contented himself with standing on the edge of the curbstone his hands thrust into the pockets of his dark overcoat his bowler hat which was not quite the correct shape slightly on the back of his head his serious stolid face illuminated by the gleam from a neighboring gas lamp  presently people began to emerge from the door first of all the musicians and a little stream of stage hands  then a girls hat appeared in the doorway and the first of the atlas young ladies came out to be claimed at once by her escort very soon afterwards beatrice arrived she recognized tavernake at once and crossed over to him  well she asked  you looked very nice he said slowly as he led the way down the street of course i knew about your singing but everything elseseemed such a surprise  for instance  why i mean your dancing he went on and somehow or other you looked different on the stage  she shook her head  different wont do for me she persisted i must have something more specific  well then you looked much prettier than i thought you were tavernake declared solemnly you looked exceedingly nice  you really thought so she asked a little doubtfully  i really thought so i thought you looked much nicer than any of the others  she squeezed his arm affectionately  dear leonard she said its so nice to have you think so do you know mr grier actually asked me out to supper  what impertinence tavernake muttered  beatrice threw her head back and laughed  my dear brother she protested it was a tremendous compliment you must remember that it was entirely through him too that i got the engagement four pounds a week i am going to have just think of it  four pounds a week is all very well tavernake admitted it seems a great deal of money to earn like that but i dont think you ought to go out to supper with any one whom you know so slightly  dear prig you know you are a shocking prig leonard  am i he answered without offence and with the air of one seriously considering the subject  of course you are how could you help it living the sort of life youve led all your days never mind i like you for it i dont know whether i want to go out to supper with anybodyi really havent decided yetbut if i did it would certainly be better for me to go with mr grier because he can do me no end of good at the theatre if he likes  tavernake was silent for several moments he was conscious of feeling something which he did not altogether understand he only knew that it involved a strong and unreasonable dislike to mr grier then he remembered that he was her brother that he had the right to speak with authority  i hope that you will not go out to supper with any one he said  she began to laugh but checked herself  well she remarked that sounds very terrible shall we take a bus to tell you the truth i am dying of hunger we rehearsed for two hours before the performance and i ate nothing but a sandwichi was so excited  tavernake hesitated a momenthe certainly was not himself this evening  would you like to have some supper at a restaurant he asked before we go home  i should love it she declared taking his arm as they passed through a stream of people to tell you the truth i was so hoping that you would propose it  i think tavernake said deliberately that there is a place a little way along here  they pushed their way down the strand and entered a restaurant which tavernake knew only by name a small table was found for them and beatrice looked about with delight  isnt this jolly she exclaimed taking off her gloves why there are five or six of the girls from the theatre here already there are two see at the corner table and the fairhaired girlshe is just behind me in the chorus  tavernake glanced around the young women whom she pointed out were all escorted by men who were scrupulously attired in evening dress she seemed to read his thoughts as she laughed at him  you stupid boy she said you dont suppose that i want to be like them do you there are lots of things its delightful to look on at and thats all isnt this fish good i love this place  tavernake looked around him with an interest which he took no pains to conceal certainly the little groups of people by whom they were surrounded on every side had the air of finding some zest in life which up to the present at any rate had escaped him they came streaming in finding friends everywhere laughing and talking insisting upon tables in impossible places calling out greetings to acquaintances across the room chaffing the maitre dhotel who was hastening from table to table the gathering babel of voices was mingled every now and then with the popping of corks and behind it all were the soft strains of a very seductive little band perched up in the balcony tavernake felt the color mounting into his cheeks it was true there was something here which was new to him  beatrice he asked her suddenly have you ever drunk champagne  she laughed at him  often my dear brother she answered why  i never have he confessed we are going to have some now  she would have checked him but he had summoned a waiter imperiously and given his order  my dear leonard she protested this is shocking extravagance  is it he replied i dont care tell me about the theatre were they kind to you there will you be able to keep your place  the girls were all much nicer than i expected she told him and the musical director said that my voice was much too good for the chorus oh i do hope that they will keep me  they would be idiots if they didnt he declared vigorously you sing better and you dance more gracefully and to me you seemed much prettier than any one else there  she laughed into his eyes  my dear brother she exclaimed your education is progressing indeed it is positively the first evening i have ever heard you attempt to make pretty speeches and you are quite an adept already  i dont know about that he protested i suppose it never occurred to me before that you were goodlooking he added examining her critically or i dare say i should have told you so you see one doesnt notice these things in an ordinary way lots of other people must have told you so though  i was never spoilt with compliments she said you see i had a beautiful sister  the words seemed to have escaped her unconsciously almost as they passed her lips her expression changed she shivered as though reminded of something unpleasant tavernake however noticed nothing for the greater part of the day he had been sedulously fighting against a new and unaccustomed state of mind he had found his thoughts slipping away time after time until he had had to set his teeth and use all his will power to keep his attention concentrated upon his work and now once more they had escaped again he felt the strange stir in his blood the slight flush on his cheek grew suddenly deeper he looked past the girl opposite to him out of the restaurant across the street into that little sittingroom in the milan court it was elizabeth who was there in front of him again he heard her voice saw the turn of her head the slow delightful curve of the lips the eyes that looked into his and spoke to him the first strange whispers of a new language his heart gave a quick throb he was for the moment transformed a prisoner no longer a different person indeed from the stolid wellbehaved young man who found himself for the first time in his life in these unaccustomed surroundings then beatrice leaned towards him her voice brought him back to the presentnot alas the voice which at that moment he would have given so much to have heard  tonight she murmured i feel as though we were at the beginning of new things we must drink a toast  tavernake filled her glass and his own  luck to you in your new profession he said  and here is one after your own heart you most curious of men she exclaimed a few seconds later to the undiscovered in life  he drained his glass and set it down empty  the undiscovered he muttered looking around it is a very good toast beatrice there are many things of which one might remain ignorant all ones life if one relied wholly upon ones own perceptions  i believe she agreed that if i had not appeared you were in great danger of becoming narrow  i am sure of it he answered but you see you came  she was thoughtful for a moment  this reminds me just a little of that first dreary feast of ours she said you knew what it was like then to feed a genuinely starving girl and i was miserable leonard it didnt seem to me that there was any other end save one  youve got over all that nonsense he asked anxiously  yes i suppose so she answered you see ive started life again and one gets stronger but there are times even now she added when i am afraid  the mirth had suddenly died from her face she looked older tired and careworn the shadows were back under her eyes she glanced around almost timorously he filled her glass  that is foolishness he said nothing nor anybody can harm you now  some note in his voice attracted her attention strong and square with hard forceful face he sat wholly at his ease among these unfamiliar surroundings a very tower of refuge she felt to the weak his face was not strikingly intellectualshe was not sure now about his mouthbut one seemed to feel that dogged nature the tireless pains by which he would pursue any aim dear to him the shadows passed away from her mind what was dead was gone it was not reasonable that she should be haunted all her days by the ghosts of other peoples sins the atmosphere of the place the atmosphere of the last few hours found its way again into her blood after all she was young the music was sweet her pulses were throbbing to the tune of this new life she drank her wine and laughed her head beating time to the music  we have been sad long enough she declared you and i my dear serious brother will embark in earnest now upon the paths of frivolity tell me how did things go today  it flashed into his mind that he had great news but that it was not for her about that matter there was still doubt in his mind but he could not speak of it  i have had an offer he said guardedly i cannot say much about it at present for nothing is certain but i am sure that i shall be able to raise the money somehow  his tone was calm and confident there was no selfassurance or bluster about it and yet it was convincing she looked at him curiously  you are a very positive person leonard she remarked you must have great faith in yourself i think  he considered the question for a moment  perhaps i have he admitted i do not think that there is any other way to succeed  the atmosphere of the place was becoming now almost languorous the band had ceased to play little parties of men and women were standing about bidding one another goodnight the lamps had been lowered and in the gloom the voices and laughter seemed to have become lower and more insinuating the lights in the eyes of the women as they passed down the room on their way out softer and more irresistible  i suppose we must go she said reluctantly  tavernake paid his bill and they turned into the street she took his arm and they turned westward even out here the atmosphere of the restaurant appeared to have found its way the soberness of life its harder and more practical side was for the moment obscured it was not the daytime crowd this whose footsteps pressed the pavements the careworn faces of the moneyseekers had vanished the men and women to whom life was something of a struggle had sought their homesresting perhaps before they took up their labors again every moment taxicabs and motorcars whirled by flashing upon the night a momentary impression of men in evening dress of women in soft garments with jewels in their hair the spirit of pleasure seemed to have crept into the atmosphere even the poorer people whom they passed in the street were laughing or singing  tavernake stopped short  tonight he declared is not the night for omnibuses we are going to have a taxicab i know that you are tired  i should love it she admitted  they hailed one and drove off beatrice leaned back among the cushions and closed her eyes her ungloved hand rested almost caressingly upon his he leaned forward there were new things in the worldhe was sure of it now sure though they were coming to him through the mists coming to him so vaguely that even while he obeyed he did not understand her full soft lips were slightly parted her heavilyfringed eyelids closed her deep brown hair which had escaped bounds a little drooping over her ear his fingers suddenly clasped hers tightly  beatrice he whispered  she sat up with a start her eyes questioning his the breath coming quickly through her parted lips  once you asked me to kiss you beatrice he said tonighti am going to  she made no attempt to repulse him he took her in his arms and kissed her even in that moment he knew that he had made a mistake nevertheless he kissed her again and again crushing her lips against his  please let me go leonard she begged at last  he obeyed at once he understood quite well that some strange thing had happened it seemed to him during those next few minutes that everything which had passed that night was a dream that this vivid picture of a life more intense making larger demands upon the senses than anything he had yet experienced was a mirage a thing which would live only in his memory a life in which he could never take any part he had blundered he had come into a new world and he had blundered a sense of guilt was upon him he had a sudden wild desire to cry out that it was elizabeth whom he had kissed beatrice was sitting upright in her place her head turned a little away from him he felt that she was expecting him to speakthat there were inevitable words which he should say his silence was a confession he would have lied but the seal was upon his lips so the moment passed and tavernake had taken another step forward towards his destiny   as he helped her out of the cab her fingers tightened for a moment upon his hand she patted it gently as she passed out before him into the house leaving the door open when he had paid the cabman and followed she had disappeared he looked into the sittingroom it was empty overhead he could hear her footsteps as she ascended to her room     chapter xiii an evening call   in the morning when he left for the city she was not down when he came home in the evening she was gone without removing his hat or overcoat he took the letter which he found propped up on the mantelpiece and addressed to him to the window and read it  dear brother leonardit wasnt your fault and i dont think it was mine if either of us is to blame it is certainly i for though you are such a clever and ambitious young person you really know very little indeed of the worldnot so much i think as i do i am going to stay for a few nights at any rate with one of the girls at the theatre who i know wants some one to share her tiny flat with her afterwards i shall see  dont throw this letter in the fire and dont think me ungrateful i shall never forget what you did for me how could i  i will send you my address as soon as i am sure of it or you can always write me to the theatre                  goodbye dear leonard                                         your sister beatrice  tavernake looked from the sheet of notepaper out across the gray square he knew that he was very angry angry though he deliberately folded the letter up and placed it in his pocket angry though he took off his overcoat and hung it up with his usual care but his anger was with himself he had blundered badly this episode of his life was one which he had better forget it was absolutely out of harmony with all his ideas he told himself that he was glad beatrice was gone housekeeping with an imaginary sister in this practical world was an absurdity sooner or later it must have come to an end better now before it had gone too farbetter now much better all the same he knew that he was going to be very lonely  he rang the bell for the woman who waited upon them and whom he seldom saw for beatrice herself had supplied their immediate wants he found some dinner ready which he ate with absolute unconsciousness then he threw himself fiercely into his work it was all very well for the first hour or so but as ten oclock grew near he began to find a curious difficulty in keeping his attention fixed upon those calculations the matter of average rentals percentage upon capitalthings which but yesterday he had found fascinatingseemed suddenly irksome he could fix his attention upon nothing at last he pushed his papers away put on his hat and coat and walked into the street  at the milan court the hallporter received his inquiry for elizabeth with an air of faint but wellbred surprise tavernake in those days was a person exceedingly difficult to place his clothes so obviously denoted the station in life which he really occupied while the slight imperiousness of his manner his absolute freedom from any sort of nervousness or awkwardness seemed to bespeak a consideration which those who had to deal with him as a stranger found sometimes a little puzzling  mrs wenham gardner is in her rooms i believe sir the man said if you will wait for a moment i will inquire  he disappeared into his office thrusting his head out a moment or two later with the telephone receiver still in his hand  mrs gardner would like the name again sir please he remarked  tavernake repeated it firmly  you might say he added that i shall not detain her for more than a few minutes  the man disappeared once more when he returned he indicated the lift to tavernake  if you will go up to the fifth floor sir he said mrs gardner will see you  tavernake found his courage almost leaving him as he knocked at the door of her rooms her french maid ushered him into the little sittingroom where to his dismay he found three men one sitting on the table the other two in easychairs elizabeth in a dress of pale blue satin was standing before the mirror she turned round as tavernake entered  mr tavernake shall decide she exclaimed waving her hand to him mr tavernake there is a difference of opinion about my earrings major post hereshe indicated a distinguishedlooking elderly gentleman with carefully trimmed beard and moustache and an eyeglass attached to a thin band of black ribbonmajor post wants me to wear turquoises i prefer my pearls mr crease half agrees with me but as he never agrees with any one on principle he hates to say so mr faulkes is wavering you shall decide you i know are one of those people who never waver  i should wear the pearls tavernake said  elizabeth made them a little courtesy  you see my dear friends she declared you have to come to england after all to find a man who knows his own mind and speaks it without fear the pearls it shall be  it may be decision crease drawled speaking with a slight american accent or it may be gallantry mr tavernake knew your own choice  the last word as usual she sighed now if you good people will kindly go on downstairs i will join you in a few minutes mr tavernake is my man of business and i am sure he has something to say to me  she dismissed them all pleasantly as soon as the door was closed she turned to tavernake her manner seemed to become a shade less gracious  well  i dont know why i came tavernake confessed bluntly i was restless and i wanted to see you  she looked at him for a moment and then she laughed tavernake felt a sense of relief at least she was not angry  oh you strangest of mortals she exclaimed holding out her hands well you see mein one of my most becoming gowns too what do you think of the fit  she swept round and faced him again with an expectant look tavernake who knew nothing of womens fashions still realized the superbness of that one unbroken line  i cant think how you can move a step in it he said but you look  he paused it was as though he had lost his breath then he set his teeth and finished  you look beautiful he declared i suppose you know that i suppose theyve all been telling you so  she shook her head  they havent all your courage dear briton she remarked and if they did tell me so i am not sure that i should be convinced you see most of my friends have lived so long and lived so quickly that they have learned to play with words until one never knows whether the things they speak come from their hearts with you it is different  yes tavernake admitted with me it is different  she glanced at the clock  well she said you have seen me and i am glad to have seen you and you may kiss my fingers if you like and then you must run away i am engaged to have supper with my friends downstairs  he raised her fingers clumsily enough to his lips and kept them there for a moment when he let them go she wrung them as though in pain and looked at him she turned abruptly away in a sense she was disappointed after all he was an easy victim  elise she called out my cloak  her maid came hurrying from the next room elizabeth turned towards her holding out her shoulders she nodded to tavernake  you know the way down mr tavernake i shall see you again soon shant i goodnight  she scarcely glanced at him as she sent him away yet tavernake walked on air     chapter xiv a warning from mr pritchard   tavernake hesitated for a moment under the portico of the milan court looking out at the rain which had suddenly commenced to descend he scarcely noticed that he had a companion until the man who was standing by his side addressed him  say your name is tavernake isnt it  tavernake who had been on the point of striding away turned sharply around the man who had spoken to him was wearing morning clothes of dark gray tweed and a soft homburg hat his complexion was a little sallow and he was cleanshaven except for a slight black moustache he was smoking a black cigar and his accent was transatlantic something about his appearance struck tavernake as being vaguely familiar but he could not at first recall where he had seen him before  that is my name certainly tavernake admitted  i am going to ask you a somewhat impertinent question his neighbor remarked  i suppose you can ask it tavernake rejoined i am not obliged to answer am i  the man smiled  come he said thats honest at any rate are you in a hurry for a few minutes  i am in no particular hurry tavernake answered what do you want  a few nights ago the stranger continued lowering his voice a little i met you with a young lady whose appearance for some reason which we neednt go into interested me tonight i happened to overhear you inquiring only a few minutes ago for the sister of the same young lady  what you heard doesnt concern me in the least tavernake retorted i should say that you had no business to listen  his companion smiled  well he declared i have always heard a good deal about british frankness and it seems to me that im getting some anyway ill tell you where i come in i am interested in mrs wenham gardner i am interested also in her sister whom i think you knowmiss beatrice franklin not miss tavernake  tavernake made no immediate reply the man was an american without a doubt perhaps he knew something of beatrice perhaps this was one of the friends of that former life concerning which she had told him nothing  you are not by any chance proposing tavernake said at last to discuss either of these ladies with me i do not know you or what your business may be in any case i am going now  the other laid his hand on tavernakes shoulder  youll be soaked to the skin he protested i want you to come into the smokingroom here with me for a few minutes we will have a drink together and a little conversation if you dont mind  but i do mind tavernake declared i dont know who you are and i dont want to know you and i am not going to talk about mrs gardner or any other lady of my acquaintance with strangers goodnight  one moment please mr tavernake  tavernake hesitated there was something curiously compelling in the others smooth distinct voice  id like you to take this card he said i told you my name before but i expect youve forgotten itpritchardsam pritchard ever heard of me before  never  not to have heard of me in the united states the other continued with a grim smile would be a tribute to your respectability most of the crooks who find their way over here know of sam pritchard i am a detective and i come from new york  tavernake turned and looked the man over there was something convincing about his tone and appearance it did not occur to him to doubt for a moment a word of this strangers story  you havent anything against heragainst either of them he asked quickly  nothing directly the detective answered all the same you have been calling upon mrs wenham gardner this evening and if you are a friend of hers i think that you had better come along with me and have that talk  i will come tavernake agreed but i come as a listener remember that i have nothing to tell you so far as you are concerned i do not know either of those ladies  pritchard smiled  well he said i guess well let it go at that all the same if you dont mind well talk come this way and well get to the smokingroom through the hotel its under cover  tavernake moved restlessly in his chair  what the devil is all this talk about crooks he exclaimed impatiently i didnt come here to listen to this sort of thing i am not sure that i believe a word of what you say  why should you pritchard remarked without proof look here  he drew a leather case from his pocket and spread it out there were a dozen photographs there of men in prison attire the detective pointed to one and with a little shiver tavernake recognized the face of the man who had been sitting at the right hand of elizabeth  you dont mean to say he faltered that mrs gardner  the detective folded up his case and replaced it in his pocket  no he said we havent any photographs of your lady friend there nor of her sister and yet it may not be so far off  if you are trying to fasten anything upon those ladies tavernake began threateningly  the detective laughed and patted him on the shoulder  it isnt my business to try and fasten things upon any one he interrupted at the same time you seem to be a friend of mrs wenham gardner and it is just as well that some one should warn her  warn her of what tavernake asked  the detective looked at his cigar meditatively  make her understand that there is trouble ahead he replied  tavernake sipped his whiskey and soda and lit a cigarette then he turned in his chair and looked thoughtfully at his companion pritchard was a strikinglooking man with hard cleancut featuresa man of determination  mr pritchard i am a clerk in an estate office my people were workpeople and i am trying to better myself in the world i havent learned how to beat about a subject but i have learned a little of the world and i know that people such as you are not in the habit of doing things without a reason why the devil have you brought me in here to talk about mrs gardner and her sister if youve anything to say why dont you go to mrs gardner herself and say it why do you come and talk to strangers about their affairs i am here listening to you but i tell you straight i dont like it  pritchard nodded  say i am not sure that i dont like that sort of talk he declared i know all about you young man youre in dowling  spences office and youve got to quit youve got an estate you want financing miss beatrice franklin was living under your roofas your sister i understanduntil yesterday and mrs gardner for some reason of her own seems to be doing her best to add you to the list of her admirers i am not sure what it all means but i could make a pretty good guess heres my point though youre right i didnt bring you here for your health i brought you here because you can do me a service and yourself one at the same time and youll be doing no one any harm nobody you care about anyway i have no grudge against miss beatrice id just as soon she kept out of the trouble thats coming  what is this service tavernake asked  pritchard for the moment evaded the point  i dare say you can understand mr tavernake he said that in my profession one has to sometimes go a long way round to get a man or a woman just where you want them now we merely glanced at that table as we came in and i can tell you this for gospel truththere isnt one of that crowd that i couldnt if i liked haul back to new york on some charge or another you wonder why i dont do it ill tell you its because i am waitingwaiting until i can bring home something more serious something that will keep them out of the way for just as long as possible do you follow me mr tavernake  i suppose i do tavernake answered doubtfully you are only talking of the men of course  pritchard smiled  my young friend he agreed i am only talking of the men at the same time i guess im not betraying any confidence or telling you anything that mrs wenham gardner doesnt know herself when i say that shes doing her best to qualify for a similar position  you mean that she is doing something against the law tavernake exclaimed indignantly i dont believe it for a moment if she is associating with these people its because she doesnt know who they are  pritchard flicked the ash from his cigar  well he said every man has a right to his own opinions and for my part i like to hear any one stick up for his friends it makes no odds to me however here are a few facts i am going to bring before you four months ago one of the turns at a vaudeville show down broadway consisted of a performance by a professor franklin and his two daughters elizabeth and beatrice the professor hypnotized told fortunes felt heads and the usual rigmarole beatrice sang elizabeth danced people came to see the show not because it was any good but because the girls even in new york were beautiful  a musichall in new york tavernake muttered  the detective nodded  among the young bloods of the city he continued were two brothers as much alike as twins although they arent twins whose names were wenham and jerry gardner theres nothing in fast life which those young men havent tried between them i should say they represented everything that was known of debauchery and dissipation the eldest cant be more than twentyseven today but if you were to see them in the morning either of them before they had been massaged and galvanized into life youd think they were little old men with just strength enough left to crawl about well to cut a long story short both of them fell in love with elizabeth  brutes tavernake interjected  i guess they found miss elizabeth a pretty tough nut to crack the detective went on anyhow you know what her price was from her name which is hers right enough wenham who was a year younger than his brother was the first to bid it three months ago mr and mrs wenham gardner miss beatrice and the devoted father left new york in the lusitania and came to london  where is this wenham gardner then tavernake demanded  pritchard took his cigar case from his pocket and selected another cigar  say thats where you strike the nail right on the head he remarked where is this wenham gardner  i dont mind telling you mr tavernake that to discover his whereabouts is exactly what i am over on this side for i have a commission from the family to find out and a blank cheque to do it with  do you mean that he has disappeared then asked tavernake  off the face of the earth sir pritchard replied something like two months ago the young married couple with miss beatrice started for a holiday tour somewhere down in the west of england a few days after they started miss beatrice comes back to london alone she goes to a boardinghouse is practically penniless but she has shaken her sisterhas i believe never spoken with her since a little later elizabeth alone turns up in london she has plenty of money more money than she has ever had the control of before in her life but no husband  so far i dont see anything remarkable about that tavernake interposed  that may or may not be pritchard answered drily this creature wenham gardneri hate to call him a manwas her abject slaveup till the time they reached london at any rate he would never have quit of his own accord he stopped quite suddenly communicating with all his friends none of their cables even were answered  why dont you go and ask mrs gardner where he is tavernake demanded bluntly  i have already pritchard declared taken that liberty with tears in her eyes she assured me that after some slight quarrel in which she admits that she was the one to blame her husband walked out of the house where they were staying and she has not seen him since she was quite ready with all the particulars and even implored me to help find him  i cannot imagine tavernake said why any one should disbelieve her  the detective smiled  there are a few little outside circumstances he remarked looking at the ash of his cigar in the first place how do you suppose that this young wenham gardner spent the last week of his stay in new york  how should i know tavernake replied impatiently  by realizing every cent of his property on which he could lay his hands the detective continued it isnt at any time an easy business and the gardner interest is spread out in many directions but he must have sailed with something like forty thousand pounds in hard cash a suspicious person might presume that that forty thousand pounds has found its way to the stronger of the combination  anything else tavernake asked  i wont worry you much more the detective answered there are a few other circumstances which seem to need explanation but they can wait there is one serious one however and that is where you come in  indeed tavernake remarked i was hoping you would come to that soon  the two sisters beatrice and elizabeth have been together ever since we can learn anything of their history those people who dont understand the disappearance of wenham gardner would like to know why they quarreled and parted why beatrice is keeping away from her sister in this strange manner i personally too should like to know from miss beatrice when she last saw wenham gardner alive  you want me to ask miss beatrice these things tavernake demanded  it might come better from you pritchard admitted i have written her to the theatre but naturally she has not replied  tavernake looked curiously at his companion  do you really suppose he asked that even granted there were any unusual circumstances in connection with that quarreldo you seriously suppose that beatrice would give her sister away  the detective sighed  no doubt mr tavernake he said these young ladies are friends of yours and perhaps for that reason you are a little prejudiced in their favor their whole bringingup and associations however have certainly not been of a strict order i cannot help thinking that persuasion might be brought to bear upon miss beatrice that it might be pointed out to her that a true story is the safest  well if youve finished tavernake declared id like to tell you what i think of your story i think its all dd silly nonsense this wenham gardner by your own saying was half mad there was a quarrel and hes gone off to paris or somewhere as to your suggestions about mrs gardner i think theyre infamous  pritchard was unmoved by his companions warmth  why thats all right mr tavernake he affirmed i can quite understand your feeling like that just at first you see ive been among crime and criminals all my days and i learn to look for a certain set of motives when a thing of this sort happens youve been brought up among honest folk who go the straightforward way about life and naturally you look at the same matter from a different point of view but you and i have got to talk this out i want you to understand that those very charming young ladies are not quite the class of young women whom you know anything about mind you i havent a word to say against miss beatrice i dare say shes as straight as they make em butyou must take another whiskey and soda mr tavernake now i insist upon it tim come right over here  mr pritchard seemed to have forgotten what he was talking about the room had been suddenly invaded the whole of the little supper party whose individual members he had pointed out to his companion came trooping into the room they were all apparently on the best of terms with themselves and they all seemed to make a point of absolutely ignoring pritchards presence elizabeth was the one exception she was carrying a tiny chinese spaniel under one arm with the fingers of her other hand she held a tortoiseshell mounted monocle to her eye and stared directly at the two men presently she came languidly across the room to them  dear me she said i had no idea that even your wide circle of acquaintances mr pritchard included my friend mr tavernake  the two men rose to their feet tavernake felt confused and angry it was as though he had been playing the traitor in listening even for a moment to these stories  mr pritchard introduced himself to me only a few minutes ago he declared he brought me in here and i have been listening to a lot of rubbish from him of which i dont believe a single word  she flashed a wonderful smile upon him  mr pritchard is so very censorious she murmured he takes such a very low view of human nature after all though i suppose we must not blame him i think that as men and women we do not exist to him we are simply the pegs by means of which he can climb a little higher in the esteem of his employers  pritchard took up his soft hat and stick  mrs gardner he said i will confess that i have been wasting my time with this young man you are a trifle severe upon me you may find and before long that i am your best friend  she laughed delightfully  dear mr pritchard she exclaimed it is a strange thought that if only i dared hope that some day it might come true  more unlikely things madam are happening every hour the detective remarked the worldour little corner of it at any rateis full of anomalies there might even come a time to any one of us three when liberty was more dangerous than the prison cell itself  he nodded carelessly to tavernake and with a bow to elizabeth turned and left the room elizabeth remained as though turned to stone looking after him as he descended the stairs  the man is a fool tavernake cried roughly  elizabeth shook her head and sighed  he is something far more ineffective she said he is just a little too clever     chapter xv general discontent   elizabeth did not at once rejoin her friends instead she sank on to the low settee close to where she had been standing and drew tavernake down to her side she waved her hand across at the others who were calling for her  in a moment dear people she said  then she leaned back among the cushions and laughed at her companion  tell me mr tavernake she asked dont you feel that you have stepped into a sort of modern arabian nights  why  oh i know mr pritchards weakness she continued he loves to throw a glamour around everything he says or does because he honors me by interesting himself in my concerns he has probably told you all sorts of wonderful things about me and my friends a very ingenious romancer mr pritchard you know confess now didnt he tell you some stories about us  she might have spared herself the trouble of beating about the bush there was no hesitation about tavernake  he said that your friends were every one of them criminals tavernake declared and he admitted that he was working hard at the present moment to discover that you were one too  she laughed softly but heartily  i wonder what was his object she remarked in taking you into his confidence  he happened to know tavernake explained that i was intimate with your sister he wanted me to ask beatrice a certain question  elizabeth laughed no more she looked steadfastly into his eyes  and that question  he wanted me to ask beatrice why she left you and hid herself in london  she tried to smile but not very successfully  according to his story tavernake continued you and beatrice and your husband were away together somewhere in the country something happened there something which resulted in the disappearance of your husband beatrice came back alone and has not been near you since soon afterwards you too came back alone mr gardner has not been seen or heard of  elizabeth was bending over her dog but even tavernake unobservant though he was could see that she was shaken  pritchard is a clever man generally she remarked diabolically clever why has he told you all this i wonder he must have known that you would probably repeat it to me why does he want to show me his hand  i have no idea tavernake replied these matters are all beyond me they do not concern me in any way i am not keeping you from your friends please send me away when you like  dont go just yet she begged sit with me for a moment cant you see she added whispering that i have had a shock sit with me i cant go back to those others just yet  tavernake did as he was bidden the woman at his side was still caressing the little animal she carried watching her however tavernake could see that her bosom was rising and falling quickly there was an unnatural pallor in her cheeks a terrified gleam in her eyes nevertheless these things passed in a very few seconds she was herself again  come she said it is not often that i give way the only time i am ever afraid is when there is something which i do not understand i do not understand mr pritchard tonight i know that he is my enemy i cannot imagine why he should talk to you he must have known that you would repeat all he said it is not like him tell me mr tavernake you have heard all sorts of things about me do you believe them do you believeits rather a horrible thing to ask isnt it she went on hurriedlydo you believe that i made away with my husband  you surely do not need to ask me that question tavernake answered fervently i should believe your word whatever you told me i should not believe that you could do anything wrong  her hand touched his for a moment and he was repaid  dont think too well of me she begged i dont want to disappoint you  some one pushed open the swing doors and she started nervously it was only a waiter who passed through into the bar  what i think of you tavernake said slowly nothing could alter but because i am stupid i suppose there is quite a good deal that i cannot understand i cannot understand for instance why they should suspect you of having anything to do with your husbands disappearance you can prove where you were when he left you  quite easily she answered only unfortunately no one seems to have seen him go he timed his departure so cunningly that he apparently vanished into thin air even then she continued but for one thing i dont suppose that any one would have had suspicions i dare say mr pritchard told you that before we left new york my husband sold out some of his property and brought it over to europe with him in cash we had both determined that we would live abroad and have nothing more to do with america it was not i who persuaded him to do this it made no difference to me if he had run away and left me the courts would have given me money if he had died and i had been a widow he would have left me his property but simply because there was all this money in our hands and because he disappeared his people and this man pritchard suspect me  it is wicked he muttered  she turned slowly towards him  mr tavernake she said do you know that you can help me very much indeed  i only wish i could he replied try me  cant you see she went on that the great thing against me is that beatrice left me suddenly when we were on that wretched expedition and came back alone she is in london i know quite close to me and still she hides pritchard asks himself why mr tavernake go and tell her what people are saying go and tell her everything that has happened let her understand that her keeping away is doing me a terrible injury beg her to come and let people see that we are reconciled and warn her too against pritchard will you do this for me  of course i will tavernake answered i will see her tomorrow  elizabeth drew a little sigh of relief  and youll let me know what she says she asked rising  i shall be only too glad to tavernake assured her  goodnight  she looked up into his face with a smile which had turned the heads of hardened stagers in new york no wonder that tavernake felt his heart beat against his ribs he took her hands and held them for a moment then he turned abruptly away  goodnight he said  he disappeared through the swing doors she strolled across the room to where her friends were sitting in a circle laughing and talking her father who had just come in and joined them gripped her by the arm as she sat down  what does it mean he demanded with shaking voice did you see that he was there with pritchardyour young manthat wretched estate agents clerk i tell you that pritchard was pumping him for all he was worth  my dear father she whispered coldly dont be melodramatic you give yourself away the whole time go to bed if you cant behave like a man  the lights had been turned low there was no one else in the room the little old gentleman with the eyeglass leaned forward  have you any notion my dear elizabeth he asked why our friend pritchard is so much in evidence just at present  not on account of you jimmy she answered nor of any one else here in fact the truth is he has conceived a violent admiration for mean admiration so pronounced indeed that he hates to let me out of his sight  they all laughed uproariously then walter crease the journalist leaned forwarda man with a long narrow face yellowstained fingers and hollow cheekbones he glanced around the room before he spoke and his voice sounded like a hoarse whisper  see here he said seems to me pritchard is getting mighty awkward he hasnt got his posse around him in this country anyway  there was a dead silence for several seconds then the little old gentleman nodded solemnly  i am a trifle tired of pritchard myself he admitted and he certainly knows too much he carries too much in his head to go around safely  the eyes of elizabeth were bright  he treats us like children she declared tonight he has told the whole of my affairs to a perfect stranger it is intolerable  the little party broke up soon after only walter crease and the man called jimmy post were left talking and they retired into the windowseat whispering together  tavernake with his hands thrust deep in his overcoat pockets left the hotel and strode along the strand some fancy seized him before he had gone many paces and turning abruptly to the left he descended to the embankment he made his way to the very seat upon which he had sat once before with beatrice with folded arms he leaned back in the corner looking out across the river at the curving line of lights at the black turgid waters the slowlymoving hulk of a barge on its way down the stream it was a new thing this for him to have to accuse himself of folly of weakness for the last few days he had moved in a mist of uncertainty setting his heel upon all reflection avoiding every issue tonight he could escape those accusing thoughts no longer tonight he was more than ever bitter with himself what folly was this which had sprung up in his lifefolly colossal unimaginable as unexpected as though it had fallen a thunderbolt from the skies what had happened to change him so completely  his thought traveled back to the boardinghouse it was there that the thing had begun before that night upon the roof the fingerposts which he had set up with such care and deliberation along the road which led towards his coveted goal had seemed to him to point with unfaltering directness towards everything in life worthy of consideration tonight they were only dreary phantasms marking time across a miserable plain perhaps after all there had been something in his nature some rebel thing intolerable yet to be reckoned with which had been first born of that fateful curiosity of his it had leapt up so suddenly sprung with such scanty notice into strenuous and insistent life yet what place had it there he must fight against it root it out with both hands what was this world of intrigue this criminal undesirable world to him his common sense forbade him altogether to dissociate elizabeth from her friends from her surroundings she was the secret of the pain which was tearing at his heartstrings of all the excitement the joy the passion which had swept like a full flood across the level way of his life which had set him drifting among the unknown seas yet it was beatrice who had brought this upon him if she had never left if he had not tasted the horrors of this new loneliness he might have been able to struggle on he missed her missed her diabolically the other things marvelous though they were had been more or less like a mirage this world of new emotions had spread like a silken mesh over all his thoughts over all his desires beatrice had been a tangible person restful delightful a real companion his one resource against this madness and now she was gone and he was powerless to get her back he turned his head he looked up the road along which he had torn that night with his arms around her she owed him her life and she had gone with all a mans inconsequence it seemed to him as he rose heavily to his feet and started homeward that she had repaid him with a certain amount of ingratitude that she had left him at the one moment in his life when he needed her most     chapter xvi an offer of marriage   the next afternoon at halfpast four tavernake was having tea with beatrice in the tiny flat which she was sharing with another girl off kingsway she opened the door to him herself and though she chattered ceaselessly it seemed to him that she was by no means at her ease she installed him in the only available chair an absurd little wicker thing many sizes too small for him and seated herself upon the hearthrug a few feet away  you have soon managed to find me out leonard she remarked  yes he answered i had to go to the stage doorkeeper for your address  he hadnt the slightest right to give it you she declared  tavernake shrugged his shoulders  i had to have it he said simply  the power of the purse again she laughed now that you are here i dont believe that you are a bit glad to see me are you  he did not answer for a moment he was thinking of that vigil upon the embankment of the long walk home of the battle with himself the continual striving to tear from his heart this new thing for which with a curious and most masculine inconsistency he persisted in holding her responsible  you know leonard she continued getting up abruptly and beginning to make the tea i believe that you are angry with me if you are all i can say is that you are a very foolish person i had to come away cant you see that  i cannot he answered stolidly  she sighed  you are not a reasonable person she declared i suppose it is because you have led such a queer life and had no womenfolk to look after you you dont understand it was absurd in a way that i should ever have called myself your sister that we should even have attempted such a ridiculous experiment but afterafter the other night  cant we forget that he interrupted  she raised her eyes and looked at him  can you she asked  there was a curious almost a pleading earnestness in her tone her eyes had something new to say something which though it failed to stir his blood made him vaguely uncomfortable nevertheless he answered her without hesitation  yes he replied i could forget it i will promise to forget it  it was unaccountable but he almost fancied that he saw this new thing pass from her face leaving her pale and tremulous she looked away again and busied herself with the teacaddy but the fingers which held the spoon were shaking a little  oh i suppose i could forget she said but it would be very difficult for either of us to behave as though it had never happened besides it really was an impossible situation you know she went on looking down into the teacaddy it is much better for me to be here with annie you can come and see me now and then and we can still be very good friends  tavernake was annoyed he said nothing and beatrice glancing up laughed at his gloomy expression  you certainly are she declared the most impossible the most primitive person i ever met london isnt arcadia you know and you are not my brother besides you were such an autocrat you didnt even like my going out to supper with mr grier  i hate the fellow tavernake admitted are you seeing much of him  he took us all out to supper last night she replied i thought it was very kind of him to ask me  kind indeed does he want to marry you tavernake demanded  she set down the teapot and again she laughed softly in her plain black gown very simple adorned only by the little white bow at her neck quakerlike and spotless with the added color in her cheeks too which seemed to have come there during the last few moments she was a very alluring person  he cant she declared he is married already  then there came to tavernake an inspiration an inspiration so wonderful that he gripped the sides of his chair and sat up here after all was the way out for him the way out from his garden of madness the way to escape from that mysterious paralyzing yoke whose burden was already heavy upon his shoulders in that swift vivid moment he saw something of the truth he saw himself losing all his virility the tool and plaything of this woman who had bewitched him a poor fond creature living only for the kind words and glances she might throw him at her pleasure in those few seconds he knew the true from the false without hesitation he gripped with all the colossal selfishness of his unthinking sex at the rope which was thrown to him  well then i do he said firmly will you marry me beatrice  she threw her head back and laughed laughed long and softly and tavernake simple and unversed in the ways of women believed that she was indeed amused  neither you nor any one else dear leonard she exclaimed  but i want you to he persisted i think that you will  there was coquetry now in the tantalizing look she flashed him  am i too then one of these things to be attained in your life she asked dear leonard you mustnt say it like that i dont like the look of your jaw it frightens me  there is nothing to be afraid of in marrying me he answered i should make you a very good husband some day you would be rich very rich indeed i am quite sure that i shall succeed if not at once very soon there is plenty of money to be made in the world if one perseveres  she had the air of trying to take him seriously  you sound quite convincing she admitted but i do wish that you would put all these thoughts out of your mind leonard it doesnt sound like you in the least remember what you told me that first night you assured me that women had not the slightest part in your life  i have changed he confessed i did not expect anything of the sort to happen but it has it would be foolish of me to deny it i have been all my life learning beatrice he continued with a sudden curious softness in his tone and yet somehow or other it seems to me that i never knew anything at all until lately there was no one to direct me no one to show me just what is worth while in life you have taught me a great deal you have taught me how little i know and there are things he went on solemnly of which i am afraid things which i do not begin even to understand cant you see how it is with me i am really very ignorant i want some one who understands i want you beatrice very badly  she patted the back of his hand caressingly  you mustnt talk like that leonard she said i shouldnt make you a good wife i am not going to marry any one  and why he asked  she shook her head  that is my secret she told him looking into the fire  you mean to say that you will never marry he persisted  oh i suppose i shall change like other women she answered just at present i feel like that  is it because your sisters marriage  she caught hold of both his hands her eyes were suddenly full of terror  you mustnt talk about elizabeth she begged you please mustnt talk about her promise that you wont  but i came here to talk about her he replied  beatrice for a moment said nothing then she threw down his hands and laughed once more as she flung herself back in her place it seemed to tavernake that he saw once more the girl who had stood upon the roof of the boardinghouse  you came to talk about elizabeth she exclaimed i forgot well go on what is it  your sister is in trouble  are you her confidant beatrice asked  i am not exactly that he admitted but she has asked me to come and see you  beatrice had suddenly grown hard her lips were set together even her attitude was uncompromising  say exactly what you have to say she told him i will not interrupt  it sounds foolish tavernake declared because i know so little but it seems that your sister is being annoyed by a man named pritchard an american detective she tells me that he suspects her of being concerned in some way with the disappearance of her husband one of his reasons is that you left her abruptly and went into hiding that you will not see or speak to her she wishes you to be reconciled  is that all beatrice asked  it is all he replied so long as you understand its significance if you go to see your sister or let her come to see you this man pritchard will have one of his causes for suspicion removed  so you came as elizabeths ambassador beatrice said half as though to herself well here is my answer i will not go to elizabeth if she finds out my whereabouts and comes here then i shall go away again and hide i shall never willingly exchange another word with her as long as i live  tavernake looked at her doubtfully  but she is your sister he explained  she is my sister beatrice repeated and yet what i have said to you i mean  there was a short silence tavernake felt unaccountably ill at ease something had sprung up between them which he did not understand he was swift to recognize however the note of absolute finality in her tone  i have given my message he declared i shall tell her what you say perhaps i had better go now  he half rose to his feet suddenly she lost control of herself  leonard leonard she cried dont you see that you are being very foolish indeed you have been good to me let me try and repay it a little elizabeth is my sister but listen what i say to you now i say in deadly earnest elizabeth has no heart she has no thought for other people she makes use of them and they count for no more to her than the figures that pass through ones dreams she has some sort of hateful gift beatrice continued and her voice shook and her eyes flashed some hateful gift of attracting people to her and making them do her bidding of spoiling their lives and throwing them away when they have ceased to be useful leonard you must not let her do this with you  he rose to his feet awkwardly very likely it was all true and yet what difference did it make  thank you he said  they stood for a moment hand in hand then they heard the sound of a key in the lock  heres annie coming back beatrice exclaimed  tavernake was introduced to miss annie legarde who thought he was a very strange person indeed because he did not fit in with any of the types of men young or old of whom she knew anything and as for tavernake he considered that miss annie legarde would have looked at least as well in a hat half the size and much better without the powder upon her face her clothes were obviously more expensive than beatrices but they were put on with less care and taste  beatrice came out on to the landing with him  so you wont marry me beatrice he said as she held out her hand  she looked at him for a moment and then turned away with a faint sob without even a word of farewell he watched her disappear and heard the door shut slowly he began to descend the stone steps there was something to him a little fateful about the closed door above the long yet easy descent into the street     chapter xvii the balcony at imanos   at six oclock that evening tavernake rang up the milan court and inquired for elizabeth there was a moment or twos delay and then he heard her reply even over the telephone wires even though he stood cramped and uncomfortable in that stuffy little telephone booth he felt the quick start of pleasure the thrill of something different in life which came to him always at the sound of her voice at the slightest suggestion of her presence  well my friend what fortune she asked him  none he answered i have done my best beatrice will not listen to me  she will not come and see me  she will not  elizabeth was silent for a moment when she spoke again there was a change in her tone  you have failed then  i did everything that could be done tavernake insisted eagerly i am quite sure that nothing anybody could say would move beatrice she is very decided indeed  i have another idea elizabeth remarked after a brief pause she will not come to me very well i must go to her you must take me there  i cannot do that tavernake answered  why not  beatrice has refused absolutely to permit me to tell you or any one else of her whereabouts he declared without her permission i cannot do it  do you mean that she asked  of course he answered uncomfortably  there was another silence when she spoke again her voice had changed for the second time tavernake felt his heart sink as he listened  very well she said i thought that you were my friend that you wished to help me  i do he replied but you would not have me break my word  you are breaking your word with me she told him  it is a different thing he insisted  you will not take me there she said once more  i cannot tavernake answered  very well goodbye  dont go he begged cant i see you somewhere for a few minutes this evening  i am afraid not elizabeth replied coolly  are you going out he persisted  i am going to the duke of yorks theatre with some friends she answered i am sorry you have disappointed me  she rang off and he turned away from the telephone booth into the street it seemed to him as he walked down the crowded thoroughfare that some reflection of his own selfcontempt was visible in the countenances of the men and women who were hurrying past him wherever he looked he was acutely conscious of it in his heart he felt the bitter sense of shame of a man who wilfully succumbs to weakness yet that night he made his efforts  for four hours he sat in his lonely rooms and worked then the unequal struggle was ended with a groan he caught up his hat and coat and left the house half an hour later he was among the little crowd of loiterers and footmen standing outside the doors of the duke of yorks theatre  it was still some time before the termination of the performance as the slow minutes dragged by he grew to hate himself to hate this new thing in his life which had torn down his everyday standards which had carried him off his feet in this strange and detestable fashion it was a dormant sense without a doubt which elizabeth had stirred into lifethe sense of sex quiescent in him so long chiefly through his perfect physical sanity perhaps too in some measure from his halfstarved imagination it was significant though that once aroused it burned with surprising and unwavering fidelity the whole world of women now were different creatures to him but they left him as utterly unmoved as in his unawakened days it was elizabeth only he wanted craved for fiercely with all this lateborn passion of mingled sentiment and desire he felt himself as he hung round there upon the pavement rubbing shoulders with the liveried servants the loafers and the passersby a thing to be despised he was like a whipped dog fawning back to his master yet if only he could persuade her to come with him if it were but for an hour if only she would sit opposite him in that wonderful little restaurant where the lights and the music the laughter and the wine were all outward symbols of this new life from before which her fingers seemed to have torn aside the curtains his heart beat with a fierce impatience he watched the thin stream of people who left before the play was over suburbanites mostly in a hurry for their trains very soon the whole audience followed commissionaires were busy with their whistles the servants eagerly looking right and left for their masters and then elizabeth she came out in the midst of halfadozen others brilliant in a wonderful cloak and dress of turquoise blue laughing with her friends to all appearance the gayest of the party tavernake stepped quickly forward but at that moment there was a crush and he could not advance she passed within a yard of him escorted by a couple of men and for a moment their eyes met she raised her eyebrows as though in surprise and her recognition was of the slightest she passed on and entered a waiting motorcar accompanied by the two men tavernake stood and looked after it she did not even glance round except for that little gesture of cold surprise she had ignored him tavernake scarcely knowing what he did turned slowly towards the strand  he was face to face now with a crisis before which he seemed powerless men were there in the world to be bullied cajoled or swept out of the way what did one do with a woman who was kind one moment and insolent the next who raised her eyebrows and passed on when he wanted her when he was there longing for her those old solid dreams of hiswealth power his name on great prospectuses a position in the worldthese things now appeared like the day fancies of a child he had seen his way towards them already he had felt his feet upon the rungs of the ladder which leads to material success this was something different something greater then a sense of despair chilled his heart he felt how ignorant how helpless he was he had not even studied the first textbook of life those very qualities which had served him so well before were hopeless here persistence beatrice had told him once only annoys a woman  he came to a standstill outside the entrance to the milan court and retraced his steps the thought of beatrice had brought something soothing with it he felt that he must see her see her at once he walked back along the strand and entered the restaurant where beatrice and he had had their memorable supper from the vestibule he could just see griers back as he stood talking to a waiter by the side of a round table in the middle of the room tavernake slowly withdrew and made his way upstairs there were one or two little tables there in the balcony hidden from the lower part of the room he seated himself at one handing his coat and hat mechanically to the waiter who came hurrying up  but monsieur the man explained with a deprecating gesture these tables are all taken  tavernake who kept an account book in which he registered even his car fares put five shillings in the mans hand  this one i will have he said firmly and sat down  the man looked at him and turned aside to speak to the head waiter they conversed together in whispers tavernake took no notice his jaw was set himself unseen he was gazing steadfastly at that table below the head waiter shrugged his shoulders and departed his other clients must be mollified there was a finality which was unanswerable about tavernakes methods  tavernake ate and drank what they brought to him ate and drank and suffered everything was as it had been that other nightthe popping of corks the soft music the laughter of women the pleasant luxurious sense of warmth and gayety pervading the whole place  it was all just the same but this time he sat outside and looked on beatrice was seated next grier and on her other side was a young man of the type which tavernake detested partly because it inspired him with a reluctant but insistent sense of inferiority the young man was handsome tall and thin his evening clothes fitted him perfectly his studs and links were of the latest mode his white tie arranged as though by the fingers of an artist and yet he was no tailors model a gentleman beyond a doubt tavernake decided watching grudgingly the courteous movement of his head listening sometimes to his wellbred but rather languid voice beatrice laughed often into his face she admired him of course how could she help it grier sat at her other side he too talked to her whenever he had the chance it was a new fever which tavernake was tasting a new fever burning in his blood he was jealous he hated the whole party below in imagination he saw elizabeth with her friends supping most likely in that other more resplendent restaurant only a few yards away he imagined her the centre of every attention without a doubt she was looking at her neighbor as she had looked at him tavernake bit his lip frowning if he had had it in his power in those black moments to have thrown a thunderbolt from his place he would have wrecked every table in the room he would have watched with joy the white startled faces of the revelers as they fled away into the night it was a new torture indescribable bitter indeed this curiosity of his of which he had spoken to beatrice as they had walked together down oxford street on that first evening was being satisfied with a vengeance he was learning of those other things of life he had sipped at the sweetness he was drinking the bitters  an altercation by his side distracted him again there was the head waiter and a protesting guest tavernake looked up and recognized professor franklin with his broadbrimmed hat in his hand the professor in fluent phraseology and a strong american accent was making himself decidedly disagreeable  you had better send for your manager right away young man he declared on tuesday night he brought me here himself and i engaged this table for the week no i tell you i wont have any other i guess my order was good enough you send for luigi right here you know who i am professor franklins my name from new york and if i say i mean to have a thing i expect to get it  for the first time he recognized tavernake and paused for a moment in his speech  have i got your table professor tavernake asked slowly  you have sir the professor answered i did not recognize you when i came in or i would have addressed you personally i have particular reasons for occupying a front table here every night this week  the thoughts began to crowd in upon tavernakes brain he hesitated  why not sit down with me he suggested  the professor acquiesced without a word the head waiter with a sigh of relief took his hat and overcoat and accepted his order tavernake leaned across the table  professor he said why do you insist upon sitting up here  the professor moved his head slowly downwards  my young friend i speak to you in confidence  in confidence tavernake repeated  i come here secretly the professor continued because it is the only chance i have of seeing a very dear relative of mine i am obliged to keep away from her just now but from here i can watch i can see that she is well  you mean your daughter beatrice tavernake said calmly  the professor trembled all over  you know he muttered  yes i know tavernake answered i have been able to be of some slight assistance to your daughter beatrice  the professor grasped his hand  yes yes he said elizabeth is very angry with you because you will not tell her where to find the little girl you are right mr tavernake you must never tell her  i dont intend it tavernake declared  say this is a great evening for me the professor went on eagerly i found out by accident myself i was at the bar and i saw her come in with a lot of others  why dont you go and speak to her tavernake asked  the professor shivered  there has been a disagreement he explained beatrice and elizabeth have quarreled mind you beatrice was right  then why dont you go to her instead of staying with elizabeth tavernake demanded bluntly  the professor temporarily collapsed he drank heavily of the whiskey and soda by his side and answered gloomily  my young friend he said beatrice when she left us was penniless mind you elizabeth is the one with brains it is elizabeth who has the money she has a strong will too she keeps me there whether i will or not she makes me do many thingsmany things surelywhich i hate but elizabeth has her way if i had gone with beatrice if i were to go to her now i should be only a burden upon her  you have no money then tavernake remarked  the professor shook his head sadly  speculations my young friend he replied speculations undertaken solely with the object of making a fortune for my children i have had money and lost it  cant you earn any tavernake asked beatrice doesnt seem extravagant  the professor regarded this outspoken young man with an air of hurt dignity  if you will forgive me he said i think that we will choose another subject of conversation  at any rate tavernake declared you must be fond of your daughter or you would not come here night after night just to look at her  the professor shook out a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his eyes  beatrice was always my favorite he announced solemnly but elizabethwell you cant get away from elizabeth he added leaning across the table to tell you the truth mr tavernake elizabeth terrifies me sometimes she is so bold i am afraid where her scheming may land us i would be happier with beatrice if only she had the means to satisfy my trifling wants  he turned to the waiter and ordered a pint of champagne  veuve clicquot 99 he instructed the man at my age he remarked with a sigh one has to be careful about these little matters the wrong brand of champagne means a sleepless night  tavernake looked at him in a puzzled way the professor was a riddle to him he represented no type which had come within the orbit of his experience with the arrival of the champagne the professor became almost eloquent he leaned forward gazing stealthily down at the round table  if i could tell you of that girls mother mr tavernake he said if i could tell you what her history our history has been it would seem to you so strange that you would probably regard me as a romancer no we have to carry our secrets with us  bythebye tavernake asked what are you a professor of  of the hidden sciences sir was the immediate reply phrenology was my earliest love since then i have studied in the east i have spent many years in a monastery in china i have gratified in every way my natural love of the occult i represent today those people of advanced thought who have traveled even in spirit for ever such a little distance across the line which divides the seen from the unseen the known from the infinite  he took a long draught of champagne tavernake gazed at him in blank amazement  i dont know much about science he said it is only lately that i have begun to realize how ignorant i really am your daughter has helped to teach me  the professor sighed heavily  a young woman of attainments sir he remarked of character too look at the way she carries her head that was a trick of her mothers  dont you mean to speak to her at all then tavernake asked  i dare not the professor replied i am naturally of a truthful disposition and if elizabeth were to ask me if i had spoken to her sister i should give myself away at once no i look on and that is all  tavernake drummed with his fingers upon the tablecloth something in the merriment of that little party downstairs had filled him with a very bitter feeling  you ought to go and claim her professor he declared look down at them now is that the best life for a girl the men are almost strangers to her and the girls are not fit for her to associate with she has no friends no relatives your daughter elizabeth can do without you very well she is strong enough to take care of herself  but my dear sir the professor objected beatrice could not support me  tavernake paid his bill without another word downstairs the lights had been lowered the party at the round table were already upon their feet  goodnight professor he said i am going to see the last of beatrice from the top of the stairs  the professor followed himthey stood there and watched her depart with annie legarde the two girls got into a taxicab together and tavernake breathed a sigh of relief a relief for which he was wholly unable to account when he saw that grier made no effort to follow them as soon as the taxi had rolled away they descended and passed into the street then the professor suddenly changed his tone  mr tavernake he said i know what you are thinking about me i am a weak old man who drinks too much and who wasnt born altogether honest i cant give up anything id be happier really happier on a crust with beatrice but i darent i simply darent try it i prefer the flesh pots with elizabeth and you despise me for it i dont blame you mr tavernake but listen  well tavernake interjected  the professors fingers gripped his arm  youve known beatrice longeryou dont know elizabeth very well but let me tell you this elizabeth is a very wonderful person i know something about character i know something about those hidden powers which men and women possessstrange powers which no one can understand powers which drag a man to a womans feet or which make him shiver when he passes another even in a crowd you see these things are a science with me mr tavernake but i dont pretend to understand everything all i know is that elizabeth is one of those people who can just do what she likes with men i am her father and i am her slave i tell myself that i would rather be with beatrice and i am as powerless to go as though i were bound with chains you are a young ignorant man mr tavernake you know nothing of life and i will give you a word of warning it is better for you that you keep away from over there  he raised one hand and pointed across the street towards the milan court with the other he once more gripped tavernakes arm  why she should take the trouble even to speak with you for a moment i do not know the professor continued but she does it has pleased her to talk with youwhy i cant imagineonly if i were you i would get away while there is yet time she is my daughter but she has no heart no pity i saw her smile at you i am sorry always for the man she smiles upon like that goodnight mr tavernake  the professor crossed the street tavernake watched him until he was out of sight then he felt an arm thrust through his  why this is what i call luck a familiar voice exclaimed mr tavernake youre the very man i was looking for     chapter xviii a midnight adventure   tavernake was not sociably inclined and took no pains to conceal the fact mr pritchard however was not easily to be shaken off  so youve been palling up to the old man eh he remarked in friendly fashion  i came across the professor unexpectedly tavernake answered coldly what do you want with me please i am on my way home  pritchard laughed softly to himself  say theres something about you britishers i cant help admiring he declared you are downright arent you  i suppose you think we are too clumsy to be anything else tavernake replied this is my bus coming goodnight  pritchards hand however tightened upon his companions arm  look here young man he said dont you be foolish im a valuable acquaintance for you if you only realized it come along across the street with me my club is on the terrace just below stroll along there with me and ill tell you something about the professor if you like  thank you tavernake answered i dont think i care about hearing gossip besides i think i know all there is to be known about him  did you give miss beatrice my message pritchard asked suddenly  if i did tavernake replied i have no answer for you  will you tell her this pritchard began  no i will tell her nothing tavernake interrupted you can look after your own affairs i have no interest in them and i dont want to have goodnight  pritchard laughed again but he did not relax his grasp upon the others arm  now mr tavernake he said it wont do for you to quarrel with me i shouldnt be surprised if you discovered that i am one of the most useful acquaintances you ever met in your life you neednt come into the club unless you like but walk as far as there with me when we get on to the terrace with closed houses on one side and a palisade upon the other i am going to say something to you  very well tavernake decided reluctantly i dont know what there is you can have to tell me but ill come as far as there at any rate  they crossed the strand and turned into adam street as they neared the further corner pritchard stepped from the pavement into the middle of the street and looked searchingly around  say youll excuse my being a little careful he remarked this is rather a lonely part for the middle of london and i have been followed for the last two days by people whose company i am not over keen about  followed what for tavernake demanded  oh the usual thing answered the detective with a shrug of the shoulders that company of crooks i showed you last night dont fancy having me around theyve a good many grudges up against sam pritchard i am not quite so safe over here as i should be in new york most of them are off to paris tomorrow thank heavens  and you tavernake asked are you going too  pritchard shook his head  if only those fools would believe it im not over here on their business at all i came over on a special commission this time as you know i have a word of warning for you mr tavernake i guess you wont like to hear it but youve got to  tavernake stopped short  i dont want your warnings he said angrily i dont want you interfering in my affairs  the detective smiled quietly then a new expression suddenly tightened his lips  never mind about that just now he exclaimed see here take this police whistle from my left hand quick and blow it for all that you are worth  it was characteristic of tavernake that he was prepared to obey without a seconds hesitation the opportunity however was denied him the events which followed came and passed like a thought a blow on his left wrist and the whistle fell into the road a dark figure had sprung up apparently from space a long arm was twined around pritchards neck bending him backwards there was a gleam of steel within a few inches of his throat and then tavernake saw a wonderful thing with a turn of his wrist pritchard suddenly seemed to lift the form of his assailant into the air tavernake caught a swift impression of a mans white face the head pointing to the street the legs twitching convulsively head over heels pritchard seemed to throw him while the knife clattered harmlessly into the roadway the man lay crumpled up and moaning before the door of one of the houses pritchard sprang after him the door had been cautiously opened and the man crawled through pritchard followed then the door closed and tavernake beat upon it in vain  for several secondsit seemed to tavernake much longerhe stood gazing at the door breathing heavily absolutely unable to collect his thoughts the whole affair had happened with such amazing celerity he could not bring himself to realize it to believe that it was pritchard who had been with him only a few seconds ago who in danger of his life had performed that marvelous trick of jiujutsu had followed his unknown assailant into that dark mysterious house from no single window of which was a single gleam of light visible tavernake had led an uneventful life of the passions which breed murder and the desire to kill he knew nothing he was dazed with the suddenness of it all how could such a thing happen in the midst of london in a thoroughfare only momentarily deserted at the further end of which indeed were many signs of life then the thought of that knife made him shiverblue glittering steel cutting the air like whipcord he remembered the look in the assassins facehorrible an epitome of the passions which seemed to reveal to him in that moment the existence of some other some unknown world about which he had neither read nor dreamed  the sound of footsteps came as an immense relief a man came round the corner smoking a cigarette and humming softly to himself the presence of another human being seemed suddenly to bring tavernakes feet back upon the earth he moved toward the pavement and addressed the newcomer  can you tell me how to get inside that house he asked quickly  the man removed the cigarette from his mouth and stared at his questioner  i should ring the bell he replied but surely its unoccupied what do you want to get in there for  less than a minute ago tavernake told him i was walking here with a friend a man came up behind us and tried deliberately to stab him he bolted afterwards through that door my friend followed him the door was closed in my face  the newcomer was a youngish man a musician who had just come from a concert and was on his way to the club at the end of the street probably had he been a journalist his curiosity would have been greater than his incredulity as it was however he gazed at tavernake for a moment blankly  look here he said this doesnt sound a very likely story of yours you know  i dont care whether its likely or not tavernake answered hotly its true the knifes somewhere in the road thereit fell up against the railings  they crossed the road together and searched there were no signs of the weapon tavernake peered over the railings  when my friend struck the other man and twisted him over he explained the knife seemed to fly up into the air it might even have reached the gardens  his companion turned slowly away  well its no use looking down there for it he remarked we might try the door if you like  they leaned their weight against it hammered at the panels and waited the door was fast closed and no reply came the musician shrugged his shoulders and prepared to depart after one more glance at tavernake half suspicious half questioning  if you think it worth while he said you had better fetch the police perhaps if you take my advice though i think i should go home and forget all about it  he passed on leaving tavernake speechless the idea that people might not believe his story had never seriously occurred to him yet all of a sudden he began to doubt it himself he stepped back into the road and looked up at the windows of the housedark uncurtained revealing no sign of life or habitation had he really taken that walk with pritchard stood on this spot with him only a minute or two ago then he picked up the police whistle and he had no longer any doubts the whole scene was before him again more vividly than ever even at this moment pritchard might be in need of help  he turned and walked sharply to the corner of the terrace finding himself almost immediately face to face with a policeman  you must come into this house with me at once tavernake exclaimed pointing backwards a friend of mine was attacked here just now a man tried to stab him they are both in that house the man ran away and my friend followed him the door is closed and no one answers  the constable looked at tavernake very much as the musician had done  do either of them live there sir he asked  how should i know tavernake answered the man sprang upon my friend from behind he had a knife in his handi saw it my friend threw him over and he escaped into that house they are both there now  which house is it sir the policeman inquired  they were standing almost in front of it the gate was open and tavernake beat against the panels with the flat of his hand then with a cry of triumph he stooped down and picked something up from a crack in the flagged stones  the key he cried come on quick  he thrust it into the lock and turned it the door swung smoothly open the policeman laid his hand upon tavernakes shoulder  look here he said lets have that story of yours again a little more clearly who is it thats in this house  five minutes ago tavernake began speaking rapidly i met a man in the strand whom i know slightlypritchard an american detective he said that he had something to say to me and he asked me to walk round with him to a club in this terrace we were in the middle of the road there talking when a man sprang at him he must have come up behind quite noiselessly the man had a knife in his hand my friend threw him head over heelsit was some trick of jiujutsu i have seen it done at the polytechnic he fell in front of this door which must either have been ajar or else some one who was waiting must have let him in he crawled through and my friend followed him the door was slammed in my face  how long ago was this the policeman asked  not much more than five minutes tavernake answered  the policeman coughed  its a very queer story sir  its true tavernake declared fiercely you and i have got to search this house  the policeman nodded  theres no harm in that sir anyway  he flashed his lantern around the hallunfurnished with paper hanging from the walls then they began to enter the rooms one by one nowhere was there any sign of occupation from floor to floor they passed in grim silence in the front chamber of the attic was a camp bedstead two or three humble articles of furniture and a small stove  caretakers kit the policeman muttered nothing seems to have been used for some time  they descended the stairs again  you say you saw the two men enter this house sir the policeman remarked doubtfully  i did tavernake declared there is no doubt about it  the back entrances are all properly locked the policeman pointed out none of the windows by which any one could escape have been opened weve been into every room theres no one in the house now sir is there  there doesnt seem to be tavernake admitted  the policeman looked him over once more tavernake certainly had not the appearance of one attempting a hoax  i am afraid there is nothing more we can do sir the man said civilly you had better give me your name and address  cant we go over the place once more tavernake suggested i tell you i saw them come in  i have my beat outside to look after sir the constable answered if it wasnt that you seem respectable i should begin to think that you wanted me out of the way for a bit name and address please  tavernake gave them readily they passed out together into the street  i shall report this matter the man said closing his book perhaps the sergeant will have the house searched again if you take my advice sir he added youll go home  i saw them both pass through that door tavernake repeated half to himself still standing upon the pavement and staring at the unlit windows  the constable made no reply but moved off soon he reached the corner of the terrace and disappeared tavernake slowly crossed the road and with his back to the railings looked steadfastly at the dark front of gray stone houses big ben struck one oclock several people passed backwards and forwards men were coming out from the club and separating for the night the roar of the city was growing fainter yet tavernake felt indisposed to move the look in that mans drawn white face and black eyes haunted him there was tragedy there the shadow of terrible things fear and the murderous desire to kill through that door they had passed the two men one in flight the other in pursuit where were they now perhaps it had been a trap pritchard had spoken seriously enough of his enemies  then as he stood there he saw for the first time a thin line of light through the closelydrawn curtains of a room on the ground floor of the adjoining house without a moments hesitation he crossed the road and rang the bell the door was opened after a trifling delay by a man in plain clothes who might however have been a servant in mufti he looked at tavernake suspiciously  i am sorry to have disturbed you tavernake explained but i saw some one go in the house next to you a little time ago can you tell me if you have heard any noises or voices during the last halfhour  the man shook his head  we have heard nothing sir he said  who lives here tavernake asked  did you call me up at one oclock in the morning to ask silly questions the man replied insolently every ones in bed here and i was just going  theres a light in your ground floor room tavernake remarked theres some one talking there nowi can hear voices  the man closed the door in his face for some time tavernake wandered restlessly about starting at last reluctantly homewards he had reached the strand and was crossing trafalgar square when a sudden thought held him he stood still for a moment in the middle of the street then he turned abruptly round in less than five minutes he was once more on the terrace     chapter xix tavernake intervenes   tavernake had the feelings of a man suddenly sobered as he turned once more into the adelphi terrace waiting until no one was in sight he opened the door of the empty house with the yale key which he had kept and carefully closed it he struck a match and listened for several minutes intently not a sound from anywhere he moved a few yards further to the bottom of the stairs and listened again still silence he turned the handle of the ground floor apartment and commenced a fresh search room by room he examined by the light of his rapidly dwindling matches this time he meant to leave behind him no possibility of any mistake he even measured the depths of the walls for any secret hiding place from room to room he passed leisurely always on the alert always listening once as he opened a door on the third floor there was a soft scurrying as though of a skirt across the floor he struck a match quickly to find a great rat sitting up and looking at him with black beady eyes it was the only sign of life he found in the whole building  when he had finished his search he came down to the ground floor and entered the room corresponding with the one from which he had heard voices in the adjoining house he crouched here upon the dusty boards for some time listening now and then he fancied that he could still hear voices on the other side of the wall but he was never absolutely certain  at last he rose to stretch himself and almost as he did so a fresh sound from outside attracted his notice a motorcar had turned into the terrace he walked to the uncurtained window and stood there sure of being himself unseen then his heart gave a great leap unemotional though he was this was a happening which might well have excited a more phlegmatic individual a motorcar which he remembered very well although it was driven now by a man in dark livery had stopped at the next house a woman and two men had descended tavernake never glanced at the latter his eyes were fastened upon their companion she was wrapped in a long cloak but she lifted her skirts as she crossed the pavement and he saw the flash of her silver buckles her carriage her figure were unmistakable it was elizabeth who was paying this early morning visit next door already the little party had disappeared they did not even ring the bell the door must have been opened silently at their coming the motorcar glided off once more the terrace was deserted  tavernake felt sure that he knew now the solutionthere was a way from this house into the next one he struck another match and standing back a few yards looked critically at the dividing wall in ancient days this had evidently been a dwellinghouse of importance elaborately decorated as the fresco work upon the ceiling still indicated the wall had been divided into three panels with a high wainscoting inch by inch he examined it from one end to the other he started from the back and came toward the front about threequarters of the way there he paused it was very simple after all the solid wall for a couple of feet suddenly ceased and the design was continued with an expanse of stretched canvas which yielded easily to his finger he leaned his ear against it he could hear now distinctly the sound of voiceshe heard even the womans laughter for the height of about four feet the wall had been bodily removed he made a small hole in the canvasthere was still darkness he enlarged the hole until he could thrust his hand throughthere was nothing but canvas the other side he knew now where he was there was only that single thickness of canvas between him and the room he had but to make the smallest hole in it and he would be able to see through even now with the removal of the barrier on his side the voices were more distinct a complete section of the wall had evidently been taken out and replaced by a detachable framework of wood covered with stretched canvas he stood back for a moment and felt with his finger he could almost trace the spot where the woodwork fitted upon hinges then he went on his hands and knees again and with his penknife in his hand he paused to listen he could hear the man crease talkinga slow nasal drawl then he heard pritchards voice followed by what seemed to be a groan there was a silence then elizabeth seemed to ask a question he heard her low laugh and some note in it sent a shiver through his body pritchard was speaking fiercely now then in the middle of his sentence there was silence once more followed by another groan he could almost feel the people in that room holding their breaths  tavernake was rapidly forgetting all caution the point of his knife was through the canvas slowly he worked it round until a small piece the size of a halfcrown was partially cut through with infinite pains he got his head and shoulders into the small recess and for the first time looked into the room pritchard was sitting almost in the middle of the apartment his arms seemed to be bound to the chair and his legs were tied together a few yards away elizabeth her fur coat laid aside was lounging back in an easychair her dress all glittering with sequins a curious light in her eyes a cruel smile parting her lips by her sidesitting in fact on the arm of her chairwas crease his long worn face paler even than usual his lips curled in a smile of cynical amusement major post was there carefully dressed as though he had been attending some social gathering standing upon the hearthrug with his coattails under his arms the professor in whose face seemed written the most abject terror was talking tavernake now could hear every word distinctly  my dear elizabeth my dear crease you are both too precipitate i tell you that i protesti protest most strongly mr pritchard i am sure with a little persuasion will listen to reason i will not be a party to any such proceeding asas this you understand crease we have gone quite far enough as it is i will not have it  elizabeth laughed softly  my dear father she said you will really have to take something for your nerves nothing need happen to mr pritchard at all unless he asks for it he has his chance no one should expect more  you are right my dear elizabeth declared crease speaking very slowly and with his usual drawl this question of his health for the futureat any rate for the immediate futureis entirely in pritchards own hands there is no one who has received so many warnings as he bramley was cautioned twice mallison was warned three times and burned to death forsith had word from us only once and he was shot in a drunken brawl this man pritchard has been warned a dozen times he has escaped death twice the time has come to show him that we are in earnest threats are useless the time has come for deeds i say that if pritchard refuses this trifling request of ours let us see that he leaves this house in such a state that he will not be able to do us any harm for some time at least  but he will give his word the professor cried excitedly i am quite sure that if you allow me to talk to him reasonably he will pledge his word to go back to the states and interfere no longer with your affairs  pritchard turned his head slightly he was a little pale and the blood was dropping slowly on to the floor from a wound in his temple but his tone was contemptuous  i will give you my word professor and you elizabeth gardner and you jim post and you walter crease that crippled or straight in evil or good health from the very jaws of death i will hang on to life until you have paid your just debts you understand that all of you i dont know what sort of a show this is you may be in earnest or you may be trying a rag in any case let me assure you of this you wont get me to beg for mercy if you force me to drink that stuff you are talking about ill find the antidote and as sure as theres a prison in america so surely ill make you suffer for it if you take my advice he went on slowly and i know what im talking about youll cut these ropes and set open your front door you ll live longer all of you  an idiot elizabeth remarked pleasantly can do but little harm in the world the word of a person of weak intellect is not to be relied upon for my part i am very tired of our friend mr pritchard if you others had been disposed to go to much greater lengths if you had said hang him from the ceiling i should have been well pleased  pritchard made a slight movement in his chairit was certainly not a movement of fear  madam he said i admire your candor let me return it i dont believe theres one of you here has the pluck to attempt to do me any serious injury if there is get on with it you hear mr walter crease bring out that bottle of yours  crease removed his cigar from his lips and rose slowly to his feet from his waistcoat pocket he produced a small phial from which he drew the cork  seems to me its up to us to do the trick he remarked languidly catch hold of his forehead jimmy  the man known as major post threw away his cigarette and coming round behind pritchards chair suddenly bent the mans head backward crease advanced phial in hand then all hell seemed to be let loose in tavernake he stepped back in his place and marked the extent of that wooden partition then setting his teeth he sprang at it throwing the great weight of his massive shoulder against the framework door scratched and bleeding but still upon his feet he burst into the room with the noise of bricks falling behindan apparition so unexpected that the little company gathered there seemed turned into some waxwork group from the chamber of horrorsmotionless without even the power of movement  tavernake in those few moments was like a giant among a company of degenerates he was strong his muscles were like whipcord and his condition was perfect walter crease went over like a log before his fist major post felt the revolver at which he had snatched struck from his hand and he himself remembered nothing more till he came to his senses some time afterwards a slash and a cut and pritchard was free the professor stood wringing his hands elizabeth had risen to her feet she was pale but she was still more nearly composed than any other person in the room tavernake and pritchard were masters of the situation pritchard leaned toward the mirror and straightened his tie  i am afraid he said looking down at walter creases groaning figure that our hosts are scarcely in fit condition to take leave of us never mind mrs gardner we excuse ourselves to you i cannot pretend to be sorry that my friends somewhat impetuous entrance has disturbed your plans for the evening but i do hope that you will realize now the fatuousness of such methods in these days goodnight it is time we finished our stroll together tavernake  they moved towards the doorthere was no one to stop them only the professor tried to say a few words  my dear mr pritchardmy dear pritchard if you will allow me to call you so he exclaimed let me beg of you before you leave us not to take this trifling adventure too seriously i can assure you that it was simply an attempt to coerce you not in the least an affair to be taken seriously  pritchard smiled  professor he said and you walter crease and you jimmy post if youre able to listen listen to me you have played the part of children tonight so surely as men and women exist who live as you do so surely must the law wait upon their heels you cannot cheat justice it is as inexorable as time itself when you try these little tricks you simply give another turn to the wheel add another danger to life you had better learn to look upon me as necessary all of you for i am certainly inevitable  they passed backwards through the door then they went down the silent hall and out into the street even as they did so the clock struck a quarter to two  my friend tavernake pritchard declared lighting a cigarette with steady fingers you are a man come into the club with me while i bathe my forehead after all well have that drink together before we say goodnight     chapter xx a pleasant reunion   tavernake awoke some hours later with a puzzled sense of having lost his own identity of having taken up another mans life stepped into another mans shoes from the day of his first arrival in london a raw country youth till the night when he had spoken to beatrice on the roof of blenheim house nothing that could properly be called an adventure had ever happened to him he had never for a moment felt the want of it he had not even indulged in the reading of books of romance the thing which had happened last night as in the cold morning sunlight he sat up in his bed seemed to him a thing grotesque inconceivable it was not really possible that those peoplethose wellbred welllooking peoplehad seriously contemplated an enormity which seemed to belong to the back pages of history or that he tavernake had burst through a wall with no weapons in his hand and had dominated the situation he sat there steadily thinking it was incredible but it was true there existed still in his mind some faint doubt as to whether they would really have proceeded to extremities pritchard himself had made light of the whole affair afterwards had treated it indeed as a huge practical joke tavernake remembering that little group as he had first seen it remained doubtful  by degrees his own personal characteristics began to assert themselves he began to wonder how his action would affect his commercial interests he had probably made an enemy of this wonderful sister of beatrices the woman who had so completely filled his thoughts during the last few days the woman too who was to have found the money by means of which he was to set his feet upon the first rung of the ladder this was a thing he decided which must be settled at once he must see her and know exactly what terms they were on whether or not she meant to be off with her bargain the thought of action of any sort was stimulating he rose and dressed had his breakfast and set out on his pilgrimage  soon after eleven oclock he presented himself at the milan court and asked for mrs wenham gardner for several minutes he waited about in nervous anticipation then he was told that she was not at home more than a little disappointed he pressed for news of her the hall porter thought that she had gone down into the country and if so it was doubtful when she would be back tavernake was now seriously disconcerted  i want particularly to wire to her he insisted please find out from her maid how i shall direct a telegram  the hall porter who was a most superior person regarded him blandly  we do not give addresses sir he explained unless at the expressed wish of our clients if you leave a telegram here i will send it up to mrs gardners rooms to be forwarded  tavernake scribbled one out begging for news of her return added his address and left the place then he wandered aimlessly about the streets there seemed something flat about the morning some aftermath of the excitement of the previous night was still stirring in his blood nevertheless he pulled himself together with an effort called for a young surveyor whom he had engaged to assist him and spent the rest of the day out upon the hill religiously he kept his thoughts turned upon his work until the twilight came then he hurried home to meet the disappointment which he had more than half anticipated there was no telegram for him he ate his dinner and sat with folded arms looking out into the street still no telegram the restlessness came back once more soon after ten oclock it became unbearable he found himself longing for company the loneliness of his little room since the departure of beatrice had never seemed so real a thing he stood it as long as he could and then catching up his hat and stick he set his face eastwards walking vigorously and with frequent glances at the clocks he passed  a few minutes past eleven oclock he found himself once more in that dark thoroughfare at the back of the theatre the lamp over the stagedoor was flickering in the same uncertain manner the same motorcars were there the same crowd of young men except that each night they seemed to grow larger this time he had a few minutes only to wait beatrice came out among the earliest at the sight of her he was suddenly conscious that he had after all no excuse for coming that she would probably crossexamine him about elizabeth would probably guess the secret of his torments he shrank back but he was a moment too late for she had seen him with a few words of excuse to the others with whom she was talking she picked up her skirts and came swiftly across the muddy street tavernake had no time to escape he remained there until she came but his cheeks were hot and he had an uncomfortable feeling that his presence that their meeting like this was an embarrassment to both of them  my dear leonard she exclaimed why do you hide over there  i dont know he answered simply  she laughed  it looks as though you didnt want to see me she remarked if you didnt why are you here  i suppose i did want to see you he replied anyhow i was lonely i wanted to talk to some one i walked all the way up here from chelsea  you have something to tell me she suggested  there was something he admitted i thought perhaps you ought to know i had supper with your father last night we talked about you  she started as though he had struck her her face was suddenly pale and anxious  are you serious leonard she asked my father  he nodded  i am sorry he said i ought not to have blundered it out like that i forgot that youyou were not seeing anything of him  how did you meet him  by accident he answered i was sitting alone up in the balcony at imanos and he wanted my table because he could see you from there so we shared it and then we began talking i knew who he was of course i had seen him in your sisters room he told me that he had engaged the table for every night this week  she looked across the road  i cant go out with those people now she declared wait here for me  she went back to her friends and talked to them for a moment or two tavernake could hear griers protesting voice and beatrices light laugh evidently they were trying uselessly to persuade her to change her mind soon she came back to him  i am sorry he said reluctantly i am afraid that i have spoiled your evening  dont be foolish please she replied taking his arm do you believe that my father will be up in the balcony at imanos tonight  tavernake nodded  he told me so  we will go and sit up there she decided he knows where i am to be found now so it doesnt matter i should like to see him  they walked off together though she was evidently absent and distressed tavernake felt once more that sense of pleasant companionship which her near presence always brought him  there is something else i must ask you she began presently i want to know if you have seen pritchard lately  i was with him last night tavernake answered  she shivered  he was asking questions  not about you tavernake assured her quickly it is your sister in whom he is interested  beatrice nodded but she seemed very little relieved tavernake could see that the old look of fear was back in her face  i am sorry beatrice he said regretfully i seem just now to be always bringing you reminiscences of the people whom it terrifies you to hear about  she shook her head  it isnt your fault leonard she declared only it is rather strange that you should be mixed up with them in any way isnt it i suppose some day youll find out everything about me perhaps youll be sorry then that you ever even called yourself my brother  dont be foolish he answered brusquely  she patted his hand  is the speculation going all right she asked  i am hoping to get the money together this week he replied if i get it i shall be well off in a year rich in five years  there is just a doubt about your getting it then she inquired  just a doubt he admitted i have a solicitor who is doing his best to raise a loan but i have not heard from him for two days then i have also a friend who has promised it to me a friend upon whom i am not quite sure if i can rely  they turned into the strand  tell me about my father leonard she begged  he hesitated it was hard to know exactly how to speak of the professor  perhaps if you have talked with him at all she went on it will help you to understand one of the difficulties i had to face in life  he is i should imagine a little weak tavernake suggested hesitatingly  very she answered my mother left him in my charge but i cannot keep him  your sister he began  she nodded  my sister has more influence than i she makes life easier for him  they reached the restaurant and made their way upstairs tavernake appropriated the same table and once more the head waiter protested  if the gentleman comes again tonight tavernake said you will find that he will be only too glad to have supper with us  then the professor came he made his usual somewhat theatrical entrance carrying his broadbrimmed hat in his hand brandishing his silvertopped cane when he saw tavernake and beatrice he stopped short then he held out both hands which beatrice immediately seized there were tears in his eyes tears running down his cheeks he sat down heavily in the chair which tavernake was holding for him  beatrice he exclaimed why this is most affecting you have come here to have supper with your old father you trust me then  absolutely she replied still clasping his hands if you give me away to elizabeth it will be the end the next time i shall never be found  for some days he assured her i have known exactly where you were to be found i have never spoken of it you are safe my meals up here he added with a little sigh have been sad feasts tonight we will be cheerful some quails i think quails and some clicquot for you my dear you need it ah this is a happiness indeed  you know mr tavernake father she remarked after he had given a somewhat lengthy order to the waiter  i met and talked with mr tavernake here the other night the professor admitted with condescension  mr tavernake was very good to me at a time when i needed help beatrice told him  the professor grasped tavernakes hands  you were good to my child he said you were good to me waiter three cocktails immediately he ordered turning round i must drink your health mr tavernakei must drink your health at once  tavernake leaned forward towards beatrice  i wonder he suggested whether you would not rather be alone with your father  she shook her head  you know so much she replied and it really doesnt seem to matter tell me father how do you spend your time  i must confess dear the professor said that i have little to do your sister elizabeth is quite generous  beatrice sat back in her chair as though she had been struck  father she exclaimed listen you are living on that money doesnt it seem terrible to you oh how can you do it  the professor looked at his daughter with an expression of pained surprise  my dear he explained your sister elizabeth has always been the moneyed one of the family she has brains and i trust her it is not for me to inquire as to the source of the comforts she provides for me i feel myself entitled to receive them and so i accept  but father she went on cant you seedont you know that its his moneywenhams  it is not a matter this my child the professor observed sharply which we can discuss before strangers some day we will speak of it you and i  has hebeen heard of she asked in a whisper  the professor frowned  a hottempered young man my dear he declared uneasily a hot tempered young man indeed elizabeth gives me to understand that it was just an ordinary quarrel and away he went  beatrice was white to the lips  an ordinary quarrel she muttered  she sat quite still tavernake unconsciously found himself watching her there were things in her eyes which frightened him it seemed as though she were looking out of the gay little restaurant with its lights and music and air of comfort out into some distant quarter of the world some other and very different place she was living through something which chilled her heart something terrifying tavernake saw those things in her face and his eyes spelt them out mercilessly  father she whispered leaning towards him do you believe what you have just been saying to me  it was the professors turn to be disturbed he concealed his discomfiture however with a gesture of annoyance  that is scarcely a proper question beatrice he answered sharply ah he added with more geniality the cocktails my young friend tavernake i drink to our better acquaintance you are english as i can see a real britisher some day you must come out to our own great countrymy daughter of course has told you that we are americans a great country sirthe greatest i have ever lived inroom to breathe room to grow room for a young man like you to plant his ambitions and watch them blossom to our better acquaintance mr tavernake and may we meet some day in the united states  tavernake drank the first cocktail in his life and wiped the tears from his eyes the professor found safety in conversation  you know he went on that i am a man of science physiognomy delights me men and women as i meet them represent to me varying types of humanity all interesting all appealing to my peculiar love of the science of psychology you my dear mr tavernake if i may venture to be so personal represent to me as you sit there the exact prototype of the young working englishman you are i should judge thorough dogmatic narrow persistent industrious and bound to be successful according to the scope and nature of your ambitions in this country you will never develop in my country sir we should make a colossus of you we should teach you not to be content with small things we should raise your hand which you yourself kept to your side and we should point your finger to the skies waiter he added turning abruptly round if the quails are not yet ready i will take another of these excellent cocktails  tavernake was embarrassed he saw that beatrice was anxious to talk to her father he saw also that her father was determined not to talk to her with a little sigh however she resigned herself to the inevitable  i have lectured sir the professor continued in most of the cities of the united states upon the human race the tendencies of every unit of the human race are my peculiar study when i speak to you of phrenology sir you smile and you think perhaps of a man who sits in a back room and takes your shilling for feeling the bumps of your head i am not of this order of scientific men sir i have diplomas from every university worth mentioning i blend the sciences which treat with the human race i know something of all of them character reading to me is at once a passion and a science leave me alone with a man or a woman for five minutes paint me a map of life and i will set the signposts along which that person will travel and i shall not miss one  you are doing no work over here father are you beatrice asked  none my dear he answered with a faint note of regret in his tone your sister elizabeth seemed scarcely to desire it her movements are very uncertain and she likes to have me constantly at hand my daughter elizabeth he continued turning to tavernake is a very beautiful young woman left in my charge under peculiar circumstances i feel it my duty therefore to be constantly at hand  again there was a flash of that strange look in the girls face she leaned forward but her father declined to meet her gaze  may i ask one or two personal questions she faltered remember i have not seen or heard anything from either of you for seven months  by all means my dear the professor declared your sister i am glad to say is well i myself am as you see me we have had a pleasant time and we have met some dear old friends from the other side our greatest trouble is that you are temporarily lost to us  elizabeth doesnt guess  my child the professor interrupted i have been loyal to you if elizabeth knew that i could tell her at any moment your exact whereabouts i think that she would be more angry with me than ever she has been in her life and my dear he added you know when elizabeth is angry things are apt to be unpleasant but i have been dumb i have not spoken nor shall i yet the professor went on you must not think beatrice that because i yield to your whim in this matter i recognize any sufficient cause why you should voluntarily estrange yourself from those whose right and privilege it is to look after you you are able i am glad to see to make your way in the world i have attended the atlas theatre and i am glad to see that you have lost none of your old skill in the song and dance you are deservedly popular there soon i have no doubt you will aspire to more important parts still my dear child the professor continued disposing of his second cocktail i see no reason why your very laudable desire to remain independent should be incompatible with a life under your sisters roof and my protection mr tavernake here with his british instincts will i am sure agree with me that it is not well for a young ladymy own daughter sir but i may say itof considerable personal attractions to live alone or under the chaperonage merely of these other young ladies of the theatre  i think tavernake said that your daughter must have very strong reasons for preferring to live alone  imaginary ones my dear sir the professor assured himaltogether imaginary the quails at last and the clicquot now this is really a delightful little meeting i drink to its repetition this is indeed a treat for me beatrice my love to you mr tavernake my best respects the only vintage sir he concluded setting down his empty glass appreciatively  to go back to what you were saying just now tavernake remarked i quite agree with you about beatrices living alone i am very anxious for her to marry me  the professor set down his knife and fork his appearance was one of ponderous theatricality  sir he declared this is indeed a most momentous statement am i to take it as a serious offer for my daughters hand  beatrice leaned over and laid her fingers upon his  father she said it doesnt matter please i am not willing to marry mr tavernake  the professor looked from one to the other and coughed  are mr tavernakes means he asked of sufficient importance to warrant his entering into matrimony  i have no money at all to speak of tavernake answered that really isnt important i shall very soon make all that your daughter can spend  i agree with my daughter sir the professor declared the subject might well be left until such time as you have improved your position we will dismiss it thereforedismiss it at once we will talk  father beatrice interrupted let us talk about yourself dont you think you would be more contented happier if you were to try to arrange for a fewa few demonstrations or lectures over here as you at first intended i know that you must find having nothing to do such a strain upon you she added  it was perhaps by accident that her eyes were fixed upon the glass which the professor was carrying to his lips he set it down at once  my child he said in a low tone i understand you  no no she insisted i didnt mean that but you are always better when you are working a man like you she went on a little wistfully should not waste his talents  he sighed  you are perhaps right my child he admitted i will go and see my agents tomorrow up till now he went on i have refused all offers i have felt that elizabeth the care of elizabeth in her peculiar position demanded my whole attention perhaps you are right perhaps i have overestimated the necessity of being constantly at her right hand she is a very clever woman elizabeth he concluded very clever indeed  where is she now father beatrice asked  she motored into the country early this morning with some friends the professor said they went to a party last night with walter crease london correspondent to the new york gazette he explained turning a little away from tavernake they were all home very late i understand and elizabeth complained of a headache this morning personally i regret to say that i was not up when they left  beatrice leaned quite close to her father  do you see anything of the man pritchard she inquired  the professor was suddenly flabby he set down his glass spilling half its contents he stole a quick glance at tavernake  my child he exclaimed you ought to consider my nerves you know very well that the sudden mention of any one whom i dislike so intensely is bad for me i am surprised at you beatrice you show a culpable lack of consideration for my infirmities  i am sorry father she whispered but is he here  he is the professor admitted between ourselves he added a white scared look upon his pale face he is spoiling my whole peace of mind my enjoyment of the comforts which elizabeth is able to provide for me is interfered with by that mans constant presence he seldom speaks and yet he seems always to be watching i do not trust him beatrice i am a judge of men and i tell you that i do not trust him  i wish that elizabeth would go away beatrice said in a low tone of course i have no rightto say things nothing serious has perhaps ever happened and yetand yet for her own sake i do not think that she should stay here in london with pritchard close at hand  the professor raised his glass with shaking fingers  elizabeth knows what is best he declared i am sure that elizabeth knows what is best but i too am beginning to wish that she would go away last night we met him at walter creases  once more he turned a little nervously towards tavernake who was looking down into the body of the restaurant with immovable face  we tried to persuade him then to go away he is really in rather a dangerous position here jimmy post has sworn that he will not be taken back to new york and there are one or two othersa pretty desperate crew we tried last night to reason with pritchard  it was no good she whispered  no good at all the professor answered drily perhaps if we had not been interrupted we might have convinced him  tell me about it she begged  the professor shook his head tavernake still had that air of paying no attention whatever to their conversation  it is not for you to know about my dear he concluded you have chosen very wisely to keep out of these matters elizabeth has such wonderful courage my own nerve i regret to say is not quite what it was waiter i will take a liqueur of the old brandy in a large glass  the brandy was brought but the professor seemed haunted by memories and his spirits never wholly returned not until the lights were turned down and tavernake had paid the bill did he partially recover his former manner  dear child he said as they stood up together i cannot tell you what the pleasure has been of this brief reunion  she rested her fingers upon his shoulders and looked up into his face  father she begged softly come to me i can keep you if you dont mind for a short time being poor you shall have all my salary except just enough for my clothes and anything will do for me to wear i will try so hard to make you comfortable  he looked at her with an air of offended dignity  my child he replied you must not talk to me like that if i did not feel that my duty lay with elizabeth i should insist upon your coming to me and under those conditions it would be i who should provide not you but for the moment i cannot leave your elder sister altogether she needs me  beatrice turned away a little sadly they all three descended the stairs  i shall leave our young friend mr tavernake to escort you to your home the professor announced i myself shall telephone to see if elizabeth has returned if she is still away i shall spend an hour or two i think with my friends at the blue room club beatrice this has been a joy to me a joy soon i hope to be repeated  he took both her hands she smiled at him with an attempt at cheerfulness  goodnight father she said  and to you sir also goodnight the professor added taking tavernakes hand and holding it for a minute in his while he looked impressively in his face i will not say too much but i will say this so much as i have seen of you i like goodnight  he turned and strode away both beatrice and tavernake watched him until he disappeared then with a sigh she picked up her skirts with her right hand and took tavernakes arm  do you mind walking home she asked my head aches  tavernake looked for a moment wistfully across the road toward the milan court beatrices hand however only held his arm the tighter  i am going to make you come with me every step of the way she declared so you can just as well make the best of it afterwards  what about afterwards he interrupted  afterwards she continued with decision you are to go straight home     chapter xxi some excellent advice   tavernake in response to a somewhat urgent message walked into his solicitors office almost as soon as they opened on the following morning the junior partner of the firm who took an interest in him and was anxious indeed to invest a small amount in the marston rise building company received him cordially but with some concern  look here tavernake he said i thought id better write a line and ask you to come down you havent forgotten have you that our option of purchase lasts only three days longer  tavernake nodded  well what of it he asked  its just as well that you should understand the situation the lawyer continued your old people are hard upon our heels in this matter and there will be no chance of any extensionnot even for an hour mr dowling has already put in an offer a thousand pounds better than yours i heard that incidentally yesterday afternoon so you may be sure that the second your option has legally expired the thing will be off altogether so far as youre concerned  thats all very well tavernake remarked but what about the plots that already belong to me  they have some sort of scheme for leaving those high and dry the solicitor explained you see the drainage and lighting will be largely influenced by the purchaser of the whole estate if dowling gets it he means to treat your plots so that they will become practically valueless its rather a mean sort of thing but then hes a mean little man  tavernake nodded  well he announced i was coming to see you anyhow this morning to talk to you about the money  your friend isnt backing out the lawyer asked quickly  my friend has not said anything about backing out yet tavernake replied but circumstances have arisen during the last few days which have altered my own views as to the expediency of business relations with this person i havent any reason to suppose that the money wont be forthcoming but if i could get it from any other source i should prefer it  the solicitor looked blank  of course he said ill do what i can if you like but i may as well tell you at once that i dont think i should have a ghost of a chance of raising the whole amount  i suppose tavernake inquired thoughtfully your firm couldnt do anything  we could do something certainly the solicitor answered on account of our own clients we might perhaps manage up to five thousand pounds that would still leave us wanting seven however and i scarcely see where we could get it  tavernake was silent for a few moments  you havent quarreled with your friend have you the solicitor asked  no there has been no quarrel tavernake replied i have another reason  if i were you id try and forget it his friend advised to tell you the truth i have been feeling rather anxious about this affair its a big thing you know and the profit is as sure as the dividend on consols i should hate to have that little bounder dowling get in and scoop it up  its a fine investment admitted tavernake and as you say there isnt the slightest risk thats why i was hoping you might have been able to manage it without my calling upon my friend  mr martin shook his head  it isnt so easy to convince other people all the same i dont want to get left if youll take my advice youll go and call on your friend at once and see exactly how matters stand if everythings ok and you can induce him to part a few hours before it is absolutely necessary i must confess that it would take a load off my mind i dont like these affairs that have to be concluded at the last possible moment  well tavernake agreed i must try what i can do then there is nothing else fresh i suppose  nothing the solicitor answered come back if you can make any definite arrangement or telephone the matter is really bothering me a little i dont want to have the other people slip in now  tavernake instead of obeying his first impulse and making his way direct to the milan court walked to the flat in kingsway climbed up the stone steps and asked for beatrice she met him at her own door fully dressed  my dear leonard she exclaimed in surprise what an early caller  i want a few words with you he said can you spare me five minutes  you must walk with me to the theatre she replied i am just off to rehearsal  they descended the stairs together  i have something to tell you tavernake began something to tell you which you wont like to hear  something which i wont like to hear she repeated fearfully go on leonard it cant be worse than it sounds  i dont know why ive come to tell you he went on i never meant to it came into my mind all of a sudden and i felt that i must it has to do with your sister and the marston rise affair  my sister and the marston rise affair beatrice exclaimed incredulously  then a sudden light broke in upon her she stopped short and clutched at his hand  you dont mean that it was elizabeth who was going to find you the money she cried  i do he answered she offered it of her own accord i do not know why i talked to her of my own affairs but she led me on to speak of them your sister is a wonderful person he continued dropping his voice i dont know why but she made me talk as no one else has ever made me talk before i simply had to tell her things then when i had finished she showed me her bankbooks and suggested that she should invest some of her money in the rise  but do you mean to tell me beatrice persisted that it is her money upon which you are relying for this purchase  tavernake nodded  you see he explained mr dowling dropped upon us before i was prepared as soon as he found out he went to the owners of the estate and made them a bid for it the consequence was that they shortened my option and gave me very little chance indeed to find the money when your sister offered it it certainly seemed a wonderful stroke of fortune i could give her eight or ten per cent whereas she would only get four anywhere else and i should make a profit for myself of over ten thousand pounds which i cannot do unless i find the money to buy the estate  but you mustnt touch that money you mustnt have anything to do with it beatrice exclaimed walking very fast and looking straight ahead you dont understand how should you  do you mean that the money was stolen tavernake asked after a moments pause  no not stolen beatrice replied but it comesoh i cant tell you only elizabeth has no right to it my own sister it is all too awful  do you think that she has come by this money dishonestly  i am not sure beatrice murmured there are worse things more terrible things even than theft  the practical side of tavernakes nature was very much to the fore that morning he began to wonder whether women after all strange and fascinating creatures though they were possessed judgment which could be relied uponwhether they were not swayed too much by sentiment  beatrice he said you must understand this i have no time to raise the money elsewhere if i dont get it from your sister supposing she is still willing to let me have it my chance has gone i shall have to take a situation in some one elses office as a clerkprobably not so good a place as i held at dowling  spences on the other hand the use of that money for a very short time would be the start of my career all that you say is so vague why need i know anything about it i met your sister in the ordinary way of business and she has made an ordinary business proposition to me one by which she will be incidentally very greatly benefited i never thought of telling you this at all but when the time came i hated to go and draw that money from your sister without having said anything to you so i came this morning but i want you if you possibly can to look at the matter from my point of view  she was silent for several moments then she glanced at him curiously  why on earth she asked should my sister make this offer to you she isnt a fool she doesnt usually trust strangers  she trusted me apparently tavernake answered  can you understand why beatrice demanded  i think that i can he replied if one can rely upon ones perception she is surrounded by people whom she might find agreeable companions but whom she is scarcely likely to have much confidence in perhaps she realized that i wasnt like them  and you want very much to take this money she said half to herself  i want to very much indeed tavernake admitted i was on my way to see her this morning and to ask her to let me have it a day or two before the time but i felt somehow that there seemed to be a certain amount of deceit in going to her and taking it without saying a word to you i felt that i had to come here first but beatrice dont ask me to give it up it means such a long time before i can move again its the first step thats so difficult and i musti must make a start its such a chance this i have spent so many hours thinking about it i have planned and worked and sketched it all out as no one else could do i must have that money  they walked on in silence until they reached the stage door beatrice was thinking of her companion as she had seen him so often poring over his plans busy with ruler and indiarubber absolutely absorbed in the interest of his task she remembered the first time he had talked about this scheme of his how his whole face had changed the almost passionate interest with which he had worked the thing out even to its smallest details she realized how great a part of his life the thing had become what a terrible blow it would be to him to have to abandon it she turned and faced him  leonard she said perhaps after all you are right perhaps i give way too much to what after all is only a sentimental feeling i am thankful that you came and told me i shall always be thankful for that take the money but pay it back as soon as you can  i shall do that he answered i shall do that you may rely upon it  she laid her hand upon his arm  leonard she begged i know that elizabeth is very beautiful and very fascinating and i dont wonder that you like to go and see her but i want to ask you to promise me one thing  he felt as though he were suddenly turned into stone it was not possibleit could not be possible that she had guessed his secret  well he demanded  dont let her introduce you to her friends dont spend too much time there she continued elizabeth is my sister and i dontreally i dont want to say anything that doesnt sound kind but her friends are not fit people for you to know and elizabethwell she hasnt very much heart  he was silent for several moments  how did you know i liked going to see your sister he asked abruptly  she smiled  my dear leonard she said you are not very clever at hiding your feelings when you came to see me the other day do you imagine i believed for a single moment that you asked me to marry you simply because you cared i think leonard that it was because you were afraid you were afraid of something coming into your life so big so terrifying that you were ready to clutch at the easiest chance of safety  beatrice this is absurd he exclaimed  she shook her head  no it isnt that she declared do you know my dear leonard what there was about you from the very first which attracted me  no he answered  it was your honesty she continued you remember that night upon the roof at blenheim house you were going to tell a lie for me and i know how you hated it you love the truth you are truthful naturally i would rely upon you wherever i was i know that you would keep your word i know that you would be honest a woman loves to feel that about a manshe loves itand i dont want you to be brought near the people who sneer at honesty and all good things i dont want you to hear their point of view you may be simple and commonplace in some respects i want you to stay just as you are do you understand  i understand tavernake replied gravely  a call boy shouted her name down the stone passage she patted him on the shoulder and turned away  run along now and get the money she said come and see me when its all over  tavernake left her with a long breath of relief and made his way towards the strand at the corner of wellington street he came face to face with pritchard they stopped at once there seemed to be something embarrassing about this meeting pritchard patted him familiarly on the shoulder  how goes it old man he asked  i am all right tavernake answered somewhat awkwardly how are you  i guess id be the better for a drink pritchard declared come along pretty well done up the other night werent we well step into the american bar here and try a gin fizz  they found themselves presently perched upon two high stools in a deserted corner of the bar to which pritchard had led the way tavernake sipped his drink tentatively  i should like he said to ask you a question or two about wednesday night  pritchard nodded  go right ahead he invited  you seem to take the whole affair as a sort of joke tavernake remarked  well isnt that what it was the detective asked smiling  tavernake shrugged his shoulders  there didnt seem to me to be much joke about it he exclaimed  pritchard laughed gayly  you are not used to americans my young friend he said over on this side you are all so fearfully literal you are not seriously supposing that they meant to dose me with that stuff the other night eh  i never thought that there was any doubt about it at all tavernake declared deliberately  pritchard stroked his moustache meditatively  well he remarked you are certainly green and yet i dont know why you shouldnt be americans are always up to games of that sort i am not saying that they didnt mean to give me a scare if they could or that they wouldnt have been glad to get a few words of information out of me or a paper or two that i keep pretty safely locked up it would have been a better joke on me then but as for the rest as for really trying to make me take that stuff of course that was all bunkum  tavernake sat quite still in his chair for several minutes  will you take another gin fizz mr pritchard he asked  why not  tavernake gave the order he sat on his stool whistling softly to himself  then i suppose he said at last i must have looked a pretty sort of an ass coming through the wall like a madman  pritchard shook his head  you looked just about what you were he answered a dd good sort im not playing up to you that it was all pretense you can never trust that gang the blackguard outside was in earnest anyway after all you know they wouldnt miss me if i were to drop quietly out there s no one else they re quite so much afraid of there s no one else knows quite as much about them  well well let it go at that tavernake declared you know so much of all these people though that i rather wish you d tell me something i want very much to know  its by telling nothing the detective replied quickly that i know as much as i do just one cocktail eh  tavernake shook his head  i drank my first cocktail last night he remarked i had supper with the professor and his daughter  not elizabeth pritchard asked swiftly  tavernake shook his head  with miss beatrice he answered  pritchard set down his glass  say tavernake he inquired you are friendly with that young lady miss beatrice arent you  i certainly am tavernake answered i have a very great regard for her  then i can tell you how to do her a good turn pritchard continued earnestly keep her away from that old blackguard keep her away from all the gang believe me she is looking for trouble by even speaking to them  but the mans her father tavernake objected and he seems fond of her  dont you believe it pritchard went on hes fond of nothing and nobody but himself and easy living hes soft mind you hes got plenty of sentiment he ll squeeze a tear out of his eye and all that sort of thing but hed sell his soul or his daughters soul for a little extra comfort now elizabeth doesnt know exactly where her sister is and she darent seem anxious or go around making inquiries beatrice has her chance to keep away and i can tell you it will be a thundering sight better for her if she does  well i dont understand it at all tavernake declared i hate mysteries  pritchard set down his empty glass  look here he remarked this affair is too serious after all for us to talk round like a couple of gossips i have given you your warning and if youre wise you ll remember it  tell me this one thing tavernake persisted tell me what is the cause of the quarrel between the two cant something be done to bring them together again  pritchard shook his head  nothing he answered as things are at present they are better apart coming my way  tavernake followed him out of the place pritchard took his arm as he turned down toward the strand  my young friend he said here is a word of advice for you the scriptures say that you cannot serve god and mammon paraphrase that to the present situation and remember that you cannot serve elizabeth and beatrice  what then tavernake demanded  the detective waited until he had lit the long black cigar between his teeth  i guess youd better confine your attentions to beatrice he concluded     chapter xxii dinner with elizabeth   the rest of that day was for tavernake a period of feverish anxieties he received two telegrams from mr martin his solicitor and he himself was more uneasy than he cared to admit at three oclock in the afternoon at eight in the evening and again at eleven oclock at night he presented himself at the milan court always with the same inquiry on the last occasion the hall porter had cheering news for him  mrs wenham gardner returned from the country an hour ago sir he announced i can send your name up now if you wish to see her  tavernake was conscious of a sense of immense relief of course he had known that she had not really gone away for good but all the same her absence especially after the event of the night before last was a little disquieting  my name is tavernake he said i do not wish to intrude at such an hour but if she could see me for a moment i should be glad  he sat down and waited patiently soon a message came that mr tavernake was to go up he ascended in the lift and knocked at the door of her suite her maid opened it grudgingly she scarcely took the pains to conceal her disapproval of this young manso ordinary so gauche why madame should waste her time upon such a one she could not imagine  mrs gardner will see you directly she told him madame is dressing now to go out for supper she will be able to spare you only a few seconds  tavernake remained alone in the luxurious little sittingroom for nearly ten minutes then the door of the inner room was opened and elizabeth appeared tavernake rising slowly to his feet looked at her for a moment in reluctant but wondering admiration she was wearing an ivory satin gown without trimming or lace of any sort a gown the fit of which seemed to him almost a miracle her only jewelry was a long rope of pearls and a small tiara tavernake had never been brought into close contact with any one quite like this  she was putting on her gloves as she entered and she gave him her left hand  what an extraordinary person you are mr tavernake she exclaimed you really do seem to turn up at the most astonishing times  i am very sorry to have intruded upon you tonight he said as regards the last occasion however upon which i made an unexpected appearance i make no apologies whatever he added coolly  she laughed softly she was looking full into his eyes and yet he could not tell whether she was angry with him or only amused  you were by way of being a little melodramatic were you not she remarked still you were very much in earnest and one forgives a great deal to any one who is really in earnest what do you want with me now i am just going downstairs to supper  it is a matter of business tavernake replied i have a friend who is a partner with me in the marston rise building speculation and he is worried because there is some one else in the field wanting to buy the property and the day after tomorrow is our last chance of paying over the money  she looked at him as though puzzled  what money  the money which you agreed to lend me or rather to invest in our building company he reminded her  she nodded  of course why i had forgotten all about it for the moment you are going to give me ten per cent interest or something splendid arent you well what about it you dont want to take it away with you now i suppose  no he answered it isnt that to be honest with you i came to make sure that you hadnt changed your mind  and why should i change my mind  you might be angry with me he said for interfering in your concerns the night before last  perhaps i am she remarked indifferently  do you wish to withdraw from your promise he asked  i really havent thought much about it she replied carelessly bythebye have you seen beatrice lately  we agreed i think he reminded her that we would not talk about your sister  she looked at him over her shoulder  i do not remember that i agreed to anything of the sort she declared i think it was you who laid down the law about that as a matter of fact i think that your silence about her is very unkind i suppose you have seen her  yes i have seen her tavernake admitted  she continues to be tragic elizabeth asked whenever my name is mentioned  i should not call it tragic tavernake answered reluctantly one gathers however that something transpired between you before she left of a serious nature  she looked at him earnestly  really she said you are a strange stolid young man i wonder she went on smiling into his face are you in love with my sister  tavernake made no immediate response only something flashed for a moment in his eyes which puzzled her  why do you look at me like that she demanded you are not angry with me for asking  no i am not angry he replied it isnt that but you must knowyou must see  then she indeed did see that he was laboring under a very great emotion she leaned towards him laughing softly  now you are really becoming interesting she murmured tell metell me all about it  i dont know what love is tavernake declared fiercely i dont know what it means to be in love  again she laughed in his face  are you so sure she whispered  she saw the veins stand out upon his temples watched the passion which kept him at first tonguetied  sure he muttered who can be sure when you look like that  he held out his arms with a swift little backward movement she flitted away and leaned against the table  what a brotherinlaw you would make she laughed so steady so respectable alas so serious dear mr tavernake i wish you joy as a matter of fact you and beatrice are very well suited for one another  the telephone bell rang she moved over and held the receiver to her ear her face changed after the first few words to which she listened it grew dark with anger  you mean to say that professor franklin has not been in since lunchtime she exclaimed i left word particularly that i should require him tonight is major post there then no mr creaseno nor mr faulkes not one of them very well ring me up directly the professor comes in or any of them  she replaced the receiver with a gesture of annoyance tavernake was astonished at the alteration in her expression the smile had gone and with its passing away lines had come under her eyes and about her mouth without a word to him she strode away into her bedroom tavernake was just wondering whether he should retire when she came back  listen mr tavernake she said how far away are your rooms  down at chelsea he answered about two miles and a half  take a taxi and drive there she commanded or stop you will find my car outside i will telephone down to say that you are to use it change into your evening clothes and come back for me i want you to take me out to supper  he looked at her in amazement she stamped her foot  dont stand there hesitating she ordered do as i say you dont expect i am going to help you to buy your wretched property if you refuse me the simplest of favors hurry i say hurry  i am really very sorry tavernake interposed but i do not possess a dress suit i would go with pleasure but i havent got such a thing  she looked at him for a moment incredulously then she broke into a fit of uncontrollable laughter she sat down upon the edge of a couch and wiped the tears from her eyes  oh you strange you wonderful person she exclaimed you want to buy an estate and you want to borrow twelve thousand pounds and you know where beatrice is and you wont tell me and you are fully convinced because you burst into a house through the wall that you saved poor pritchard from being poisoned and you dont possess a dress suit never mind as it happens it doesnt matter about the dress suit you shall take me out as you are  tavernake felt in his pockets and remembered that he had only thirty shillings with him  here carry my purse she said carelessly we are going downstairs to the smaller restaurant i have been traveling since six oclock and i am starving  but how about my clothes tavernake objected will they be all right  it doesnt matter where we are going she answered you look very well as you are come and let me put your tie straight  she came close to him and her fingers played for a moment with his tie she was very near to him and she laughed deliberately into his face tavernake held himself quite stiff and felt foolish he also felt absurdly happy  there she remarked when she had arranged it to her satisfaction you look all right now i wonder she added half to herself what you do look like something colonial and forceful i think never mind help me on with my cloak and come along you are a most respectablelooking escort and a very useful one   although tavernake was nominally the host it was elizabeth who selected the table and ordered the supper there were very few other guests in the room the majority being down in the larger restaurant but among these few tavernake noticed two of the girls from the chorus at the atlas elizabeth had chosen a table from which she had a view of the door and she took the seat facing it from the first tavernake felt certain that she was watching for some one  talk to me now please about this speculation she insisted i should like to know all about it and whether you are sure that i shall get ten per cent for my money  tavernake was in no way reluctant it was a safe topic for conversation and one concerning which he had plenty to say but after a time she stopped him  well she said i have discovered at any rate one subject on which you can be fluent now i have had enough of building properties please and house building i should like to hear a little about beatrice  tavernake was dumb  i do not wish to talk about beatrice he declared until i understand the cause of this estrangement between you  her eyes flashed angrily and her laugh sounded forced  not even talk of her my dear friend she protested you scarcely repay the confidence i am placing in you  you mean the money  precisely she continued i trust you why i do not knowi suppose because i am something of a physiognomistwith twelve thousand pounds of my hardearned savings you refuse to trust me with even a few simple particulars about the life of my own sister come i dont think that things are quite as they should be between us  do you know where i first met your sister tavernake asked  she shook her head pettishly  how should i you told me nothing  she was staying in a boardinghouse where i lived tavernake went on i think i told you that but nothing else it was a cheap boardinghouse but she had not enough money to pay for her meals she was tired of life she was in a desperate state altogether  are you trying to tell me or rather trying not to tell me that beatrice was mad enough to think of committing suicide elizabeth inquired  she was in the frame of mind when such a step was possible he answered gravely you remember that night when i first saw you in the chemists shop across the street she had been very ill that evening very ill indeed you could see for yourself the effect meeting you had upon her  elizabeth nodded and crumbled a little piece of roll between her fingers then she leaned over the table towards tavernake  she seemed terrified didnt she she hurried you awayshe seemed afraid  it was very noticeable he admitted she was terrified she dragged me out of the place a few minutes later she fainted in the cab  elizabeth smiled  beatrice was always oversensitive she remarked any sudden shock unnerved her altogether are you terrified of me too mr tavernake  i dont know he answered frankly sometimes i think that i am  she laughed softly  why she whispered  he looked into her eyes and he felt abject how was it possible to sit within a few feet of her and remain sane  you are so wonderful he said in a low tone so different from any one else in the world  you are glad that you met me thenthat you are here she asked  he raised his eyes once more  i dont know he answered simply if i really believedif you were always kind like thisbut you see you make two men of me when i am with you i am a fool your fool to do as you will with when i am away some glimmerings of common sense come back and i know  you know what she murmured  that you are not honest he added  mr tavernake she exclaimed lifting her head a little  oh i don t mean dishonest in the ordinary way he protested eagerly what i mean is that you look things which you dont feel that you are willing for any one who cant help admiring you very much to believe for a moment that you too feel more kindly than you really do this is so clumsy he broke off despairingly but you understand what i mean  you have an adorable way of making yourself understood she laughed come do let us talk sense for a minute or two you say that when you are with me you are my slave then why is it that you do not bring beatrice here when i beg you to  i am your slave he answered in everything that has to do with myself and my own actions in that other matter it is for your sister to decide  she shrugged her shoulders  well she said i suppose i shall be able to endure life without her at any rate we will talk of something else tell me are you not curious to know why i insisted upon bringing you here  yes he admitted i am  spoken with your usual candor my dear briton she exclaimed well i will gratify your curiosity this as you see is not a popular supping place a few people come inmostly those who for some reason or other dont feel smart enough for the big restaurants the people from the theatres come in here who have not time to change their clothes as you perceive the place has a distinctly bohemian flavor  tavernake looked around  they seem to come in all sorts of clothes he remarked i am glad  there is a man now in london elizabeth continued whom i am just as anxious to see as i am to find my sister i believe that this is the most likely place to find him that is why i have come my father was to have been here to take me but as you heard he has gone out somewhere and not returned none of my other friends were available you happened to come in just in time  and this man whom you want to see tavernake asked is he here  not yet she answered  there were indeed only a few scattered groups in the place and most of these were obviously theatrical but even at that moment a man came in alone through the circular doors and stood just inside looking around him he was a man of medium height thin and of undistinguished appearance his hair was lightcolored and plastered a little in front over his forehead his face was thin and he walked with a slight stoop something about his clothes and his manner of wearing them stamped him as an american tavernake glanced at his companion wondering whether this perhaps might not be the person for whom she was watching his first glance was careless enough then he felt his heart thump against his ribs a tragedy had come into the room the woman at his side sat as though turned to stone there was a look in her face as of one who sees death the small patch of rouge invisible before was now a staring daub of color in an oasis of ashen white her eyes were as hard as stones her lips were twitching as though indeed she had been stricken with some disease no longer was he sitting with this most beautiful lady at whose coming all heads were turned in admiration it was as though an image of death sat there a frozen presentment of horror itself     chapter xxiii on an errand of chivalry   the seconds passed the woman beside him showed no sign of life tavernake felt a fear run cold in his blood such as in all his days he had never known this indeed was something belonging to a world of which he knew nothing what was it illness pain surprise there was only his instinct to tell him it was terror the terror of one who looks beyond the grave  mrs gardner he exclaimed elizabeth  the sound of his voice seemed to break the spell a halfchoked sob came through her teeth the struggle for composure commenced  i am ill she murmured give me my glass give it to me  her fingers were feeling for it but it seemed as though she dared not move her head he filled it with wine and placed the stem in her hand even then she spilled some of it upon the tablecloth as she raised it to her lips the man who stood still upon the threshold of the restaurant looked into her face slowly as though his quest were over he came down the room  go away she said to tavernake go away please he is coming to speak to me i want to be alone with him  strangely enough at that moment tavernake saw nothing out of the common in her request he rose at once without any formal leavetaking and made his way toward the other end of the cafe as he turned the corner towards the smokingroom he glanced once behind the man had approached quite close to elizabeth he was standing before her table they seemed to be exchanging greetings  tavernake went on into the smokingroom and threw himself into an easychair he had been there perhaps for ten minutes when pritchard entered certainly it was a night of surprises even pritchard cool deliberate slow in his movements and speech seemed temporarily flurried he came into the room walking quickly as the door swung back he turned round as though to assure himself that he was not being followed he did not at first see tavernake he sat on the arm of an easychair his hands in his pockets his eternal cigar in the corner of his mouth his eyes fixed upon the doors through which he had issued without a doubt something had disturbed him he had the look of a man who had received a blow a surprise of some sort over which he was still ruminating then he glanced around the room and saw tavernake  hullo young man he exclaimed so this is the way you follow my advice  i never promised to follow it tavernake reminded him  pritchard wheeled an easychair across the room and called to the waiter  come he said you shall stand me a drink two whiskies and sodas tim and now mr leonard tavernake you are going to answer me a question  am i tavernake muttered  you came down in the lift with mrs wenham gardner half an hour ago you went into the restaurant and ordered supper she is there still and you are here have you quarreled  no we did not quarrel tavernake answered she explained that she was supping in the cafe only for the sake of meeting one man she wanted an escort i filled that post until the man came  he is there now pritchard asked  he is there now tavernake assented  pritchard withdrew the cigar from his mouth and watched it for a moment  say tavernake he went on is that man who is now having supper with mrs wenham gardner the man whom she expected  i imagine so tavernake replied  didnt she seem in any way scared or disturbed when he first turned up  she looked as i have seen no one else on earth look before tavernake admitted she seemed simply terrified to death i do not know whyshe didnt explainbut that is how she looked  yet she sent you away  she sent me away she didnt care what became of me she was watching the door all the time before he came who is he pritchard  that sounds a simple question pritchard answered gravely but it means a good deal theres mischief afoot tonight tavernake  you seem to thrive on it tavernake retorted drily any more bunkum  pritchard smiled  come he said youre a sensible chap take these things for what theyre worth believe me when i tell you now that there is a great deal more in the coming of this man than mrs wenham gardner ever bargained for  i wish youd tell me who he is tavernake begged all this mystery about beatrice and her sister and that lazy old hulk of a father is most irritating  pritchard nodded sympathetically  youll have to put up with it a little longer im afraid my young friend he declared youve done me a good turn ill do you one ill give you some good advice keep out of this place so long as the old man and his daughter are hanging out here the girl s cleveroh shes as clever as they make thembut shes gone wrong from the start they aint your sort tavernake you dont fit in anywhere take my advice and hook it altogether  tavernake shook his head  i cant do that just now he said goodnight im off for the present at any rate  pritchard too rose to his feet he passed his arm through tavernakes  young man he remarked there are not many in this country whom i can trust youre one of them theres a sort of solidity about you that i rather admire you are not likely to break out and do silly things do you care for adventures  i detest them tavernake answered especially the sort i tumbled into the other night  pritchard laughed softly they had left the room now and were walking along the open space at the end of the restaurant leading to the main exit  thats the difference between us he declared thoughtfully now adventures to me are the salt of my life i hang about here and watch these few respectablelooking men and women and there doesnt seem to be much in it to an outsider but gee whiz theres sometimes things underneath which you fellows dont tumble to a man asks another in there to have a drink they make a cheerful appointment to meet for lunch to motor to brighton it all sounds so harmless and yet there are the seeds of a conspiracy already sown they hate me here but they know very well that wherever they went i should be around i suppose some day theyll get rid of me  more bunkum tavernake muttered  they stood in front of the door and passed through into the courtyard on their right the interior of the smaller restaurant was shielded from view by a latticework covered with flowers and shrubs pritchard came to a standstill at a certain point and stooping down looked through he remained there without moving for what seemed to tavernake an extraordinarily long time when he stood up again there was a distinct change in his face he was looking more serious than tavernake had ever seen him but for the improbability of the thing tavernake would have thought that he had turned pale  my young friend he said youve got to see me through this you ve a sort of fancy for mrs wenham gardner i know tonight you shall be on her side  i dont want any more mysteries tavernake protested id rather go home  it cant be done pritchard declared taking his arm once more youve got to see me through this come up to my rooms for a minute  they entered the court and ascended to the eighth floor pritchard turned on the lights in his room a plainly furnished and somewhat bare apartment from a cupboard he took out a pair of rubbersoled shoes and threw them to tavernake  put those on he directed  what are we going to do tavernake asked  you are going to help me pritchard answered take my word for it tavernake its all right i could tackle the job alone but id rather not now drink this whiskey and soda and light a cigarette i shall be ready in five minutes  but where are we going tavernake demanded  you are going pritchard replied on an errand of chivalry you are going to become once more a rescuer of woman in distress you are going to save the life of your beautiful friend elizabeth     chapter xxiv close to tragedy   the actual words of greeting which passed between elizabeth and the man whose advent had caused her so much emotion were unimpressive the newcomer with the tips of his fingers resting upon the tablecloth leaned slightly towards her at close quarters he was even more unattractive than when tavernake had first seen him he was faultily shaped there was something a little decadent about his deepset eyes and receding forehead neither was his expression prepossessing he looked at her as a man looks upon the thing he hates  so elizabeth he said this pleasure has come at last  i heard that you were back in england she replied pray sit down  even then her eyes never left his all the time they seemed to be fiercely questioning seeking for something in his features which eluded them it was terrible to see the change which the last few minutes had wrought in her her smooth girlish face had lost its comeliness her eyes always a little narrow seemed to have receded it was such a change this as comes to a brave man who in the prime of life feels fear for the first time  i am glad to find you at supper he declared taking up the menu i am hungry you can bring me some grilled cutlets at once he added to the waiter who stood by his side and some brandy nothing else  the waiter bowed and hurried off the woman played with her fan but her fingers were shaking  i fear he remarked that my coming is rather a shock to you i am sorry to see you looking so distressed  it is not that she answered with some show of courage you know me too well to believe me capable of seeking a meeting which i feared it is the strange thing which has happened to you during these last few monthsthis last year do you knowhas any one told youthat you seem to have become even more likethe image of  he nodded understandingly  of poor wenham many people have told me that of course you know that we were always appallingly alike and they always said that we should become more so in middleage after all there is only a year between us we might have been twins  it is the most terrible thing in likenesses i have ever seen the woman continued slowly when you entered the room a few seconds ago it seemed to me that a miracle had happened it seemed to me that the dead had come to life  it must have been a shock the man murmured with his eyes upon the tablecloth  it was she agreed hoarsely cant you see it in my face i do not always look like a woman of forty cant you see the gray shadows that are there you see i admit it frankly i was terrifiedi am terrified  and why he asked  why she repeated looking at him wonderingly doesnt it seem to you a terrible thing to think of the dead coming back to life  he tapped lightly upon the tablecloth for a minute with the fingers of one hand then he looked at her again  it depends he said upon the manner of their death  an executioner of the middle ages could not have played with his victim more skillfully the woman was shivering now preserving some outward appearance of calm only by the most fierce and unnatural effort  what do you mean by that jerry she asked i was not even withwenham when he was lost you know all about it i supposehow it happened  the man nodded thoughtfully  i have heard many stories he admitted before we leave the subject for ever i should like to hear it from you from your own lips  there was a bottle of champagne upon the table ordered at the commencement of the meal she touched her glass the waiter filled it she raised it to her lips and set it down empty her fingers were clutching the tablecloth  you ask me a hard thing jerry she said it is not easy to talk of anything so painful from the moment we left new york wenham was strange he drank a good deal upon the steamer he used to talk sometimes in the most wild way we came to london he had an attack of delirium tremens i nursed him through it and took him into the country down into cornwall we took a small cottage on the outskirts of a fishing villagest catherines the place was called there we lived quietly for a time sometimes he was better sometimes worse the doctor in the village was very kind and came often to see him he brought a friend from the neighboring town and they agreed that with complete rest wenham would soon be better all the time my life was a miserable one he was not fit to be alone and yet he was a terrible companion i did my best i was with him half of every day sometimes longer i was with him till my own health began to suffer at last i could stand the solitude no longer i sent for my father he came and lived with us  the professor her listener murmured  she nodded  it was a little better then for me she went on except that poor wenham seemed to take such a dislike to my father however he hated every one in turn even the doctors who always did their best for him one day i admit i lost my temper we quarreled i could not help itlife was becoming insupportable he rushed out of the houseit was about three oclock in the afternoon i have never seen him since  the man was looking at her looking at her closely although he was blinking all the time  what do you think became of him he asked what do people think  she shook her head  the only thing he cared to do was swim she said his clothes and hat were found down in the little cove near where we had a tent  you think then that he was drowned the man asked  she nodded speech seemed to be becoming too painful  drowning her companion continued helping himself to brandy is not a pleasant death once i was nearly drowned myself one struggles for a short time and one thinksyes one thinks he added  he raised his glass to his lips and set it down  it is an easy death though he went on quite an easy death by the way were those clothes that were found of poor wenhams identified as the clothes he wore when he left the house  she shook her head  one could not say for certain she answered i never noticed how he was dressed he wore nearly always the same sort of things but he had an endless variety  and this was seven months agoseven months  she assented  poor wenham he murmured i suppose he is dead what are you going to do elizabeth  i do not know she replied soon i must go to the lawyers and ask for advice i have very little more money left i have written several times to new york to you to his friends but i have had no answer after all jerry i am his wife no one liked my marrying him but i am his wife i have a right to a share of his property if he is dead if he has deserted me surely i shall be allowed something i do not even know how rich he was  the man at her side smiled  much better off than i ever was he declared but elizabeth  well  there were rumors that before you left new york wenham converted very large sums of money into letters of credit and bonds very large sums indeed she shook her head he had a letter of credit for about a thousand pounds i think she said there is very little left of the money he had with him  and you find living here expensive i dare say  very expensive indeed she agreed with a sigh i have been looking forward to seeing you jerry i thought perhaps for the sake of old times you might advise me  of old times he repeated to himself softly elizabeth do you think of them sometimes  she was becoming more herself this was a game she was used to playing of old times indeed it seemed only yesterday that these two brothers who had the reputation in those days of being the richest young men in new york were both at her feet so far she had scarcely been fortunate there was still a chance however she looked up it seemed to her that he was losing his composure yes there was something of the old gleam in his eyes once he had been madly enough in love with her it ought not to be impossible  jerry she said i have told you these things it has been so very very painful for me wont you try now and be kind remember that i am all alone and it is all very difficult for me i have been looking forward to your coming i have thought so often of those times we spent together in new york wont you be my friend again wont you help me through these dark days  her hand touched his for a moment he snatched his away as though stung then he caught her fingers in his and held them as though in a vice she smiled the smile of conscious power the flush of beauty was streaming once more into her face poor fellow he was still in love then the fingers which had closed upon hers were burning what a pity that he was not a little more presentable  yes he muttered we must be friends elizabeth wenham had all the luck at first perhaps its going to be my turn now eh  he bent towards her she laughed into his face for a moment and then was once more suddenly colorless the smile frozen upon her lips she began to shiver  what is it he asked what is it elizabeth  nothing she faltered only i wishi do wish that you were not so much like wenham sometimes a trick of your voice the way you hold your headit terrifies me  he laughed oddly  you must get used to that elizabeth he declared i cant help being like him you know we were great friends always until you came i wonder why you preferred wenham  dont ask meplease dont ask me that she begged really i think he happened to be there just at the moment i felt like making a clean sweep of everything of leaving new york and every one and starting life again and i thought wenham meant it i thought i should be able to keep him from drinking and to help him start a new life altogether over here or on the continent  poor little woman he said you have been disappointed i am afraid  she sighed  i am only human you know she went on every one told me that wenham was a millionaire too see how much i have benefited by it i am almost penniless i do not know whether he is dead or alive i do not know what to do to get some money was wenham very rich jerry  the man laughed  oh he was very rich indeed he assured her it is terrible that you should be left like this we will talk about it together presently you and i in the meantime you must let me be your banker  dear jerry she whispered you were always generous  you have not spoken of the little prudedear miss beatrice he reminded her suddenly  elizabeth sighed  beatrice was a great trial from the first she declared you know how she disliked you bothshe was scarcely even civil to wenham and she would never have come to europe with us if father hadnt insisted upon it we took her down to cornwall with us and there she became absolutely insupportable she was always interfering between wenham and me and imagining the most absurd things one day she left us without a word of warning i have never seen her since  the man stared gloomily into his plate  she was a queer little thing he muttered she was good and she seemed to like being good  elizabeth laughed not quite pleasantly  you speak as though the rest of us she remarked were qualified to take orders in wickedness  he helped himself to more brandy  think back he said think of those days in new york the life we led the wild things we did week after week month after month the same eternal round of turning night into day of struggling everywhere to find new pleasures pulling vice to pieces like children trying to find the inside of their playthings  i dont like your mood in the least she interrupted  he drummed for a moment upon the tablecloth with his fingers  we were talking of beatrice you dont even know where she is now then  i have no idea elizabeth declared  she was with you for long in cornwall he asked  elizabeth toyed with her wineglass for a minute  she was there about a month she admitted  and she didnt approve of the way you and wenham behaved he demanded  apparently not she left us anyway she didnt understand wenham in the least i shouldnt be surprised elizabeth went on to hear that she was a hospital nurse or learning typing or a clerk in an office she was a young woman of gloomy ideas although she was my sister  he came a little closer towards her  elizabeth he said we will not talk any more about beatrice we will not talk any more about anything except our two selves  are you really glad to see me again jerry she asked softly  you must know it dear he whispered you must know that i loved you always that i adored you oh you knew it dont tell me you didnt you knew it elizabeth  she looked down at the tablecloth  yes i knew it she admitted softly  cant you guess what it is to me to see you again like this he continued  she sighed  it is something for me too to feel that i have a friend close at hand  come he said they are turning out the lights here you want to know about wenhams property let me come upstairs with you for a little time and i will tell you as much as i can from memory  he paid the bill helped her on with her cloak his fingers seemed like burning spots upon her flesh they went up in the lift in the corridors he drew her to him and she began to tremble  what is there strange about you jerry she faltered looking into his face you terrify me  you are glad to see me say you are glad to see me  yes i am glad she whispered  outside the door of her rooms she hesitated  perhaps she suggested faintlywouldnt it be better if you came tomorrow morning  once more his fingers touched her and again that extraordinary sense of fear seemed to turn her blood cold  no he replied i have been put off long enough you must let me in you must talk with me for half an hour i will go then i promise half an hour elizabeth havent i waited an eternity for it  he took the keys from her fingers and opened the door closing it again behind them she led the way into the sittingroom the whole place was in darkness but she turned on the electric light the cloak slipped from her shoulders he took her hands and looked at her  jerry she whispered you mustnt look at me like that you terrify me let me go  she wrenched herself free with an effort she stepped back to the corner of the room as far as she could get from him her heart was beating fiercely somehow or other neither of these two young men over whose lives she had certainly brought to bear a very wonderful influence had ever before stirred her pulses like this what was it she wondered what was the meaning of it why didnt he speak he did nothing but look and there were unutterable things in his eyes was he angry with her because she had married wenham or was he blaming her because wenham had gone there was passion in his face but such passion desire perhaps but what else she caught up a telegram which lay upon her writing desk and tore it open it was an escape for a moment she read the words stared and read them aloud incredulously it was from her father  jerry gardner sailed for new york today  she looked up at the man and as she looked her face grew gray and the thin sheet went quivering from her lifeless fingers to the floor then he began to laugh and she knew  wenham she shrieked wenham  there was murder in his face murder almost in his laugh  your loving husband he answered  she sprang for the door but even as she moved she heard the click of the bolt shot back he touched the electric switch and the room was suddenly in darkness she heard him coming towards her she felt his hot breath upon her cheek  my loving wife he whispered at last     chapter xxv the madman talks   tavernake turned on the light pritchard with a quick leap forward seized wenham around the waist and dragged him away elizabeth had fainted she lay upon the floor her face the color of marble  get some water and throw over her pritchard ordered  tavernake obeyed he threw open the window and let in a current of air in a moment or two the woman stirred and raised her head  look after her for a minute pritchard said i il lock this fierce little person up in the bathroom  pritchard carried his prisoner out tavernake leaned over the woman who was slowly coming back to consciousness  tell me about it she asked hoarsely where is he  locked up in the bathroom tavernake answered pritchard is taking care of him he wont be able to get out  you know who it was she faltered  i do not tavernake replied it isnt my business im only here because pritchard begged me to come he thought he might want help  she held his fingers tightly  where were you she asked  in the bathroom when you arrived then he bolted the door behind and we had to come round through your bedroom  how did pritchard find out  i know nothing about it tavernake replied i only know that he peered through the latticework and saw you sitting there at supper  she smiled weakly  it must have been rather a shock to him she said he has been convinced for the last six months that i murdered wenham or got rid of him by some means or other help me up  she staggered to her feet tavernake assisted her to an easy chair then pritchard came in  he is quite safe he announced sitting on the edge of the bath playing with a doll  she shivered  what is he doing with it she asked  showing me exactly with a shawl pin where he meant to have stabbed you pritchard answered drily now my dear lady he continued it seems to me that i have done you one injustice at any rate i certainly thought youd helped to relieve the world of that young person where did he come from perhaps you can tell me that  she shrugged her shoulders  i suppose i may as well she said listen you have seen what he was like tonight but you dont know what it was to live with him it was hellshe sobbedabsolute hell he drank he took drugs it was all his servant could do to force him even to make his toilet it was impossible it was crushing the life out of me  go on pritchard directed  there isnt much more to tell she continued i found an old farmhousethe loneliest spot in cornwall we moved there and i left himwith mathers i promised mathers that he should have twenty pounds a week for every week he kept his master away from me he has kept him away for seven months  what about that story of yoursabout his having gone in swimming pritchard asked  i wanted people to believe that he was dead she declared defiantly i was afraid that if you or his relations found him i should have to live with him or give up the money  pritchard nodded  and tonight you thought  i thought he was his brother jerry she went on the likeness was always amazing you know that i was told that jerry was in town i felt nervous somehow and wired to mathers i had his reply only last night he wired that wenham was quite safe and contented not even restless  that telegram was sent by wenham himself pritchard remarked i think you had better hear what he has to say  she shrank back  no i couldnt bear the sight of him again  i think you had better pritchard insisted i can assure you that he is quite harmless i will guarantee that  he left the room soon he returned his arm locked in the arm of wenham gardner the latter had the look of a spoilt child who is in disgrace he sat sullenly upon a chair and glared at every one then he produced a small crumpled doll with a thread of black cotton around its neck and began swinging it in front of him laughing at elizabeth all the time  tell us pritchard asked what has become of mathers  he stopped swinging the doll shivered for a moment and then laughed  i dont mind he declared i guess i dont mind telling you see whatever i was when i did it i am mad nowquite mad my friend pritchard here says i am mad i must have been mad or i shouldnt have tried to hurt that dear beautiful lady over there  he leered at elizabeth who shrank back  she ran away from me some time ago he went on sick to death of me she was she thought shed got all my money she hadnt theres plenty more plenty more she ran away and left me with mathers she was paying him so much a week to keep me quiet not to let me go anywhere where i should talk to keep me away from her so that she could live up here and see all her friends and spend my money and at first i didnt mind and then i did mind and i got angry with mathers and mathers wouldnt let me come away and three nights ago i killed mathers  there was a little thrill of horror he looked from one to the other by degrees their fear seemed to become communicated to him  what do you mean by looking like that all of you he exclaimed what does it matter he was only my manservant i am wenham gardner millionaire no one will put me in prison for that besides he shouldnt have tried to keep me away from my wife anyway it dont matter i am quite mad mad people can do what they like they have to stop in an asylum for six months and then theyre quite cured and they start again i dont mind being mad for six months elizabeth he whined come and be mad too you havent been kind to me theres plenty more moneyplenty more come back for a little time and ill show you  how did you kill mathers pritchard asked  i stabbed him when he was stooping down wenham gardner explained you see when i left college my father thought it would be good for me to do something i dare say it would have been but i didnt want to i studied surgery for six months the only thing i remember was just where to kill a man behind the left shoulder i remembered that mathers was a fat man and he stooped so that his coat almost burst i just leaned over picked out the exact spot and he crumpled all up i expect he went on youll find him there still no one comes near the place for days and days mathers used to leave me locked up and do all the shopping himself i expect hes lying there now some one ought to go and see  elizabeth was sobbing quietly to herself tavernake felt the perspiration break out upon his forehead there was something appalling in the way this young man talked  i dont understand why you all look so serious he continued no one is going to hurt me for this i am quite mad now you see i am playing with this doll sane men dont play with dolls i hope theyll try me in new york though i am wellknown in new york i know all the lawyers and the jurymen oh theyre up to all sorts of tricks in new york say you dont suppose theyll try me over here he broke off suddenly turning to pritchard i shouldnt feel so much at home here  take him away elizabeth begged take him away pritchard nodded  i thought youd better hear he said i am going to take him away now i shall send a telegram to the policestation at st catherines they had better go up and see whats happened  pritchard took his captive once more by the arm the young man struggled violently  i dont like you pritchard he shrieked i dont want to go with you i want to stay with elizabeth i am not really afraid of her shed like to kill me i know but shes too cleveroh shes too clever id like to stay with her  pritchard led him away  well see about it later on he said youd better come with me just now  the door closed behind them tavernake staggered up  i must go he declared i must go too  elizabeth was sobbing quietly to herself she seemed scarcely to hear him on the threshold tavernake turned back  that money he asked the money you were going to lend mewas that his  she looked up and nodded tavernake went slowly out     chapter xxvi a crisis   pritchard was the first visitor who had ever found his way into tavernakes lodgings it was barely eight oclock on the same morning tavernake holloweyed and bewildered sat up upon the sofa and gazed across the room  pritchard he exclaimed why what do you want  pritchard laid his hat and gloves upon the table already his first swift glance had taken in the details of the little apartment the overcoat and hat which tavernake had worn the night before lay by his side the table was still arranged for some meal of the previous day apart from these things a single glance assured him that tavernake had not been to bed  pritchard drew up an easychair and seated himself deliberately  my young friend he announced i have come to the conclusion that you need some more advice  tavernake rose to his feet his own reflection in the lookingglass startled him his hair was crumpled his tie undone the marks of his night of agony were all too apparent he felt himself at a disadvantage  how did you find me out he asked i never gave you my address  pritchard smiled  even in this country with a little help he said those things are easy enough i made up my mind that this morning would be to some extent a crisis with you you know tavernake i am not a man who says much but you are the right sort youve been in with me twice when i should have missed you if you hadnt been there  tavernake seemed to have lost the power of speech he had relapsed again into his place upon the sofa he simply waited  how in the name of mischief pritchard continued impressively you came to be mixed up in the lives of this amiable trio i cannot imagine i am not saying a word against miss beatrice mind all that surprises me is that you and she should ever have come together or having come together that you should ever have exchanged a word you see i am here to speak plain truths you are i take it a good sample of the hard stubborn middleclass briton these three people of whom i have spoken belongmiss beatrice perhaps by force of circumstancesbut still they do belong to the land of bohemia however when one has got over the surprise of finding you on intimate terms with miss beatrice there comes a more amazing thing you with hard common sense written everywhere in your face have been prepared at any moment for all i know are prepared now to make an utter and complete idiot of yourself over elizabeth gardner  still tavernake did not speak pritchard looked at him curiously  say he went on i have come here to do you a service if i can so far as i know at present this very wonderful young lady has kept on the right side of the law but see here tavernake shes been on the wrong side of everything thats decent and straight all her days she married that poor creature for his money and set herself deliberately to drive him off his head last nights tragedy was her doing not his though he poor devil will have to end his days in an asylum and the lady will have his money to make herself more beautiful than ever with now i am going to let you behind the scenes my young friend  then tavernake rose to his feet in the shabby little room he seemed to have grown suddenly taller he struck the crazy table with his clenched fist so that the crockery upon it rattled pritchard was used to seeing menstrong men toomoved by various passions but in tavernakes face he seemed to see new things  pritchard tavernake exclaimed i dont want to hear another word  pritchard smiled  look here he said what i am going to tell you is the truth what i am going to tell you id as soon say in the presence of the lady as here  tavernake took a step forward and pritchard suddenly realized the man who had thrown himself through that little opening in the wall one against three without a thought of danger  if you say a single word more against her tavernake shouted hoarsely i shall throw you out of the room  pritchard stared at him there was something amazing about this young mans attitude something which he could not wholly grasp he could see too that tavernakes words were so few simply because he was trembling under the influence of an immense passion  if you wont listen pritchard declared slowly i cant talk still youve got common sense i take it youve the ordinary powers of judging between right and wrong and knowing when a man or a womans honest i want to save you  silence tavernake exclaimed look here pritchard he went on breathing a little more naturally now you came here meaning to do the right thingi know that youre all right only you dont understand you dont understand the sort of person i am i am twentyfour years old i have worked for my own living up here in london since i was twelve i was a man so far as work and independence went at fifteen since then i have had my shoulder to the wheel i have lived on nothing i have made a little money where it didnt seem possible i have worried my way into posts which it seemed that no one could think of giving me but all the time i have lived in a little corner of the worldlike that  his finger suddenly described a circle in the air  you dont understandyou cant he went on but there it is i never spoke to a woman until i spoke to beatrice chance made me her friend i began to understand the outside of some of those things which i had never even dreamed of before she set me right in many ways i began to read think absorb little bits of the real world it was all wonderful then elizabeth came i met her too by accidentshe came to my office for a houseelizabeth  pritchard found something almost pathetic in the sudden dropping of tavernakes voice the softening of his face  i dont know how to talk about these things tavernake said simply theres a literature thats reached from before the bible to now full of nothing else its all as old as the hills i suppose i am about the only sane man in this city who knew nothing of it but i did know nothing of it and she was the first woman now you understand i cant hear a word against heri wont she may be what you say if so shes got to tell me so herself  you mean that you are going to believe any story she likes to put up  i mean that i am going to her tavernake answered and i have no idea in the world what will happenwhether i shall believe her or not i can see what you think of me he went on becoming a little more himself as the stress of unaccustomed speech passed him by i will tell you something that will show you that i realize a good deal i know the difference between beatrice and elizabeth less than a week ago i asked beatrice to marry me it was the only way i could think of the only way i could kill the fever  and beatrice pritchard asked curiously  she wouldnt tavernake replied after all why should she i have my way to make yet i cant expect others to believe in me as i believe in myself she was kind but she wouldnt  pritchard lit a cigar  look here tavernake he said you are a young man youve got your life before you and lifes a biggish thing empty out those romantic thoughts of yours roll up your shirt sleeves and get at it you are not one of these weaklings that need a womans whispers in their ears to spur them on you can work without that its only a chapter in your lifethe passing of these three people a few months ago you knew nothing of them let them go get back to where you were  then tavernake for the first time laugheda laugh that sounded even natural  have you ever found a man who could do that he asked the candle gives a good light sometimes but youll never think it the finest illumination in the world when youve seen the sun never mind me pritchard im going to do my best still but theres one thing that nothing will alter i am going to make that woman tell me her story i am going to listen to the way she tells it to me you think that where women are concerned i am a fool i am but there is one great boon which has been vouchsafed to foolsthey can tell the true from the false some sort of instinct i suppose elizabeth shall tell me her story and i shall know when she tells it whether she is what you say or what she has seemed to me  pritchard held out his hand  youre a queer sort tavernake he declared you take life plaguy seriously i only hope you ll get all out of it you expect to so long  tavernake opened the window after his visitor had gone and leaned out for some few minutes letting the fresh air into the close stifling room then he went upstairs bathed and changed his clothes made some pretense at breakfast went through his letters with methodical exactness at eleven oclock he set out upon his pilgrimage     chapter xxvii tavernake chooses   tavernake was kept waiting in the hall of the milan court for at least half an hour before elizabeth was prepared to see him he wandered aimlessly about watching the people come and go looking out into the flowerhung courtyard curiously unconscious of himself and of his errand unable to concentrate his thoughts for a moment yet filled all the time with the dull and uneasy sensation of one who moves in a dream every now and then he heard scraps of conversation from the servants and passersby referring to the last nights incident he picked up a paper but threw it down after only a casual glance at the paragraph he saw enough to convince him that for the present at any rate elizabeth seemed assured of a certain amount of sympathy the career of poor wenham gardner was set down in black and white with little extenuation little mercy his misdeeds in paris his career in new york spoke for themselves he was quoted as a type a decadent of the most debauched instincts to whom crime was a relaxation and vice a habit tavernake would read no more he might have been all these things and yet she had become his wife  at last came the message for which he was waiting as usual her maid met him at the door of her suite and ushered him in elizabeth was dressed for the part very simply with a suggestion even of mourning in her gray gown she welcomed him with a pathetic smile  once more my dear friend she said i have to thank you  her fingers closed upon his and she smiled into his face tavernake found himself curiously unresponsive it was the same smile and he knew very well that he himself had not changed yet it seemed as though life itself were in a state of suspense for him  you too are looking grave this morning my friend she continued oh how horrible it has all been within the last two hours i have had at least five reporters a gentleman from scotland yard another from the american ambassador to see me it is too terrible of course she went on wenhams people are doing all they can to make it worse they want to know why we were not together why he was living in the country and i in town they are trying to show that he was under restraint there as if such a thing were possible mathers was his own servantpoor mathers  she sighed and wiped her eyes still tavernake said nothing she looked at him a little surprised  you are not very sympathetic she observed please come and sit down by my side and i will show you something  he moved towards her but he did not sit down she stretched out her hand and picked something up from the table holding it towards him tavernake took it mechanically and held it in his fingers it was a cheque for twelve thousand pounds  you see she said i have not forgotten this is the day isnt it if you like you can stay and have lunch with me up here and we will drink to the success of our speculation  tavernake held the cheque in his fingers he made no motion to put it in his pocket she looked at him with a puzzled frown upon her face  do talk or say something please she exclaimed you look at me like some grim figure say something sit down and be natural  may i ask you some questions  of course you may she replied you may do anything sooner than stand there looking so grim and unbending what is it you want to know  did you understand that wenham gardner was this sort of man when you married him  she shrugged her shoulders slightly  i suppose i did she admitted  you married him then only because he was rich  she smiled  what else do women marry for my dear moralist she demanded it isnt my fault if it doesnt sound pretty one must have money  tavernake inclined his head gravely he made no sign of dissent  you two came over to england he went on with beatrice and your father beatrice left you because she disapproved of certain things  elizabeth nodded  you may as well know the truth she said beatrice has the most absurd ideas after a week with wenham i knew that he was not a person with whom any woman could possibly live his valet was really only his keeper he was subject to such mad fits that he needed some one always with him i was obliged to leave him in cornwall i cant tell you everything but it was absolutely impossible for me to go on living with him  beatrice tavernake remarked thought otherwise  elizabeth looked at him quickly from below her eyelids it was hard however to gather anything from his face  beatrice thought otherwise elizabeth admitted she thought that i ought to nurse him put up with him give up all my friends and try and keep him alive why it would have been absolute martyrdom misery for me she declared how could i be expected to do such a thing  tavernake nodded gravely  and the money he asked  well perhaps there i was a trifle calculating she confessed but you she added nodding at the cheque in his hand shouldnt grumble at that i knew when we were married that i should have trouble his people hated me and i knew that in the event of anything happening like this thing which has happened they would try to get as little as possible allowed me so before we left new york i got wenham to turn as much as ever he could into cash that we brought away with us  and who took care of it  elizabeth smiled  i did she answered naturally  tell me about last night tavernake said i suppose i am stupid but i dont quite understand  how should you she answered listen then wenham i suppose got tired of being shut up with mathers although i am sure i dont see what else was possible so he waited for his opportunity and when the man wasnt lookingwell you know what happened she added with a shiver he got up to london somehow and made his way to dover street  why dover street  i suppose you know elizabeth explained that wenham has a brotherjerrywho is exactly like him these two had rooms in dover street always where they kept some english clothes and a servant jerry gardner was over in london i knew that and was expecting to see him every day wenham found his way to the rooms dressed himself in his brothers clothes even wore his ring and some of his jewelry which he knew i should recognize and came here i believedyes i believed all the time she went on her voice trembling that it was jerry who was sitting with me once or twice i had a sort of terrible shiver then i remembered how much they were alike and it seemed to me ridiculous to be afraid it was not till we got upstairs till the door was closed behind me that he turned round and i knew  her head fell suddenly into her hands it was almost the first sign of emotion tavernake analyzed it mercilessly he knew very well that it was fear the cowards fear of that terrible moment  and now  now she went on more cheerfully no one will venture to deny that wenham is mad he will be placed under restraint of course and the courts will make me an allowance one thing is absolutely certain and that is that he will not live a year  tavernake half closed his eyes was there no sign of his suffering no warning note of the things which were passing out of his life the woman who smiled upon him seemed to see nothing the twitching of his fingers the slight quivering of his face she thought was because of his fear for her  and now she declared in a suddenly altered tone this is all over and done with now you know everything there are no more mysteries she added smiling at him delightfully it is all very terrible of course but i feel as though a great weight had passed away you and i are going to be friends are we not  she rose slowly to her feet and came towards him his eyes watched her slow graceful movements as though fascinated he remembered on that first visit of his how wonderful he had thought her walk she was still smiling up at him her fingers fell upon his shoulders  you are such a strange person she murmured you arent a little bit like any of the men ive ever known any of the men i have ever cared to have as friends there is something about you altogether different i suppose that is why i rather like you are you glad  for a single wild moment tavernake hesitated she was so close to him that her hair touched his forehead the breath from her upturned lips fell upon his cheeks her blue eyes were half pleading half inviting  you are going to be my very dear friend are you notleonard she whispered i do feel that i need some one strong like you to help me through these days  tavernake suddenly seized the hands that were upon his shoulders and forced them back she felt herself gripped as though by a vice and a sudden terror seized her he lifted her up and she caught a glimpse of his wild set face then the breath came through his teeth he shook all over but the fit had passed he simply thrust her away from him  no he said we cannot be friends you are a woman without a heart you are a murderess  he tore her cheque calmly in pieces and flung them scornfully away she stood looking at him breathing quickly white to the lips though the murder had gone from his eyes  beatrice warned me he went on pritchard warned me some things i saw for myself but i suppose i was mad now i know  he turned away her eyes followed him wonderingly  leonard she cried out you are not going like this you dont mean it  ever afterwards his restraint amazed him he did not reply he closed both doors firmly behind him and walked to the lift she came even to the outside door and called down the corridor  leonard come back for one moment  he turned his head and looked at her looked at her from the corner of the corridor steadfastly and without speech her fingers dropped from the handle of the door she went back into her room with shaking knees and began to cry softly afterwards she wondered at herself it was the first time she had cried for many years   tavernake walked to the city and in less than half an hours time found himself in mr martins office the lawyer welcomed him warmly  im jolly glad to see you tavernake he declared i hope youve got the money sit down  tavernake did not sit down he had forgotten indeed to take of his hat  martin he said i am sorry for you i have been fooled and you have to pay as well as i have i cant take up the option on the property i havent a penny toward it except my own money and you know how much that is you can sell my plots if you like and call the money your costs ive finished  the lawyer looked at him with wideopen mouth  what on earth are you talking about tavernake he exclaimed are you drunk by any chance  no i am quite sober tavernake answered i have made one or two bad mistakes thats all you have a power of attorney for me you can do what you like with my land make any terms you please goodday  but tavernake look here the lawyer protested springing to his feet i say tavernake he called out  but tavernake heard nothing or if he heard he took no notice he walked out into the street and was lost among the hurrying throngs upon the pavements     book two      chapter i new horizons   towards the skyline across the level country stumbling and crawling over the deephewn dikes wading sometimes through the mudoozing swamp tavernake who had left the small railway terminus on foot made his way that night steadily seawards as one pursued by some relentless and indefatigable enemy twilight had fallen like a mantle around him fallen over that great flat region of fens and pastureland and bog little patches of mist harbingers of the coming obscurity were being drawn now into the gradual darkness lights twinkled out from the farscattered homesteads here and there a dog barked some lonely bird seeking shelter called to its mate but of human beings there seemed to be no one in sight save the solitary traveler  tavernake was in grievous straits his clothes were caked with mud his hair tossed with the wind his cheeks pale his eyes set with the despair of that fierce upheaval through which he had passed for many hours the torture which had driven him back towards his birthplace had triumphed over his physical exhaustion now came the time however when the latter asserted itself with a halfstifled moan he collapsed sheer fatigue induced a brief but merciful spell of uneasy slumber he lay upon his back near one of the broader dikes his arms outstretched his unseeing eyes turned toward the sky the darkness deepened and passed away again before the light of the moon when at last he sat up it was a new world upon which he looked a strange land moonlit in places yet full of shadowy somberness he gazed wonderingly aroundfor the moment he had forgotten then memory came and with memory once more the stab at his heart he rose to his feet and went resolutely on his way  almost until the dawn he walked keeping as near as he could to that long monotonous line of telegraph posts yet avoiding the road as much as possible with the rising of the sun he crept into a wayside hovel and lay there hidden for hours hunger and thirst seemed like things which had passed him by it was sleep only which he craved sleep and forgetfulness  dusk was falling again before he found himself upon his feet starting out once more upon this strangely thoughtof pilgrimage this time he kept to the road plodding along with tired dejected footsteps which had in them still something of that restless haste which drove him ceaselessly onward as though he were indeed possessed of some unquiet spirit he was recovering now however a little of his natural common sense he remembered that he must have food and drink and he sought them from the wayside publichouse like an ordinary traveler conquering without any apparent effort that first invincible repugnance of his toward the face of any human being then on again across this strange land of windmills and spreading plains until the darkness forced him to take shelter once more that night he slept like a child with the morning the fever had passed from his blood a great wind blew in his face even as he opened his eyes touched to wakefulness by the morning sun a wind that came booming over the level places salt with the touch of the ocean and fragrant with the perfume of many marsh plants he was coming toward the sea now and within a very short distance from where he had spent the night he found a broad shining river stealing into the land with eager fingers he stripped himself and plunged in diving again and again below the surface swimming with long lazy strokes backwards and forwards afterwards he lay down in the warm dry grass dressed himself slowly and went on his way the wind which had increased now since the early morning came thundering across the level land bending the tops of the few scattered trees sending the sails of the windmills spinning bringing on its bosom now stronger than ever the flavor of the sea itself salt and stimulating tavernake told himself that this was a new world into which he was coming he would pass into its embrace and life would become a new thing  towards evening with many a thrill of reminiscence he descended a steep hill and walked into a queer timeforgotten village whose scattered redtiled cottages were built around an arm of the sea boldly enough now he entered the one inn which flaunted its sign upon the cobbled street and taking a seat in the stonefloored kitchen ate and drank and bespoke a bed later on he strolled down to the quay and made friends with the few fishermen who were loitering there they answered his questions readily although he found it hard at first to pick up again the dialect of which he himself had once made use the little place was scarcely changed all progress indeed seemed to have passed it by there were a handful of fishermen a boatbuilder and a fishcurer in the village there was no other industry save a couple of small farmhouses on the outskirts of the place no railway within twelve miles tourists came seldom excursionists never in the half contented half animallike expression which seemed common to all the inhabitants tavernake read easily enough the history of their uneventful days it was such a shelter as this indeed for which he had been searching  on the second night after his arrival he walked with the boatbuilder upon the wooden quay the boatbuilders name was nicholls and he was a man of some means deacon of the chapel with a fair connection as a jobbing carpenter and possessor of the only horse and cart in the place  nicholls tavernake said you dont remember me do you  the boatbuilder shook his head slowly and ponderously  there was richard tavernake who farmed the low fields he remarked reminiscently maybe youre a son of his now i come to think of it he had a boy apprenticed to the carpentering  i was the boy tavernake answered i soon had enough of it and went to london  youm grown out of all knowledge nicholls declared but i mind you now so youve been in london all these years  ive been in london tavernake admitted and i think of the two that spreybythesea is the better place  sprey is well enough the boatbuilder confessed well enough for a man who isnt set on change  change tavernake asserted grimly is an overrated joy i have had too much of it in my life i think that i should like to stay here for some time  the boatbuilder was surprised but he was a man of heavy and deliberate turn of mind and he did not commit himself to speech tavernake continued  i used to know something of carpentering in my younger days he said and i dont think that i have forgotten it all i wonder if i could find anything to do down here  matthew nicholls stroked his beard thoughtfully  the folk round about are not over partial to strangers he observed and youm been away so long i reckon theres not many asd recollect you and as for carpentering jobs theres tom lake over at lesser blakeney and his brother down at brancaster besides me on the spot as you might say its a poor sort of opening thered be if you ask my opinion especially for one like yourself as as got education  i should be satisfied with very little tavernake persisted i want to work with my hands i should like to forget for a time that i have had any education at all  that do seem mightily queer to me nicholls remarked thoughtfully  tavernake smiled  come he said it isnt altogether unnatural i want to make something with my hands i think that i could build boats why do you not take me into your yard i could do no harm and i should not want much pay  matthew nicholls stroked his beard once more and this time he counted fifty as was his custom when confronted with a difficult matter he had no need to do anything of the sort for nothing in the world would have induced him to make up his mind on the spot as to so weighty a proposal  its not likely that youre serious he objected you are a young man and stronglimbed i should imagine but youve educationone can tell it by the way you pronounce your words its but a poor living after all to be made here  i like the place tavernake declared doggedly i am a man of small needs i want to work all through the day work till i am tired enough to sleep at night work till my bones ache and my arms are sore i suppose you could give me enough to live on in a humble way  take a bite of supper with me nicholls answered in these serious affairs my daughter has always her say we will put the matter before her and see what she thinks of it  they lingered about the quay until the light from wells lighthouse flashed across the sea and until in the distance they could hear the moaning of the incoming tide as it rippled over the bar and began to fill the tidal way which stretched to the wooden pier itself then the two men made their way along the village street through a field and into the little yard over which stood the sign of matthew nicholls boatbuilder at one corner of the yard was the cottage in which he lived  youll come right in mr tavernake he said the instincts of hospitality stirring within him as soon as they had passed through the gate we will talk of this matter together you and me and the daughter  tavernake seemed on his introduction to the household like a man unused to feminine society perhaps he did not expect to find such a type of her sex as ruth nicholls in such a remote neighborhood she was thin and her cheeks were paler than those of any of the other young women whom he had seen about the village her eyes too were darker and her speech different there was nothing about her which reminded him in the least of the child with whom he had played tavernake watched her intently presently the idea came to him that she too was seeking shelter  supper was a simple meal but it was well and deftly served the girl had the gift of moving noiselessly she was quick without giving the impression of haste to their guest she was courteous but her recollection of him appeared to be slight and his coming but a matter of slight interest after she had cleared the cloth however and produced a jar of tobacco her father bade her sit down with them  mr tavernake he began ponderously is thinking some of settling down in these parts ruth  she inclined her head gravely  it appears her father continued that he is sick and tired of the city and of headwork he is wishful to come into the yard with me if so be that we could find enough work for two  the girl looked at their visitor and for the first time there was a measure of curiosity in her earnest gaze tavernake was in his way good enough to look upon he was wellbuilt his shoulders and physique all spoke of strength his features were firmly cut although his general expression was gloomy but for a certain moroseness an uncouthness which he seemed to cultivate he might even have been deemed goodlooking  mr tavernake would make a great mistake she said hesitatingly it is not well for those who have brains to work with their hands it is not a place for those to live who have been out in the world at most seasons of the year it is but a wilderness sometimes there is little enough to do even for father  i am not ambitious for overmuch work or for overmuch money miss nicholls tavernake replied i will be frank with you both things out in the world there went ill with me it was not my fault but they went ill with me what ambitions i had are finishedfor the present at any rate i want to rest i want to work with my hands to grow my muscles again to feel my strength to believe that there is something effective in the world i can do i have had a shock a disappointmentcall it what you like  the old man nicholls nodded deliberately  well he pronounced its a big change to make i never thought of help in the yard before when theres been more than i could do ive just let it go come for a week on trial leonard tavernake if we are of any use to one another we shall soon know of it  the girl who had been looking out into the night came back  you are making a mistake mr tavernake she said you are too young and strong to have finished your battle  he looked at her steadily and sighed it was only too obvious that hers had been fought and lost  perhaps he replied softly you are right perhaps it is only the rest i want we shall see     chapter ii the simple life   so tavernake became a boatbuilder summer passed into winter and this hamlet by the sea seemed indeed as though it might have been one of the forgotten spots upon the earth save for that handful of cottages the two farmhouses a few hundred yards inland and the deserted hall halfhidden in its grove of pine trees there was no dwellingplace nor any sign of human habitation for many miles for eight hours a day tavernake worked mostly out of doors in the little yard which hung over the beach sometimes he rested from his labors and looked seaward looked around him as though rejoicing in that unbroken solitude the emptiness of the gray ocean the loneliness of the land behind what things there were which lay back in the cells of his memory no person there knew for he spoke of his past to no one not even to ruth he was a good workman and he lived the simple life of those others without complaint or weariness there was nothing in his manner to denote that he had been used to anything else the village had accepted him without question it was only ruth who still gravely but kindly enough disapproved of his presence  one day she came and sat with him as he smoked his afterdinner pipe leaning against an overturned boat with his eyes fixed upon that line of gray breakers  you spend a good deal of your time thinking mr tavernake she remarked quietly  too much he admitted at once too much miss nicholls i should be better employed planing down that mast there  you know that i did not mean that she said reprovingly only sometimes you make meshall i confess italmost angry with you  he took his pipe from his mouth and knocked out the ashes as they fell on the ground so he looked at them  all thought is wasted time he declared grimly all thought of the past the past is like those ashes it is dead and finished  she shook her head  not always she replied sometimes the past comes to life again sometimes the bravest of us quit the fight too soon  he looked at her questioningly almost fiercely her words however seemed spoken without intent  so far as mine is concerned he pronounced it is finished there is a memorial stone laid upon it and no resurrection is possible  you cannot tell she answered no one can tell  he turned back to his work almost rudely but she stayed by his side  once she remarked reflectively i too went a little way into the world i was a schoolteacher at norwich i was very fond of some one there we were engaged then my mother died and i had to come back to look after father  he nodded  well  we are a long way from norwich she continued quietly soon after i left the man whom i was fond of grew lonely he found some one else  you have forgotten him tavernake asked quickly  i shall never forget him she replied that part of life is finished but if ever my father can spare me i shall go back to my work again sometimes those work the best and accomplish the most who carry the scars of a great wound  she turned away to the house and after that it seemed to him that she avoided him for a time at any rate she made no further attempt to win his confidence propinquity however was too much for both of them he was a lodger under her fathers roof it was scarcely possible for them to keep apart saturdays and sundays they walked sometimes for miles across the frostbound marshes in the quickening atmosphere of the darkening afternoons when the red sun sank early behind the hills and the twilight grew shorter every day they watched the seabirds together and saw the wild duck come down to the pools felt the glow of exercise burn their cheeks felt too that common and nameless exultation engendered by their loneliness in the solitude of these beautiful empty places in the evenings they often read together for nicholls although no drinker never missed his hour or so at the village inn tavernake in time began to find a sort of comfort in her calm sexless companionship he knew very well that he was to her as she was to him something human something that filled an empty place yet something without direct personality little by little he felt the bitterness in his heart grow less then a late springlate at any rate in this quaint corner of the worldstole like some wonderful enchantment across the face of the moors and the marshes yellow gorse starred with golden clumps the brown hillside wild lavender gleamed in patches across the silverstreaked marshes the dead hedges came blossoming into life crocuses long lines of yellow and purple crocuses broke from waxy buds into starlike blossoms along the front of matthew nichollss garden and with the coming o spring tavernake found himself suddenly able to thin of the past it was a new phase of life he could sit down and think of those things that had happened to him without fearing to be wrecked by the storm often he sat out looking seaward thinking of the days when he had first met beatrice of those early days of pleasant companionship of the marvelous avidity with which he had learned from her only when elizabeths face stole into the foreground did he spring from his place and turn back to his work  one day tavernake sat poring over the weekly local paper reading it more out of curiosity than from any real interest suddenly a familiar name caught his eye his heart seemed to stop beating for a moment and the page swam before his eyes quickly he recovered himself and read        the queens hall unthank road                   norwich                  twice daily              professor franklin           assisted by his daughter            miss beatrice franklin      will give his refined and marvelous      entertainment comprising hypnotism feats      of second sight never before attempted on      any stage thoughtreading and a brief      lecture upon the connection between ancient      superstitions and the extraordinary      developments of the new science       professor franklin can be consulted privately      by letter or by appointment  address for this      weekthe golden cow bells lane norwich  twice tavernake read the announcement then he went out and found ruth  ruth he told her there is something calling me back perhaps for good  for the first time she gave him her hand  now you are talking like a man once more she declared go and seek it comeback and say goodbye to us if you will but throw your tools into the sea  tavernake laughed and looked across at his workshop  i dont believe he said that youve any confidence in my boat  im not sure that i would sail with you she answered even if you ever finished it a laborers work for a laborers hand you must go back to the other things     chapter iii old friends meet   the professor set down his tumbler upon the zincrimmed counter he was very little changed except that he had grown a shade stouter and there was perhaps more color in his cheeks he carried himself too like a man who believes in himself in the small publichouse he was without doubt an impressive figure  my friends he remarked our hosts whiskey is good at the same time i must not forget  youll have one with me professor a youth at his elbow interrupted two special whiskies miss if you please  the professor shrugged his shouldersit was a gesture which he wished every one to understand he was suffering now the penalty for a popularity which would not be denied  you are very kind sir he said very kind indeed as i was about to say i must not forget that in less than half an hour i am due upon the stage it does not do to disappoint ones audience sir it is a poor place this musichall but it is full they tell me packed from floor to ceiling at eightthirty i must show myself  a marvelous turn too professor declared one of the young men by whom he was surrounded  i thank you sir the professor replied turning towards the speaker glass in hand there have been others who have paid me a similar compliment others i may say not unconnected with the aristocracy of your countrynot unconnected either i might add he went on with the very highest in the land those who from their exalted position have never failed to shower favors upon the more fortunate sons of our profession the science of which i am to some extent the pioneernot a drop more my young friend say im in dead earnest this time no more indeed  the young man in knickerbockers who had just come in banged the head of his cane upon the counter  youll never refuse me professor he asserted confidently im an old supporter i am ive seen you in blackburn and manchester and twice here just as wonderful as ever and that young lady of yours professor begging your pardon if she is your daughter as no doubt she is why shes a nut and no mistake  the professor sighed he was in his element but he was getting uneasy at the flight of time  my young friend he said your face is not familiar to me but i cannot refuse your kindly offer it must be the last however absolutely the last  then tavernake directed here from the musichall pushed open the swing door and entered the professor set down his glass untasted tavernake came slowly across the room  you havent forgotten me then professor he remarked holding out his hand  the professor welcomed him a little limply something of the bombast had gone out of his manner tavernakes arrival had reminded him of things which he had only too easily forgotten  this is very surprising he faltered very surprising indeed do you live in these parts  not far away tavernake answered i saw your announcement in the papers  the professor nodded  yes he said i am on the warpath again i tried resting but i got fat and lazy and the people wouldnt have it sir he continued recovering very quickly something of his former manner the number of offers i got through my agents by every post was simply astoundingastounding  i am looking forward to seeing your performance this evening tavernake said politely in the meantime  i know what you are thinking of the professor interrupted well well give me your arm and we will walk down to the hall together my friends the professor added turning round i wish you all a goodnight  then the door was pushed halfway open and tavernakes heart gave a jump it was beatrice who stood there very pale very tired and much thinner even than the beatrice of the boardinghouse but still beatrice  father she exclaimed do you know that it is nearly  then she saw tavernake and said no more she seemed to sway a little and tavernake taking a quick step forward grasped her by the hands  dear sister he cried you have been ill  she was herself again almost in a moment  ill never in my life she replied only i have been hurryingwe are late already for the performanceand seeing you there well it was quite a shock you know walk down with us and tell me all about it tell us what you are doing hereor rather dont talk for a moment it is all so amazing  they turned down the narrow cobbled street the professor walking in the middle of the roadway swinging his cane a very imposing and wonderful figure with the tails of his frockcoat streaming in the wind his long hair only halfhidden by his hat he hummed a tune to himself and affected not to take any notice of the other two then tavernake suddenly realized that he had done a cowardly action in leaving her without a word  there is so much to ask she began at last but you have come back  she looked at his workmans clothes  what have you been doing she asked sharply  working tavernake answered good work too i am the better for it dont mind my clothes beatrice i have been mad for a time but after all it has been a healthy madness  it was a strange thing that you did she saidyou disappeared  he nodded  some day he told her i may perhaps be able to make you understand just now i dont think that i could  it was elizabeth she whispered softly  it was elizabeth he admitted  they said no more then till they reached the hall she stopped at the door and put out her hand timidly  i shall see you afterwards she ventured  do you mind my coming to the performance he asked  she hesitated  a few moments ago she remarked smiling i was dreading your coming now i think that you had better it will be all over at ten oclock and i shall look for you outside you are living in norwich  i shall be here for tonight at any rate he answered  very well then she said afterwards we will have a talk  tavernake passed through the scattered knot of loiterers at the door and bought a seat for himself in the little musichall which notwithstanding the professors boast was none too well filled it was a place of the oldfashioned sort with small tables in the front and waiters hurrying about serving drinks the people were of the lowest order and the atmosphere of the room was thick with tobacco smoke a young woman in a flaxen wig and boys clothes was singing a popular ditty marching up and down the stage and interspersing the words o f her song with grimaces and appropriate action tavernake sat down with a barelysmothered groan he was beginning to realize the tragedy upon which he had stumbled a comic singer followed who in a dress suit several sizes too large for him gave an imitation of a popular irish comedian then the curtain went up and the professor was seen standing in front of the curtain and bowing solemnly to a somewhat unresponsive audience a minute later beatrice came quietly in and sat by his side there was nothing new about the show tavernake had seen the same thing before with the exception that the professor was perhaps a little behind the majority of his fellowcraftsmen the performance was finished in dead silence and after it was over beatrice came to the front and sang she was a very unusual figure in such a place in a plain black evening gown with black gloves and no jewelry but they encored her heartily and she sang a song from the musical comedy in which tavernake had first seen her a sudden wave of reminiscence stirred within him his thoughts seemed to go back to the night when he had waited for her outside the theatre and they had had supper at imanos to the day when he had left the boardinghouse and entered upon his new life it was more like a dream than ever now  he rose and quitted the place immediately she had finished waiting in the street until she appeared she came out in a few minutes  father is going to a supper she announced at the inn where he has a room for receiving people will you come home with me for an hour then we can go round and fetch him  i should like to tavernake answered  her lodgings were only a few steps awaya strange little house in a narrow street she opened the front door and ushered him in  you understand of course she said smiling that we have abandoned the haunts of luxury altogether  he looked around at the tiny room with its struggling fire and horsehair sofa linoleum for carpet oleographs for pictures and he shivered not for his own sake but for hers on the sideboard were some bread and cheese and a bottle of ginger beer  please imagine she begged taking the pins from her hat that you are in those dear comfortable rooms of ours down at chelsea draw that easychair up to what there is of the fire and listen you smoke still  i have taken to a pipe he admitted  then light it and listen she went on smoothing her hair for a minute in front of the lookingglass you want to know about elizabeth of course  yes he said i want to know  elizabeth on the whole beatrice continued got out of all her troubles very well her husbands people were wild with her but elizabeth was very clever they were never able to prove that she had exercised more than proper control over poor wenham he died two months after they took him to the asylum they offered elizabeth a lump sum to waive all claims to his estate and she accepted it i think that she is now somewhere on the continent  and you he asked why did you leave the theatre  it was a matter of looking after my father she explained you see while he was there with elizabeth he had too much money and nothing to do the consequence was that he was alwayswell i suppose i had better say itdrinking too much and he was losing all his desire for work i made him promise that if i could get some engagements he would come away with me so i went to an agent and we have been touring like this for quite a long time  but what a life for you tavernake exclaimed couldnt you have stayed on at the theatre and found him something in london  she shook her head  in london she said he would never have got out of his old habits and then she went on hesitatingly you understand that the public want something else besides the hypnotism  tavernake interrupted her ruthlessly  of course i understand he declared i was there tonight i understood at once why you were not very anxious for me to go the people cared nothing at all about your fathers performance they simply waited for you you would get the same money if you went round without him  she nodded a trifle shamefacedly  i am so afraid some one will tell him she confessed they nearly always ask me to leave out his part of the performance they have even offered me more money if i would come alone but you see how it is he believes in himself he thinks he is very clever and he believes that the public like his show it is the only thing which helps him to keep a little selfrespect he thinks that my singing is almost unnecessary  tavernake looked into that faint glimmer of miserable fire he was conscious of a curious feeling in his throat how little he knew of life the pathos of what she had told him the thought of her bravely traveling the country and singing at thirdrate musichalls never taking any credit to herself simply that her father might still believe himself a man of talent appealed to him irresistibly he suddenly held out his hand  poor little beatrice he exclaimed dear little sister  the hand he gripped was cold she avoided his eyes  youyou mustnt she murmured please dont  he held out his other hand and half rose but her lips suddenly ceased to quiver and she waved him back  no leonard she begged please dont do or say anything foolish since we do meet again though like this i am going to ask you one question what made you come to me and ask me to marry you that day  he looked away something in her eyes accused him  beatrice he confessed i was a thickheaded ignorant fool without understanding i came to you for safety i was afraid of elizabeth i was afraid of what i felt for her i wanted to escape from it  she smiled piteously  it wasnt a very brave thing to do was it she faltered  it was mean he admitted it was worse than that but beatrice he went on i was missing you horribly you did leave a big empty place when you went away i am not going to excuse myself about elizabeth i lived through a time of the strangest most marvelous emotions one could dream of then the thing came to an end and i felt as though the bottom had gone out of life i supposei loved her he continued hesitatingly i dont know i only know that she filled every thought of my brain that she lived in every beat of my heart that i would have gone down into hell to help her and then i understood that morning she told me something of the truth about herself not meaning tounconsciouslyjustifying herself all the time not realizing that every word she said was damnable and then there didnt seem to be anything else left and i had only one desire i turned my back upon everything and i went back to the place where i was born a little fishing village for the last thirty miles i walked i shall never forget it when i got there what i wanted was work work with my hands i wanted to build something to create anything that i could labor upon i became a boat builderi have been a boatbuilder ever since  and now she asked  beatrice  she turned and faced him she looked into his eyes very searchingly very wistfully  beatrice he said i ask you once more only differently will you marry me now ill find some work ill make enough money for us do you remember he went on how i used to talk how i used to feel that i had only to put forth my strength and i could win anything ill feel like that again beatrice if youll come to me  she shook her head slowly she looked away from him with a sigh she had the air of one who has sought for something which she has failed to find  you mustnt think of that again leonard she told him it would be quite impossible this is the only way i can save my father we have a tour that will take us the best part of another year  but you are sacrificing yourself he declared i will keep your father  it isnt that only she replied for one thing i couldnt let you and for another it isnt only the money its the work as long as hes made to think that the public expect him every night he keeps off drinking too much there is nothing else in the whole world which would keep him steady dont look as though you didnt understand leonard he is my father you know and there isnt anything more terrible than to see any one who has a claim on us give way to anything like that you maynt quite approve but please believe that i am doing what i feel to be right  the little fire had gone out beatrice glanced at the clock and put on her jacket again  i am sorry leonard she said but i think i must go and fetch father now you can walk with me there if you will it has been very good to see you again for the rest i dont know what to say to you do you think that it is quite what you were meant forto build boats  i dont seem to have any other ambition he answered wearily when i read in the paper this morning that you and your father were here things seemed suddenly different i came at once i didnt know what i wanted until i saw you but i know now and it isnt any good  no good at all she declared cheerfully it wont be very long leonard before something else comes along to stir you i dont think you were meant to build boats all your life  he rose and took up his hat she was waiting for him at the door again they passed down the narrow street  tell me beatrice he begged is it because you dont like me well enough that you wont listen to what i ask  for a moment she half closed her eyes as though in pain then she laughed not perhaps very naturally they were standing now by the door of the public house  leonard she said you are very young in years but you are a baby in experience mind there are other reasons why i could notwould not dream of marrying you other reasons which are absolutely sufficient butdo you know that you have asked me twice and you have never once said that you cared that you have never once looked as though you cared no dont please she interrupted dont explain anything you see a woman always knowstoo well sometimes  she nodded and passed in through the swingingdoors standing out there in the narrow crooked street tavernake heard the clapping and applause which greeted her entrance he heard her fathers voice some one struck a note at the pianoshe was going to sing very slowly he turned away and walked down the cobbled hill     chapter iv pritchards good news   late in the afternoon of the following day ruth came home from the village and found tavernake hard at work on his boat she put down her basket and stopped by his side  so you are back again she remarked  yes i am back again  and nothing has happened  nothing has happened he assented wearily nothing ever will happen now  she smiled  you mean that you will stay here and build boats all your life  that is what i mean to do he announced  she laid her hand upon his shoulder  dont believe it leonard she said there is other work for you in the world somewhere just as there is for me  he shook his head and she picked up her basket again smiling  your time will come as it comes to the rest of us she declared cheerfully you wont want to sit here and bury your talents in the sands all your days have you heard what is going to happen to me  no something good i hope  my fathers favorite niece is coming to live with usthere are seven of them altogether and farming doesnt pay like it used to so margaret is coming here father says that if she is as handy as she used to be i may go back to the schools almost at once  tavernake was silent for a moment then he got up and threw down his tools  great heavens he exclaimed if i am not becoming the most selfish brute that ever breathed do you know the first thought i had was that i should miss you you are right young woman i must get out of this  she disappeared into the house smiling and tavernake called out to nicholls who was sitting on the wall  mr nicholls he asked how much notice do you want  matthew nicholls removed his pipe from his mouth  why i dont know that im particular he replied being as you want to go between you and me im gettin fat and lazy since you came there aint enough work for two and thats all there is to it and being as youre young and active why ive left it to you and look at my arms  he held them up  used to be all muscle now theyre nothin but bloomin pap and no but two glasses of beer a day extra have i drunk just to pass the time you can stay if you will young man but you can go out fishin and leave me the work and ill pay you just the same for im not saying that i dont like your company or you can go when you please and thats the end of it  matthew nicholls spat upon the stones and replaced his pipe in his mouth tavernake came in and sat down by his side  look here he said i believe you are right ill stay another week but ill take things easy you get on with the boat now ill sit here and have a smoke  nicholls grunted but obeyed and for the next few days tavernake loafed on his return one afternoon from a long walk he saw a familiar figure sitting upon the sea wall in front of the workshop a familiar figure but a strange one in these parts it was mr pritchard in an american felt hat and smoking a very black cigar he leaned over and nodded to tavernake who was staring at him aghast  hallo old man he called out run you to earth you see  yes i see tavernake exclaimed  come right along up here and lets talk pritchard continued  tavernake obeyed pritchard looked him over approvingly tavernake was roughly dressed in those days but as a man he had certainly developed  say youre looking fine his visitor remarked what wouldnt i give for that color and those shoulders  it is a healthy life tavernake admitted do you mean that youve come down here to see me  thats so pritchard announced down here to see you and for no other reason not but that the scenery isnt all it should be and that sort of thing he went on but i am not putting up any bluff about it its you i am here to talk to are you ready shall i go straight ahead  if you please tavernake said slowly filling his pipe  you dropped out of things pretty sudden pritchard continued it didnt take me much guessing to reckon up why between you and me you are not the first man whos been up against it on account of that young woman dont stop me he begged i know how youve been feeling it was a right good idea of yours to come here others before you have tried the shady side of new york and paris and its the wrong treatment its hell thats what it is for them now that young womanwe got to speak of heris about the most beautiful and the most fascinating of her sexill grant that to start withbut she isnt worth the life of a snail much less the life of a strong man  you are quite right tavernake confessed shortly i know i was a foola fool if i could think of any adjective that would meet the case id use it but there it is i chucked things and i came here you havent come down to tell me your opinion of me i suppose  not by any manner of means pritchard admitted i came down first to tell you that you were a fool if it was necessary since you know it it isnt well pass on to the next stage and that is what are you going to do about it  it is in my mind at the present moment tavernake announced to leave here the only trouble is i am not very keen about london  pritchard nodded thoughtfully  thats all right he agreed londons no place for a man anyway you dont want to learn the usual tricks of moneymaking money thats made in the cities is mostly made with stained fingers i have a different sort of proposal to make  go ahead tavernake said what is it  a new country pritchard declared altering the angle of his cigar a virgin land mountains and valleys great rivers to be crossed all sorts of cold and heat to be borne with a land rich with mineralssome say gold but never mind that there is oil in parts theres tin theres coal and theres thousands and thousands of miles of forest youre a surveyor  passed all my exams tavernake agreed tersely  you are the man for out yonder pritchard insisted ive two years vacationdead sick of this city life i amand i am going to put you on the track of it you dont know much about prospecting yet i reckon  nothing at all  you soon shall pritchard went on well start from winnipeg a few horses some guides and a couple of tents well spend twenty weeks my friend without seeing a town what do you think of that  gorgeous tavernake muttered  twenty weeks well strike westward i know the way to set about the whole job i know one or two of the capitalists too and if we dont map out some of the grandest estates in british columbia why my name aint pritchard  but i havent a penny in the world tavernake objected  thats where youre lying pritchard remarked pulling a newspaper from his pocket see the advertisement for yourself leonard tavernake something to his advantage well down i went to those lawyersyour old lawyer it wasmartin i told him i was on your track and he saidfor heavens sake send the fellow along say tavernake he made me laugh the way he described your bursting in upon him and telling him to take your land for his costs and walking out of the room like something almighty why he worked that thing so that they had to buy your land and they took him into partnership hes made a pot of money and needs no costs from you and theres the money for your land and what he had of yours besides waiting for you  tavernake smoked stolidly at his pipe his eyes were out seaward but his heart was beating to a new and splendid music to start life again a mans life out in the solitudes out in the great open spaces it was gorgeous this he turned round and grasped pritchard by the shoulder  i say he exclaimed why are you doing all this for me pritchard  pritchard laughed  you did me a good turn he said and youre a man youve the pluckthats what i like you knew nothing you were as green and ignorant as a young man from behind the counter of a country shop but my god youd got the right stuff and i meant getting even with you if i could youll leave here with me tomorrow and in three weeks we sail  ruth came smiling out from the house  wont you bring your friend in to supper mr tavernake she begged its good news i hope she added lowering her voice a little  its the best tavernake declared the best     chapter v beatrice refuses   a week later tavernake was in london a visit to his friend mr martin had easily proved the truth of pritchards words and he found himself in possession of a sum of money at least twice as great as he had anticipated he stayed at a cheap hotel in the strand and made purchases under pritchards supervision for the first few days he was too busy for reflection then pritchard let him alone while he ran over to paris and tavernake suddenly realized that he was in the city to which he had thought never to return he passed the back of the theatre where he had waited for beatrice he looked up at the entrance of the milan court he lunched alone and with a curious mixture of feelings at the little restaurant where he had supped with beatrice it was over that part of his life over and finished yet with his natural truthfulness he never attempted to disguise from himself the pain at his heart three times in one day he found himself under some pretext or another in imanos restaurant once in the middle of the street he burst into a fit of laughter it was while pritchard was in london and he asked him a question  pritchard he remarked you area man of experience did any one ever care for two women at the same time  pritchard removed his cigar from his teeth and stared at his companion  why my young friend he replied ive found no trouble myself in being fond of a dozen  tavernake smiled and said no more pritchard was one of the good fellows of the world but there were things which were hidden from him yet tavernake who had fallen into a habit during his solitude of analyzing his sensations was puzzled by this one circumstance that when he thought of elizabeth though his heart never failed to beat more quickly the sense of shame generally stole over him and when he thought of beatrice a curious loneliness a loneliness that brought with it a pain seemed suddenly to make the hours drag and his pleasures flavorless for two days he was puzzled then his habit of taking long walks helped him toward a solution in a small outlying musichall in the eastend of london he saw the same announcement that he had noticed in the norfolk newspaperprofessor franklin in large type and miss beatrice franklin in small  that night he attended the musichall the scene was practically a repetition of the one in norwich only with additions the professors bombastic performance met with scarcely any applause its termination was indeed interrupted by catcalls and whistles from the gallery beatrices songs on the other hand were applauded more vociferously than ever she had hard work to avoid a third encore  at the end of the performance tavernake made his way to the stagedoor and waited the neighborhood was an unsavory one and the building itself seemed crowded in among a row of shops of the worst order fish stalls and a glaring gin palace long before beatrice came out tavernake could hear the professors voice down the covered passage the professors voice apparently raised in anger  undutiful behavior thats what i call itundutiful  they emerged into the street the professor very much the same as usual beatrice paler with a pathetic droop about her mouth tavernake came eagerly forward  beatrice he cried holding out his hand  the professor drew back beatrice stood stillfor a moment it seemed as though she were about to faint tavernake grasped her hands  i am so sorry he exclaimed clumsily i ought not to have come up like that  she smiled a little wan smile  i am quite all right she replied only the heat inside was rather trying and even out here the atmosphere isnt too good is it how did you find us out  by chance again tavernake answered i have news may i walk with you a few steps  she glanced timidly toward her father the professor was holding aloof in dignified silence  perhaps tavernake said quickly you would take supper with me i am going abroad and i should like to say goodbye properly a bottle of champagne and some supper what do you say professor  the professor suffered his features to relax  a very admirable idea he declared where shall we go  is it too late to get to imanos tavernake suggested  the professor hesitated  a taxicab he remarked would do it if  he paused and tavernake smiled  a taxicab it shall be he decided i am in funds just for the moment come along both of you and ill tell you all about it  he made her take his arm although her fingers did no more than touch his coat sleeve  pritchard came and dug me out he continued i am going abroad with him its sort of prospecting in some new country at the back of british columbia we see what we can find and then go to a financiers and start companies mining companies and oil fieldsanything i am off in a week  beatrice half closed her eyes they had hailed a passing cab and she sank back among the cushions with a sigh of relief  dear leonard she murmured i am so glad so very happy for your sake this is the sort of thing which i hoped would happen  and now tell me about yourselves he went on  there was a sudden silence tavernake was conscious that beatrices clothes were distinctly shabbier that the professors hat was shiny the professor cleared his throat  i do not wish he said to intrude our private matters upon one who although i will not call him a stranger is assuredly not one of our old friends at the same time i admit that a little trouble has arisen between beatrice and myself and we were discussing it at the moment you arrived i shall appeal to you now as an unprejudiced member of the audience tonight mr tavernake you will give me your honest opinion  certainly tavernake promised with a sinking premonition of what was to come  what i complain of the professor began speaking with elaborate and impressive slowness is that my performance is hurried over and that too long a time is taken up by beatrices songs the management remark upon the applause which her efforts occasionally ensure but as i would point out to you sir he continued a performance such as mine makes too deep an impression for the audience to show their appreciation of it by such vulgar methods as handclapping and whistling you follow me i trust mr tavernake  why yes of course tavernake admitted  i take a sincere and earnest interest in my work the professor declared and i feel that when it has to be scamped that my daughter may sing a musichall ditty the result is to say the least of it undignified for some reason or other i have been unable to induce the management to see entirely with me but my point is that beatrice should sing one song only and that the additional ten minutes should be occupied by me in either a further exposition of my extraordinary powers as a hypnotist or in a little address to the audience upon the hidden sciences now i appeal to you mr tavernake as a young man of common sense what is your opinion  tavernake much too honest to be capable in a general way of duplicity was on the point of giving it but he caught beatrices imploring gaze her lips were moving he hesitated  of course he began slowly you have to try and put yourself into the position of the major part of the audience who are exceedingly uneducated people it is very hard to give an opinion professor i must say that your entertainment this evening was listened to with rapt interest  the professor turned solemnly towards his daughter  you hear that beatrice he said severely you hear what mr tavernake says with rapt interest  at the same time tavernake went on without a doubt miss beatrices songs were also extremely popular it is rather a pity that the management could not give you a little more time  failing that sir the professor declared my point is as i explained before that beatrice should give up one of her songs what you have said this evening more than ever confirms me in my view  beatrice smiled thankfully at tavernake  well she suggested at any rate we will leave it for the present sometimes i think though father that you frighten them with some of your work and you must remember that they come to be amused  that the professor admitted is the most sensible remark you have made beatrice there is indeed something terrifying in some of my manifestations terrifying even to myself who understand so thoroughly my subject however as you say we will dismiss the matter for the present the thought of this supper party is a pleasant one do you remember mr tavernake the night when you and i met in the balcony at imanos  perfectly well tavernake answered  now i shall test your memory the professor continued with a knowing smile can you remember sir the brand of champagne which i was then drinking and which i declared if you recollect was the one which best agreed with me the one brand worth drinking  i am afraid i dont remember that tavernake confessed restaurant life is a thing i know so little of and i have only drunk champagne once or twice in my life  dear dear me the professor exclaimed you do astonish me sir well that brand was veuve clicquot and you may take my word for it mr tavernake and you may find this knowledge useful to you when you have made a fortune in america and have become a man of pleasure there is no wine equal to it veuve clicquot sir if possible of the year 1899 though the year 1900 is quite drinkable  veuve clicquot tavernake repeated ill remember it for this evening  the professor beamed  my dear he said to beatrice mr tavernake will think that i had a purpose in testing his memory  beatrice smiled  and hadnt you father she asked  they all laughed together  well it is pleasant the professor admitted to have ones weaknesses ministered to especially when one is getting on in life he added with a ponderous sigh never mind we will think only of pleasant subjects this evening it will be quite interesting mr tavernake to hear you order the supper  i shant attempt it tavernake answered i shall pass it on to you  this reminds me the professor declared of the old days i feel sure that this is going to be a thoroughly enjoyable evening we shall think of it often mr tavernake when you lie sleeping under the stars why what a wonderful thing these taxicabs are you see we have arrived  they secured a small table in a corner at imanos and tavernake found himself curiously moved as he watched beatrice take off her worn and much mended gloves and look around uneasily at the other guests her clothes were indeed shabby and there were hollows now in her cheeks  again he felt that pain a pain for which he could not account suddenly america seemed so far away the loneliness of the great continent became an actual and appreciable thing the professor was very much occupied ordering the supper tavernake leaned across the table  do you remember our first supper here beatrice he asked  she nodded with an attempt at brightness which was a little pitiful  yes she replied i remember it quite well and now please leonard dont talk to me again until i have had a glass of wine i am tired and worn out that is all  even tavernake knew that she was struggling against the tears which already dimmed her eyes he filled her glass himself the professor set his own down empty with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur  i think he said that you will agree with me about this vintage beatrice this is what will bring color into your cheeks my little girl he continued turning to tavernake will soon need a holiday i am hoping presently to be able to arrange a short tour by myself and if so i shall send her to the seaside now i want you particularly to try the fish saladthe second dish there beatrice let me help you  presently the orchestra began to play the warmth of the room the wine and the foodtavernake had a horrible idea once that she had eaten nothing that daybrought back some of the color to beatrices cheeks and a little of the light to her eyes she began to talk something in the old fashion she avoided however any mention of that other supper they had had together as time went on the professor who had drunk the best part of two bottles of wine and was talking now to a friend became almost negligible tavernake leaned across the table  beatrice he whispered you are not looking well i am afraid that life is getting harder with you  she shook her head  i am doing what i must she answered please dont sympathize with me i am hysterical i think tonight it will pass off  but beatrice he ventured timidly could one do nothing for you i dont like these performances and between you and me we know they wont stand your fathers show much longer it will certainly come to an end soon why dont you try and get back your place at the theatre you could still earn enough to keep him  already i have tried she replied sorrowfully my place is filled up you see she added with a forced laugh i have lost some of my looks leonard i am thinner too of course i shall be all right presently but its rather against me at these westend places  again he felt that pain at his heart he was sure now that he was beginning to understand  beatrice he whispered give it upmarry me i will take care of him  the flush of color faded from her cheeks she shivered a little and looked at him piteously  leonard she pleaded you mustnt i really am not very strong just now we have finished with all thatit distresses me  but i mean it he begged somehow i have felt all sorts of things since we came in here i think of that night and i believei do believe that what came to me before was madness it was not the same  she was trembling now  leonard she implored if you care for me at all be quiet father will turn round directly and i cant bear it i shall be your very faithful friend i shall think of you through the long days before we meet again but dontdont spoil this last evening  the professor turned round his face mottled his eyes moist a great goodhumor apparent in his tone  well i must say he declared that this has been a most delightful evening i feel immensely better and you too i hope beatrice  she nodded smiling  i trust that when mr tavernake returns the professor continued he will give us the opportunity of entertaining him in much the same manner it will give me very much pleasure also beatrice and if sir he proceeded during your stay in new york you will mention my name at the goats club or the mosquito club you will i think find yourself received with a hospitality which will surprise you  tavernake thanked him and paid the bill they walked slowly down the room and tavernake was curiously reluctant to release the little hand which clasped his  i have kept this to the last beatrice said in a low tone elizabeth is in london  he was curiously unmoved  yes he murmured  i should like youi think it would be well for you to go and see her she went on you know leonard you were such a strange person in those days you may imagine things you may not realize where you are i think that you ought to go and see her now now that you have lived through some suffering now that you understand things better will you  yes i will go tavernake promised  beatrice glanced round towards where her father was standing  i dont want him to know she whispered i dont want either him or myself to be tempted to take any of her money she is living at claridges hotel go there and see her before you leave for your new life  he stood at the door and watched them go down the strand the professor flamboyant walking erect with flying coattails and his big cigar held firmly between his teeth beatrice a wan figure in her black clothes clinging to his arm tavernake watched them until they disappeared conscious of a curious excitement a strange pain a sense of revelation when at last they were out of sight and he turned back for his coat and hat his feet were suddenly leaden the band was playing the last selectionit was the air which beatrice had sung only that night at the eastend musichall with a sudden overpowering impulse he turned and strode down the strand in the direction where they had vanished it was too late there was no sign of them     chapter vi understanding comes too late   tavernakes first impression of elizabeth was that he had never even in his wildest thoughts done her justice he had never imagined her so wonderfully so alluringly beautiful she had received him after a very long delay in her sittingroom at claridges hotela large apartment furnished more like a drawingroom she was standing when he entered almost in the center of the room dressed in a long lace cloak and a hat with a drooping black feather she looked at him as the door opened as though for a moment half puzzled then she laughed softly and held out her hands  why of course i remember you she exclaimed and to think that when i had your card i couldnt imagine where i had heard the name before you are my dear estate agents clerk who wouldnt take my money and who was so wretchedly rude to me twelve months ago  tavernake was quite cool he found himself wondering whether this was a pose or whether she had indeed forgotten he decided that it was a pose  i was also he reminded her one night in your rooms at the milan court when your husband  she stopped him with an imperative gesture  spare me please she begged those were such terrible daysso dull too i remember that you were quite one of the brightest spots you were absolutely different from every one i had ever met before and you interested me immensely  she looked at him and slowly shook her head  you look very nice she said your clothes fit you and you are most becomingly tanned but you dont look half so awkward and so adorable  i am sorry he replied shortly  and you came to see me she went on that was really nice of you you were quite fond of me once you know tell me has it lasted  that is exactly what i came to find out he answered deliberately so far i am inclined to think that it has not lasted  she made a little wry face and drew his arm through hers  come and sit down and tell me why she insisted be honest now is it because you think i am looking older  i have thought of you for many hours a day for months tavernake said slowly and i never imagined you so beautiful as you seem now  she clapped her hands  and you mean it too she exclaimed there is just the same delightfully convincing note in your tone i am sure that you mean it please go on adoring me mr tavernake i have no one who interests me at all just now there is an italian count who wants to marry me but he is terribly poor and a young australian who follows me everywhere but i am not sure about him there is an english boy too who is going to commit suicide if i dont say yes to him this week on the whole i think i am rather sorry that people know i am a widow tell me mr tavernake are you going to adore me too  i dont think so tavernake answered i rather believe that i am cured  she shrugged her shoulders and laughed musically  but you say that you still think i am beautiful she went on and i am sure my clothes are perfectthey came straight from paris i hope you appreciate this lace she added drawing it through her fingers my figure is just as good too isnt it  she stood up and turned slowly round then she sat down suddenly taking his hand in hers  please dont say that you think i have grown less attractive she begged  as regards your personal attractions tavernake replied i imagine that they are at least as great as ever if you want the truth i think that the reason i do not adore you any longer is because i saw your sister last night  saw beatrice she exclaimed where  she was singing at a miserable eastend musichall so that her father might find some sort of employment tavernake said the people only forbore to hiss her fathers turn for her sake she goes about the country with him heaven knows what they earn but it must be little enough beatrice is shabby and thin and pale she is devoting the best years of her life to what she imagines to be her duty  and how does this affect me elizabeth asked coldly  only in this way tavernake answered you asked me how it was that i could find you as beautiful as ever and adore you no longer the reason is because i know you to be wretchedly selfish i believed in you before everything that you did seemed right that was because i was a fool because you had filled my brain with impossible fancies because i saw you and everything that you did through a distorted mirror  have you come here to be rude she asked him  not in the least he replied i came here to see whether i was cured  she began to laugh very softly at first but soon she threw herself back among the cushions and laid her hand caressingly upon his shoulder  oh you are just the same she cried just the same dear truthful bundle of honesty and awkwardness and ignorance so you are going to be victim of beatrices bow and spear after all  i have asked your sister to marry me tavernake admitted she will not  she was very wise elizabeth declared wiping the tears from her eyes as an experience you are delightful as a husband you would be terribly impossible are you going to stay and take me out to dinner this evening im sure you have a dress suit now  tavernake shook his head  i am sorry he said i have already an engagement  she looked at him curiously was it really true that he had become indifferent she was not used to men who escaped  tell me she asked abruptly why did you come i dont understand you are here and you pass your time being rude to me i ask you to take me to dinner and you refuse do you know that scarcely a man in london would not have jumped at such a chance  very likely tavernake answered i have no experience in such matters i only know that i am going to do something else  something you want to do very much she whispered  i am going down to a little musichall in whitechapel tavernake said and i am going to meet your sister and i am going to put her in a cab and take her to have some supper and i am going to worry her until she promises to be my wife  you are certainly a devoted admirer of the family she laughed perhaps you were in love with her all the time  perhaps i was he admitted  she shook her head  i dont believe it she said i think you were quite fond of me once you have such absurdly oldfashioned ideas or i think that you would be fond of me now  tavernake rose to his feet  i am going he declared this will be goodbye tomorrow i am going to british columbia  the laughter faded for a moment from her face she was suddenly serious  dont go she begged listen i know i am not good like beatrice but i do like youi always did i suppose it is that wonderful truthfulness of yours you are a different type from the men one meets i am rather a reckless person it is such a comfort sometimes to meet any one like you you seem such an anchorage stay and talk to me for a little time take me out tonight you asked me to go with you once you know and i would not tonight it is i who ask you  he shook his head slowly  this is goodbye he said firmly i suppose after all you were not unkind to me in those days but you taught me a very bitter lesson i came to you today in fear and trembling i was afraid perhaps that the worst was not over that there was more yet to come now i know that i am free  she stamped her foot  you shall not go away like that she declared  he smiled  do you think i do not understand he continued it is only because i am able to go because the touch of your fingers that look in your eyes do not drive me half mad now that you want me to stay you would like to try your powers once more i think not i am satisfied that i am cured indeed but perhaps it is safer to risk nothing  she pointed to the door  very well then she ordered you can go  he bowed and already his fingers were on the handle suddenly she called to him  leonard leonard  he turned round she was coming towards him with her arms outstretched her eyes were full of tears there were sobs in her voice  i am so lonely she begged i have thought of you so much dont go away unkindly stay with me for this evening at any rate you can see beatrice at any time it is i who need you most now  he looked around at the splendid apartment he looked at the woman whose fingers glittering with jewels rested upon his shoulders then he thought of beatrice in her shabby black gown and wan little face and very gently he removed her hands  no he said i do not think that you need me any more than i need you this is a caprice of yours you know it and i know it is it worth while to play with one another  her hands fell to her sides she turned half away but she said nothing tavernake with a sudden impulse which had in it nothing of passionvery little indeed of affectionlifted her fingers to his lips and passed out of the room he descended the stairs filled with a wonderful sense of elation a buoyancy of spirit which he could not understand as he walked blithely to his hotel however he began to realize how much he had dreaded this interview he was a free man after all the spell was broken he could think of her now as she deserved to be thought of as a consummate woman of the world selfish heartless conscienceless he was well out of her toils it was nothing to him if even he had known that at that moment she was lying upon the sofa to which she had staggered as he left the room weeping bitterly  for over an hour tavernake endured the smells and the bad atmosphere of that miserable little musichall watching eagerly each time the numbers were changed then at last towards the end of the program the manager appeared in front  ladies and gentlemen he announced i regret very much to inform you that owing to the indisposition of the young lady miss beatrice franklin and her father are unable to appear tonight i have pleasure in announcing an extra turn namely the sisters de vere in their wonderful burlesque act  there was a murmur of disapprobation mingled with some cheering tavernake left his place and walked around to the back of the hall presently the manager came out to him  i am sorry to trouble you sir tavernake said but i heard your announcement just now from the front can you give me the address of professor franklin i am a friend and i should like to go and see them  the manager pointed to the stagedoorkeeper  this man will give it you he announced shortly its quite close i shall look in myself after the show to know how the young lady is  tavernake procured the address and set out in the taxicab which he had kept waiting the driver listened to the direction doubtfully  its a poor sort of neighborhood sir he remarked  weve got to go there tavernake told him  they reached it in a few minutes a miserable street indeed tavernake knocked at the door of the house to which he was directed with sinking heart a man collarless and half dressed in carpet slippers opened the door after a few moments waiting  well what is it he asked gruffly  is professor franklin here tavernake inquired  the man seemed as though he were about to slam the door but thought better of it  if youre a friend of the professors as he calls himself he said and youve any money to shell out why youre welcome but if youre only asking out of curiosity let me tell you that he used to lodge here but hes gone and if id had my way hed have gone a week ago him and his daughter too  i dont understand tavernake protested i thought the young lady was ill  she may be ill or she may not the man replied sulkily all i know is that they couldnt pay their rent couldnt pay their food bill couldnt pay for the drinks the old man was always sending out for so tonight i spoke up and theyve gone  at least you know where to tavernake exclaimed  i aint no sort of an idea the man declared take my word for it straight guvnor i know no more about where they went to than the man in the moon except that im well shut of them and theres a matter of eighteen and sixpence if you care to pay it  ill give you a sovereign tavernake promised if you will tell me where they are now  whats the good of making silly conditions like that the man grumbled if i knew where they were id earn the quid soon enough but i dont and thats the long and the short of it and if you aint going to pay the eighteen and six well ive answered all the questions i feel inclined to  ill make it two pounds tavernake promised im going to sail for america tomorrow morning early and i must see them first  the man leaned forward  look here he said if i knew where they was a quid would be quite good enough for me but i dont and thats straight if you want to look for them i should try one of the doss houses as likely there as anywhere  he slammed the door and tavernake turned away a sudden despair had seized him he looked up and down the street he looked away beyond and thought of the miles and miles of streets the myriads of chimneys the huge branches of the great city stretching far and wide at eight oclock the next morning he must leave for southampton was it too late after all that he had discovered the truth     chapter vii in a virgin country   one night tavernake began to laugh he had grown a long brown beard and the hair was over his ears he was wearing a gray flannel shirt a handkerchief tied around his neck and a pair of worn riding breeches held up by a belt he had kicked his boots off at the end of a long day and was lying in the moonlight before a fire of pine logs whose smoke went straight to the starhung sky no word had been spoken for the last hour tavernakes fit of mirth came with as little apparent reason as the puffs of wind which every now and then stole down from the mountain side and made faint music in the virgin forests  pritchard turned over on his side and looked at him cigars had for many weeks been an unknown thing and he was smoking a corncob pipe full of coarse tobacco  stumbled across a joke anywhere he asked  im afraid no one but myself would see the humor of it tavernake answered i was thinking of those days in london i was thinking of beatrices horror when she discovered that i was wearing readymade clothes and the amazement of elizabeth when she found that i hadnt a dress suit its odd how cramped life gets back there  pritchard nodded pressing the tobacco down into the bowl of his pipe with his forefinger  youre right tavernake he agreed one loses ones sense of proportion men in the cities are all alike they go about in disguise  i should like tavernake said inconsequently to have mr dowling out here  amusing fellow pritchard inquired  tavernake shook his head smiling  not in the least he answered only he was a very small man out here it is difficult to keep small dont you feel it pritchard these mountains make our hills at home seem like dustheaps the skies seem loftier look down into that valley its gigantic immense  pritchard yawned  theres a little place in the bowery he began  oh i dont want to know any more about new york tavernake interrupted lean back and close your eyes smell the cinnamon trees listen to that night bird calling every now and then across the ravine theres blackness if you like theres depth its like a cloak of velvet to look into but you cant see the bottomno not in the daytime listen  pritchard sat up for a few moments neither spoke a dozen yards or so off a scattered groupthe rest of the partywere playing cards around a fire the green wood crackled an occasional murmur of voices a laugh or an exclamation came to their ears but for the rest an immense a wonderful silence a silence which seemed to spread far away over that weird halfinvisible world tavernake listened reverently  isnt it marvelous he exclaimed we havent seen a human being except our own party for three days there probably isnt one within hearing of us now very likely no living person has ever set foot in this precise spot  oh its big pritchard admitted its big and its restful but it isnt satisfying it does for you for a time because you started life wrong and you needed a reaction but for meah well he added i hear the call right across these thousands of miles of forests and valley and swamp i hear the electric cars and the clash of the overhead railway i see the flaring lights of broadway and i hear the babel of tongues i am going back to it tavernake theres plenty to go on with weve done more than carry out our program  back to new york tavernake muttered disconsolately  so youre not ready yet pritchard demanded  heavens no tavernake answered who would be what is there in new york to make up for this  pritchard was silent for a moment  well he said one of us must be getting back near civilization the syndicate will be expecting to hear from us besides weve reports enough already its time something was decided about that oil country weve done some grand work there tavernake  tavernake nodded he was lying on his side and his eyes were fixed wistfully southward over the glimmering moonlit valley over the great wilderness of virgin pine woods which hung from the mountains on the other side away through the cleft in the hills to the plains beyond chaotic a world unseen  if you like to go on for a bit pritchard suggested slowly theres no reason why you shouldnt take mccleod and richardson with you and pete and half the horses and strike for the tin country on the other side of the yolite hills so long as we are here its quite worth it if you can stick it out  tavernake drew a long breath  id like to go he admitted simply i know mccleod is keen about prospecting further south you see most of our finds so far have been among the oil fields  settled pritchard declared tomorrow then we part im for the valley and i reckon ill strike the railway to chicago in a week gee whiz new york will seem good  you think that the syndicate will be satisfied with what we have done so far tavernake asked  his companion smiled  if they arent theyll be fools i reckon theres enough oil fields here for seven companies therell be a bit for us too tavernake i guess dont you want to come back to new york and spend it  tavernake laughed once more but this time his laugh was not wholly natural  spend it he repeated what is there to spend it on uncomfortable clothes false plays drinks that are bad for you food thats half poisoned atmosphere that stifles my god pritchard is there anything in the world like this stretch out your arms man lie on your back look up at the stars let that wind blow over your face listen  they listened and again they heard nothing yet again there seemed to be that peculiar quality about the silence which spoke of the vastness of space  pritchard rose to his feet  new york and the fleshpots for me he declared keep in touch and good luck old man  next day at dawn they parted and tavernake with his three companions set his face towards an almost undiscovered tract of land their progress was slow for they were all the time in a country rich with possibilities for weeks they climbed climbed till they reached the snows and the wind stung their faces and they shivered in their rugs at night they came to a land of sparser vegetation of fewer and wilder animals where they heard the baying of wolves at night and saw the eyes of strange animals glisten through the thicket as the flames of their evening fire shot up toward the sky then the long descent began the long descent to the great plain now their faces were bronzed with a sun ever hotter ever more powerful no longer the snow flakes beat their cheeks they came slowly down into a land which seemed to tavernake like the biblical land of canaan three times in ten days they had to halt and make a camp while tavernake prepared a geographical survey of likelylooking land  mccleod came up to tavernake one day with a dulllooking lump in his hand glistening in places  copper he announced shortly its what ive been looking for all the time no end to it theres something bigger than oil here  they spent a month in the locality and every day mccleod became more enthusiastic after that it was hard work to keep him from heading homeward at once  i tell you sir he explained to tavernake theres millions there millions between those four stakes of yours whats the good of more prospecting theres enough there in a square acre to pay the expenses of our expedition a thousand times over lets get back and make reports we can strike the railway in ten days from hereperhaps sooner  you go tavernake said leave me pete and two of the horses  the man stared at him in surprise  whats the good of going on alone he asked youre not a mining expert or an oil man you cant go prospecting by yourself  i cant help it tavernake answered its something in my blood i suppose i am going on think youll strike that railway and in a month you will be back in new york dont you imagine when youre there when you hear the clatter and turmoil of it when you see the pale crowds chivvying one another about to pick the dollars from each others pocketsdont you believe youll long for these solitudes the big empty places great possibilities the silence think of it man what is there beyond those mountains i wonder  mccleod sighed  youre right he said one may never get so far out again our fortunes will keep i suppose and anyhow we ought to strike a telegraph station in about a fortnight well go right ahead then  in ten days they dropped ten thousand feet they came to a land where their throats were always dry where the trees and shrubs seemed like property affairs from a theatre where they plunged their heads into every pool that came to wash their noses and mouths from the red dust that seemed to choke them up they found tin and oil and more copper then by slow stages they passed on to a land of great grassy plains of blue grass miles and miles of it and suddenly one day they came to the telegraph posts rough pine trees unstripped of their bark with a few sagging wires tavernake looked at them as robinson crusoe might have looked at man fridays footsteps it was the first sign of human life which they had seen for months  its a real world we are in after all he sighed somehow or other i thoughti thought wed escaped     chapter viii back to civilization   pritchard trim and neat a new yorker from the careful arrangement of his tie to the tips of his patent boots gazed with something like amazement at the man whom he had come to meet at the grand central station tavernake looked indeed like some splendid bushman whose life has been spent in the kingdom of the winds and the sun and the rain he was inches broader round the chest and carried himself with a new freedom his face was bronzed right down to the neck his beard was fullgrown his clothes travelstained and worn he seemed like a breath of real life in the great new york depot surrounded by streams of blackcoated palecheeked men  pritchard laughed softly as he passed his arm through his friends  come my briton he said my primitive man i have rooms for you in a hotel close here a bath and a mint julep then ill take you to a tailors what about the big country its better than your salt marshes eh better than your little fishing village better than building boats  you know it tavernake answered i feel as though id been drawing in life for month after month have i got to wear boots like yourspatent  got to be done pritchard declared  and the hatoh my heavens tavernake groaned ill never become civilized again  well see pritchard laughed say tavernake it was a great trip of ours everythings turning out marvelously the oil and the copper are big manbig i tell you i reckon your five thousand dollars will be well on the way to half a million im pretty near there myself  it was not until later on when he was alone that tavernake realized with how little interest he listened to his companions talk of their success it was so short a time ago since the building up of a fortune had been the one aim upon which every nerve of his body was centered curiously enough now he seemed to take it as a matter of course  on second thoughts ill send a tailor round to the hotel pritchard declared ive rooms myself next yours we can go out and buy boots and the other things afterwards  by nightfall tavernakes wardrobe was complete even pritchard regarded him with a certain surprise he seemed somehow to have gained a new dignity  say but you look great he exclaimed they wont believe it at the meeting tomorrow that you are the man who crossed the yolite mountains and swam the peraneek river thats a wonderful country you were in tavernake after you left the tracks  they were in broadway with the roar of the city in their ears and tavernake lifting his face starwards suddenly seemed to feel the silence once more the perfume of the pine woods the scent of nature herself freed through all these generations of any presence of man  ill never keep away from it he said softly ill have to go back  pritchard smiled  when your reports in shape and the dollars are being scooped in theyll send you back fast enoughthat is if you still want to go he remarked i tell you leonard tavernake our city men here are out for the dollars over on your side a man makes a million or so and hes had enough one fortune here only seems to whet the appetite of a new yorker by the way he added after a moments hesitation does it interest you to know that an old friend of yours is in new york  tavernakes head went round swiftly  who is it he asked  mrs wenham gardner  tavernake set his teeth  no he said slowly i dont know that that interests me  glad of it pritchard went on i can tell you i dont think things have been going extra well with the lady shes spent most of what she got from the gardner family and she doesnt seem to have had the best of luck with it either i came across her by accident she is staying at a flashy hotel but its in the wrong quartersecondratequite secondrate  i wonder whether we shall see anything of her tavernake remarked  do you want to pritchard asked shell probably be at martins for lunch at the plaza for tea and rectors for supper shes not exactly the lady to remain hidden you know  well avoid those places then if you are taking me around tavernake said  youre cured are you pritchard inquired  yes i am cured tavernake answered cured of that and a great many other things thanks to you you found me the right tonic  tonic pritchard repeated meditatively that reminds me this way for the best cocktail in new york  the night was not to pass however without its own especial thrill for tavernake the two men dined together at delmonicos and went afterwards to a roof garden a new form of entertainment for tavernake and one which interested him vastly they secured one of the outside tables near the parapets and below them new york stretched a flaming phantasmagoria of lights and crude buildings down the broad avenues with their towering blocks their street cars striking fire all the time like toys below the people streamed like insects away to the hudson where the great ferry boats ablaze with lights went screaming across the dark waters tavernake leaned over and forgot there was so much that was amazing in this marvelous city for a man who had only just begun to find himself  the orchestra stationed within a few yards of him commenced to play a popular waltz and pritchard to talk tavernake turned his fascinated eyes from the prospect below  my young friend pritchard said you are up against it tonight take a drink of your wine and then brace yourself  tavernake did as he was told  what is this danger he asked whats wrong anyway  pritchard had no need to answer as tavernake set his glass down his eyes fell upon the little party who had just taken the table almost next to theirs there were walter crease major post two men whom he had never seen before in his lifeheavy of cheek both dulleyed but dressed with a rigid observance of the fashion of the city in short dinner coats and black ties and between them was elizabeth tavernake gripped the sides of his chair and looked yes she had altered her eyebrows were a trifle made up there was a tinge in her hair which he did not recognize a touch of color in her cheeks which he doubted yet her figure and her wonderful presence remained that art of wearing her clothes as no other woman could she was easily the most noticeablelooking of her sex among all the people there tavernake heard the sound of her voice and once more the thrill came and passed she was the same elizabeth thank god he thought that he was not the same tavernake  do you wish to go pritchard asked  tavernake shook his head  not i he answered this place is far too fascinating cant we have some more wine this is my treat and pritchard why do you look at me like that you are not supposing for a moment that i am capable of making an ass of myself again  pritchard smiled in a relieved fashion  my young friend he said i have lived in the world so long and seen so many strange things especially between men and women that i am never surprised at anything i thought youd shed your follies as your grip upon life had tightened but one is never sure  tavernake sighed  oh i have shed the worst of my follies he answered i only wish  he never finished his sentence elizabeth had suddenly seen him for a moment she leaned forward as though to assure herself that she was not mistaken then she half sprang to her feet and sat down again her lips were partedshe was once more bewilderingly beautiful  mr tavernake she cried come and speak to me at once  tavernake rose without hesitation and walked firmly across the few yards which separated them she held out both her hands  this is wonderful she exclaimed you in new york and i have wondered so often what became of you  tavernake smiled  it is my first night here he said for two years i have been prospecting in the far west  then i saw your name in the papers she declared it was for the manhattan syndicate wasnt it  tavernake nodded and one of the men of the party leaned forward with interest  youre going to make millions and millions she assured him you always knew you would didnt you  i am afraid that i was almost too confident he answered but certainly we have been quite fortunate  one of elizabeths companions intervenedhe was the one who had pricked up his ears at the mention of the manhattan syndicate  say elizabeth he remarked id like to meet your friend  elizabeth with a frown performed the introduction  mr anthony cruxhallmr tavernake  mr cruxhall held out a fat white hand on the little finger of which glittered a big diamond ring  say are you the mr tavernake that was surveyor to the prospecting party sent out by the manhattan syndicate he inquired  i was tavernake admitted briefly i still am i hope  then youre just the man i was hoping to meet mr cruxhall declared wont you sit down with us right here id like to talk some about that trip im interested in the syndicate  tavernake shook his head  ive had enough of work for a time he said besides i couldnt talk about it till after my report to the meeting tomorrow  just a few words mr cruxhall persisted well have a bottle of champagne eh  you will excuse me i am sure tavernake replied when i tell you that it would not be correct on my part to discuss my trip until after i have handed in my report to the company i am very glad to have seen you again mrs gardner  but you are not going she exclaimed in dismay  i have left mr pritchard alone tavernake answered  elizabeth smiled and waved her hand to the solitary figure  our friend mr pritchard again she remarked well it is really a curious meeting isnt it i wondershe lifted her head to his and her eyes called him closer to hershave you forgotten everything  he pointed over the roofs of the houses his back was to the river and he pointed westward  i have been in a country where one forgets he answered i think that i have thrown the knapsack of my follies away i think that it is buried there are some things which i do not forget but they are scarcely to be spoken of  you are a strange young man she said was i wrong or were you not once in love with me  i was terribly in love with you tavernake confessed  yet you tore up my cheque and flung yourself away when you found out that my standard of morals was not quite what you had expected she murmured havent you got over that quixoticism a little leonard  he drew a deep sigh  i am thankful to say he declared earnestly that i have not got over it that if anything my prejudices are stronger than ever  she sat for a moment quite still and her face had become hard and expressionless she was looking past him past the line of lights out into the blue darkness  somehow she said softly i always prayed that you might remember you were the one true thing i had ever met you were in earnest it is past then  it is past tavernake answered bravely  the music of a hungarian waltz came floating down to them she half closed her eyes her head moved slowly with the melody tavernake looked away  will you come and see me just once she asked suddenly i am staying at the delvedere in fortysecond street  thank you very much tavernake replied i do not know how long i shall be in new york if i am here for a few days i shall take my chance at finding you at home  he bowed and returned to pritchard who welcomed him with a quiet smile  youre wise tavernake he said softly i could hear no words but i know that you have been wise between you and me he added in a lower tone she is going downhill she is in with the wrong lot here she cant seem to keep away from them they are on the very fringe of bohemia a great deal nearer the arm of the law than makes for respectable society the man to whom i saw you introduced is a millionaire one day and a thief the next theyre none of them any good did you notice too that she is wearing sham jewelry that always looks bad  no i didnt notice tavernake answered  he was silent for a moment then he leaned a little forward  i wonder he asked do you know anything about her sister  pritchard finished his wine and knocked the ash from his cigar  not much he replied i believe she had a very hard time she took on the father you know the old professor and did her best to keep him straight he died about a year ago and miss beatrice tried to get back into the theatre but shed missed her chance theatrical business has been shocking in london i heard shed come out here wherever she is she keeps right away from that sort of set he wound up moving his head towards elizabeths friends  i wonder if she is in new york tavernake said with a strange thrill at his heart  pritchard made no reply his eyes were fixed upon the little group at the next table elizabeth was leaning back in her chair she seemed to have abandoned the conversation her eyes were always seeking tavernakes pritchard rose to his feet abruptly  its time we were in bed he declared remember the meeting tomorrow  tavernake rose to his feet as they passed the next table elizabeth leaned over to him her eyes pleaded with his almost passionately  dear leonard she whispered you mustyou must come and see me i shall stay in between four and six every evening this week the delvedere remember  thank you very much tavernake answered i shall not forget     chapter ix for always   once again it seemed to beatrice that history was repeating itself the dingy oblong diningroom with its mosquito netting stained tablecloth and hard cane chairs expanded until she fancied herself in the drawingroom of blenheim house between the landladies there was little enough to choose mrs raithby lawrence notwithstanding her caustic tongue and suspicious nature had at least made some pretense at gentility the woman who faced her nowhardfeatured with narrow suspicious eyes and a mass of florid hairwas unmistakably and brutally vulgar  whats the good of your keeping on saying you hope to get an engagement next week she demanded with a sneer whos likely to engage you why youve lost your color and your looks and your weight since you came to stay here they dont want such as you in the chorus and for the rest youre too high and mighty thats my opinion of you take what you can get and how you can get it and be thankfulthats my motto day after day you tramp about the streets with your head in the air and wont take this and wont take that and meanwhile my bill gets bigger and bigger now where have you been to this morning i should like to know  beatrice who was faint and tired shaking in every limb tried to pass out of the room but her questioner barred the way  i have been up town she answered nervously  hear of anything  beatrice shook her head  not yet please let me go upstairs and lie down i am tired and i need to rest  and i need my money mrs selina p watkins declared without quitting her position and its no good your going up to your room because the doors locked  what do you mean beatrice faltered  i mean that ive done with you the lodginghouse keeper announced your rooms locked up and the keys in my pocket and the sooner you get out of this the better i shall be pleased  but my boxmy clothes beatrice cried  ill keep em a week for you the woman answered bring me the money by then and you shall have them if i dont hear anything of you theyll go to the auction mart  something of her old spirit fired the girl for a moment she was angry and she forgot that her knees were trembling with fatigue that she was weak and aching with hunger  how dare you talk like that she exclaimed you shall have your money shortly but i must have my clothes i cannot go anywhere without them  the woman laughed harshly  look here my young lady she said youll see your box again when i see the color of your money and not before and now out you go pleaseout you go if youre going to make any trouble solly will have to show you the way down the steps  the woman had opened the door and a colored servant half dressed with a broom in her hand came slouching down the passage beatrice turned and fled out of the greasy noisome atmosphere down the wooden uneven steps out into the ugly street she turned toward the nearest elevated as though by instinct but when she came to the bottom of the stairs she stopped short with a little groan she knew very well that she had not a nickel to pay the fare her pockets were empty all day she had eaten nothing and her last coin had gone for the car which had brought her back from broadway and here she was on the other side of new york in the region of lowclass lodging houses with the bowery between her and broadway she had neither the strength nor the courage to walk with a halfstifled sob she took off her one remaining ornament a cheap enameled brooch and entered a pawnbrokers shop close to where she had been standing  will you give me something on this please she asked desperately  a man who seemed to be sorting a pile of readymade coats paused in his task for a moment took the ornament into his hand and threw it contemptuously upon the counter  not worth anything he answered  but it must be worth something beatrice protested i only want a very little  something in her voice compelled the mans attention he looked at her white face  whats the trouble he inquired  i must get up to fifth avenue somehow she declared i cant walk and i havent a nickel  he pushed the brooch back to her and threw a dime upon the counter  well he said you dont look fit to walk and thats a fact but the brooch isnt worth entering up theres a dime for you now git please im busy  beatrice clutched the coin and almost forgetting to thank him found her way up the iron stairs on to the platform of the elevated soon she was seated in the train rattling and shaking on its way through the slums into the heart of the wonderful city there was only one thing left for her to try a thing which she had had in her mind for days yet she found herself even now she was committed to it thinking of what lay before her with something like black horror it was her last resource indeed strong though she was she knew by many small signs that her strength was almost at an end the days and weeks of disappointments the long fruitless trudges from office to office the heartsickness of constant refusals poor food the long fasts had all told their tale she was attractive enough still her pallor seemed to have given her a wonderful delicacy the curve of her lips and the soft light in her gray eyes were still as potent as ever when she thought though what a poor asset her appearance had been the color flamed in her cheeks  in broadway she made her way to a very magnificent block of buildings and passing inside took the lift to the seventh floor here she got out and knocked timidly at a glasspaneled door on which was inscribed the name of mr anthony cruxhall a very superior young man bade her enter and inquired her business  i wish to see mr cruxhall for a moment privately she said i shall not detain him for more than a minute my name is franklinmiss beatrice franklin  the young mans lips seemed about to shape themselves into a whistle but something in the girls face made him change his mind  i guess the boss is in he admitted hes just got back from a big meeting but i am not sure about his seeing any one today however ill tell him that youre here  he disappeared into an inner room presently he came out again and held the door open  will you walk right in miss franklin he invited  beatrice went in bravely enough but her knees began to tremble when she found herself in the presence of the man she had come to visit mr anthony cruxhall was not a pleasantlooking person his cheeks were fat and puffy he wore a diamond ring upon the finger of his toowhite hand and a diamond pin in his somewhat flashily arranged necktie he was smoking a black cigar which he omitted to remove from between his teeth as he welcomed his visitor  so youve come to see me at last little miss beatrice he said with a particularly unpleasant smile come and sit down here by the side of me thats right eh now what can i do for you  beatrice was trembling all over the mans eyes were hateful his smile was hideous  i have not a cent in the world mr cruxhall she faltered i cannot get an engagement i have been turned out of my rooms and i am hungry my father always told me that you would be a friend if at any time it happened that i needed help i am very sorry to have to come and beg yet that is what i am doing will you lend or give me ten or twenty dollars so that i can go on for a little longer or will you help me to get a place among some of your theatrical people  mr cruxhall puffed steadily at his cigar for a moment and leaning back in his chair thrust his hand into his trousers pocket  so bad as that is it he remarked so bad as that eh  it is very bad indeed she answered looking at him quietly or you know that i should not have come to you  mr cruxhall smiled  i remember the last time we talked together he said we didnt get on very well too high and mighty in those days werent you miss beatrice wouldnt have anything to say to a bad lot like anthony cruxhall youre having to come to it eh  she began to tremble again but she held herself in  i must live she murmured give me a little money and let me go away  he laughed  oh ill do better than that for you he answered thrusting his hand into his waistcoat pocket and drawing out a pile of dollar bills lets look at you gee whiz yes youre shabby arent you take this he went on slamming some notes down before her go and get yourself a new frock and a hat fit to wear and meet me at the madison square roof garden at eight oclock well have some dinner and i guess we can fix matters up  then he smiled at her again and beatrice whose hand was already upon the bills suddenly felt her knees shake a great black horror was upon her she turned and fled out of the room past the astonished clerk into the lift and was downstairs on the main floor before she remembered where she was what she had done the clerk after gazing at her retreating form hurried into the inner office  young woman hasnt bolted with anything eh he asked  mr cruxhall smiled wickedly  why no he replied i guess shell come back  tavernake left the meeting on that same afternoon with his future practically assured for life he had been appointed surveyor to the company at a salary of ten thousand dollars a year and the mine in which his savings were invested was likely to return him his small capital a hundredfold very kind things had been said of him and to him  pritchard and he had left the place together when they had reached the street they paused for a moment  i am going to make a call near here pritchard said dont forget that we are dining together unless you find something better to do and in the meantimehe took a card from his pocket and handed it to tavernakei dont know whether i am a fool or not to give you this he added however there it is do as you choose about it  he walked away a little abruptly tavernake glanced at the address upon the card 1134 east third street for a moment he was puzzled then the light broke in upon him suddenly his heart gave a leap he turned back into the place to ask for some directions and once more stopped short down the stone corridor like one who flies from some hideous fate came a slim black figure with white face and set horrified stare tavernake held out his hands and she came to him with a great wondering sob  leonard she cried leonard  theres no doubt about me he answered quickly am i such a very terrifying object  she stood quite still and struggled hard by and by the giddiness passed  leonard she murmured i am ill  then she began to smile  it is too absurd she faltered but youve got to do it all over again  what do you mean he asked  get me something to eat at once she begged i am starving somewhere where its cool leonard how wonderful i never even knew that you were in new york  he called a carriage and took her off to a roof garden there as it was early they got a seat near the parapet tavernake talked clumsily about himself most of the time there was a lump in his throat he felt all the while that tragedy was very near by degrees though as she ate and drank the color came back to her cheeks the fear of a breakdown seemed to pass away she became even cheerful  we are really the most amazing people leonard she declared you stumbled into my life once before when i was on the point of being turned out of my rooms youve come into it again and you find me once more homeless dont spend too much money upon our dinner for i warn you that i am going to borrow from you  he laughed  thats good news he remarked but im not sure that im going to lend anything  he leaned across the table their dinner had taken long in preparing and the dusk was falling now over them were the stars the band was playing soft music the hubbub of the streets lay far below almost they were in a little world by themselves  dear beatrice he said three times i asked you to marry me and you would not and i asked you because i was a selfish brute and because i knew that it was good for me and that it would save me from things of which i was afraid and now i am asking you the same thing again but i have a bigger reason beatrice i have been alone most of the last two years i have lived the sort of life which brings a man face to face with the truth helps him to know himself and others and i have found out something  yes she faltered tell me leonard  i found out that it was you i cared for always he continued and that is why i am asking you to marry me now beatrice only this time i ask you because i love you and because no one else in the world could ever take your place or be anything at all to me  leonard she murmured  you are not sorry that i have said this he begged  she opened her eyes again  i always prayed that i might hear you say it she answered but it seemsoh it seems so onesided here am i starving and penniless and youyou i suppose are well on the way towards the success you worshiped  i am well on the way he said earnestly towards something greater beatrice i am well on the way towards understanding what success really is what things count and what dont i have even found out he whispered the thing which counts for more than anything else in the world and now that i have found it out i shall never let it go again  he pressed her hand and she looked across the table at him with swimming eyes the waiter who had been approaching turned discreetly away the band started to play a fresh tune from down in the streets came the clanging of the cars a curious cosmopolitan murmur of sounds but between those two there was the wonderful silence
