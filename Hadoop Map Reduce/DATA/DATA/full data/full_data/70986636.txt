land and sea and the heart of the palermitans was glad out they trooped into the scented darkness strolling along the promenade in little groups listening to the band drinking in the cool night breeze from the sea singling out friends laughing talking flirting and passing on a long line of carriages was drawn up along the marina and many of the old sicilian aristocracy were mingling with the crowd  palermo is like a night blossom which opens only with the first breath of evening by day it is parched and sleepy and stupid by night it is alive and joyousthe place itself becomes an al fresco paradise it is night which draws the sweetness from the flowers the air is heavy with the faint perfume of hyacinths and wild violets and a breeze stirring among the orange groves wafts a delicious aromatic odor across the bay long rays of light from the little semicircle of whitefronted villas flash across the slumbering waters of the harbor out of door restaurants are crowded all is light and life and bustle every one is glad to have seen the last of the broiling sun every one is happy and lighthearted the inborn gaiety of the south asserts itself women in graceful toilettes pass backward and forward along the broad parade making the air sweeter still with the perfume of their floating draperies and the light revelry of their musical laughter  tis a motley throng and there is no respecting of persons townspeople a sprinkling of the old nobility and a few curious visitors follow in each others footsteps by day those who can sleep by night they awake and don their daintiest clothing and palermo is gay  the terrace of the hotel de leurope extends to the very verge of the promenade and night by night is crowded with men of all conditions and nations who sit before little marble tables facing the sea smoking and drinking coffee and liqueurs at one of these so close to the promenade that the dresses of the passersby almost touched them two men were seated  one was of an order and race easily to be distinguished in any quarter of the globean english country gentleman there was no possibility of any mistake about him saxon was written in his face in the cut of his clothes even his attitude betrayed it he was tall and handsome and young enough not to have outlived enthusiasm for he was looking out upon the gay scene with keen interest his features were well cut his eyes were blue and his bronze face was smooth save for a slight wellformed moustache he wore a brown tweed coat and waistcoat flannel trousers a straw hat tilted over his eyes and he was smoking a briar pipe with his hands in his pockets and his feet resting upon the stone work  his companion was of a different type he was of medium height only and thin his complexion was sallow and his eyes and hair were black his features though not altogether pleasing were regular and almost classical in outline his clothes displayed him to the worst possible advantage he wore black trousers and a dark frock coat tightly fitting which accentuated the narrowness of his shoulders the only relief to the sombreness of his attire consisted in a white flower carefully fastened in his buttonhole he too had been smoking but his cigarette had gone out and he was watching the stream of people pass and repass with a fixed searching gaze though young his face was worn and troubled he had none of the sang froid or the pleasureseeking carelessness of the englishman who sat by his side his whole appearance was that of a man with a steadfast definite purpose in lifeof a man who had tasted early the sweets and bitters of existence joy and sorrow passion and grief  they were only acquaintances these two men chance had brought them together for some evil purpose of her own when the englishman who unlike most of his compatriots was a young man of a sociable turn of mind and detested solitude had come across him a few minutes ago in the long low diningroom of the hotel and had proposed their sharing a table and their coffee outside the other would have refused if he could have done so with courtesy as that had been impossible he had yielded however and they had become for a while companions albeit silent ones  the englishman was in far too good a humor with himself the place and his surroundings to hold his peace for long he exchanged his pipe for a havana and commenced to talk  i say this is an awfully jolly place no idea it was anything like it im glad i came  his vis√†vis bowed in a courteous but abstracted manner he had no wish to encourage the conversation so he made no reply but the englishman having made up his mind to talk was not easily repulsed  you dont live here do you he asked  the sicilian shook his head  no it happens that i was born here but my home was on the other side of the island it is many years since i visited it  he had made a longer speech than he had intended and he paid the penalty for it the englishman drew his chair a little nearer and continued with an air of increasing familiarity  its very stupid of me but do you know ive quite forgotten your name for the moment i remember my cousin cis davenport introducing us at rome and i knew you again directly i saw you but im hanged if i can think of your name i always had a precious bad memory  the sicilian looked none too well pleased at the implied request he glanced uneasily around and then bent forward leaning his elbow upon the table so that the heads of the two men almost touched when they had come into the place he had carefully chosen a position as far away from the flaming lights as possible but they were still within hearing of many of the chattering groups around  i do not object to telling you my name he said in a low tone sunk almost to a whisper but you will pardon me if i make a request which may appear somewhat singular to you i do not wish you to address me by it here or to mention it to be frank there are reasons for wishing my presence in this neighborhood not to be known you are a gentleman and you will understand  oh perfectly the englishman answered him in a tone of blank bewilderment  what did it all mean had he run off with some one elses wife or was he in debt one of the two seemed to be the natural conclusion anyhow he did not want to know the fellows name he had only asked out of politeness and if he were in any sort of scrape perhaps it would be better not to know it  i tell you what the englishman explained in the midst of the others hesitating pause dont tell it me i can call you anything you like for this evening i daresay we i shant meet afterwards and if you want to keep it dark about your being here why then i shant be able to give you awayby accident of course come ill call you anything you like choose your name for the night  the sicilian shook his head slowly  you have been told my name when i had the honor of being presented to you at rome he said and at any chance mention you might recall it i prefer to tell it to you and rely upon your honor  as you like  my name is leonardo di marioni  by jove of course it is the englishman exclaimed i should have thought of it in a moment i remember davenport made me laugh when he introduced us his pronunciations so queer you know and hes only been at rome about a month so he hasnt had time to pick it up good old cis he was always a dunce i suppose his uncle got him in at the embassy  no doubt the sicilian answered politely i have only had the pleasure of meeting your cousin once or twice and i know him but slightly you will not forget my request and if you have occasion to address me perhaps you will be so good as to do so by the name of cortegi it is the name by which i am known here and to which i have some right  the englishman nodded  all right ill remember by the bye he went on i had the pleasure of meeting your sister in naples i believe she is engaged to marry martin briscoe isnt she  the sicilians face darkened into a scowl the thin lips were tightly compressed and his eyes flashed with angry light  i was not aware of it he answered haughtily  the other raised his eyebrows  fact i assure you he continued suavely not noticing the sicilians change of countenance martin told me about it himself i should have thought that you would have known all about it briscoe isnt half a bad fellow he went on meditatively of course it isnt altogether pleasant to have a father who makes pickles and who wont leave off although he must have made a fine pot of money but martin stands it very well he isnt half a bad fellow  the sicilian rose from his chair with a sudden impetuous movement the moonlight fell upon his white furious face and black eyes ablaze with passion he was in a towering rage  i repeat sir that i know of no such engagement he exclaimed in a voice necessarily subdued but none the less fierce and angry i do not understand your nation which admits into the society of nobles such men it is infamous in sicily we do not do these things for such a man to think of an alliance with a marioni is more than presumptionit is blasphemy  thats all very well but i only know what i was told the englishman answered bluntly  its no affair of mine im sorry i mentioned it  the sicilian stood quite still for a moment a shade of sadness stole into his marble face and his tone when he spoke again was more mournful than angry  it may be as you say signor i have been traveling and for many months i have seen nothing of my sister i have heard such rumors as you allude to but i have not heeded them the affair is between us two i will say no more only this while i am alive that marriage will not take place  he resumed his seat and conversation languished between the two men the englishman sat with knitted eyebrows watching the people pass backward and forward with an absent puzzled look in his blue eyes he had an indistinct recollection of having been told something interesting about this man at the time of their introduction he was notorious for something what was it his memory seemed utterly to fail him he could only remember that for some reason or other leonardo di marioni had been considered a very interesting figure in roman society during his brief stay at the capital and that he had vanished from it quite suddenly  the sicilian too was watching the people pass to and fro but more with the intent gaze of one who awaits an expected arrival than with the idle regard of his companion once the latter caught his anxious expectant look and at the same time noticed that the slim fingers which held his cigarette were trembling nervously  evidently looking out for some one he thought seems a queer fish anyhow is it a man or a woman i wonder  soon he knew     chapter ii  she is a singer   there was a brief lull in the stream of promenaders the englishman turned round with a yawn and ordered another cup of coffee from his altered position he had a full view of the sicilians face and became suddenly aware of an extraordinary change in it the restlessness was gone the watching seemed to be at an end the fire of a deep passion was blazing in his dark eyes and the light of a great wistful joy shone in his face the englishman almost involuntarily turned in his chair and glanced round to see what had wrought the change  he looked into the eyes of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen a flood of silver moonlight lay upon the marina glancing away across the dark blue waters of the bay and the soft dazzling light gently touched her hair and gleamed in her dark sweet eyes she was tall and clad in white flowing draperies clinging softly around her slim girlish figure and giving to her appearance an inexpressible daintiness as though they were indeed emblematic of the spotless purity of that fair young being was it the chastened light or was there indeed something spiritual something more than humanly beautiful in the delicate oval faceperfect in its outline perfect in its faint coloring and stately poise she was walking slowly her every movement full of a distinctive and deliberate grace and her head a little upturned as though her thoughts were far away among the softly burning stars rather than concerned with the fashionable and picturesque crowd which thronged around her a remark from her companion a girl of somewhat slighter stature and darker complexion caused her to lower her eyes and in doing so they fell upon the eager impassioned gaze of the young englishman  afterwards he was never ashamed to confess that that moment brought with it a peculiar lingering sweetness which never altogether died away it was the birth of a new sensation the most poignant of all sensations although philosophers deny and materialists scoff at it after all there is something more than refined sensuality in love which has so sudden a dawning there is a certain innate spirituality which sublimates and purifies it so that the flame burns softly but brightly still through joy and grief mocking at satiety surviving the sorrow of gray hairs triumphing over the desolation of old age and sweetening the passage to the grave he was a headstrong chivalrous young man passionate loyal and faithful among all his faults that first love of his never grew cold never lessened it lasted forever for some men it is not possible to give the better part of themselves up to the worship of a pure woman selfishness forbids it but this young englishman who sat there spellbound absorbed in the consciousness of this new and sweet emotion was not one of these  suddenly she withdrew her eyes with a faint conscious blush and as she did so she saw for the first time the sicilian her whole aspect swiftly changed a terrified shudder swept across her features and her lips parted with fear she looked into a face but a moment before at her first appearance all aglow with passionate love now black with suppressed anger and fierce jealousy his eyes fascinated her but it was the fascination of dread and indeed his appearance was not pleasant to look upon his thin form seemed dilated with nervous passion and his eyes were on fire suddenly he conquered himself and with the swiftness of lightning across the water the fierceness died out of his face leaving it pale almost to ghastliness in the moonlight he half rose from his seat and lifting his hat bowed low  she answered his salutation timidly and touched her companion on the arm she too started as she saw that dark thin figure gazing so steadfastly upon them and her first impulse seemed to be to approach him she stopped short on the promenade and though there was a certain amount of apprehension in her dark eyes there was also some pleasure and her lips were parted in a halfwelcoming halfinviting smile but he did not make any advance toward her on the contrary with a slight and almost imperceptible gesture he motioned them to proceed with a little wave of the hand she obeyed him and he resumed his seat drawing his hat over his eyes and no longer watching the stream of promenaders  the englishman absorbed in his own sudden passion had seen nothing out of the common in the brief interchange of glances between the trio all that he noticed was that his companion had saluted the taller of the two girls and that she had acknowledged the salutation it was quite enough for him  he leaned over the low palisade watching her until she disappeared among the crowd scarcely daring to hope that she might look back and yet determined to lose no opportunity of a farewell glance should she do so when she was finally out of sight he drew a long breath and turned toward his companion  who is she he asked abruptly  i fear that i do not quite understand you he said quietly although his voice and limbs were trembling with passion to whom do you allude  the girl in white who passed just now you knew her tell me her name  why should i  i wish to know it  the sicilian lit his cigarette he was growing calmer but the fingers which held the match were still shaking  possibly but that is no reason why i should tell it to you that lady is a friend of mine certainly but it is not the custom in my country however it may be in yours to bandy a ladys name about a public place  but i am not asking out of curiosity the other persisted nor am i a stranger to you  what is your motive if it be not curiosity the sicilian asked with a dark shade stealing into his face you had better be careful signor there is danger at hand for any man who so much as directs an impertinent glance at either of those ladies  the englishman was far too deeply in earnest to be angry  you wont tell me then he said simply  i will not  certain  quite certain  very good i shall find out  the sicilian laid his hand upon the others arm his black eyes were flashing angrily and his tone was threatening  signor a word of warning i constitute myself the protector of those ladies i have a very good right to do so any idle and public inquiries concerning them or any attempt to obtrude an acquaintance upon them i shallpunish you understand  certainly he answered you have only to prove the offense and the right of protectorship and i shall be at your service you probably know little concerning the men of my country let me tell you that we are not in the habit of forcing ourselves upon unknown ladies nor in our respect for them are we second to the men of any nation in the world i wish you goodevening signor  he walked away with his head in the air an object of much curiosity to the many scattered little groups of dusky foreigners and jews through which he passed at the door of the hotel he paused for a moment and then instead of joining the stream of promenaders he entered and slowly ascended the broad marble staircase toward his room just as he reached the first landing however he felt a light touch on his arm and a guttural voice in his ear he turned sharply round and found before him one of the waitersthe one who had served him with his coffee outside  well what do you want he asked  the man answered in a low tone with his eyes glancing suspiciously around all the time  the signor was inquiring the name of the lady who passed by he said apologetically the signor spoke loudly and i could not choose but hear  the englishman came to a sudden standstill and looked down into the ferretlike face and black eyes of the man who had followed him  well  i can tell it to the signor  look sharp then  the signor is generous he remarked with a cunning look i have risked my place by leaving the terrace without permission to bring him this news and i am poorvery very poor he added with a sudden drop in his voice which resembled a whine  the englishman threw a piece of gold into the brown greedy palm  tell it me and be off he said shortly  the waiterhalf greek half native and a thorough rascalbowed low and his beadlike eyes glistened  the signor is noble the beautiful ladys name is signorina adrienne cartuccio  the singer  the same signor the divine singer  ah  the englishman turned toward the wide open window and gazed steadfastly at the place in the crowd where she had vanished  she sings tonight does she not he asked  truly signor palermo is full of visitors from all parts of the island on purpose to hear her  at what time  at nine oclock signor in the concert hall if the signor desires to hear her he should go early for tonight is the only chance she sings but once and it is for the poor they say that she has come to the villa fiolesse on the hill to be away from the world to rest  the englishman descended the stairs and went slowly back to his seat he had only one thought in a few hours time he would see her again it would be paradise  he reached his table and sat down the seat opposite to him was empty the sicilian had gone     chapter iii  better thou wert dead before me   on the brow of the hill fiolesse at a sharp angle in the white dusty road a man and woman stood talking on one side of them was a grove of flowering magnolias and on the other a high closelytrimmed hedge skirted the grounds of the villa fiolesse there was not another soul in sight but as though the place were not secure enough from interruption the girl every now and then glanced half fearfully around her and more than once paused in the middle of a sentence to listen at last her fears escaped from her lips  leonardo i wish that you had not come she cried what is the good of it i shall have no rest till i know that you are beyond the sea again  his face darkened and his tone was gloomy and sad  beyond the seas while my heart is chained forever here margharita he answered ah i have tried and i know the bitterness of it you cannot tell what exile has been like to me i could bear it no longer tell me child i watched you climb this hill together you looked back and saw me and waited did she see me too quick answer me i will know she saw me on the marina did she know that i was following her  i think she saw you she said nothing when i lingered behind it was as though she knew  the sicilian clasped his hands and looked away over the sea the moonlight fell upon his weary pallid face and glistened in his dark sad eyes he spoke more to himself than her  she knew and yet she would not wait to speak a single word to me ah it is cruel if only she could know how night by night in those fardistant countries i have lain on the mountain tops and wandered through the valleys thinking and dreaming of heralways of her it has been an evil time with me my sister a time of dreary days and sleepless nights and this the end of it my heart is faint and sick with longing and i hastened here before it should break i must see her margharita let us hasten on to the villa  she laid her hand upon his arm her eyes were soft with coming tears  leonardo listen she cried it is best to tell you she will not see you she is quite firm she is angry with you for coming  angry with me angry because i love her so that i risk my life just to see her to hear her speak ah but that is cruel let me go in and speak to her let me plead with her in my own fashion  she shook her head  leonardo the truth is best she said softly adrienne does not love you she is quite determined not to see you again even i pleading with tears in my eyes could not persuade her she has locked herself in her room while she prepares for the concert you could not see her unless you forced yourself upon her and that would not do  no i would not do that he answered wearily margharita there is a question i must ask it though the answer kill me is thereany one else  she shook her head  there is no one else leonardo yet but what matter is that since it cannot be you some day it will come all that a sister could do i have done she pities you leonardo but she does not love you she never will  he moved from the open space where the moonlight fell upon his marble face to the shadow of the magnolia grove he stood there quite silent for a moment then he spoke in a strained hard voice which she scarcely recognized  margharita you have done your best for me you do not know what a mans love is or you would not wonder that i suffer so much yet if it must be it must i will give her up i will go back to my exile and forget her yet since i am here grant me a last favor let me see her to say farewell  she looked up at him in distress  leonardo how can i she has given orders that under no circumstances whatever are you to be admitted  but to say farewell  she would not believe it it has been so before leonardo and then you have been passionate and pleaded your cause all over again i have promised that i will never ask her to see you again  then let me see her without asking you can find an opportunity if you will for my sake margharita  she laid her troubled tearstained face upon his shoulder  it is wrong of me leonardo yet if you will promise me to say farewell and farewell only  be it so i promise  well then each night we have walked past the marina and home by the mountain road it is a long way round and it is lonely but we have pietro with us and on these moonlight nights the view is like fairyland  and will you come that way home tonight after the concert  yes  it is good  you will remember your promise leonardo she said anxiously  i will remember he answered and margharita since this is to be our farewell i have something to say to you also before i pass away from your life into my exile in rome i was told a thing which for a moment troubled me i say for a moment because it was for a moment only that i believed it the man who told me was my friend or he would have answered to me for it as for an insult shall i tell you margharita what this thing was  her face was troubled and her eyes were downcast the sicilian watched her confusion with darkening brows since she made no answer he continued  they told me margharita that you a marioni daughter of one of europes grandest families daughter of a race from which princes have sprung and with whom in the old days kings have sought alliance they told me that you were betrothed to some low american a trader a man without family or honor they told me this margharita and i answered them that they lied forgive me for the shadow of a doubt which crossed my mind sister forgive me that i beg for a denial from your own lips  she lifted her head she was pale but her dark eyes had an indignant sparkle in them  they did lie leonardo she answered firmly but not in the fact itself it is true that i am engaged to be married  betrothed without my sanction margharita how is that am i not your guardian  yes but leonardo you have been away and no one knew when you would return or where you were  it is enough tell me of the man to whom you are betrothed i would know his name and family  leonardo his name is martin briscoe and his familyhe has no family that you would know of it is true that he is an american but he is a gentleman  an american it is perhaps also true that he is a trader  his coolness alarmed her she looked into his face and trembled  i do not know it may be so his father  the sicilian interrupted her his face was marble white but his eyes were afire  his father spare me the pedigree i know it margharita stand there where the moonlight touches your face let me look at you is it you a daughter of the marionis who can speak so calmly of bringing this disgrace upon our name you my little sister margharita the proudspirited girl who used to share in my ambitions and to whom our name was as dear as to myself  leonardo spare me  spare you yes when you have told me that this is some nightmare some phantasma lie spare you yes when you tell me that this presumptuous upstart has gone back to his upstart country  she dropped her hands from before her face and stood before him pale and desperate  leonardo i cannot give him up i love him  and do you owe me no love do you owe no duty to the grandeur of our race noblesse oblige margharita we bear a great name and with the honor which it brings it brings also responsibilities i do not believe that you can truly love this man but if you do your duty is still plain you must crush your love as you would a poisonous weed under your feet you must sacrifice yourself for the honor of our name  leonardo you do not understand i love him and cannot give him up my word is given i cannot break it  he drew a step further away from her and his voice became harder  you must choose then between him and me between your honor and your unworthy lover there is no other course as my sister you are the dearest thing on earth to me as that mans wife you will be an utter stranger i will never willingly look upon your face nor hear you speak i will write your name out of my heart and my curse shall follow you over the seas to your new home and ring in your ears by day and by night i will never forgive i swear it  he ceased and bent forward as though for her answer she did not speak the deep silence was broken only by the faroff murmur of the sea and the sound of faint sobbing from between her clasped hands the sound of her distress softened him for a moment he hesitated and then spoke again more quietly  margharita ponder this over be brave and remember that you are a marioni till tomorrow farewell     chapter iv  down into hell to win the love he sought   it was two hours later and the marina was almost deserted the streets and squares too of the southern city were silent and empty it seemed as though all palermo had gathered together in that sprawling whitewashed building called in courtesy a concert hall flashes of light from its many windows gleamed upon the pavements below and from the upper one the heads of a solid phalanx of men and women wedged in together threw quaint shadows across the narrow street the tradespeople aristocracy and visitors of the place had flocked together to the concert frantically desirous of hearing the great singer who although so young had been made welcome at every court in europe it was an honor to their island city that she should have visited it at all much more that she should choose to sing there and the quick palermitans fired with enthusiasm rushed to welcome her the heavy slumberous air was still vibrating with the shout which had greeted her first appearance and the echoes from across the scarcely rippled surface of the bay were lingering among the rocky hills on the other side of the harbor  the sicilian heard it as he threaded his way toward the poorer part of the city and a dull red glow burned for a moment in his sallow cheeks it maddened him that he too was not there to join in it to feast his eyes upon her and listen to the matchless music of her voice was she not more to him than to any of them so long he had carried her image in his heart that a curious sense of possession had crept into all his thoughts of her he was frantically jealous heedless of the fact that he had no right to be he would have felt toward the man on whom adrienne cartuccio had smiled as toward a robber she was his and his only she should be years of faithful homage and unabated longing had made her so his was a narrow but a strong nature and the desire of her had become the mainspring of his life his she should surely be no other man had the right to lift his eyes to her as he hurried through those silent streets he forgot her many kindly but firm repulses jesuitical in his love any means by which he might win her seemed fair and honorable and tonight though he was stooping to treachery to possess himself of this long coveted jewel he felt no shame only his heart beat strong and fast with passionate hope the moment had come at length for him to play his last card and at the very prospect of success heaven itself seemed open before his eyes  he had been threading his way swiftly and with the air of one well acquainted with the neighborhood through a network of narrow streets and courts filthy and poverty stricken at last he came to a sudden pause before a flight of steps leading down to the door of a small wine shop which was little more than a cellar  from the street one could see into the bar and the sicilian paused for a moment and peered downward behind the counter a stout swarthylooking native woman was exchanging coarse badinage with a man in a loose jersey and baggy trousers there seemed to be no one else in the place save another man who sat in the darkest corner with his head buried upon his arms  the sicilian only hesitated for a moment then he pulled his soft hat lower over his eyes and lighting a cigarette to dispel as far as possible the rank stale odor of the place stepped down and entered the wine shop  evidently he was not known there the woman stared curiously at him as she passed the glass of cura√ßao for which he asked and the man scowled he took no notice of either but with his glass in his hand made his way across the sawdustcovered floor to the most remote of the small tables  a few feet only from him was the man who slept or who seemed to sleep and all around quaint shadows of the tall buildings outside stealing in through the open window almost shut the two men off from the rest of the wine shop where the gas jets hung the sicilian smoked on in silence his neighbor commenced to move presently the woman and her admirer resumed their talk with their heads a little closer together and their voices lowered they were absorbed in themselves and their coarse flirtation the man sipped more liquor and the woman filled his glass with no sparing hand the strong brandy ran through his veins quicker and quicker he tried to embrace the woman and failed owing to the barrier between them he tried again and this time partially succeeded then he tried to clamber over the counter but missed his footing and fell in a heap on the floor where he lay to all appearance too drunk to get uphelpless and stupefied  the woman peered over at him with a sneer on her face then she arranged the bottles in their places and called out a noisy greeting to the sicilian who was smoking silently among the shadows with only the red tip of his cigarette visible in the darkness he made no reply she yawned and looked downward at the drunken man once more there was no sign of life in his coarse face he was wrapped deep in a drunken sleep and he still had money in his pockets ah well it should be hers when these two strangers had gone  she turned to a little recess behind the bar and approaching the wall looked at herself in a cracked lookingglass which hung there something in her hair needed rearrangement and she remained there straightening it with her fingers from where she stood she was within hearing distance if any one descended the steps and entered the wine shop so she did not hurry the contemplation of her coarse features and small black eyes seemed to inspire her with a strange pleasure she remained at the glass turning her head from side to side with a curiously grotesque satisfaction then one of her large glass earrings was dull she took it out and rubbed it vigorously on her skirt humming a popular tune to herself the while the whole thing took time but what matter there was no one in the vault save two drunken men and another who chose to sit in the darkness without making any response to her advances if a fresh customer had descended the greasy stone steps and pushed open the rickety swing door he would have found her in her place ready with the usual coarse greeting or jest should he chance to be a neighbor or an acquaintance meanwhile she was happy where she was  in the wine shop itself things were not exactly as she supposed no sooner had her back been turned than the man near whom the sicilian had seated himself slowly raised his head and looked around assured of her departure and after a moments contemplation of the man who lay upon the floor to all appearance so hopelessly drunk he turned toward the sicilian  my orders signor he whispered it is to be tonight  yes  the signorina will not listen to reason then  in the darkness the sicilian felt the deep flush which stole into his olive cheeks he was not there without an effort in all his deeds and thoughts he had always reckoned himself as others had reckoned him an honorable man his presence in this place and the means he was stooping to use filled him with the most intense humiliation only one thing was strongerhis passionate love for adrienne cartuccio  do not breathe the signorinas name he muttered receive your instructions but make no comments  command signor i am ready was the whispered answer  first have you succeeded as you expected the carriage and mules and men  in ten minutes i could have them all here signor the task was not easy but it is accomplished they are at the signors disposal all that remains is for you to give the orders  the sicilian was perfectly silent for a moment the darkness hid his facehid the shame which for a moment lowered it the shame which an honorable gentleman feels when he stoops to dishonor it passed away before the stronger feeling and when he spoke his tone was firm though low  it is well listen pietro the attempt is to be made tonight in three hours time you will be prepared the notice is sufficient  more than sufficient signor the sooner the better the mouths of my men are closed with gold and they are carefully chosen but one and all they love the wine and wine in its way is as powerful as gold see that animal yonder signor my men love the drink as well as he and before he reached that state he might have chattered away a dozen secrets  the sicilian watched the man who was lying on the sawduststrewn floor something in his breathing attracted him and he leaned forward  is he asleep do you think he whispered i thought i saw his eyes open  pietro rose and crawling like a cat drew close to the drunken man he passed his hand lightly over him and listened to his breathing finally he crept back to his seat  that is no spy he whispered he is only a common fisherman and he is stupefied with drink i watched him when he came in proceed signor let me know your plans  the sicilian continued speaking as rapidly as possible he had conspired before but honorably and with men of his own rank but herein this low den with such a companionit made his heart sick he was only anxious to get away as speedily as possible  tonight the signorina sings at the town hall she leaves there at ten oclock on foot accompanied only by another lady and a manservant who is in my pay she will dismiss her carriage and walk the road to the villa fiolesse you know they will pursue it past the turn thinking to follow a winding path which leads from it into the grounds of the villa about half a mile further on the road is quite deserted there and sheltered by pine groves at the entrance to the first grove the cart and mules must be in waitingalso your men there will be no resistance but above everything pietro remember thisno discourtesy or roughness to either of the ladies let them be treated firmly but with the utmost respect remember that one will be my wife and the other is my sister  but you yourself signor shall you not be there  no if all goes well i

served  spend it as you will and come to me afterwards for your own reward i will go now to make my own preparations be faithful this night pietro and your fortune is secured i am not one to forget a service  the signor is a prince pietro answered bowing see the moon is behind a cloud it is a propitious moment to leave this place without being observed i too must go but outside our ways lie apart  come then the sicilian answered rising quickly but one last caution pietro see that your men understand perfectly that for any rudeness or illusage to either of the signorinas they will answer to me with their lives it may be that i shall not join you before daybreak if so remember that the man who offends those whom you guard by so much as a look shall die his corpse shall whiten on the mountains for carrion crows to peck at  it is well signor there is no fear  they crept out of the door opening and closing it noiselessly ascended into the street and separated the sound of their footsteps died away upon the rude stone pavements for a minute or two unbroken silence reigned in the wine shop  diabolo  the exclamation came from the man who had fallen while endeavoring to embrace the hostess and who since to all appearance had been in a drunken sleep a very remarkable change had come over him he was sitting bolt upright on the floor shaking the sawdust from his hair and his dark eyes were no longer vacant but bright and full of excitement he peered cautiously over the counter the woman who had repelled his advances was still loitering near the lookingglass then he stole softly on to his feet and walking on tiptoe and without the slightest difficulty left the place outside he simulated once more the walk of a drunken man and staggered down the street and out of sight  presently the hostess of the place having arranged her headdress to her own satisfaction came out behind the counter she leaned over and looked for her drunken admirer after all he had money in his pocket and he was not such a bad fellow she would take him into her little room behind and let him sleep for a while more comfortably butbut where was he he was not there she turned the light higher and looked around there was no one in the room at all two hopelessly drunken men and the stranger had left the place without making the slightest sound or without calling for more drink it was incredible but it was true the wineshop keeper had never been so surprised in her life not only was she surprised but she was frightened the thing was beyond belief the sweat broke out upon her forehead and she crossed herself the devil himself must have come and fetched them away and if so why should he not fetch her she was wicked enough what a horrible thought  half a dozen men the crew of a fishing boat suddenly entered the court filling the air with their voices and descended the steps she came to herself while serving them and commenced to forget her fright but she did not mention that little occurrence and the very thought of a drunken man for days afterwards made her shudder     chapter v  treachery   it was almost midnight and palermo lay sleeping in the moonlight the concert was over and the people who had shouted themselves hoarse with enthusiasm had dispersed at last to their homes the last of the broadwheeled heavilybuilt carriages had rolled away through the white streets of the town one by one the promenaders had left the marina and all sound had died away there was a faint sighing breeze in the orange groves around the bay but scarcely a ripple upon the water one man alone lingered drinking in the sweetness of the night the englishman sat on the last seat of the marina in the shadow of a cluster of orange trees  he had seen her againnay more he had heard her singthis girlnightingale who had taken the world by storm chance had favored him insomuch that he had been able to secure almost a front seat in the concert room and the wonderful music of her voice rang still in his ears he had stolen out here to try and think it all over and to calm the passion which had suddenly leaped up within him it was quite a new experience through which he was passing he scarcely knew himself he was happy and miserable sanguine and despondent all in a moment one question was always before himone end one aim how was he to know her how could he endure to live here seeing her day by day for a brief while without making her acquaintance there was nothing to be hoped for from the sicilian who would not even tell him her name possibly though she would visit or be visited by some of the nobility of the place this was almost his only hope he had letters to most of them and he made up his mind to present them all on the morrow  he sat there dreaming with a burnedout cigar between his teeth and his eyes idly wandering over the blue mediterranean suddenly the stillness was broken by the sound of a soft gliding footstep close at hand he had heard no one approach yet when he looked up quickly he found he was no longer alone a man in the garb of a native peasant was standing by his side  naturally the englishman was a little surprised he half rose from his seat and then resumed it as he recognized the dark swarthy face and black eyes of the waiter who had told him adrienne cartuccios name  hullo what are you doing here he demanded  i was in search of the signor was the hasty response for an hour i have sought him everywhere and now it is by chance that i am successful  the englishman looked at him with suspicion this change of dress was doubtless for the purpose of disguise what was the meaning of it  well and now youve found me what do you want he asked watching him closely  i will tell the signor is it not that he has an admiration for mademoiselle cartuccio the singer well she is in danger it is for the signor to rescue her  the englishman sprang up with sparkling eyes and pitched his dead cigar into the sea  in danger he repeated breathlessly quick tell me where  the man pointed inland  do you see that belt of white road there leading up into the hills  yes what about it  have you noticed anything pass along it  there was a heavy cart or carriage and some mules i think went by half an hour ago  the native shrugged his shoulders  it was an hour signor but no matter step back with me into the shadow of those olive trees that is better now we cannot be seen and i will explain  the englishman beat the ground with his foot  explanations be damned he exclaimed where is mademoiselle cartuccio quick  the man held up his hands and spoke more rapidly  this evening i heard by accident of a plot to carry off signorina cartuccio by a rejected suitor i hasten to inform the police but on the way i pause i say to myself what shall i get for my pains and for the risk i run nothing then i think of the signor i watched his face when the signorina pass by and i say to myself he has the passion of her if i show him the way to save her he will be generous he will win the lady and he will reward poor andrea  thats all right tell me what to do and i will give you fifty poundsanything you like dont waste time speak up  the mans eyes shone with cupidity he went on rapidly  the signor is a prince listen along yonder road before many minutes have passed will come the signorina cartuccio with her friend attended only by an aged servant men are waiting for them in the grove of orange trees above the villa fiolesse their orders are to carry off the two ladies to the other side of the island where a place has been prepared for them for an hour i have searched for the signor that he might procure aid and so encounter these brigands but in vain i was in despair  i want no help how many of the blackguards are there  four signor  natives  yes signor  and cowards i suppose  the man smiled  they have not much bravery signor i know the men  i wouldnt have anyone else here for the world the englishman said shaking his fist  does the signor want a knife asked the man thrusting his hand into his inner pocket  not i we dont understand that sort of thing in our country my brave andrea fisticuffs will settle this little matter youll see  the man looked up admiringly at the englishmans commanding figure and broad shoulders  i think they will run away from the signor when they see him he whispered but let the signor remember this if one of them thrusts his hand inside his coat so do not wait one momentknock him down or get out of his way he will have the knife and they know how to use it these brigands  tell me the name of their leaderi mean the fellow who is trying to carry off the signorina will he be there  the man shook his head  i cannot tell the signor his name i dare not i was once in his service and he has powershush  the two men held their breath keeping well in the shadow of the orange grove they had reached the road and in the distance they could hear the sound of approaching voices  i leave you now signor whispered his companion to the englishman i dare not be seen tomorrow at the hotel  he glided noiselessly away the englishman scarcely heard him he was listening intently light footsteps were coming along the winding road toward him and soon a laughing voice rang out upon the night air  my dear adrienne dont you think we were a little foolish to walk home so late as this see there is not a soul upon the promenade  tant mieux was the light answer is it not to escape from them all that we came this way the stillness is exquisite and the night breeze from the sea after that hot room is divine what a view we shall have of the bay when we get to the top of the hill  they say that this place is infested with robbers and it is terribly lonely was the somewhat fearful answer why would you not let poor leonardo come with us  because i did not want leonardo cherie leonardo is very good but he wearies me by persisting to dwell upon a forbidden subject and as for protectionwell i fancy giovanni is sufficient  they were passing him now so close that he felt impelled to hold his breath he had only a momentary glimpse of them but it was sufficient a few yards behind a sullenlooking servant was trudging along looking carefully around in the white moonlight their faces even their expressions were perfectly visible to him adriennes rapt and absorbed by the still restful beauty of the dreaming night and indifferent to all fear her companion whose dark eyes were glancing somewhat anxiously around her and giovannis whose furtive looks more expectant than apprehensive marked him out to the englishman as an accomplice in whatever devilry was afoot unseen himself he watched them pass and listened to their voices growing fainter and fainter in the distance they were out of sight and out of hearing  he was preparing to follow them when suddenly another sound broke the stillness he held his breath and crouched down watching in a minute two dark forms keeping carefully in the shadows by the side of the road crept stealthily past  he waited till they too were out of sight and then stood up with tingling pulses but quite cool moving on tiptoe he stepped lightly over the low stone wall into the road and gazed after them  the ascent was steep and the road curved round and round in zigzag fashion on one side it was bordered by a thicklygrowing orange grove whose delicate perfume was sweetening the still languid air on the other was a stretch of waste open country separated from the road by a low wall he chose the seaward side and keeping under the shadow of the trees followed them his footsteps sinking noiselessly into the thick dust  once the two ladies paused to look back he stopped too and the two bending figures between them drew closer into the shadows and waited he was some distance away but the sound of her voice floated clearly down to him on a breath of that faint night air  ah how beautiful it is she cried pointing downward just a few steps and we shall see the sea glistening through the leaves of the orange trees  i am sure that it is not prudent adrienne we have come past the footpath down to the villa and this upper road is so lonely listen i fancied that i heard footsteps  there was a moments silence then a low musical laugh which sounded to him like the sweetest music  it was the echo of our own you foolish child there is nothing to fear and have we not giovanni  again they turned and again he followed suddenly his heart gave a great bound about fifty yards in front of the two girls was a rudelybuilt country carriage drawn by a pair of mules and with a single man on the box they had paused at such an unexpected sight and seemed to be deliberating in whispers whether or no they should proceed before they had come to any decision the two men had crept out from the shadow of the wall and trees into the road and with bent bodies hurried toward them  he did not shout out or make any noise he simply lessened the distance between him and them by increasing his pace the two stooping forms casting long oblique shadows across the white hard road were almost level with their intended victims now the shadow of one of them crept a little in advance of the ladies and adrienne cartuccio seeing it stepped suddenly back with a cry of alarm  giovanni giovanni there are robbers ah  the cry became a shriek but it was instantly stifled by a coarse hand thrust upon her mouth at the same moment her companion felt herself treated in a similar manner they could only gaze into the dark ruffianly faces of their captors in mute terror the whole thing had been too sudden for them to make any resistance and giovanni their trusted escort seemed suddenly to have disappeared as a matter of fact he was watching the proceedings from behind a convenient bowlder  the man who was holding adrienne pointed to the carriage the door of which the driver had thrown open  this way signorina he said it is useless to struggle we shall not harm you  she shook her head violently and with a sudden effort thrust his hand away from her mouth  what do you want she cried who are you you can have my jewels but i will never step inside that carriage help help  he wound his arms around her and without a word commenced dragging her across the road  you may shout as much as you like he muttered there will only be echoes to answer you  a sudden warning cry rang out from his companion and with a start he released his victim the englishman had stepped into the middle of the group and before he could spring back a swinging lefthander sent him down into the dust with a dull heavy thud  you blackguard he thundered out then turning quickly round he faced the other man who had sprung across the road with bent body and with his right hand in his breast there was a gleam of cold steel but before he could use the knife which he had drawn his arm was grasped and held as though by a vice and slowly bent backward he dropped the weapon with a shriek of pain upon the road and fell on his knees before his captor  the englishmans grasp relaxed and taking advantage of it the man suddenly jumped up leaped over the wall and disappeared in the plantation pursuit would have been impossible but none of them thought of it  the two ladies looked at their preserver standing in the middle of the roadfair and straight and tall like a greek god but with a terrible fury blazing in his dark blue eyes  you are not hurt i trust he asked his breath coming quickly for he was in a towering passion he was not speaking to the darker of the two girls at all in fact he was unconscious of her presence he was standing by adrienne cartuccios side watching the faint color steal again into her cheeks and the terror dying out of her eyes to be replaced by a far softer light her black lace wrap which she had been wearing in spanish fashion had fallen a little back from her head and the moonlight was gleaming upon her ruddy golden hair all wavy and disarranged throwing into soft relief the outline of her slim girlish figure her heaving bosom and the exquisite transparency of her complexion she stood there like an offended young queen passionately wrathful with the men who had dared to lay their coarse hands upon her yet feeling all a womans gratitude to their preserver her eyes were flashing like stars and her brows were bent but as she looked into his face her expression softened of the two sensations gratitude was the stronger  you are not hurt he repeated i am sorry that i did not get here sooner before that fellow touched you  she held out her hand to him with a little impetuous movement  thanks to you no signor she said her eyes suddenly filling with tears oh how grateful we are are we not margharita  indeed indeed we are the signor has saved us from a terrible danger  he laughed a little awkwardly where is the englishman who likes to be thanked  it is nothing the fellows were arrant cowards but what was the carriage doing here  he pointed along the road already the clumsy vehicle had become a black speck in the distance swaying heavily from side to side from the pace at which it was being driven and almost enveloped in a cloud of dust  adrienne shook her head margharita had turned away with her face buried in her hands  i cannot imagine perhaps they were brigands and intended to carry us off for a ransom  the englishman shrugged his shoulders  odd sort of bandits he remarked why they hadnt the pluck of a chicken between them especially this one  he touched the prostrate figure with his foot and the two girls shuddered  he isis not dead is he margharita asked  not he i shouldnt say that he was very badly hurt either the englishman declared bending down and listening to his breathing more frightened than anything hell get up and be off directly we leave you will let me see you home he continued speaking to adrienne  she looked up at him with a gleam of humor in her wet eyes  you dont imagine that we should let you go and leave us here she said come margharita  the englishman looked at the other girl almost for the first time as she came up and joined them her dark eyes were full of tears and her face was troubled there was very little relief or thankfulness for her escape in her expression the englishman was no physiognomist but he was a little puzzled  there is no danger now signorina he said reassuringly tomorrow i will go to the police and i dare say that we shall get to the bottom of the whole affair  she shuddered but made no reply walking on by their side but a little distance apart as for the englishman he was in paradise to all intents and purposes he was alone with adrienne cartuccio listening to her low voice and every now and then stealing a glance downward into those wonderful eyes just then very soft and sweet that walk through the scented darkness with the faroff murmur of the sea always in their ears was like the dawning of a new era in his life  it was she who talked most and he who listened yet he was very happy and when they reached her villa and he left them at the door she gave him a white flower which he had found courage to beg for  may i call on you tomorrow he asked trembling for the answer  if you would like to yes she answered readily come early if you have nothing to do and we will give you afternoon tea √† langlaise by the bye she added a little shyly is there not something which you have forgotten  he divined her meaning at once  of course i ought to have told you my name he exclaimed hastily how stupid of me it is st mauricelord st maurice  lord st maurice then are you not the fortunate possessor of that delightful little yacht in the harbor  yes if you mean the pandora shes mine do you like sailing will you come for a sail he asked eagerly  well talk about it tomorrow she laughed holding out her hand goodnight  he let her hand go if he held it a moment longer and a little more firmly than was absolutely necessary was he much to blame  goodnight he said goodnight signorina he added bowing to margharita i shall come tomorrow afternoon  then he turned away and walked with long swinging steps back to the hotel     chapter vi  the bitter springs of anger and fear   margharita  she had found her way into a lonely corner of the villa grounds and with her head resting upon her hands she was gazing across the blue sunlit waters of the bay below hidden by the thicklygrowing shrubs was the white dusty road and the voice which disturbed her thoughts seemed to come from it she pushed the white flowering rhododendrons on one side and peered through  leonardo she exclaimed leonardo  she seemed surprised to see him standing there pale dusty and with a great weariness shining out of his black eyes and it did not occur to her to offer him any greeting she could not say that she was glad to see him and yet her heart ached when she looked into his pale sorrowful face so she was silent  are you alone he asked  yes adrienne is in the house i believe  then i am coming in  she looked troubled but she could not send him away he clambered over the low paling and pushing back the boughs of the shrubs which grew between them made his way up the bank to her side  have you been away she asked  yes i have been home home he repeated bitterly i have wandered through the woods and i have climbed the hills where we spent our childhood i have looked upon the old scenes and my heart is broken  her eyes filled with tears for a moment her thoughts too went back to the days when they had been children together and he had been her hero brother how time had changed them both and how far apart they had drifted they could never be the same again she knew it quite well there had grown up a great barrier between them she could not even pretend to sympathize with him although her heart was still full of pity  leonardo i am sorry she whispered how is it i wonder that all through life you seem to have set your heart upon things which are impossible  it is fate  fate but you are a man and man should control fate  have i not tried he answered bitterly tell me do i so easily relinquish my great desire why am i here because i have said to myself that i will not be denied adrienne shall be mine  she looked at him steadily  we have not met leonardo since the night after the concert do you know that we had an adventure on the way home  tell me about it he answered looking away  is there any need leonardo  a faint tinge of color stole into his olive cheek  you guessed then he said tell me does she know has she any idea  none  she does not suspect me at all  no she thinks that it was an ordinary attack by robbers and that the carriage was to take us a little way into the interior so that they might hold us and demand a ransom it was her own idea i said nothing i feel as though i were deceiving her but i cannot tell her she would never look upon your face again leonardo  you must not tell her he muttered swear that you will not  she shook her head  there is no need i am not anxious to denounce my own brother as a wouldbe abductor  margharita i was desperate he cried passionately and that cursed englishman he has become my evil genius it was a miserable chance that enabled him to become your preserver  it was a very fortunate one for you leonardo  what do you mean he cried sharply tell me has he been here  yes  he seemed to calm himself with a great effort he was on the threshold of what he had come to know he must keep cool or she would tell him nothing  margharita he said slowly the time is fast coming when i shall have no more favors to ask you will you remember that you are my sister and grant me a great one now  if i can leonardo  it is good i shall not ask you anything impossible or unreasonable tell me the truth about adrienne and this englishman tell me how you have spent your days since this affair and how often he has been here then tell me what you yourself think tell me whether she cares for him and he for her let me hear the whole truth so that i may know how to act  there was a moments silence a yellowbreasted bird flew between them and a shower of rhododendron blossoms fell at their feet the lazy murmur of insects floated upon the heavy afternoon air so faint and breathless that the leaves which grew thick around them scarcely rustled a clump of pink and white hyacinths grew out of the wall the waxy heads bent with the weight of their heavy bellshaped petals she snapped off a white blossom and toyed with it in her fingers for a moment the lazy joy of the hot afternoon seemed to grate upon her when she looked into that white strained face deep lined and suffering what right had nature to put forth all her sweet sights and perfumes to be so peaceful and joyous while man her master could feel such agony it was mockery it was not right or fair  she thrust the flower into his hand  leonardo she whispered remember our watchword endurance i will tell you everything lord st maurice came on the day after our adventure he stayed till evening and we walked with him on the marina the next day we went yachting with him yesterday and today he has spent nearly the whole of his time here i believe that he is in love with adrienne and as for her if she does not love him already i believe that she soon will you have asked for the truth my brother and it is best that you should have it forgive me for the pain it must cause you  he passed his arm round the gnarled branch of a small chestnut tree and then turning round hid his face there was a great lump rising in her throat but she dared not attempt to console him she knew that he was angry with herthat he blamed her for his fruitless love and despised her for the lover she had chosen in the days of their youth they had both been dreamers he had been faithful to the proud romantic patriotism which had been the keynote of their idealism she in his eyes at any rate had been utterly faithless only her affection had remained steadfast and even that he had commenced to doubt  presently he turned and faced her his face was ghastly white but his eyes were hot and red  where is she he asked i am going to her i am going to see with my own eyes and hear with my own ears whether this story of yours be true where is she  she looked at him doubtfully  leonardo she said forgive me but you will frighten her if you go as you are now your clothes are all dusty and ragged and you look as though you were on the threshold of a fever besides she is asleep go down to the hotel and change your clothes and then ride up here to call somehow or other i will manage that she shall see you then  he looked down at himself and smiled bitterly  it is true he said i look but a sorry lover remember margharita that i hold you to your promise in an hour i shall return  he left the grounds and walked down the hill with bent shoulders and never a glance to the right or the left     chapter vii  comfort comfort scorned of devils   adrienne i am the happiest man in the world  for how long sir  pour la vie he answered solemnly  her hand stole softly into his and there was a long silence between them what need had they of words it is only the lighter form of love fancy touched by sentiment which seeks for expressions by such means their love was different a silent consciousness of each others presence sufficed for them and so they sat there side by side steeped in the deep subtle joy of that perfect love which upon the nature of both the man and the woman had so chastening and spiritualizing an influence there was a new music in their lives a sweeter harmony than either of them had ever been conscious of before the world had grown more beautifuland it was for them the love which widens and deepens also narrows humanity was a forgotten factor in their thoughts all that they saw and dreamed of was theirs to taste to admire and to enjoy together it was for them that the silvery moon and the softly burning stars cast upon the sleeping earth a strange new beauty it was for them the air hung heavy with the faint perfume of spices and the mingled scents of heliotrope and violets it was for them that the dark pine trees waved softly backward and forward against the violet sky for them that the faraway sea made melancholy music against the pebbly beach and the soft night wind rustled among the tree tops in the orange groves all nature was fair for their sakes it is the grand selfishness of lovea noble vice  adrienne  they both started and looked round the voice was harsh and agitated and it broke in like a jarring note upon their sweet absorbed silence it was leonardo di marioni who stood before them on the balconyleonardo with white face and darklygleaming eyes to lord st maurice that stifled cry had sounded like the hiss of the snake in paradise and when he looked up the simile seemed completed  is it you leonardo adrienne said letting go her lovers hand and leaning back in her chair your entrance is a little unceremonious is it not were there no servants to announce you or to bring me word of your presence i dislike surprises  and i too adriennei too dislike surprises he answered his voice quivering with passion i find one awaiting me here  she rose and stood facing him cold but angry  you are forgetting yourself count di marioni and your speech is a presumption we have been friends but if you wish our friendship to continue you will alter your tone you have no right to speak to me in that tone and i expect an apology  his lips quivered and he spoke with a strange bitterness  no right ay you say well no right adrienne will you spare me a few moments alone i have a thing to say to you  she frowned and hesitated for a moment after all she had a womans heart and she could not choose but pity him  will not another time do leonardo she asked almost gently you see i have a visitor  yes he saw it he had looked up into the handsome debonair face with that proud happy smile upon the parted lips from the garden path below how he hated it  i may be summoned away from palermo at any moment he said cannot you spare me a short five minutes i will go away then  she looked down at her lover he rose to his feet promptly  ill have a cigar among the magnolias he exclaimed call me when i may come up  a look passed between them which sent a swift keen pain through the sicilians heart then lord st maurice vaulted over the balcony alighting in the garden below and they were alone  adrienne leonardo cried and his voice was low and bitter i dare not ask and yet i must know tell me quickly dont torture me you care for this englishman  yes  you love him  dearly with all my heart  you are going to marry him  yes  and not all her pity could keep the joy from her tone as she uttered the last monosyllable  my god my god  the suffering in his white face was awful to see her eyes filled with tears she knew that she had done this man no wrong that he had never had a single word of definite encouragement from her that time after time she had told him that his love was hopeless yet her heart was heavy as she watched his anguish  leonardo she said softly i am sorry but surely you do not blame me is it my fault that i love him and not you have i not begged you often to accept the only answer i could ever give you be generous leonardo and let us be friends  it was several moments before he spoke and then it seemed as though there had been a conflict in the man and the worse half had conquered the dumb grief in his eyes which had been so piteous to witness had changed suddenly into a furious passionate anger he shook with the violence of his emotions and though she was used to his stormy impetuous nature she was frightened  friends a curse upon such folly is it for friendships sake that i have followed you here at the risk of my life just to breathe the same air to look but now and then into your face ah adrienne adrienne listen once more to me do you think that he can love as i do never never i know that sluggish english temperament their wives are their servants or their dolls their passion is the passion of animals and they have not even constancy  she held out her hand he had destroyed her pity henceforth he was obnoxious to her  leave me she commanded you are talking of what you do not understand you are insulting me i detest you  detest me he laughed hysterically and the fire in his eyes grew brighter since when since this cursed englishman whispered his lies into your ears and stole you from me nay do not shake your head mine you would have been some day as surely as now you have made my life a hell my love would have conquered in the end it would have worn away your coldness and your resistance drop by drop mother of god it shall conquer do i come of a race who are content to stand calmly by and see the woman they love stolen away by strangers no  he stopped short and there was a strange look in his face adrienne saw it and trembled  leonardo she said i call a man who cannot bear a disappointment a coward i do not love you and under no circumstances whatever would it have been possible for me ever to have married you never never  he turned on his heel and walked away  we shall see he said au revoir my cousin  the emphasis in his tone and a certain fixed look in his face chilled her she held up her hands and he stayed  listen she said speaking slowly and with her eyes fixed steadily upon him i do not wish to think ill of you i do not wish to think that you could harm the man i love but if you didif you did i sayyou should taste a womans vengeance you think me weak but there are things which will fire the blood and steel the nerve of a weaker woman than i am remember leonardo lift but your little finger against lord st maurice and all ties of kindred and country are forgotten those means which lie ready to my hand i will use i have warned you remember  her tone had passed from earnestness to solemnity her attitude her final gesture were full of dramatic grace beside her he appeared mean and insignificant  i thank you for your candor cousin he said slowly if i harm your lover  if you harm him she interrupted fiercely you will win my undying hate even while you are undergoing my vengeance you know my power leonardo you know the means which lie ready to my hand never doubt but that i shall use them  he turned round and walked out of the house passing lord st maurice in the garden without even glancing toward him in the road he paused for a moment watching the long shadows pass quivering across the dark hills and the gleam of the moonlight upon the water far away below  she would never dare he murmured to himself she is a woman and she would forget     chapter viii  death in the face and murder in the heart   lord st maurice was in a good humor with himself and the entire world that night he had spent nearly the whole of the day with the woman he loved and whom he was shortly to marry and with the prospect of another such day on the morrow even his temporary exile from paradise was not a very severe trial he was an ardent suitor and deeply in love but an hour or two alone with a case of excellent cigars with delightful thoughts to keep him company the softest air in europe to breathe and one of the most picturesque sights to look upon could scarcely be esteemed a hardship above him among the woods twinkled the bright lights of the villa fiolesse which he had just quitted and below was the gay little marina still dotted about with groups of men in soft hats and light clothes and brighteyed laughing women whose musical voices rang out on the still night air with strange distinctness  through the clinging magnolia bushes and rhododendron shrubs he pushed his way downward the red end of his cigar shining out like a signal light in the semipurple darkness every now and then he stopped to take a breath of air perfumed by a clump of hyacinth or some starshaped flower which had yielded up its sweetness to the softlyfalling night now and then too he took a lovers look at the stars and downward to the softlyheaving bosom of the mediterranean all these things seemed to mean so much more to him now adrienne had changed the world and he was looking out upon it with different eyes sentiment which before he had scoffed at a little as became a sturdy young briton but lately escaped from public school and college had suddenly become for him something akin to a holy thing he was almost a poet that nighthe who had scarcely read a line of what the world calls poetry since his school days there was a man whom he had hated all his life just then he began to think of him without a particle of anger or resentment if he could have met him there among those drooping whiteflowering shrubs he felt that he could have shaken his hand have asked him heartily after his health and doubtless have fixed a day to dine with him the world was a capital place and palermo was on the threshold of heaven his big boyish heart was full to overflowing oh it is a fine thing to be in love  from the present he began to think a little of the future he was right in the clouds and he began to dream at twentyfive years old imagination is the master of the man at forty the situations are reversed but in losing the upper hand imagination often loses its power and freshness lord st maurice was in his twentysixth year and he began to dream he was his own master and he was rich there was a fine estate in eastshire a shooting lodge in scotland and a box in leicestershire which would adrienne prefer how delightful it would be to take her to them in the proper seasons and find out which one pleased her most when they reached england after a cruise as far as cairo and back along the mediterranean july would be on the wane it was just the best time they would go straight to scotland and have a few days alone upon those glorious moors before the shooting commenced he remembered with a little laugh the bachelor invitations which he had given and which must now be rescinded bother bachelor invitations adrienne was sure to like scotland this southern land with its profusion of flowers its deep intense coloring and its softlyblowing winds was beautiful enough in its way but the purple covered moors and cloudtopped hills of scotland had their own charm adrienne had never seen heather and his long low cottage was set in a very sea of it how pleasant the evening would be out on the balcony with the red sun sinking down behind bathness hill ah how happy they would be life had never seemed so fair a thing  he was on the marina by this time elbowing his way among the people who were still lazily walking backward and forward or standing in little knots talking the openair restaurant too was crowded but there were a few vacant seats and among them the little iron chair in which he had been lounging on that evening when adrienne cartuccio had passed by among the crowd he stopped short and stepping lightly over the railing drew it to him and sat down the busy waiter was by his side in a moment with coffee and liqueurs and taking a cigar from his case he began meditatively to smoke  since sundown the hot air had grown closer and more sulphurous and away westward over the waters the heavens seemed to be continually opening and closing belching out great sheets of yellow light a few detached masses of black clouds were slowly floating across the starlit sky now one had reached the moon and a sudden darkness fell upon the earth with such a lamp in the sky illuminations in the hotel gardens were a thing unheard of and the effect was singular only the red lights of the smokers were visible dotted here and there like glowworms conversation too dropped men lowered their voices the women ceased to make the air alive with the music of their laughter it was the southern nature when the sky was fair their hearts were light and their voices gay now there was a momentary gloom and every one shivered  the englishman looked up at the cloud wondered whether there would be a storm and calmly went on smoking the sudden hush and darkness meant nothing to him in his state of mind they were rather welcome than otherwise but in the midst of the darkness a strange thing happened  he was neither superstitious nor impressionable from either weakness he would contemptuously and with perfect truth have declared himself altogether free but suddenly the sweet swiftlyflowing current of his thoughts came to a full stop he was conscious of a cold chill which he could not in any way explain there had been no sound of footsteps nothing to warn him of it but he fancied himself abruptly encountered by some nameless danger the perspiration broke out upon his forehead and the cigar dropped from his fingers was it a nightmare the prelude to a fever was he going mad oh it was horrible  by a great effort of will he contrived to raise his eyes to the cloud it had almost passed away from the face of the moon the main body of it was already floating northward only one long jagged edge remained there could be only a second or two more of this unnatural gloom his heart was thankful for it ah what was that he bit his tongue hard or he would have called out either he was dreaming or that was the warm panting breath of a human being upon his cheek  he sprang up with his arm stretched out as though to defend himself and holding his breath but there was no sound save the dull murmur of whispered conversation around one glance more at the cloud how slowly it moved ah thank god the light was coming already the shadows were moving away voices were being raised figures were becoming distinct in a moment the moon would be free  it was all over laughing voices once more filled the air the waiters were running about more busily than ever people rubbed their eyes and joked about the darkness but the englishman sat quite still holding in his hand a long curiouslyshaped dagger which the first gleam of moonlight had shown him lying at his feet  he was no coward but he gave a little shudder as he examined the thing and felt its blueish steel edge with his finger it was by no means a toy weapon it had been fashioned and meant for use what use somehow he felt that he had escaped a very great danger as he put the thing thoughtfully into his pocket and leaned back in his chair the shrill voices and clatter of glasses around him sounded curiously unreal in his ears  by degrees he came to himself and leaning forward took a match from the little marble table and relit his cigar then for the first time he noticed with a start that the chair opposite to him was occupied occupied too by a figure which was perfectly familiar it was the sicilian who sat there quietly smoking a long cigarette and with his face shaded by the open palm of his hand  lord st maurice made no sign of recognition on the contrary he turned his head away preferring not to be seen his nerves were already highly strung and there seemed to him to be something ominous in this second meeting with the sicilian if he could have been sure of being able to do so unnoticed he would have got up and gone into the hotel  goodevening signor  lord st maurice turned and looked into the white corpselike face of the sicilian it told its own story there was trouble to come  goodevening signor he answered quietly  the sicilian leaned over the table there were gray rims under his eyes and even his lips had lost their color  a week ago signor he remarked we occupied these same seats here  i remember it lord st maurice replied quietly  it is well it is of the events which have followed that night that i desire to speak if you signor will grant me a few moments of your time  certainly the englishman replied courteously after all perhaps the fellow did not mean to quarrel  i regret exceedingly having to trouble you signor with a little personal history the sicilian continued i must tell you at the commencement that for five years i have been a suitor for the hand of the signorina adrienne cartuccio my cousin  second cousin i believe lord st maurice interposed  the sicilian waved his hand it was of no consequence  certain political differences with the imperial party at rome he continued culminated two years ago in my banishment from italy and sicily you i believe lord st maurice are of ancient family and it is possible that you may understand to some extent the bitterness of exile from a country and a home which has been the seat of my family for nearly a thousand years such a sentence is not banishment as the world understands it it is a living death but signor it was not all it was not even the worst alas that i a marioni should live to confess it but to be parted from the woman i love was even a sorer trial yet i endured it i endured it hoping against hope for a recall my sister and i were orphans she made her home with the signorina cartuccio thus i had news of her continually sometimes my cousin herself wrote to me it was these letters which preserved my reason and consciously or unconsciously they breathed to me ever of hope  not adriennes ill swear the englishman muttered to himself he was a true briton and there was plenty of dormant jealousy not very far from the surface  the sicilian heard the words and his eyes flashed  the signorina cartuccio if you please signor he remarked coldly we are in a public place  lord st maurice felt that he could afford to accept the rebuke and he bowed his head  my remark was not intended to be audible he declared  for two years i bore with my wretched life the sicilian continued but at last my endurance came to an end i determined to risk my liberty that i might hear my fate from her own lips i crossed the alps without molestation and even entered rome there i was watched but not interfered with the conclusion i came to was that as long as i lived the life of an ordinary citizen and showed no interest in politics i was safe i crossed to palermo unharmed i have seen the signorina and i have made my appeal  the englishman dropped his eyes and knocked the ash from his cigar the fellow was coming to the point at last  you signor the sicilian continued in a tone which although it was no louder seemed to gain in intensity from the smoldering passion underneath you signor know what my answer was for you were the cause i have not told you this much of my story to win your pity i simply tell it that i may reason with you i have tried to make you understand something of the strength of my love for the signorina do you think that after what i have risked after what i have suffered that i shall stand aside and see another man an alien take her from me i come of a race signor who are not used to see the women they love chosen for other mens wives have you ever heard of count hubert di marioni who with seven hundred men carried off a princess of austria from her fathers court and brought her safely through italy here to be one of the mothers of my race it was five hundred years ago and among the ruins of ancient kingdoms the marionis have also fallen in estate but the old spirit lingers lord st maurice i am not a bloodthirsty man i do not wish your life go back to your country and choose for a bride one of her own daughters give up all thought of the signorina di cartuccio or as surely as the moon yonder looks down upon you and me i shall kill you  lord st maurice threw his cigar away and shrugged his shoulders the affair was going to be serious then  you must forgive me signor if i do not quite follow you he said slowly the custom in our countries doubtless differs in england it is the lady who chooses and it is consideredpardon meillmannered for a rejected suitor to have anything more to say  as you remark the ideas and customs of our countries differ the sicilian rejoined here a nobleman of my descent would consider it an everlasting shame to stand quietly on one side and see the woman whom he worshiped become the bride of another man and that man an alien he would be esteemed and justly a coward let us waste no more words signor i have sought you tonight to put this matter plainly before you unless you leave this island and give up your pretensions to the hand of the signorina cartuccio you die you have climbed for the last time to the villa fiolesse swear to go there no more swear to leave this island before day breaks tomorrow or your blood shall stain its shores by the unbroken and sacred oath of a marioni i swear it  to lord st maurice the sicilians words and gestures seemed only grotesque he looked at him a little contemptuouslya thin shrunkenup figure ghastly pale and seeming all the thinner on account of his somber black attire what a husband for adrienne how had he dared to love so magnificent a creature the very idea of such a man threatening him seemed absurd to lord st maurice an athlete of public school and college renown with muscles like iron and the stature of a guardsman he was not angry and he had not a particle of fear but his stock of patience was getting exhausted  how are you going to do the killing he asked pardon my ignorance but it is evidently one of the customs of the country which has not been explained to me how do you manage it  i should kill you in a duel the sicilian answered it would be easily done  the englishman burst out laughing it was too grotesque almost like a huge joke  damn you and your duels he said rising to his feet and towering over his companion look here mr di marioni ive listened to you seriously because i felt heartily sorry for you but ive had enough of it i dont know whether you understand the slang of my country if you do youll understand what i mean when i tell you that youve been talking bally rot we may be a rough lot we englishmen but were not cowards and no one but a coward would dream of giving a girl up for such a tissue of whimperings be a man sir and get over it and look herenone of this sort of business  he drew the dagger from his breast pocket and patted it the sicilian was speechless and livid with rage  you are a coward he hissed you shall fight with me  that i wont lord st maurice answered goodhumoredly just take my advice make up your mind that we both cant have her and shes chosen me and come and give me your hand like a man think it over now before the morning goodnight  the sicilian sprang up and looked rapidly around at an adjoining table he recognized two men and touched one on the shoulder  signors he cried and you signor le capitaine pardon me if i ask you for your hearing for an instant thisgentleman here has insulted me and declines to give me satisfaction i have called him a coward and a rascal and i repeat it his name is lord st maurice if he forfeits his right to be considered a gentleman i demand that his name be struck off the visitors club  the three men had risen to their feet two of them were gentlemen of the neighborhood with whom lord st maurice had a bowing acquaintance the third was a french officer they looked inquiringly at lord st maurice  its quite true gentlemen he said with easy selfpossession hes been calling me all the bad names under the sun and i have declined to give him what he calls satisfaction i havent the least objection to your knowing it  the two palermitans looked at one another doubtfully the officer giving his moustache a twist stepped forward and bowed  might we inquire your reasons for declining the duel he asked  the englishman shrugged his shoulders  certainly he answered in the first place i am an officer in the service of her majesty the queen and duelling is strictly forbidden in the second signor di marioni is too excited to know what he is talking about  in england signor your first objection is valid here it is scarcely so as to the latter monsieur le count seems now to be perfectly composed i am on the committee of the club and i fear that i must erase your name if you persist in your refusal  i dont care two straws about your club lord st maurice answered carelessly as for the duel i decline it once and for all we englishmen have a code of honor of our own and it is more to us than the custom of the countries which we chance to visit i wish you goodnight gentlemen  they fell back impressed in spite of themselves by the coolness and hauteur of his words suddenly with the swiftness of a tigercat the sicilian leaped forward and struck the englishman on the cheek  perhaps you will tell us all signor how the men of your country resent an insult such as that he cried  every one turned round at the sound of the scuffle the eyes of all were upon the englishman who stood there head and shoulders above all the crowd with blazing eyes and pale cheeks he was in a towering passion but his voice never shook or faltered  you shall see for yourself signor he cried  the sicilian struggled but he was like a child in the englishmans arms he had caught him up in a vicelike grasp and held him high over the heads of the astonished onlookers for a moment he seemed as though he were going to throw him right out of the restaurant on to the marina but at the last moment he changed his mind and with a contemptuous gesture set him down in the midst of them breathless and choking  you can send your seconds as soon as you like he said shortly goodevening gentlemen  they fell back before him like sheep leaving a broad way right into the hotel through which he passed stern and selfpossessed the sicilian watched him curiously with twitching lips  there goes a brave man whispered one of the palermitans to the french officer but his days are numbered  the frenchman gazed at the sicilian and nodded there was death in his face     chapter ix      ah why should love like men in drinking songs     spice his fair banquet with the dust of earth   lord st maurice walked straight into his room without perceiving that it was already occupied he flung his hat into a corner and himself into an easychair with an exclamation which was decidedly unparliamentary  dn he muttered  thats a lively greeting remarked a voice from the other end of the room  he looked quickly up a tall figure loomed out of the shadows of the apartment and presently resolved itself into the figure of a man with his hands in his pockets and a huge meerschaum pipe in his mouth  briscoe by jove how long have you been here  about two hours ive been resting anything wrong downstairs thought i heard a row  strike a light theres a good fellow and ill tell you  the newcomer moved to the window and pulled aside the curtain  moons good enough he remarked i hate those sickly candles great scott whats the matter with you you look as black as thunder  lord st maurice told him the whole story martin briscoe listened without remark until he had finished then he pushed the tobacco firmly down into the bowl of his pipe and relit it smoking for a few minutes in silence  i tell you what maurice he said at length of all the bloodthirsty little devils that ever were hatched that marioni takes the cake why im going to fight him myself tomorrow morning  what cried st maurice starting up in his chair  fact i assure you margharita told me that he was going to be troublesome but id no idea that he was such a little spitfire i landed two hours ago and came straight here id scarcely had a tub and made myself decent when in the little beggar walks and kicks up no end of a row i listened for a bit and then told him to go to hell in five minutes hed got the whole thing arranged seconds and all tomorrow morning at 630 on the sands ll see me a dead man if he can use his tools as well as he can talk little beast  briscoe this is a horrible mess lord st maurice declared emphatically i dont know what you think of duels i hate them  it isnt duels i hate its the being spitted briscoe answered gloomily i can fence a bit but its always been with foils im not used to swords and i expect that fellow is a regular don at it theres a sort of corpselike look about him anyway got any baccy st maurice mines so beastly dry  help yourself old fellow who the devils that  there was a knock at the door and one of the servants of the hotel appeared with some difficulty for he was a native and spoke french execrably he explained that there were some gentlemen below who desired to speak with lord st maurice  the two men exchanged glances  my time has come you see lord st maurice remarked grimly wait for me  in the deserted salle √† manger the french officer and one of the palermitan gentlemen were talking together the latter approached lord st maurice and drew him on one side  i do not know how you may be situated here for friends lord st maurice he said but i felt that you would only consider it courteous of me to offer my services to you in case you are without a second in this affair my father wrote to me from rome of your visit here and i went to your yacht to call this afternoon my name is prucciosignor adriano pruccio  lord maurice bowed  i remember your father quite well he said and i am glad to commence our acquaintance by accepting the favor you offer will you be so good as to make all the necessary arrangements with the count marionis second and let me know the result  the palermitan withdrew into a corner of the room with the frenchman and a few minutes whispered conversation took place between them then he rejoined lord st maurice who was standing at the window  i am sorry to say that count marioni who is the insulted person in this affair chooses swords  lord st maurice nodded  when and where  at a place below the cliffs to which i shall conduct you at six oclock tomorrow morning  at six oclock but he has another affair on at halfpast  so i understand the palermitan answered i pointed out that we should prefer an interval of at least a day but monsieur le capitaine there explains that the count de marioni having dispensed with his incognito is hourly in danger of arrest on account of some political trouble and is therefore anxious to have both affairs settled i have agreed therefore with your permission to waive all etiquette in the matter  i dont know that it makes any difference to me lord st maurice answered tonight by moonlight would have suited me best  signor pruccio laughed  you are in a great hurry lord st maurice may i ask whether you are proficient with your weapon  i never fenced since i was at school he answered coolly i suppose marioni is dangerous  the palermitan looked very grave he began to see that it would be more like a murder than a duel  count marioni is one of the finest swordsmen in italy he answered perhaps if i were to explain that you are not accustomed to the rapier  pray dont lord st maurice interrupted hed be just as likely to shoot me  that is true signor pruccio assented i have seen him do wonderful things with the pistol if you can spare an hour or two signor i should be happy to give you a little advice as to the management of your weapon there is a large room at the top of my house where we fence  lord st maurice shook his head  thank you ill take my chance he answered  at five oclock signor will you not come to my house for the night  im much obliged but i must write some letters goodnight signor  goodnight signor sleep well                                       the golden light died out of the waning moon and afar off in the east a long line of red clouds seemed to rise out of the sea the air was still and calm and breathless even the sea seemed hushed as the yellow stars faded from the sky behind that bank of glowing clouds was the promise of the richer and fuller day amber was becoming golden and pink purple till through a very rainbow of coloring the suns first rays shot across the chilled waters  lord st maurice had fallen asleep with his head resting upon his arms close to the open window by his side with the ink scarcely dry upon either were his will and his farewell letter to adrienne no one but himself would ever know the agony the hopeless grief which had rent his heart as word after word sentence after sentence of passionate leavetaking had found their way on to those closelywritten sheets of paper but it was over nowover and done with when some faint sound from below or a breath of the morning breeze from the bosom of the sea awoke him and he commenced making a few preparations for the start he was surprised to find how calm he was the passion of his grief had spent itself he thought of those hours before sleep had fallen upon him with horror but they seemed to him very far away he was face to face with death but he felt only that he was about to make a journey into an undiscovered land his imagination was dulled he remembered only that he was going out to meet death and it behoved him to meet it as an honorable english gentleman  he plunged his head into a basin of cold water and made a careful toilette not forgetting even the buttonhole which adrienne had fetched for him with her own fingers on the evening before then he quietly left the hotel and walked slowly up and down the marina until signor pruccio arrived     chapter x  a marionis oath   two men stood facing one another on a narrow belt of sand stripped to the shirt and with rapiers in their hands one was the sicilian leonardo di marioni the other the englishman lord st maurice their attitude spoke for itself they were about to fight for each others life  it was a fair spot which their two seconds had chosen to stain with bloodshed close almost to their feet the blue waters of the mediterranean glistening in the early morning sunlight broke in tiny rippling waves upon the firm white sand inland was a semicircle of steep cliffs at the base of which there were great bowlders of rock ferncovered and with hyacinths of many colors growing out of the crevices and lending a sweet fragrance to the fresh morning air it was a spot shut off from the world for the towering cliffs ran out into the sea on either side completely enclosing the little cove there was only one possible approach to it save by boat and that a difficult and tedious one and looking upward from the shore hard to discover but on the northward side the cliffs suddenly dropped and in the deft was a thick plantation of aloes through which a winding path led down to the beach  perhaps of all the little group gathered down there to witness and take part in the coming tragedy signor pruccio lord st maurices second was looking the most disturbed and anxious his man he knew must fall and an ugly sickening dread was in his heart it was so like a murder he pictured to himself that fair boyish faceand in the clear morning sunlight the young englishmans face showed marvelously few signs of the night of agony through which he had passedghastly and livid with the stamp of death upon the forehead and the deep blue eyes glazed and dull it was an awful thing yet what could he do what hope was there leonardo di marioni he knew to be a famous swordsman lord st maurice had never fenced since he had left eton and scarcely remembered the positions it was doubtful even whether he had ever held a rapier but what signor pruccio feared most was the pale unflinching hate in the sicilians white face he loathed it and yet it fascinated him he knew alas how easily by one swift turn of the wrist he would be able to pass his sword through the englishmans body mocking at his unskilled defense he fancied that he could see the arms thrown up to heaven the fixed wild eyes the red blood spurting out from the wound and staining the virgin earth almost he fancied that he could hear the deathcry break from those agonized white lips horrible effort of the imagination what evil chance had made him offer his services to this young english lord and dragged him into assisting at a duel which could be but a farceworse than a farce a murder he would have given half his fortune for an earthquake to have come and swallowed up that merciless sicilian  a few yards away martin briscoe was standing with his second he and lord st maurice at this tragical moment of their lives had been nearer a quarrel than ever before briscoe with some justice had claimed priority with the sicilian and had maintained his right in the face of lord st maurices opposition but the sicilian had stepped in and insisted upon his privilege to decide for himself whom he should first meet the times had been distinctly stated he reminded them six oclock by lord st maurices second and halfpast six by mr briscoes he had arranged it so with a definite purpose and he claimed that it should be carried out there was no appeal from his decision he was in the right and martin briscoe with a dull red glow of anger in his homely rugged cheeks had been forced to retire and become a most unwilling spectator of what he feared could only be a butchery  signor pruccio had delayed the duel as long as he could under the pretext of waiting for the doctor who had been instructed to follow them but who had not yet arrived twice the sicilian had urged that they should commence and each time he had pleaded that they might wait for a few minutes longer to enter upon a duel √† loutrance save in the presence of a medical man was a thing unheard of he declared but at last this respite was exhausted for the opposing second with a pleasant smile had remarked that he himself was skilled in surgery and would be happy to officiate should any necessity arise there was no longer any excuse lord st maurice himself insisted upon the signal being given sadly therefore he prepared to give it already both men had fallen into position the word trembled upon his lips  a flock of seabirds flew screaming over their heads and he waited a moment until they should have passed then he raised his hand  stop  the cry was a womans they all looked round only a few yards away from them stood adrienne her fair hair streaming loose in the morning breeze and her gown torn and soiled she had just issued from the sloping aloe plantation and was trembling in every limb from the speed of her descent  the cloud on the sicilians face grew black as night  this is no sight for you to look upon he cried between his teeth you will not save your lover by waiting you had better go or i will kill him before your eyes  she walked calmly between them and looked from one to the other  lord st maurice i need not ask you i know this duel is not of your seeking  it is not he answered lowering his sword this fellow insulted me and i punished him publicly in the restaurant of the hotel de leurope last night in my opinion that squared matters but he demanded satisfaction and from his point of view i suppose he has a right to it i am quite ready to give it to him  the seconds had fallen back they three were alone she went up to the sicilian and laid her hand upon his arm  leonardo we have been friends have we not why should you seek to do that which will make us enemies for ever i have broken no faith with you i never gave you one word of hope i never loved you i never could have loved you why should you seek to murder the man whom i do love and make me miserable for ever  his face was ghastly but he showed no sign of being moved by her words  bah you talk as you feeljust now he said quickly i tell you that i do not believe one word if he had not come between us you would have been mine some day love like mine would have conquered in the end away away he cried pushing her back in growing excitement and stamping on the ground with his feet the sight of you only maddens me and nerves my arm to kill though you beg on your knees for his life that man shall die  i shall not beg upon my knees she answered proudly yet leonardo for your own sake for the sake of your own happiness i bid you once more consider you would stain your hand with the blood of the man who is more to me than you can ever be is this what you call love leonardo beware i am not a woman to be lightly robbed of what is dear to me put up your sword or you will repent it to your dying day  her voice rang out clear and threatening upon the morning stillness and her eyes were flashing with anger it was a wonderful tableau which had grouped itself upon that little strip of sand  the sicilian was unmoved the sight of the woman he loved championing his foe seemed to madden him  out of my way he cried grasping his sword firmly lord st maurice are you not weary of skulking behind a womans petticoats on guard i say on guard  she suddenly flung her hands above her head and there was what seemed to be a miraculous increase in the little group three men in plain dark clothes sprang from behind a gigantic bowlder and in an instant the sicilian was seized from behind  he looked around at his captors pale and furious they were strangers to him as yet he did not realize what had happened  what does this mean he cried furiously who dares to lay hands upon me we are on free ground  she shook her head  leonardo you have brought this upon yourself she said firmly but compassionately you plotted to murder the man i love i warned you that to protect him there was nothing which i would not dare only a moment ago i gave you another chance one word from you and i would have thrown these papers into the sea producing a packet from her bosom rather than have placed them where i do now  a fourth man had strolled out of the aloe grove smoking a long cigarette into his hands adrienne had placed the little packet of letters which he accepted with a low bow  even now the sicilian felt bewildered but as his eyes fell upon the fourth man he started and trembled violently gazing at him as though fascinated  i do not understand he faltered  the fourth man removed his cigarette from his teeth and produced a paper  permit me to explain he said politely i have here a warrant for your arrest count di marioni alias leonardo di cortegi on two counts first that you being an exile have returned to italian soil and secondly on a further and separate charge of conspiracy against the italian government in collusion with a secret society calling themselves members of the order of the white hyacinth the proofs of the latter conspiracy which were wanting at your first trial have now been furnished  he touched the little roll of papers which he had just received and with a low bow fell back there was an ominous silence  at the mention of his first name a deathlike pallor had swept in upon the sicilians face his manner suddenly became quite quiet and free from excitement but there was a look in his dark eyes more awful than had been his previous fury  you have done a brave thing indeed adrienne he said slowly you have saved your lover you have betrayed the man who would have given his life to serve you listen to me as i loved you before so do i hate you now as my love for you in the past has governed my life and brought me always to your side so in the days to come shall my undying hate for you and for that man shape my actions and mold my life and bring me over sea and land to the farthest corners of the earth to wreak my vengeance upon you be it ten or twenty or thirty years they keep me rotting in their prisons the time will come when i shall be free again and then beware search your memory for the legends of our race was ever a hate forgotten or an oath broken hear me swear he cried raising his clasped hands above his head with a sudden passionate gesture by the sun and the sky and the sea and the earth i swear that as they continue unchanged and unchanging so shall my hate for you remain ah you can take your lovers hand traitress and think to find protection there but in your heart i read your fear the day shall come when you shall kneel at my feet for mercy and there shall be no mercy gentlemen my sword i am at your service     chapter xi  a meeting of the order   a man in a furlined overcoatthin shrunken and wornstood on the pavement in a little street in camberwell looking about him in evident disgust before him stretched a long row of sixroomed houses smokebegrimed hideously similar hideously commonplace the street was empty save for the fourwheeled cab from which he had just alighted and which was now vanishing in a slight fog a milkman and a greengrocers boy in amicable converse and a few dirty children playing in the gutter nothing could be more depressing or more calculated to unfavorably impress a stranger from a southern land visiting the great city for the first time it was a picture of suburban desolation the home of povertystricken philistinism uncaring and uncared for in swinburnes words though with a different meaning one saw there without the necessity of further travel a land that was lonelier than ruin  the little old man who had alighted from the cab stood for a moment or two looking helplessly around half surprised at what he saw half disgusted such monotonous and undeviating ugliness was a thing which he had never dreamed ofcertainly he had never encountered anything like it was it possible that he had made a mistake in the address he drew a scrap of paper from his pocket and consulted it again the address was written there plainly enough85 eden street camberwell he was certainly in eden street camberwell and the figures on the gatepost opposite him worn and black with dirt were unmistakably an eight and a five with a little shudder he pushed open the gate and walked through the narrow strip of untidy garden to the front door the bell he found broken and useless so he knocked softly at first and then louder against the worn panels  it was some time before an answer came several of the neighbors appeared upon their doorsteps and took bold and somewhat ribald stock of the visitor a young person of eightyone who was considered the wit of the neighborhood made several very audible remarks which produced a chorus of gigglings on the subject of his clothes and foreign appearance but he stood there as though he had been deaf his hands thrust down into the loose pockets of his overcoat and his deepsunken eyes fixed wistfully but not impatiently upon the closed door he was a mute picture of resignation  at last after his third summons the door was slowly and cautiously opened and the astonished visitor beheld for the first time in his life a london maidofallwork the astonishment seemed perfectly mutual he with his parchment dried face white hair and eyebrows and piercing black eyes only a little dimmed by time muffled up to the throat in furs and unmistakably a foreigner was as strange to her as her appearance was to him he looked at her black hands her face besmeared with dirt and with her uncombed hair hanging loose around it at the tattered and soiled print gown looped up on one side and held together on the other by pins and at the whitestockinged feet showing through the holes in her boots what an object it was it was fortunate for him that the twilight and fog concealed partially at any rate the disgust in his face  ismr bartlezzi in he inquired as soon as he could find words to speak at all  lawkamussy i dunno the girl answered in blank bewilderment he dont have no visitors he dont you aint taxes are you  no he answered somewhat at a venture for he did not catch her meaning  nor water rate no you aint the water rate she continued meditatively i knows him he wears a brown billycock and glasses e does and i see him walking with mary ann stubbins on a sunday  he admitted doubtfully that she was correct he was not the water rate  it began to dawn upon her that it would be safe to admit him into the house  just yer come hinside will yer she said i dunno who yer are but i guess you aint nothink to be afraid of come hinside  she opened the door and admitted him into a dark narrow passage he had to squeeze himself against the wall to allow her to pass him then she surveyed him critically again with her arms akimbo and her head a little on one side  i reckon youve got a name she surmised what is it  you can tell mr bartlezzi that a gentleman from abroad desires to speak with him he answered my name is immaterial will you accept this he added holding out a halfcrown timidly toward her  she grabbed it from him and turned it over incredulously in the semidarkness there was no deception about it it was indeed a halfcrownthe first she had ever been given in her life  she dropped a rude sort of curtsey and opening the door of a room half ushered half pushed him in then she went to the foot of the stairs the coin tightly clinched in her hand and he heard her call out  master theres a gent here from furrin parts has wants you which is name his immaterial es in the parlor  there was a growl in reply and then silence the handmaiden her duty discharged shuffled off to the lower regions the visitor was left alone  he looked around him in deep and increasing disgust the walls of the little room into which he had been shown were bare save for a few cheap chromos and glaring oleographs of the sort distributed by grocers and petty tradespeople at christmas a cracked lookingglass with a dirty gilt frame tottered upon the mantelpiece the furniture was scanty and of the publichouse pattern and there was a strong nauseous odor of stale tobacco smoke and beer a small piano stood in one corner the cheapest of its kind and maintaining an upright position only by means of numerous props one leg tilted in the air was supported by two old and coverless volumes of a novel and another was casterless the carpet was worn into shreds and there was no attempt to conceal or mend the huge ravages which time had made in it the ceiling was cracked and black with smoke and the faded paper was hanging down from the top of the wall there was not a single article or spot in the room on which the eye could rest with pleasure it was an interior which matched the exterior nothing worse could be said about it  the visitor took it all in and raising his hand to his head closed his eyes ah what a relief it was to blot it all out of sight if only for a moment he had known evil times but at their worst such surroundings as these he had never met with a strange nervousness was creeping slowly over him the presage of disappointment he dropped his hands and walked restlessly up and down striving to banish his fears might not all this be necessarya form of disguisea clever mode of concealment poverty alone could not have brought things to this strait poverty there had been no poverty in his day yet he was full of forebodings he remembered the wonder the evasions almost the pity with which his first inquiries in rome had been met he could not expect to find things exactly the same twenty years is a long time and there must be many changes why had he not stayed in rome a little longer and learned more he could easily have obtained the knowledge which he desired there it would have been wiser surely it would have been wiser  the door opened in the midst of his meditations and he looked eagerly up again his heart fell it was not such a man as this that he had expected to see ah what a day of disappointments it was  the figure which after a moments pause in the doorway now advanced somewhat hesitatingly toward him was that of a man a little past middle age he was of medium height but stout even to corpulency and his cheeks were fat and puffy his hair was gray and his thick stubbly mustaches which had evidently once been black were also changing color his dark shiny coat was ridiculously short for him and his trousers terminated above his ankles he wore no necktie and his collar was ragged and soiled in short his whole appearance was not only untidy but dirty his gait too was slouching and undignified  you wished to speak to me he said in a thick tone and with a foreign accent my name is bartlezzisignor alfonso bartlezzi  yes i wished to speak with you  signor bartlezzi began to feel uncomfortable under his visitors fixed gaze why should he look at him so intently he had never set eyes upon him beforeand what an odd shrunken little figure it was he coughed and shifted his position  ah yes i am ready as you see is it anything to do with my profession  i do not know what your profession is  signor bartlezzi made an effort to draw himself up and assumed a military air  i am a master of fencing he announced also a professor of italianprofessor alfonso bartlezzi at your service i am fairly wellknown in this neighborhood if you have pupils to recommend sir or if you are thinking of taking lessons yourself i should be most happy my services are sometimes made use of as interpreter both in the police court and privately i should be happy to serve you in that capacity sir  signor bartlezzi having declared himself folded his arms and waited he felt certain that his visitor must now divulge his name and mission that however he seemed in no hurry to do  you are an italian he asked presently  certainly sir  may i ask have you still correspondents or friends in that country  the professor was a little uneasy he looked steadfastly at his visitor for a moment however and seemed to regain his composure  i have neither he answered sorrowfully the friends of former days are silent they have forgotten me  you have lived in england for long then  since i was a boy sir  and you are content  the professor shrugged his shoulders and looked round the gesture was significant  scarcely so he answered but what would you have may i now ask you a question sir he continued  yes  your name  his visitor looked around him mournfully  the day for secrecy is past i suppose he said sadly i am the count leonardo di marioni  what shrieked the professor  count leonardo di marionithat is my name i am better known as signor di cortegi perhaps in the history of our society  my god  if a thunderbolt had burst through the ceiling of the little sitting room the professor could not have been more agitated he had sunk down upon a chair pale and shaking all over with the effect of the surprise  he was a young man he faltered  his visitor sighed  it was fiveandtwenty years ago he answered slowly fiveandtwenty years rotting in a roman prison that has been my fate i was a young man then you see me now  he held up his arms and let them drop again heavily to his side it was a gesture full of sad dramatic pathos but in that little room there was no one to observe it no one to pity him for those white hairs and deepdrawn lines but that was nothing it was not pity that he wanted  there was silence both men were absorbed in their own thoughts signor bartlezzi was thunderstruck and completely unnerved the perspiration stood out upon his forehead and he could feel his hands and legs shaking this was a terrible and altogether unexpected blow to him it was not the thought of that twentyfive years lonely captivity which was oppressing him so much as the fact that it was overthat the day of release had come and that it was indeed count marioni who stood before him alive and a free man that was the serious part of it had it not been proclaimed that the imprisonment was for life that had certainly been the sentence a gleam of hope flashed in upon him perhaps he had escaped from prison if so the sooner he was back there the better  was not the sentence for life he gasped  the count assented shaking his head slowly  yes for life he answered bitterly that was the sentence imprisonment for life  then you have escaped  the same slow shake of the head the professor was bitterly disappointed  no at fiveandtwenty years a prisoner with a goodconduct sheet is restored to liberty my time came at last it was a weary while  what evil fate kept him alive all that time the professor muttered under his breath men are buried deep who pass within the walls of an italian prison what had kept this frail old man alive before the night was over he knew  the professor sat on the edge of his chair limp and dejected he was quite powerless to frame any speech of welcome or congratulation fortunately it was not expected his visitor was deep in thought and some time passed before he appeared even to notice the presence of signor bartlezzi at last however he looked up and spoke  i fear that all things have not gone well with us he said sadly on my release i visited the old home of our society in the piazza di spiola at rome it was broken up i met with no one who could tell me anything about it it was doubtless because i knew not where to go but i had fanciedi had hopedthat there might have been some one whose memory would not have been altogether dulled by time who would have come to meet me at the prison gates and welcome me back into the living world once more but that is nothing doubtless the day of my release was unknown it was the hot season at rome and i wandered wearily about seeing no familiar face and unable to hear anything of our friends i might have had patience and lingered but it seemed to me that i had been patient so longit was all exhausted from there i went to florence with the same result at last i came to london and by making cautious inquiries through my bank i discovered your address so i have come here  ah yes yes answered the professor with blinking eyes and still completely bewildered you have come here just so just so  the numbers have fallen off i suppose yet you still have meetings  oh yes certainly we still have meetings the professor assented spasmodically  the little old man nodded his head gravely he had never doubted it  when is the next he asked with the first touch of eagerness creeping into his voice  signor bartlezzi felt a cold perspiration on his forehead and slowly mopped it with a red cotton handkerchief the calmness of despair was settling down upon him he must know he thought better get it over  tonight he answered in an hourperhaps before theyll be dropping in directly  ah it was a longdrawn and significant monosyllable the count rose to his feet and commenced pacing the room already its meanness was forgotten its narrow walls had expanded the day of his desire had come what are your numbers now he asked  the professor drew a long breath and kept his eyes fixed upon his visitor the thing was narrowing down  four he answered four besides myself  the count started and appeared perplexed  four on the acting committee you mean i suppose he suggested four is the old number  the professor shook his head doggedly  four altogether he repeated  the old mans eyes flashed but the angry light died almost immediately away after all there might be grave reasons of which he was ignorant for restricting the number  four desperate and brave men may be much he mused half aloud one will do enough for my purpose  there was a ghastly humor in that speech which was nearly too much for signor bartlezzi he was within an ace of collapsing but he saved himself by a quick glance at that worn old man his visitor was living in the light of fiveandtwenty years ago the awakening would come it was at hand  signor bartlezzi the count said pausing suddenly in his restless walk i have a confession to make  so had he signor bartlezzi mused though his would keep  proceed he begged with a wave of his hand and a touch of his old bombast which had collapsed so suddenly proceed i am all attention  the count stood in the middle of the room with his left hand thrust into the bosom of his coat and the right stretched out toward the professor it was his old attitude of bygone days into which he had unconsciously fallen but his expression was no longer threatening and his voice though indeed it quivered was free from the passion and fire of his youth he was apologetic now rather than denunciatory it was a great change  you will doubtless imagine signor bartlezzi he said from my presence here from my seeking you out immediately upon my release that the old fires burn still in my heart that my enthusiasm for the cause still survives the chill of fiveandtwenty years alas that i should confess it but it is not so  then what the mischief does he want here mused the professor an account of his money i suppose oh damn those meddlesome italians who set him free  i am sorry but it is natural he remarked aloud wagging his head sagely fiveandtwenty years is a devil of a time  you will not misunderstand me professor he went on almost pleadingly you will not imagine for one moment that the order of the white hyacinth and everything connected with it is not still dear to me very dear i am an old man and my time for usefulness is past yet there is one demand which i have to make of the association which i have faithfully served and suffered for doubtless you know full well what i mean will you hear it now or shall i wait and lay it before the meeting tonight  the latter by all means begged the professor hastily they wouldnt like it if you told me first theyd feel hurt im sure  the count bowed his head  so be it then he said gravely  there was a short silence the professor with his thumbs in his waistcoat gazed fixedly down the street  i dont see why they shouldnt share the storm he mused hes small but he looks as though he might be awkward i would very much rather martello and the others were here martello is a strong man  there was a knock at the outside door and signor bartlezzi peered through the window  there they are he exclaimed ill go and let them in myself it would be better to prepare them for your presence excuse me  his visitor bowed and resumed his seat  i await the pleasure of the council he said with dignity     chapter xii  a figure from a world gone by   the count was left to himself in the bare untidylooking parlor and for a minute or two he was content to sit quite still and recover himself after the unaccustomed exertion of speech he needed all his strength for what lay before him but by degrees his restlessness grew he rose from his chair and paced up and down in increasing excitementhis misgivings were growing fainterhe worked himself up into the firm belief that the day for which he had waited so long was at hand  they dare not deny me he cried lifting his hands high above his head until they almost touched the smokebegrimed ceiling it is my due my just reward  he was so absorbed that he did not hear the noises outsidethe shuffling of feet and after a while a brief suppressed tittering signor bartlezzi who had entered the room quietly had to speak twice before he was conscious of his presence  they are in the room behind signor count and i have informed them of your presence he announced  the count drew himself up and stopped suddenly short in his restless walk  good he exclaimed lead the way i follow  together they passed into the narrow passage and the professor threw open the door of another room the count entered  the professor had done what he could in the short time at his disposal pens and ink had been placed upon the deal table and the chairs had been ranged along it instead of around the fire the tobacco jar and pipes were there however and some suspiciouslooking jugs and the hasty current of fresh air caused by the withdrawal of a sheet of brown paper from the upper window frame was altogether powerless to cope with the close beerhouse smell which hung about the place  the company consisted of four men the chair at the head of the table had been left vacant for the professor on the right sat andrew martello an anglicized italian and a vendor of ice cream on the left was pietro muratti the proprietor of an itinerant musical instrument these were the only two besides the professor who had any pretense to italian blood the other two were a french barber and a jew pawnbroker  the light was purposely dim and the counts eyes were bad besides his long confinement and the great though suppressed excitement under which he was laboring had to a certain extent confused his judgment he saw a mean room and four men only when he had dreamed of a chamber in some great house and an important assemblage but disappointing though this was it did not seem fatal to his hopes let but these four men be faithful to their oaths and he who had served their cause so well could demand as a right the boon he craved he strove earnestly to read their faces but the light was bad and his eyes were dim he must wait their voices would show him what manner of men they were after all why should he doubt for a moment men who had remained faithful to a dying and deserted cause must needs be men of strength and honorable men the very fewness of their numbers proved it else why should they too not have fallen away he would banish all doubt he would speak when his time came with all confidence  the professor introduced him with all solemnity casting an appealing glance at each in turn as though begging them to accept this matter seriously there was just a slender thread of hope still and he did not intend to abandon it  gentlemen he said i have the honor to present to you the count leonardo di marioni a martyr as you all know to our cause count marioni was only last week released from an imprisonment which has lasted for fiveandtwenty years  they all looked at him curiouslya little compassionately but none of them were quite sure how to acknowledge the salutation the jew alone stood up and made a shuffling little bow the others remained silent except the little french barber who murmured something about pleasure and acquaintance which the professor promptly frowned down the count who had remained standing advanced to the bottom of the table and laying his trembling hands upon it spoke  gentlemen and brothers of the order of the white hyacinth he said solemnly i am glad to meet you  the frenchman and the italian muratti exchanged expressive winks the vendor of ice cream growled across the table for the birdseye and commenced leisurely filling his pipe while the jew ventured upon a feeble hear hear  my name is doubtless known to you the count continued and the story of my life which i am proud to remember is closely interwoven with the history of your order your faces alas are strange to me my old comrades whom i had hoped to meet and whose sympathy i had counted on are no more i feel somewhat as though i had stepped out of the shadows of a bygone life and everything is a little strange to me i have grown unaccustomed even to speech itself you must pardon me if i do not make myself understood with ease the past seems very very far away  by this time all the pipes were lit and the mugs were filled the smoke hung round the little assembly in a faint cloud and the atmosphere was growing dense the count looked a little puzzled but he only hesitated for a moment he remembered that he was in england and the habits of foreigners were not easy to grow accustomed to it was a small matter although he wished that the odor of the tobacco had not been quite so rank when he resumed speaking however it was forgotten in a moment  i must ask you to bear with me in a certain confession which i am about to make he continued i am not here tonight to inquire or in any way to concern myself in the political prospects of our order alas that the time should come when i should find myself calmly acknowledging that my countrys sorrows were mine no longer but comrades i must claim from you your generous consideration fiveandtwenty years is a long time i have lost my touch of history my memoryi must confess itmy memory itself is weak i do not doubt that small though your numbers be you are nobly carrying on the work in which i too once bore a part i do not doubt but that you are laboring still in the glorious cause of liberty but i am with you no longer my work on earth for others such as it has been is accomplished i do not come to aid or to join you alas that i should say it i leonardo di marioni whose life was once so closely bound up with your prosperity as the breath of a man is to his body but it is so i am stranded upon the wreck of my past and i can only call upon you with a fardistant voice for my own salvation  there was a distinct air of relief the vendor of ice cream spat upon the floor and in response to a frown from the professor at once covered it with his foot the professor drew his hand thoughtfully down his chin they were approaching the crux of the whole matter  we regret it deeply count he said solemnly in that case the small trifle of money which the london agents of your bank have placed to our credit yearly on your behalf for the cause and which has regularly been used for theernecessary expenseser  the count stretched out his hand  it is nothing he answered why should you mention it that and more too the order is welcome to i doubt not that it has been well used  it has they cried with one voice  a drop more beer and a bottle of bran  the ice vendor never finished his sentence a furious kick from the professor under the table reminded him that he was on dangerous grounds and he desisted rubbing his leg and growling  the count scarcely heeded the interruption his whole form was shaking with eagerness his bony white hands were outstretched toward his four listeners for fiveandtwenty years he had dreamed of this  no my appearance once more before you comrades brothers has no such petty object he cried i am here to demand my rights as a member of the order of the white hyacinth i am here to remind you of our great principlevengeance upon traitors i am here to remind you of your unchanging oaths and to claim your fulfillment of them even as francesco dellia pleaded and not in vain before the council at rome thirty years ago we are a society of peace save alone where traitors are concerned i point out to you a traitor and i crypunishment  the professor knitted his brows and his hopes suddenly fell they all exchanged glances  old buffers dotty whispered the jew to his neighbor tapping his head significantly  the musical gentleman nodded  lets hear what its all about anyhow muttered the icecream vendor tapping the table  there was silence at once they all turned toward the count and waited  he had not been disappointed in their silence it seemed to him like the prudent reserve of true conspirators they wished to hear his case and as yet he had only reached the preamble good they should hear it  you all know that i was arrested and thrown into prison because i broke what they choose to call my parolebecause after the sentence of banishment had been passed upon me i returned to my native country and took part once more in the counsels of our order but you have yet to learn this comrades you have yet to learn that i was betrayed foully wilfullybetrayed into the clutches of the italian police before my very eyes papers of our society incriminating me were placed in the hand of our enemy signor villesco by one who had sworn our oaths in the first degree and worn our flower at your hands i call for vengeance upon my betrayersvengeance upon adrienne di cartuccio calling herself lady st maurice vengeance upon her husband her family and all belonging to her it is the first decree of our order which all of you have sworn to and i stand within my rights answer comrades of the order of the white hyacinth for your sake i have languished fiveandtwenty years in a roman prison with you it rests to sweeten my death by your oaths i charge you give me vengeance  his eyes were flashing and his features for the first time were convulsed with anxiety what meant this unsympathetic silence this lack of enthusiasm he looked from one to another of their stolid puzzled faces where were the outstretched hands the deep solemn oaths the cry for lots to be drawn which he had confidently expected their silence was driving him mad suddenly the icecream vendor spoke  what is it you want gaffer he asked without removing his pipe from his mouth cursed if i can see what youre driving at or any of us for that matter  what is it i want he cried passionately the life of my betrayer or such a mark of my vengeance as will make her rue the day she sent one of your order to work out his life a miserable captive in a prison cell is it not clear what i want speak all of you do you grudge me this thing do you hesitate  the vendor of ice cream constituted himself the spokesman of the little party he knocked the dead ashes from his pipe and leisurely refilled it the little old man at the bottom of the table was shaking with anxiety the thunderbolt quivered in the air  thats all bally rot you know guvnor he said calmly we aint murderers here this white hyacinth crew as youre atalking of must a been a bloodthirsty lot o chaps we aint on that track we meets here just for a drop and a smoke sociable like with our friend the professor and forms a sort of a club like among hourselves youve come to the wrong shop  the mans words blunt and unfeeling answered their purpose well they left no possibility of doubt or misunderstanding the count after a moments wild stare around tottered and sank into a chair all that had seemed strange to him was suddenly clear his head fell upon his arms and he crouched there motionless the hopes of fiveandtwenty years were wrecked the spark which had left him alive had died out the order of the white hyacinth was no more  there was a distinct and terrible pathos in the scene even those rough coarse men casting uneasy glances at that white bowed head and crouching figure at the head of the table and listening to his low moaning were conscious of a vague pity they thought of him as of some wandering lunatic who had strayed in upon them and indeed none of them except the professor doubted but that he was mad  he looked up at last and the icecream vendor who was not a bad sort at heart poured out a mugful of the unwholesomelooking beer and pushed it across the table toward him  here guvnor drink this he said gruffly itll do you good cheer up old buck i should whats done cant be undone and whats dead cant be brought to life again make the best of it i say youve got some of the ready left ill go bail and you aint too old to get a bit out o life yetif yer make haste and about that bloodthirsty talk of yours about vengeance and such like you just take my tip and chuck it we think more of life here than they does in furrin parts and hangin aint a pleasant death take my tip guvnor you chuck it  the count pushed the mug away and rose to his feet he had not heard a word there was a terrible buzzing in his head and ears  i am a foolish old man i fear he said unsteadily i ought to have considered fiveandtwentyyears ah yes it is a long time ago professor will you send your servant for a carriage i will go away  he stood quite still talking softly to himself with the tips of his fingers still resting lightly upon the table and a faraway look in his eyes signor bartlezzi himself ran hatless to the nearest cabstand and in a few minutes the rattle of a vehicle was heard outside and the professor returned breathless the count rose at once  i wish you goodnight gentlemen he said mildly you have been very patient with me fiveandtwenty years it is a long whilea long while fiveandtwenty years goodevening gentlemen professor i will take your arm to the door my sight is alittle dim thank you how dark it is the hotel continental if you please thank you professor  and so he went away     chapter xiii  between life and death   for three days count leonardo di marioni abode in his sittingroom at the hotel continental living the life of a man in a dream so far as the outside world was concerned it was a complete case of suspended animation of all that passed around him he was only dimly conscious the faces of his fellow creatures were strange to him he had lost touch with the world and the light of his reason was flickering almost it seemed as though it would go out indeed and leave him groping in the chaos of insanity mechanically he rose late in the morning ate what was brought to him or ordered what was suggested all day long he sat in a sort of dreamless apathy living still the life of the last fiveandtwenty years and finding no change save that the chair in which he sat was softer and the fire over which he stretched his withered palms was a new experience to him there were things even which he missed in the freedomif freedom it could be called he missed the warm dancing sunlight which day by day had filled the shabby sittingroom of his confinement he missed that patch of deep blue sky seen through his high barred window and the fragrant scents of the outside world which day by day had floated through it he missed the kindly greeting of his pitying gaoler and the simple foodthe macaroni the black coffee and the fruitwhich had been served to him and above all there was something else which he missed  for through all his apathy he was conscious of a great sickening disappointment something gone out of his life which had helped him day by day through all that weary imprisonment dear to his heart had grown that hope of standing one day before the masters of his order and claiming as his rightful due vengeance upon those whose word had sent him into captivity dear to his memory and treasured among his thoughts had grown that hope in his prison house he had grown narrower other thoughts and purposes had faded away that one only remained growing stronger and stronger day by day until it had seized hold of his whole being he lived only through it and with it  given some soulabsorbing purpose some cherished end however dimly seen through the mists of futurity and a man may preserve his reason through the longest captivity while day by day his narrowing life contracts till all conscience all hope all sentiment become the slaves of that one passionate desire day by day it looms larger before him day by day all doubts concerning it grow weaker and the justice of it becomes clearer and more unquestioned right and wrong justice and injustice according to other mens standards have no power over it in his own thoughts his moral sense slumbers so deeply has it become grafted into his life that he no more questions its right to exist than he does the presence of the limbs upon his body as surely as the night follows day so surely does his whole being gravitate toward the accomplishment of his desire it is a part of what is left of his life and if it is smitten his life is smitten they are at once sympathetic and identical so closely entwined that to sever them is death to both  thus it was with count marioni and thus it was that day by day he sat in his sittingroom slowly pining to death rude feet had trampled upon the desire of his life and the wound was open and bleeding only a little while longer and he would have turned upon his side with a sigh and yielded up his last breath and so far as his numbed faculties could have conceived a thought death would have seemed very pleasant to him he was dying of loneliness of disappointment and despair  the people at the hotel had made several attempts to rouse him but in vain he answered no questions and in his quiet way resented intrusion he paid whatever was demanded and he gave no trouble the manager who knew his history from a short cutting in a newspaper which had chronicled his arrival in london was at his wits end to know how to save him he had once endeavored to reason gently with his eccentric visitor and he had been bidden quietly to leave the room on his endeavoring to make one more appeal the count had risen quietly and pointed to the door  i wish only to be left in peace he said with a touch of dignity in his sad calm manner if you cannot do that i will go away to another hotel choose  the manager had bowed and withdrawn in silence but he was a kindhearted man and he was still troubled about the matter day by day the count was growing weaker before long he would doubtless die from sheer distaste of living as much as from any actual disease something ought to be done toward communicating with his friends if he had any with a certain amount of reluctance the manager as a last resource penned the following advertisement and sent it to the principal london papers       if there are any friends or relatives still alive of count      leonardo di marioni who has recently been set free by the      italian government after a long term of imprisonment they are      requested to communicate personally if possible with the      manager of the hotel continental where the count is now lying      dangerously ill     chapter xiv  an everlasting hate   at four oclock on the afternoon of the following day an open barouche drawn by a pair of magnificent bay horses drove up to the door of the hotel continental the manager who was standing at the window of his private room noticed two thingsfirst that there was a coronet upon the carriage door and secondly that the lady who was alighting carried in her hand a copy of the morning post turned down as though to mark a certain place in it  as she crossed the pavement he had a better view of her face and recognized her with a little start of surprise in a moment he was outside and on the steps to receive her an attention he very rarely bestowed upon his guests  the swing doors opened and closed and the lady with the paper still in her hand turned to the manager  do you know anything about this paragraph she asked touching it with her delicatelygloved forefinger the one i mean which concerns the count di marioni  certainly your ladyship he answered i inserted it myself  he is still here i suppose  he is your ladyship i do not know whether you will consider that i acted wisely in taking such a step but i could see no alternative he arrived here alone about a fortnight ago and at that time there seemed to be nothing singular about him excepting his clothing and a certain nervousness which the servants marked in his manner and which we can scarcely wonder at considering his painful history and recent return toercivilized ways he left the hotel almost immediately after engaging his room and was away i believe for several hours i chanced to be in the hall on his return and was struck by the change in his appearance your ladyship i never saw a man on whose face was written such dumb and helpless agony he went straight to his room and since then has never left it he is simply pining to death there he neither eats nor drinks nor speaks he sits there with his eyes fixed upon the fire like a man waiting for his end i ventured to visit him one morning but my attempts at remonstrance were cut short at once in a most dignified fashion i feel that it would be heartless to ask him to leave the hotel but at the same time if he remains and continues in the same way he will certainly either die or go mad very shortly what he wants is the personal care of friends and very kind treatment and as i could think of no other way of communication with them i decided to advertise his presence here i trust that your ladyship does not think my interference officious  he bowed his head and turned away out of respect for the tears which he could see in her eyes and which she made scarcely an effort to conceal  no you did quite right she said after a moments pause i was waiting for my husband outside the club and quite by chance i took up the post and saw your paragraph i drove here at once will you show me to the counts rooms if you please  certainly your ladyship will you come this way  she followed him up the fine marble staircase and down the firstfloor corridor at the extreme end he paused outside a door  it is of no use knocking he said he never answers if i can be of any further service your ladyship will perhaps be so good as to ring the bell  he opened the door for her and closed it quietly as she entered then he retreated along the corridor and returned to his room wondering not a little at the visitor whom his advertisement had brought  the great room in which the count marioni was sitting was almost in darkness for the afternoon was dull and foggy and the curtains were partially closed there was no lamp lit and the only light came from the brightlyburning fire near which the count was sitting in an armchair ludicrously too large for his frail body the flames fell upon his white worn face with its deep branding lines and gleamed in his great sad eyes so bright and dry that they seemed like mirrors for the firelight his hair and short unkempt beard were as white as snow matching even the unnatural pallor of his skin and his black frock coat was buttoned across a chest which would have been narrow for a consumptive boy he did indeed look on the threshold of death  he had not turned his head at the opening or closing of the door but presently another sound broke the silence it was a womans sob and as he slowly turned his head a tall graceful figure moved forward out of the shadows and he heard his name softly murmured  leonardo  his hand went up to his forehead was it a dream or was he indeed back once more in the days of his youth back among the pine woods which topped his castle walking side by side with her whose presence seemed to make the long summer days one sweet dream of delight the familiar odor of violets and wild hyacinths seemed to fill the room the fogbound city with its ceaseless roar existed for him no longer the sun of his own dear country warmed his heart and the sea wind blew in his eager face and she was therehis queenthe great desire of his weary life all his pulses leaped with the joy of her presence fiveandtwenty years of lonely misery were blotted out ah memory is a wonderful magician  leonardo will you not speak to me  again that voice where was he now face to face with her on the sands at palermo deceived betrayed given over to the enemies of his country and by herthe woman for whom his passionate love had been his sole crime listen the air is full of that cry of threatened vengeance hark how the echoes ring back from the cliffs by the sun and the sky and the sea and the earth i swear that as they continue unchanged and unchanging so shall my hate for you remain darknessa prison cell year by year year by year darkness solitude misery see the blade hair turn gray the strength of manhood wasting away the eye growing dim the body weak year by year year by year it goes on what was that scratched upon the whitewashed walls what was the cry which rang back from the towering cliff hate unchanging and unchanged the sameever the same  leonardo have you no word for me  he rose slowly from his chair and fixed his eyes upon her  before their fire she shrank back appalled was it a storm about to burst upon her no the words were slow and few  you have dared to comehere dared to come and look upon your handiwork away out of my sight you have seen me go  tears blinded her eyes the sight of him was horrible to her she forgot in her great pity that justice had been upon her side she sank upon her knees before him on the velvet pile carpet  leonardo for the love of god forgive me she sobbed oh it is painful to see you thus and to know the burden of hate which you carry in your heart forgive me forgive us both  he stooped down until his ghastly face nearly touched hers  curse you he muttered hoarsely you dare to look at me and ask for forgiveness never never every morning and night i curse you i curse you when my mother taught me to pray i live for nothing else if i had the strength i would strangle you where you stand hells curses and mine ring in your ears and sit in your heart day by day and night by night away with you away away  she was a brave woman but she fled from the room like a hunted animal and passed out of the hotel with never a look to the right or to the left  the manager came out to speak to her but he stood still aghast and let her go without uttering a word or offering to assist her as long as he lived he remembered the look on the countess of st maurices face as she came down those stairs clutching hold of the banisters and with hasty trembling steps left the hotel he was a great reader of fiction and he had heard of irish banshees and brahmin ghosts but never a living storyteller had painted such a face as he looked upon at that moment     chapter xv  the counts second visitor   two days more passed without any change in the counts conduct or health save that his brow was a little darker and he was heard occasionally muttering to himself  on the morning of the third a fourwheeled cab deposited at the door of the hotel a young lady who demanded somewhat haughtily to see the manager she was shown into the waitingroom and in a few minutes he appeared  he had been expecting a visit from an applicant for the post of assistant bookkeeper and he entered the room with a little less than his usual ceremony under the impression that this was she he found himself confronted with a tall slim girl elegantly but simply dressed in plain black clothes she carried herself with the dignity of a queen and before the quick glance of her flashing black eyes he felt himself abashed into making a low bow there was something foreign in her appearance but something eminently aristocratic  goodmorning madam  she disdained to notice the salutation and holding out a paper toward him pointed with her long slim finger to the advertisement column  i have come about this paragraph take me to him  with the greatest pleasure madam he answered bowing may i be permitted to ask are you a relation of the counts  certainly i am his niece she answered frowning take me to him at once i dont choose to be kept waiting she added impetuously  the manager bit his lip and bowed again to hide a smile it seemed to him that if this young lady failed to rouse his eccentric visitor the task was hopeless indeed  will you pardon me madam if i detain you one moment he said deferentially i should like before you see the count to explain to you the reasons which induced me to insert that notice in the times  she tapped the floor impatiently with her foot  be quick then  the count arrived here on the first of the month almost a fortnight ago immediately on his arrival he went out in a cab and returned somewhat late at night looking dazed and ill from that moment he has not left his room and we fear madam to be candid that he is losing his reason he declines to go out to see a physician to write to his friends it is pitiable to see him especially when one considers his long and painful imprisonment from which he has only just been released he would not listen to any suggestions or advice from us so it occurred to me to put that advertisement in the paper unknown to him may i be pardoned if i beg of you not to mention the means by which you became aware of his presence here or to simply state that you saw his arrival chronicled in the paper he may regard our interference in the light of a liberty although it was solely for his good  it was a liberty to take she answered coldly i will not promise anything i dare say i shall not mention it  there is one thing more which i should tell you madam he continued two days ago a visitor came to see him having noticed in the paper as you have done the paragraph i inserted i will not tell you her name but she was one of the most beautiful and distinguished englishwomen of our aristocracy and from the manner of her departure i could not help coming to the conclusion that the count by some means or other had frightened her to death she was nearly fainting as she came downstairs and she has not been here since i have no reason beyond what i have told you to doubt the counts sanity but i think that it is right for you to know this  very well i am not afraid kindly take me to him at once now she directed  he led her out of the apartment and up the broad staircase outside the door of the counts sittingroom he paused  shall i announce you madam he asked  no go away she answered shortly i wish to enter alone     chapter xvi  a new member for the order   count marioni sat in his old attitude brooding over the fire from the depths of his armchair with a sad vacant look in his dull eyes at first he took no notice of the opening of the door but as the light smooth footsteps crossed the floor toward him and hesitated at his side he glanced wearily up in a moment his whole expression was changed he was like a numbed and torpid figure suddenly galvanized into acute life  he passed his hand swiftly across his eyes and his thin fingers grasped the sides of his chair with nervous force ah he must be dreaming again it was one of the faces of the past tempting and mocking him yet no she stood there surely she stood there mother of god was this madness come at last  margharita he cried stretching out his hands toward her margharita  it was no dream then nor was it madness it was truth there were loving clinging arms around his neck a passionate weeping face pressed close against his hot tears her tears were tricking down his hollow cheeks kindling his stagnant blood by their warmth and thawing the apathetic chill whose icy hand had lain so heavy upon him a sob escaped him his eager trembling fingers pushed back the clustering hair from her temples he peered wonderingly into her face it must be a vision it would surely fade away and leave him once more in the outer darkness fiveandtwenty years had passed she had been like this then a sense of bewilderment crept in upon him  margharita he exclaimed feebly i do not understand you are margharita you have her hair her eyes her mouth and yet of course it cannot be ah no it cannot be  you are thinking of my mother she cried softly she loved you so much i am like her am i not  married margharita married ah of course i had forgotten and you are her child my sisters child ah fiveandtwenty years is a long time  it is a shameful cruel time she cried passionately my mother used to tell me of it when i was a little girl and her voice would shake with anger and pity francesca too would talk to me about you i prayed for you every evening when i was little that they might soon set you free again oh it was cruel  she threw her arms around his neck and he rested his head upon her shoulder it was like an elixir of life for him  and your mother margharita he asked fearfully  she is dead was the low reply  ah margharita dead she was so like you child dead fiveandtwenty years is a weary while dead  he sighed and his tearless eyes looked thoughtfully into the fire memories of other days were rising up and passing before him in swift procession he saw himself and her orphan brother and sister wandering hand in hand over their beautiful island home with the sea wind blowing in their faces and the spirit of the mountains which towered around them entering into their hearts dear to them had been that home dear that close and precious companionship they had talked of the life which lay before themrosecolored and joyous pregnant with glorious opportunities and possibilities for their island and the larger continent close at hand were convulsed at that time in certain patriotic efforts the history of which has been written into the history of europe and no one desired more ardently to bear a hand in the struggle than young leonardo di marioni large hearted romantic and with an imagination easily fired he was from the first a dreamer and margharita had ever been ready to share his dreams the blood of kings was in their veins to lead him on to great things and she margharita his sister his beloved sister should be the mistress of his destinies thus they had talked thus they had dreamed and now from the other side of the gulf he looked backward and saw in his own life in the place of those great deeds which he had hoped to accomplish one black miserable chasm and in hers forgetfulness of her high descentfor she had married this english merchants sonand the grave ah it was sad very sad  her soft breath upon his cheek brought him back to the present he looked down into her face with such a wistful fondness that it brought the tears again into her eyes  your mother then married martin briscoe  yes  and he  my father too is dead she answered sadly i am an orphan  ah and now you livewith whom do you live child he asked with sudden eagerness tell me are you happy  i am miserable she cried passionately  a quiet smile flitted across his face there was hope it was well  i am miserable often i wish that i were dead  tell me all about it child he whispered i have a right to know  she sank down upon the floor and rested her head upon the side of the chair in a moment she began  i think that i was quite happy when i was a little girl i do not remember very much about that time or about my mother for she died when i was six years old papa was very good to me but he was stern and cold always i do not think that he ever smiled after mamma died and he had money troubles too a bank failed and he lost a great deal and then he had a great many shares in a company which failed i dont understand much about it but when he died three years ago nearly everything he had went to pay people i had to go and live with my fathers brother and i hate it i hate them allmy uncle my aunt and my cousins they are vulgar common people they are in business and they are fearfully rich but their manners are dreadful and they are always talking of their money they have no taste no art no refinement i was going to leave them when i heard that you were here i was going to be a governessyes even earn my own breadrather than stay with them any longer i hated them so and their life and everything to do with them oh uncle uncle let me live with you let us go away from this wretched england let us go to some southern country where the sun is warm and the people do not talk of their money and there are beautiful things to see and admire it is ugly and cold here and i am weary of it  she broke off in a sudden fit of sobbing he took her face gently in his hands and held it up to him it was he now who was to play the part of consoler  margharita i am a lonely old man whose life is well nigh spent yet if you will come to me if you will really live with me then you will make my last days happy when i die all that i have will be yours it is settled is it not  like summer lightning the tempest of her grief died away and her face was brilliant with smiles  i will never never leave you uncle she cried joyously we will live together always oh how happy we shall be  then she looked at himlooked at his shrunken limbs and worn pinched face and a sudden darkening fire kindled in her face she stamped her foot and her eyes flashed angrily the sight of him reminded her that so far as he was concerned at least their happiness could not be of very long duration the finger of death had laid its mark upon that ashen gray face it was written there  how i hate them she cried those cruel wicked people who kept you in prison all these years i should like to kill them allto see them die here before us i would not spare onenot one  he thrust her away and started to his feet a changed man the old fires had leaped up anew the old hate the old desire was as strong as ever within him she looked at him startled and wondering his very form seemed dilated with passion  child he cried have you ever heard the story of my seizure and imprisonment no you have not you shall hear it you shall judge between me and them listen when i was a young man italy seemed trembling on the verge of a revolution the history of it all you know you know that the country was honeycombed with secret societies more or less dangerous to one of these i belonged we called our order the order of the white hyacinth we were all young ardent and impetuous and we imagined ourselves the apostles of the coming liberation yet we never advocated bloodshed we never really transgressed the law we gave lectures we published pamphlets we were a set of boy dreamers with wild theoriescommunists most of us but there was not one who would not have died to save our country the misery of civil warnot one not one even women wore our flower and were admitted associates of our order we pledged ourselves that our aims were bloodless no society that ever existed was more harmless than ours i say it i swear it bear me witness oh my god if what i say be not true  he was a strong man again the apathy was gone his reason was saved he stood before this dark tall girl who with clasped hands was drinking in every word and he spoke with all the swelling dignity of one who has suffered unjustly  by some means or other our society fell under the suspicion of the government the edict went forth that we should be broken up we heard the mandate with indignation we were young and hotblooded and we were conscious that we had done no harmthat we were innocent of the things ascribed to us we swore that we would carry on our society but in secret before then everything had been open we had had a recognized meeting place the public had attended our lectures ladies had worn the white hyacinth openly at receptions and balls now all was changed we met in secret and under a ban still our aim was harmless one clause alone was added to our rules of a different character and we all subscribed tovengeance upon traitors we swore it solemnly one to the othervengeance upon traitors  ah if i had lived in those days i would have worn your flower at the court of the king she cried with glowing cheeks  he pressed her hand in silence and continued  as time went on and things grew still more unsettled in the country a species of inquisition was established the eyes of the law were everywhere they fell upon us one night ten of us were arrested as we left our meeting place we were all noble and the families of my companions were powerful i was looked upon as the ringleader and upon me fell the most severe sentence i was banished from italian soil for ten years with the solemn warning that death would be my lot if i ventured to return  it was atrocious  he held up his hand  margharita in those days i loved her name was adrienne she too was an orphan and although she was of noble birth she was poor as we marionis were poor also she had a great gift she was a singer and sooner than be dependent upon her relatives she had sung at concerts and operas until all europe knew of her fame when i was exiled i was given seven days in which to make my adieux i went to her and declared my love she did not absolutely reject me nor did she accept me she asked for time for consideration i could give her none i begged her to leave the country with me alas she would not perhaps i was too passionate too precipitate it may have been so i cannot say i went away alone and left her i plunged into gay life at paris i dwelt among the loneliest mountains of switzerland i endured the dullness of this cold gray london and the dissipation of vienna it was all in vain one by one they palled upon me no manner of life no change of scene could cure me of my love i fell ill and i knew that my heart was breaking you and i margharita come of a race whose love and hatred are eternal  she crept into his arms and he went on holding her there  back i came at the peril of my life content to die if it were only at her feet i found her cold and changed blaming me even for my rashness desiring even my absence not a word of pity to sweeten those weary days of exile not a word of hope to repay me for all that i had risked to see her again soon i knew the reasonanother love had stolen away her heart there was an englishmanone of those cursed englishmenvisiting her daily at palermo and she told me calmly one day that she loved him and intended to become his wife she forgot my long years of devoted service she forgot her own unspoken yet understood promise she forgot all that i had suffered for her she forgot that her words must sound to me as the death warrant of all joy and happiness in this world and she forgot too that i was a marioni was i wrong i wonder margharita that i quarreled with him you are a child and yet my instinct tells me that you have a womans judgment tell me should i have stepped aside and let him win her without a blow  you would have been a coward if you had she cried you fought him tell me that you fought him  margharita you are a true daughter of your country the old man cried you are a marioni listen i insulted him he declined to fight i struck him across the face in a public restaurant and forced him to accept my challenge the thing was arranged we stood face to face on the sand sword in hand the word had been given his life was at my mercy but mind margharita i had no thought of taking it without giving him a fair chance i intended to wait until my sword was at his throat and then i would have said to him give up the woman whom i have loved all my life and go unhurt he himself should have chosen was not that fair  fair it was generous go on go on  the word had been given our swords were crossed and at that moment she adrienne the woman whom i loved stood before us with her were italian police come to arrest me there was one letter alone of mine written in a hasty moment which could have been used in evidence against me at my former trial and which would have secured for me a harsher sentence that letter had fallen into her hands and she had given it over to my bitter enemy the chief of the italian police i was betrayed betrayed by the woman whom i had braved all dangers to see it was she who had brought them she whowithout remorse or hesitationcalmly handed me over to twentyfive years captivity in a prison cell  margharita freed herself from his arms she was very pale and her limbs were shaking but what a fire in those dark cruel eyes  go on go on she cried let me hear the rest  then as i stood there margharita love shriveled up and hate reigned in its place the memory of the oath of our order flashed into my mind a curtain seemed raised before my eyes i saw the long narrow room of our meeting place i saw the dark faithful faces of my comrades i heard their firm voicesvengeance upon traitors vengeance upon traitors she too this woman who had betrayed me had worn our flower upon her bosom and in her hair she had come under the ban of that oath margharita i threw my sword into the sea and i raised my clasped hands to the sky and i swore that were it the last day of my life the day of my release should see me avenged let them hide in the uttermost corners of the earth i cried that false woman and her english lover still i would find them out and they should taste of my vengeance to my trial i went with that oath written in my heart i carried it with me into my prison cell and day by day and year by year i repeated it to myself it kept me alive the desire of it grew into my being even now it burns in my heart  during my captivity i was allowed to see my lawyer and i made over by deed so much to be paid every year to the funds of our order at the london branch for our headquarters had been moved there after my first arrest day by day i dreamed of the time when i should stand a martyr in their cause before my old comrades and demand of them the vengeance which was my due i imagined them one by one grasping my hand full of deep silent sympathy with my long sufferings i heard again the oath which we had swornvengeance upon traitors vengeance upon traitors it was the music which kept me alive the hope which nourished my life  the dark eyes glowed upon him like stars and her voice trembled with eagerness  you have been to them you will be avenged tell me that it is so  a little choking sob escaped from him the numbness was passing away from his heart and senses his sorrows were becoming human and demanding human expression  alas margharita alas he cried with drooping head the bitterest disappointment of my life came upon me all unawares while i have lain rotting in prison history has turned over many pages the age for secret societies has gone by the order of the white hyacinth is no moreworse than that its very name has been dragged through the dust one by one the old members fell away its sacred aims were forgotten the story of its downward path will never be written a few coarse ignorant men meet in a pothouse night by night to spend the money i sent in beer and foul tobacco that is the end of the order of the white hyacinth  margharita looked like a beautiful wild animal in her passion her hair had fallen all over her face and was streaming down her back her small white hand was clenched and upraised and her straight supple figure pantherlike in its grace was distended until she towered over the little shrunken form before her terrible was the gleam in her eyes and terrible the fixed rigidity of her features yet she was as beautiful as a young goddess in her wrath  no she cried fiercely the order shall not die you belong to it still and ii too swear the oath of vengeance together we will hunt her downthis woman she shall suffer  she shall die he cried  a slight shudder passed across the girls face but she repeated his words  she shall die but uncle you are ill what is it  she chafed his hands and held him up he had fainted     chapter xvii  the return to reason   where am i margharita  she leaned over him and drew a long deep breath of relief it was the reward of many weary days and nights of constant watching and careful nursing his reason was saved  in your own room at the hotel she whispered dont you remember you were taken ill  he looked at her helpless and puzzled slowly the mists began to roll away  yes you were with me he murmured softly i remember now i was telling you the story of the pastmy past you are margharitas child yes i remember was it this afternoon  she kissed his forehead and then drew back suddenly lest the warm tear which was quivering on her eyelid should fall back upon his face  it was three weeks ago  three weeks ago he looked wonderingly aroundat the little table at his side where a huge bowl of sweetscented roses was surrounded by a little army of empty medicine bottles at margharitas pale wan face and at a couch drawn up to the bedside and you have been nursing me all the time he whispered  she smiled brightly through the tears which she could not hide  of course i have who has a better right i should like to know  he sighed and closed his eyes in a few minutes he was asleep  for a fortnight his life had hung upon a thread and even when the doctor had declared him out of danger the question of his sanity or insanity quivered upon the balance for another week he would either awake perfectly reasonable in all respects his old self or he would open his eyes upon a world the keynote to which he had lost forever in other words he would either awake a perfectly sane man or hopelessly and incurably insane there would be no middle course that was the doctors verdict  and through all those long days and nights margharita had watched over him as though he had been her own father all the passionate sympathy of her warm southern nature had been kindled by the story of his wrongs day by day the sight of his helpless suffering had increased her indignation toward those whom she really believed to have bitterly wronged him through those long quiet days and silent nights she had brooded upon them she never for one moment repented of having allied herself to that wild oath of vengeance whose echoes often at dead of night seemed still to ring in her ears her only fear was that he would emerge from the fierce illness under which he was laboring so weakened and shaken that the desire of his life should have passed from him she had grown to love this shrunken old man in her girlhood she had heard stories of him from her nurse and many times the hot tears had stood in her eyes as she conjured up to herself that pathetic figure waiting and waiting year by year for that liberty which was to come only with old age she had thought of him sadeyed and weary pacing his lonely prison cell and ever watching through his barred window the little segment of blue sky and sunlight which penetrated into the highwalled court how he must long for the scent of flowers the fresh open air the rustle of leaves and the hum of moving insects how his heart must ache for the sound of mens voices the touch of their hands some sense of loving or friendly companionship to break the icy monotony of his weary stagnant existence her imagination had been touched and she had been all ready to welcome and to love him as a hero and a martyr even if he had appealed to her in no other way but when she had seen him stricken down and helpless with that look of ineffable sadness in his soft dark eyes it was more than her sympathy which was aroused more than her imagination which was stirred her large pitying heart became his absolutely she was alone in the world and she must needs love some one for good or for evil fate had brought this strange old man to her and woven this tie between them  that night she scarcely slept at all and before daybreak she stole softly over to the window and looked out the roar of the great city was hushed and silent below the streets and squares were white and empty in the gray light of the approaching dawn the mists were rising from the river and the yellow light was dying out of the room away eastward there was a break in the sky a long thin line of amber light which widened even while she watched it below the sky was red a dull brick red as though the yellow fog had mingled with the fainter and rosier coloring gradually the two came nearer together in the distance a cock crew and a cab drove across the empty square at the end of the street a lamplighter came round the corner whistling and one by one the row of gaslights beneath were extinguished even in that moment or two a brighter shade had stolen into the eastern sky that bank of dull purple clouds was breaking away and a few brilliant specks of cloudlets were shot up toward st pauls then the sun showed a rim and almost its first pale beam quivered upon the great church dome traveled across a thousand slate roofs and fell upon the girls white upturned face and across the white coverlet  margharita  she turned round quickly he was sitting up in bed and the sunbeam was traveling up toward him  are you awake did i disturb you she asked tenderly  he shook his head  i have been awake thinking i remember being taken ill i remember everything tell me i must know did youdid you meaneverything you said you pitied me and my story made you sad i would not hold you to your word  she drew herself up she was pale no longer the color burned in her cheeks  i am a marioni she answered proudly every word i said seems to me now too weak that is the only change  he held out his hands she grasped them fondly  margharita she came here he whispered  what here here in this room  he nodded  it was two days before you came i was sitting alone in the twilight the door opened i thought i was dreaming it was she as beautiful as ever richly dressed happy comely she came to pity to sue for pardon i let her talk and then when i had gathered strength i stood up and cursed her i thrust her away i cursed her with the fiercest and crudest words which my lips could utter it drove the warm color from her cheeks and the light from her eyes i cursed her till her heart shook with fear she staggered out of the room a stricken woman i  tell me her name  it was adrienne cartuccio it is now lady maurice  the lady st maurice she was my mothers friend then  yes  margharitas eyes were bright and her voice trembled  listen she cried when my mother was dying she gave me a letter if ever you need a friend or help she whispered go to lady st maurice this letter is to her she will help you for my sake uncle fate is on our side just before i came to you i wrote to lady st maurice i told her that i was unhappy in my life and i wished for a situation as a governess i sent her my mothers letter  and she replied  yes she offered me a home if i wished i could teach her little girl  her voice was trembling and her eyes dry and brilliant were fixed upon his he was sitting upright in bed leaning a little forward toward her and the sunbeam which had stolen in through the parted curtains fell upon his white corpselike face a strange look was in his eyes his fingers clutched the bedclothes nervously  you willgo he asked hoarsely you will go to lady st maurice  an answering light shot back from her eyes she was suddenly pale to the lips her voice was hushed as though in fear but it was firm  yes i shall go tonight i shall accept her offer     chapter xviii  i have a feara foolish fear   geoff its the most extraordinary thing in the world  what is it dear he asked throwing down his newspaper on the breakfast table and lighting a cigarette tell me about it  listen  she read the letter which was open in her hands and he listened thoughtfully leaning back in the highbacked oak chair and watching the blue smoke from his cigarette curl upward to the ceiling       london thursday       dear lady st maurice i have delayed answering your letter      for some time longer than may seem courteous to you owing to      the illness of a member of the family with whom i have been      living i trust however that you will not consider it too      late for me to thank you heartily for your generous offer to      me which if we can agree upon one point i shall be most      happy and grateful to accept you have a little girl you tell      me and no governess if you will allow me to fill the latter      position which i believe that i am quite capable of doing i      shall be glad to come i could not feel myself at ease in      becoming one of your household on any other footing hoping to      hear from you soon i am yours sincerely       margharita briscoe  did you ever hear of such a thing lady st maurice exclaimed margharitas child my governess i call it very stupid pride  lord st maurice shook his head  i think you are wrong dear after all you must remember that you are a complete stranger to her  that has been her mothers fault margharita never exactly blamed me for what i did at palermo but she always felt bitterly for her brother and she could not forget that it was my hand which had sent him to prison it was very unreasonable of her but after all one can understand her feeling still this girl of hers can have no such feeling toward me  of course not but none the less as i said before you are a complete stranger to her lord st maurice answered her parentage is just the sort to have given her those independent ideas and im inclined to think that she is quite right  lady st maurice sighed  i would have been only too happy to have welcomed her as a daughter she said i dare say you are right geoff i shall write and tell her to come  she walked away to the window looking across the pinebound cliffs to the sea time had dealt with her very leniently as indeed he needs must with those whose life is like one long summers day her brow was still smooth and her hair rich and soft as ever had not a single tinge of gray her figure too was perfect the lithe gracefulness of youth had only ripened into the majesty of dignified womanhood there was not a society paper which did not sometimes allude to her as the beautiful lady st maurice  but just at that moment her eyes were sad and her face was troubled her husband looking up suddenly saw it and throwing down his paper walked across the room to her side  adrienne what is it little woman he asked fondly  i was thinking of poor leonardo she answered geoffrey it is very foolish to let it trouble me is it not  very darling why should it  do you remember how terrible he looked when they arrested him on the sands and those fierce threatening words of his even now i can hear them sometimes in my ears  foolish little woman  i cannot help it this girls letter with its note of proud independence brings it all back to me geoffrey leonardo di marioni comes of a race who pride themselves more than anything upon keeping their word in love and in hate you can scarcely understand their fierce passionate nature i have always felt that when the day of his release came he would remember his oath and strive to work some evil upon us  lord st maurice passed his arm around his wifes waist with a reassuring smile  it is fiveandtwenty years ago love is not that enough to set your fears at rest  she looked at him without a smile grave and serious  the fiveandtwenty years are up geoffrey leonardo is free  what of it he answered carelessly if he has not forgotten us altogether what harm could he do us  she clasped her hands around his neck and looked into his face  geoffrey i have a confession to make she whispered will you forgive me  its a rash promise but ill chance it he answered smoothing her hair and smiling down into her upturned face  geoffrey he is in london i have seen him  he looked a little surprised but he did not draw away  seen him where when  do you remember the day when i was to have called for you at the travelers and you waited for me and i did not come yes i know that you do well i did come really but as i sat in the carriage waiting i took up the morning post and i read an advertisement there signed by the manager of the continental hotel it was inquiring for any friend or relative of count leonardo di marioni who was lying there dangerously ill and alone geoffrey of course i ought to have waited for you but i am impulsive sometimes and i was then i thought that if i could see him alone for the first time that i might win his forgiveness and so i drove there at once they showed me into his room he was sitting over the fire a miserable shrunken little figure wasted to a shadow ah how my heart ached to see him geoffrey i knelt by his side i spoke to him as tenderly as i could to one of my own children and then he turned a white corpselike face upon me and spoke words which god grant i may some day forget i do not believe that human lips have ever framed such hideous curses how i got down to the carriage i do not know you are not angry with me geoffrey  angry why no love he answered tenderly you did it for the best what a vindictive little beggar  geoffrey i cant help thinking that some day if he recovers he will try to do you or me a mischief  lord st maurice laughed outright  we are not in sicily he answered lightly  what could he do to either of us am i not big enough to protect myself and take care of you i tell you what adrienne why shouldnt i go and see him when i am in london next week  you she shuddered and clasped him tightly geoffrey promise me at once that you will not go near him she begged promise me  on one condition  what is it  that you will give up troubling about this nonsense  i will try she promised  thats right now put on your hat and come for a run on the cliff i cant have you looking so pale  he walked to the door with her and opened it kissing her forehead as she passed through she looked up at him fondly and the quiet pleasure which glowed for a moment in her cheeks and shone in her eyes made her look once more like a girl of twenty a womans greatest happiness had been hers in middle age her husband was still her lover  forgive me for being silly she whispered i cant help it our life has been so happy that i cannot bear to think of a cloud of any sort coming over it even for a very short while  the only cloud we have to fear is that big fellow yonder over gorton point he laughed  better bring your mackintosh down i shall not shoot today until i have seen some color in your cheeks     chapter xix  the new governess   none of the little household at mallory grange lord st maurices norfolk seat ever forgot margharitas first appearance among them she came late in the afternoon and was shown into lady st maurices own little sitting room without the ceremony of an announcement lady st maurice had many kind words ready to say but the sight of the figure who crossed the threshold and came out of the dusk toward the center of the room struck her dumb she stood up for a moment perfectly silent with her hand pressed to her side such a likeness was marvelous in this girls proud dark face she could recall leonardos features one by one the air seemed suddenly full of voices sobbing and cursing and threatening then she came to herself and held out her handforced her lips even to wear a kindly welcoming smile  i am so glad to have you here margharita she said do you know that your likeness to your motherand her familyhas startled me it is wonderful  it is very nice to hear you say so the girl answered taking the chair which at lady st maurices motion a servant had wheeled up to the fire i like to think of myself as belonging altogether to my mother and her people i have been very unhappy with my fathers relations  i am only sorry that you remained with them so long lady st maurice said let me give you some tea and then you must tell me why you never wrote to me before  because i made up my mind to bear it as long as i was able she answered i have done so it was impossible for me to remain there any longer and i determined to take my life into my own hands and if necessary find a situation i wrote first to you and you have been kind enough to engage me  to lady st maurice who was a woman of genial manners and kindly disposition there seemed to be a curious hardness in the girls tone and mode of expressing herself she had avoided the kiss with which she had been prepared to greet her and had shaken hands in the most matteroffact way this last phrase too was a little ungracious  engage you i hope you are not going to look upon our little arrangement in that light lady st maurice said pleasantly for your mothers sake margharita i should have been only too glad to have welcomed you here at any time as my daughter and i hope that when we know one another better you will not be quite so independent dont be afraid she added you shall have your own way at first some day i hope that you will come round to mine  margharita sipped her tea quietly and made no reply but in the firelight her dark eyes glowed softly and brightly and lady st maurice was quite satisfied with her silence for a few moments neither of them spoke then lady st maurice leaned back in her chair away from the firelight and asked a question  did you know that the count di marioni your uncle was in london  i knew that he had been there margharita answered in a low tone  had been has he gone away  i suppose so the girl continued looking steadily at her questioner yesterday i called to see him at a hotel in piccadilly and they told me that he had left that morning for abroad i was sorry to be too late  yes  lady st maurice asked no more the dark eyes seemed to be trying to pierce the dusk between them and read her face she turned the conversation and asked a few questions about the journey afterward would be time enough to find out how much this girl knew  soon lord st maurice came in from shooting wet to the skin and stood by the fire drinking his tea and talking pleasantly to margharita and his wife she talked more readily to him than to lady st maurice but in the middle of the conversation she checked herself and stood up  i am tired she said abruptly may i go to my room  lady st maurice took her away herself and showed her the suite which had been prepared for her there was a bedroom a daintily furnished little sitting room and a bath room all looking out upon the sea a bright fire had been lit in both the rooms and bowls of flowers and many little feminine trifles helped to unite comfort to undoubted luxury margharita went from one to the other without remark  these are far too nice she said simply when lady st maurice turned to go i have not been used to such luxury  lady st maurice left her with a sigh and went downstairs she had hoped to see the cold proud face relax a little at the many signs of thought in the preparations which had been made for her and she was disappointed she entered her sitting room thoughtfully and went up to her husband  geoffrey she is horribly like him  if poor marioni had had this girls looks i should have felt more jealous he answered lightly im almost sorry lumley is here  she shook her head  she is beautiful but i dont think lumley will admire her he places expression before everything and this girl has none she must have been very unhappy i think or else she is very heartless  he stood with his back to the fire twisting his mustache and warming himself  the fact is he remarked youre disappointed because she didnt jump into your arms and cry a little and all that sort of thing now i respect the girl for it for i think she was acting under constraint give her time adrienne and i think youll find her sympathetic enough and as to the expressionwell i may be mistaken but i should say that she had a sweeter one than most women although we havent seen it yet give her time adrienne dont hurry her  it was two hours before they saw her again and then she came into the drawing room just as the dinner gong was going neither of them had seen her save by the dim light of a single lamp and even then she had been wrapped in a long traveling coat and so although lord st maurice had called her beautiful they were neither of them prepared to see her quite as she was she wore a plain black net dinner gown curving only slightly downward at the white throat the somberness of which was partially relieved by an amber foundation she had no jewelry of any sort nor any flowers and she carried only a tiny lace handkerchief in her left hand but she had no need of a toilet or of adornment that proud exquisitely graceful carriage which only race can give was the dowry of her descent from one of the ancient families of southern europe but the beauty of her face was natures gift alone it was beauty of the best and purest french typethe beauty of the aristocrats of the court of louis the fourteenth the luxurious black hair was parted in the middle and raised slightly over the temples showing a high but delicately arched forehead her complexion was dazzling in its purity but colorless there was none of the harshness of the sicilian type in her features or in the lines of her figure the severest critic of feminine beauty could have asked only for a slightly relaxed mouth and a touch of humanity in her dark still eyes and even he knowing that the great joys of womanhoodthe joys of loving and being lovedwere as yet untasted by her would have held his peace murmuring perhaps that the days of miracles were not yet passed and a daughter of diana had appeared upon the earth  the little group to whom her entrance was something like a thunderbolt consisted only of lord and lady st maurice and their son lord lumley he although his surprise was the greatest was the first to recover from it  i am happy to meet you in proper form miss briscoe he said bowing and then looking into her face with a humorous light in his eyes i was afraid that i should never have the opportunity of telling you that those fellows met with at any rate a part of what they deserved i saw them locked up  she looked at him for a moment with slightly arched eyebrows and then suddenly smiled  oh is it really you she exclaimed holding out her hand which she had not previously offered i am so glad i was afraid that i should never have the opportunity to thank you for your kindness  you have met lumley before then asked lady st maurice wondering  scarcely so much as that he answered laughing dont you remember my telling you of my adventure in piccadilly mother  yes i remember do you mean that the young lady was really margharita  she looked at him and he colored slightly for the first time he remembered how enthusiastically he had spoken of the girl whom he had assisted and lady st maurice remembered too that for several days afterward he had been silent and distrait she could not fail to remember it for it was the first time she had ever heard lumley admire a girl in such terms  yes it was miss briscoe he answered keeping his head turned away from his mother  it was indeed i she admitted i dont know what i should have done but for your help lord lumley i am afraid that i should have screamed and made a scene  i cant imagine your doing it he remarked truthfully  perhaps not but i was so surprised i could not understand it  may i remind you that i am completely in the dark as to this little adventure lord st maurice remarked pleasantly what was it lumley  a very simple affair after all i was in piccadilly and miss briscoe here was coming out of some milliners shop and crossing the pavement to her carriage  cab she interrupted  cab then well it was late in the afternoon and two drunken little cads tried to speak to her naturally as i was the nearest decent person i interfered and assisted miss briscoe into her cab that i was passing was a piece of good fortune for which i have always been thankful  lord lumley does not add that his interference consisted in knocking one man down and holding the other until he almost choked with one hand while he helped me into the cab with the other  i only shook him a little he laughed giving his mother his arm for the butler had announced dinner while they had been talking if i had been he i would rather have had the shaking than the look miss briscoe flashed at him  i detest being touched she said coldly especially by a stranger  how did the affair end lord st maurice asked sipping his soup i hope you got them locked up lumley  why the termination of the affair was the part on which i do really congratulate myself he answered a policeman came up at once but before i could give them in chargein which case i should of course have been called upon to prosecute and got generally mixed up in the affairone of the fellows began thumping the policeman so of course he collared them and marched them off i slipped away and i noticed the next morning that they got pretty heavily fined for assaulting a policeman in the execution of his duty  a satisfactory ending to a most unpleasant affair lord st maurice remarked  during dinner lord lumley devoted himself to their guest but for a long time the burden of the conversation lay altogether upon his shoulders it was not until he chanced to mention the national gallery in connection with the seasons exhibition of pictures that margharita abandoned her monosyllabic answers and generally reserved demeanor he saw at once that he had struck the right note and he followed it up with tact he was fresh from a tour among the galleries of southern europe and holland and he himself was no mean artist but margharita he soon found knew nothing of recent art she was hopelessly out of date she knew nothing of the modern cant of the nineteenth century philistinism at which it was so much the fashion to scoff she had not caught the froth of the afternoon talk at fashionable studios and having jumbled it together in the popular fashion she was not prepared to set forth her views on art in somebody elses pet phrases lord lumley had met that sort of young lady and had shunned her margharita had simply acquired from a hurried visit to italy when she was quite young a dim but vast appreciation of the soul of the great masters she could not have defined art nor could she have expressed in a few nicelyrounded sentences her opinion of leonardo da vincis masterpiece or of the genius of pico della mirandola but she felt that a great world lay beyond a larger knowledge and understanding of these things and some day she hoped after time and thought and study to enter it  and lord lumley reading her thoughts with a keen and intuitive sympathy talked to her that night at dinner and afterward in a corner of the perfumed roselit drawing room as no man had ever talked to her beforetalked to her so earnestly and with so much effect that lady st maurice rose from her writing table at the other end of the room watched them with pale and troubled face and more than once made some faint effort to disturb them he showed her the systems and manner of thought by which the dimlyfelt wondering admiration of the uncultured yet sensitive mind can develop into the large and soulfelt appreciation of the artist it was the keys of her promised land which he held out to her with winning speech and a kindliness to which she was unaccustomed he was young himself but he had all the advantages of correct training of travel and of delicate artistic sensibilities he had taught himself much and fresh from the task of learning he had all the best enthusiasm of the teacher he had told himself that he too like the athenians worshiped beauty but never in his life had he seen anything so beautiful as margharitas face as she listened to him spiritual life seemed to have been poured into a piece of beautiful imagery her lips were parted and her dark eyes were softened it was the face of a st cecilia how long before it would become the face of a woman  it was lord st maurices arrival which dissolved the spell he had missed his afterdinner cigar and chat with lumley and directly he entered the drawing room he saw the cause adriennes eyes and his met a little annoyed by his sons defection he did not hesitate to act  miss briscoe are you too tired or may we ask for a little music he said walking up to the pair  she looked up frowning a little at the interruption then a swift recollection of her position came to her and the light died out of her face she rose at once  i shall be pleased to do what i can i sing a little but i play badly  she affected not to notice lord st maurices arm but crossed the room by his side toward the piano he opened it arranged the stool and remained standing there  she struck a few minor chords and suddenly the room seemed full of a sad plaintive music rising gradually to a higher pitch and then dying away as her voice took up the melody and carried it on lady st maurice held her hand to her side for a moment and her husband frowned it was a sicilian love song which she was singing the song of a peasant whose bride lies dead by his side the victim of anothers jealousy adrienne had heard it often in the old days and the beautiful wild music which rang in their ears was full of memories to her it closed abruptly and only lumley with an unusual sparkle in his eyes found words to thank her  are all your songs sad ones miss briscoe lord st maurice asked abruptly cant you offer us something in the shape of an antidote  she sat down at the piano again  i do not know anything gay she said i can only sing what i feel i will play something  she dashed off into a light hungarian dance full of verve and sparkle and lord st maurice kept time with his foot smiling approvingly directly it was over she closed the piano and turned to lady st maurice  if i may i should be glad to go to my room now she said i had no idea it was so late  lumley held the door open for her and felt unreasonably disappointed because she passed out with a slight inclination of the head but without looking at him then he turned back into the room and they all three looked at one another for a moment  she is marvelously handsome lord st maurice pronounced  marvelously his son echoed softly  but lady st maurice said nothing     chapter xx  lord lumley and margharita  geoffrey come here for a moment  the earl of st maurice who was a most obedient husband folded up his paper and joined his wife at the window  well dear  look there  he followed her finger it pointed to three figures a man in shooting clothes with a gun under his arm a girl and a child between them strolling along the cliffs outside the grounds he glanced at them carelessly and back into his wifes face as though for an explanation  well  this is the third morning that lumley has joined margharita and gracie in their walk  very good natured of him the earl replied carelessly he always was fond of gracie though wasnt he  i wish i could feel sure that it was entirely for gracies sake she answered anxiously  her husband whistled and his brows contracted a little  you mean to suggest i suppose that miss briscoe is the attraction he remarked thoughtfully  how can i help thinking so both yesterday and this morning he was in the schoolroom until i heard her tell him quite severely that he must go as he was interrupting their work both mornings i have asked him to drive with me and each time he made an excuse if margharitas name is mentioned before him he is either unusually silent and reserved or very talkative as a rule you know lumley does not care for girls that makes me all the more anxious  miss briscoe is certainly wonderfully beautiful he said yet i think that lumley has common sense  he has peculiar ideas his wife answered i have always been afraid of his doing something bizarre and as you say margharita is wonderfully beautifulfar more so than her mother i think what would you advise me to do geoffrey  he stroked his long gray mustache and looked thoughtful  its a delicate matter he said to even hint at the girl going away because lumley admires her would be unjust and at the same time if lumley got an inkling of the reason it would certainly make him think more of her than he does now you have no fault to find with her in any way  none absolutely none her behavior is perfect she is proud but i do not consider that a fault her manners are the manners of a perfectlybred lady  and gracie likes her  gracie adores her  she certainly doesnt attempt to encourage lumley in any way the earl continued thoughtfully  her manners and behavior in fact her whole conduct is perfectly irreproachable lady st maurice acknowledged in certain ways she has been a great disappointment to me but i wish to be just to her and i feel bound to say so it makes the situation all the more difficult  in that case we can do nothing her husband said decidedly things must take their course if they develop as we will hope they may not i will speak to lumley privately  you see she is coming back because lumley has joined them lady st maurice said geoffrey look at her now at the top of that hill does she not remind you of him  he took up a pair of field glasses from the table and looked at her steadily  yes she does he admitted she is just like that poor fellow marioni sometimes i never noticed it so clearly  she is horribly like him and geoffrey it is foolish of me but sometimes she looks at me with his eyes it makes me shiver  foolish little woman why you are actually nursing your fears  they are scarcely fears only a stupid sort of foreboding that comes on sometimes and which afterward i look upon as morbid it is foolish of me i know to connect them with margharita and yet i cant help it sometimes she is so like him  why dont you ask her if she knows anything about him or where he is surely you might do that  i have made up my mind to more than once but really geoffrey absurd though it may sound i have never felt quite at ease in asking margharita personal questions she so obviously insists upon our relations remaining exactly those of employer and employed it was not at all what i intended but what can i do i wish to be a friend to her but her manner quite forbids it she is far prouder than i am  lord st maurice shrugged his shoulders and kissed his wifes forehead  i shouldnt trouble about it dear they are a headstrong intractable race those marionis and this girl takes after her mother treat her kindly and shell come round some day come and sit in the library if you have nothing better to do for half an hour i have some stupid letters to write  i will come in one moment geoffrey she answered i may as well clear off some of my correspondence debts there are some invitations to answer too  lord st maurice left the room and adrienne remained by the window her eyes fixed upon the little group which had come to a standstill now on the summit of the low line of cliffs the field glasses were still on the table by her side and raising them to her eyes she watched them steadfastly for several minutes when she put them down she was a shade paler and there were tears in her eyes  if i thought that it would wipe out the past she murmured after all it might be well but how can it he will never forgive never never  she turned away brushing the tears from her eyes and went into her husbands room smiling and comely such sorrows as she had were not for him to sharenot even for him to know of the burden of them was for her alone                                       and meanwhile lord lumley her only son was leaning against the trunk of a pine tree on the brow of the cliff with something very much like a frown upon his forehead and a little distance away margharita was calmly reading to gracie out of a french picture book brought as lord lumley had been quick to surmise chiefly with a view of excluding him from their company it was quite true as his father had remarked that he had received very little encouragement from margharita in fact he had been told somewhat plainly a few minutes ago that his presence was interfering with the lesson as if there was any necessity to bring lesson books out of doors he had muttered sotto voce withdrawing himself a few yards however and relapsing into an irritated silence the book had been brought on his account altogether there was no doubt whatever about that and manlike he felt aggrieved of course he ought to have gone away at once and he had started with that intention but the sound of margharitas voice arrested him before he had gone half a dozen yards after all it would be pleasanter to stay and listen  so he stood there crumpling up a sprig of heather in his hand and ostensibly waiting for a shot at a sea gull he was quite aware that no sea gull was likely to rise anywhere near and that his gun was unloaded but the excuse was the only one that had occurred to him at a minutes notice his real object in remaining was that he might walk home with margharita when the lesson was over  the earl of st maurice had been a handsome man in his youth but his son was handsomer to the fine saxon physique of the st maurices in lord lumley had been added something of the more delicate beauty of his mother he had the long limbs and broad shoulders of which a gallery full of st maurices boasted but his features were more delicately formed and his forehead was higher and more intellectual than any of them  yet it had not in any way spoiled him he had not an atom of conceit or pride of any sort at college where he had graduated early he presented the rare combination of a noblemans son a moderate athlete and a hard reading man his had been the intellectual set of the whole university and having the rare gift of attaining an unsought influence over most of those with whom he was brought into contact he had imparted a distinctly scholarly tone to the little circle which he had formed men of all grades spoke well of him he was reserved and he was not a prig he was consistent to his own ideals and yet not censorious he was possessed of an agreeable and even winning manner and yet he had rather avoided the society of women than otherwise the consequence was that at twentyfour he had the thoughtful intellectual air of a much older man  the lesson came to an end at last and the three strolled down toward the house together lord lumley had joined them because there was something which he was determined to say  miss briscoe he began during a momentary halt while they watched a yacht tacking in the bay below may i ask you a question  i suppose so she answered carelessly without looking at him  you are beginning to avoid me  indeed  you brought that wretched book out this morning as an excuse to get rid of me  well if i did you should certainly relieve me of the necessity should you not  you know that you did and yesterday morning if gracie had not pleaded to stay out a little longer you would have cut your work short because of my presence  then if you think so lord lumley it is clearly your duty to go away as i reminded you just now  thanks i wonder why the path of duty is always so disagreeable  she did not answer him but taking gracie by the hand turned homeward he kept his place by her side heedless of the angry glance which she flashed upon him  i want to know why you object to my society so much miss briscoe he said presently  there are a great many things we want to know in this world which we dont know she answered where we go to after we die for instance we have to be patient and wait till we find out  then you wont tell me  why should i but if you really want to know the reason is simple enough i have been used to solitude i prefer it if i cannot have it absolutely i can have it comparatively at any rate  with gracie  exactly  you are complimentary he laughed  she shrugged her shoulders  why should i not tell the truth when there is nothing to be gained by telling a falsehood  he looked at her gravely  that sounds cynical miss briscoe  i am indifferent as to its sound she answered hadnt you better go and shoot something  he did not notice her suggestion  miss briscoe i do not like the way in which we are talking i  the remedy is obvious she interrupted haughtily  probably the fault is mine he continued calmly ignoring her speech i have not been used to talking to girls much my friends have all been men and i daresay that i have got into the habit therefore of expressing myself clumsily but what i want to say to you if you will give me the opportunity is this the first few evenings after your arrival here were very pleasant ones indeedfor me you talked to me and i found more pleasure in our conversation than i have ever done in anything else in my life there that is being frank is it not i hoped that we might be friends indeed it seemed to me that we were certainly going to be so i do not wish to offend you by any apparent exaggeration but i must say that it made a considerable difference to my interest in life that is putting it mildly where you have found the time to read and think so much of course i cannot tell it is not my business only i know that it makes your companionship very pleasant for me you see i am trying to be as matteroffact as possibledo please give me credit for that i just want to know why you have altered your manner to me why we cannot be friends will you tell me please miss briscoe  his pleading tone had a manly musical ring in it which was very pleasant to listen to and in his anxiety for her answer he had stooped down until his dark handsome head nearly touched hers she drew away impatiently  that is impossible she said coldly  and why  if for no other reason surely the countess of st maurices governess is no suitable friend for lord lumley  he colored under the intense hauteur of her words  you will forgive my saying that that is the first remark which i have heard from you miss briscoe which has not been in good taste goodmorning goodbye gracie  he turned abruptly along a private path through the pine wood margharita and her charge went on up to the house alone     chapter xxi  a land that is lonelier than ruin   late in the afternoon of the same day they met again and this time really by accident since morning a storm had been blowing but just before sunset the wind and rain had dropped and an angry sun glared out in its last moments upon the troubled sea lord lumley tired of struggling with a pile of books and smoking cigarettes had seen the change from his study window and seizing his cap and a stick had hurried out to taste the strong salt wind and to watch the cloud effects from the cliffs and as he had rounded the corner he had come face to face with margharita  she was standing on the highest point of the cliffs her skirts blowing wildly around her tall slim figure and making strange havoc with her hair her face was turned seaward but at the sound of his footsteps she turned quickly round his heart beat fast for a moment and then he remembered their parting earlier in the day  i am sorry to have disturbed you he said coldly raising his cap if i had had the least idea that you were here i would have taken the other path  he was passing on but as she made him no answer he glanced up at her face then all thought of going vanished there were glistening tears in her dark eyes and her lips were quivering  forgive me miss briscoe he said springing up to her side i was a clumsy idiot but i was afraid that you would think that i had followed you may i stay  she nodded and turned her face away from him  yes stay she answered softly stay and talk to me dont think me silly but i was feeling sadlonely perhapsand you have always spoken so kindly to me that the changeit was a little too sudden  i was a brute he whispered gently  the change in her was wonderful her voice was soft and glancing up at her face he could see that it was stained with tears at that moment he felt that he would have given the world to have taken her into his arms and held her there but he thrust the thought resolutely from him now was his opportunity to teach her to trust him he would not even suffer his voice to take too tender a note  the fresh air is glorious after a day cooped up in a little study he said lightly see the curlews there flying round and round over the marshes tennysons old home lies that way you know do you wonder that this flat country with its strange twilight effects should have laid hold of him so powerfully  it is strange and weird she murmured thoughtfully  weird is the very word for it tennyson might have written that lovely but hackneyed poem locksley hall from this very spot the place seems born to evoke sentiment and a stormy twilight like this seems to fit in with it it is not a fairweather land people come here in the summer and call the place flat and uninteresting one can scarcely wonder at it  it is a sadlooking country she said it was its sadness which brought me out this afternoon similia similibus curantur you know but in my case it has failed  and why should you be sad he asked softly wont you give me a little of your confidence  she smiled bitterly and shook her head  no you could never know ask me no questions only leave me alone talk to me of other things if you will my thoughts are bad companions tonight i do not want to be left alone with them do you know any of swinburnes salt marshes  a little  say it to me i want to escape from my thoughts  he obeyed her standing up by her side and watching the wild music of the poetry kindle her imagination and work into her heart he understood the situation now she was oppressed by some great trouble and he must help her to forget it and so when he had come to the last line he talked to her softly of it pointing out the strange lights on the sea and the shadows lying across the desolate country soon he drifted into verse again striving so far as he could to avoid the poetry of pessimism and despair so beautiful and yet so noxious and strike a more joyous and hopeful note soon he found himself at maud and here he was fluent but here she stopped him warned perhaps by the light which was creeping into his eyes  let us go home now she said you have been very kind to me i shall never forget it  he gave her his hand and they scrambled down on to the path they retraced their steps toward the house almost in silence he was only fearful of losing one particle of the advantage which he had gained the fear of not seeing her again however gave him courage  may i ask a favor he begged humbly  she nodded  make it a small one please i am almost afraid of having to refuse it  will you come down into the drawing room tonight  she shook her head  i cannot i have a long letter to write  his face fell  for just a short time then  she hesitated  yes if you wish it  we are friends now are we not anxiously  she flashed a brilliant look upon him which made the color steal into his cheeks and his heart beat fast  yes she said softly if you will     chapter xxii  lord lumleys confession   mother dont you think that miss briscoe is a very strange girl  lady st maurice looked up from her work quickly nine oclock was just striking and her son only a moment before had replaced his watch in his pocket with an impatient little gesture  yes i do think so she answered quietly i think her very strange indeed why do you ask me  he shrugged his shoulders  oh i dont know exactly it seems odd that she should want to spend all her evening alone and that she should have so many long letters to write do you think that she quite understands that you would like her to come down with us  i am quite sure that she does lumley i even objected to having her come here as a governess at all her mother was a dear friend of mine many years ago and i told margharita from the first that i would rather have her here as my daughter she would have been very welcome to a home with us it was only her pride which made her insist upon coming as gracies governess and i suppose it is the same feeling which prompts her to keep herself so much aloof from us i am sorry but i can do no more than i have done toward making her see things differently  lord lumley fidgeted about for a minute or two on the hearthrug there was a certain reserve in his mothers manner which made the task which he had set himself more difficult even than it would have been under ordinary circumstances besides he felt that from her low seat she was watching him intently and the knowledge did not tend toward setting him more at his ease  you loved her mother then  i did she was my dearest friend  and yetforgive me if i am wrongbut sometimes i fancy that you do not even like miss briscoe  she will not let me like or dislike her lumley  he shook his head  it isnt that exactly i have seen you watching her sometimesas for instance when she sang that sicilian song hereas though you werewell almost afraid of her as though there was something about her which almost repelled you  the countess laid down her work and looked steadfastly into the fire there was a moments silence  you have been a close watcher lumley  i admit it but tell me have i not watched to some purpose there is no mistaking the look in your face sometimes when she comes into the room unexpectedly if the thing were not absurd i should say that you were afraid of her  lady st maurice held her hand to her side for a moment as though she felt a sudden pain she repeated her sons words without looking up at him  afraid of her no no lumley i am afraid of something else something of which her face continually reminds me it is the shadow of the past which seems to follow her footsteps  a tragic note had suddenly been struck in the conversation between mother and son lord lumley who had been altogether unprepared for it was full of interest  the past he repeated whose past tell me all about it mother  she looked up at him and he saw that her face was unusually pale  lumley it is only a little while ago since your father and i told you the story of our strange meeting and marriage you remember it  every word every word mother  you remember the duel which the count di marioni sought to force upon your father but which i prevented you remember the means which i was driven to use to prevent it and the oath of vengeance which leonardothe count di marioniswore against us both  yes  lumley twentyfive years have passed away and he is free  but miss briscoe he asked bewildered how does all this concern her  she is his niece  his niece his niece  lord lumley could say nothing with all the swift selfishness of a man his thoughts were centered round one point would this new development hinder his purpose or was it favorable to him  leonardos sister lumley was my dear friend she married a man named briscoe and died very soon afterward margharita is their daughter and lumley there is no english blood in her veins she is a marioni i can see his eyes and his forehead every time i look at hers they seem to tell me that that wild oath still lives that some day he will stretch out his hand and redeem that murderous threat lumley there have been times when it has terrified me to look at that girl  his face was clearing a smile even began to dawn upon his lips  why mother dont you see that so far as miss briscoe is concerned that is all fancy he said you feel in that way toward her simply because she happens to resemble the count di marioni isnt that a little unfair to her what can she know of an oath which was sworn fiveandtwenty years ago long before she was born why i dont suppose that she ever heard of it  she smiled a little sadly  lumley i do not attempt to defend my feeling of course it is absurd to connect her with it really  i was sure that you would say so mother  but lumley although i cannot defend it the feeling remains listen no woman has known greater happiness than i have my life has been sometimes almost too perfect and yet i never altogether forgot those passionate words of leonardos they lay like a shadow across my life darkening and growing broader as the years of his confinement passed away the time of his release came at lastonly a few months ago and only a few months ago lumley i saw him  you saw him where  in london lumley why did he come almost on the day of his release here to england it was a country which he hated in his younger days and yet instead of visiting his old home his love for which was almost a passion instead of lingering in those sunny southern towns where many friends still remained who would have received him with open arms he came straight to london alone i found him at a hotel there broken down and almost as it were on the threshold of death yet when he saw me when he heard my voice the old passion blazed out lumley i prayed to him for forgiveness and he scorned me he had never forgotten he would never forgive he pointed to his person his white hairs to all the terrible evidences of his long imprisonment and once more with the same passion which had trembled in his tone twentyfive years ago he cursed me it was horrible i fled from that place like a haunted woman and since then lumley i have been haunted every feature in the girls magnificent face and every movement of her figure reminds me that she is a marioni  she had risen and was standing by his side a beautiful but a suffering woman he took her into his arms and kissed her forehead  mother you have too much imagination he said gently look at the matter seriously granted that this old man still harbors a senseless resentment against you yet what could he do he forgets the days in which he lives and the country to which you belong vendettas and romantic vengeances such as he may have dreamt of fiveandtwenty years ago are extinct even in his own land here they cannot be taken seriously at all  she shivered a little and looked into his face as though comforted in some measure  that is what i say to myself lumley she said but there are times when the old dread is too strong for me wholly to crush it i am not an englishwoman you know i come of a more superstitious race  i am sorry that miss briscoe should be the means of bringing these unpleasant thoughts to you he remarked thoughtfully mother  yes lumley  would it be a great trouble to you ifsome dayi asked you to receive her as a daughter  she stood quite still and shivered her face was suddenly of a marble pallor  youyou mean this lumley  i mean that i care for her mother  you have notspoken to her  no i should not have said anything to you yet only it pained me to think that there was anything between youany aversion i mean i thought that if you knew you would try and overcome it  i cannot  mother  lumley i cannot she looks at me out of his eyes she speaks to me with his voice something tells me that she bears in her heart his hate toward me you do not know these marionis they are one in hate and one in love unchanging and hard as the rocks on which their castle frowns even margharita herself in the old days never forgave me for sending leonardo to prison although i saved her lovers life as well as mine lumley you have said nothing to her  not yet  she would not marry you i tell you that in her heart she hates us all sometimes i fancy that she is hereonly  mother  he laid his hand firmly upon her white trembling arm she looked around following his eyes margharita pale and proud was standing upon the threshold with a great bunch of white hyacinths in the bosom of her black dress  am i intruding she asked quietly i will come down some other evening  lord lumley sprang forward to stop her but his mother was the first to recover herself  pray dont go away margharita she said with perfect selfpossession only a few minutes ago we were complaining that you came down so seldom lumley open the piano and get miss briscoes songs  he was by her side in a moment but he found time for an admiring glance toward his mother she had taken up a paper knife and was cutting the pages of her book it was the savoirfaire of a great lady     chapter xxiii  margharitas diarya correspondence   letter from count leonardo di marioni to miss m briscoe care of the earl of st maurice mallory grange lincolnshire  hotel de paris turin  my beloved niece alas i have but another disappointment to recount i arrived here last night and early this morning i visited the address which i obtained at florence with so much difficulty the house was shut up from inquiries made with caution among the neighbors i learned that andrea paschuli had left a few months before for rome thither i go in search of him  the delay is irksome but it is necessary although my desire for the day of my vengeance to come is as strong as ever i would not have the shadow of a suspicion rest upon you truly yours will be no crime but the world and the courts of justice would have it otherwise you will in verity be but the instrument upon my head be the guilt as mine will be the exceeding joy when the thing for which i crave is accomplished bless you my child that you have elected to aid me in carrying out this most just requital bless you my child that you have chosen to bring peace into the heart of one who has known great suffering  your last letter was short yet i do not wonder at it what is there you can find to say to me while our great purpose remains thus in abeyance my health continues good i am thankful to say yet were it otherwise i know that my strength would linger with me till my oath is accomplished till that day shall come death itself has no power over me even though its shadow lay across my path i could still defy it think not that i am blaspheming margharita or that i believe in no god i believe in a god of justice and he will award me my right oh that the time may be short for i am growing weary life is very burdensome save only for its end  sometimes my beloved margharita you have sought to lighten the deep gloom through which i struggle by picturing the happy days we may yet spend together in some fardistant country where the shadows of this great selfish world barely reach and its mighty roar and tumult sound but as a faint low murmur i have listened but i have answered not for in my heart i know that it will never be those days will never come i have shrunk from throwing a chill upon your warm generous heart but of late i have wondered whether i do well in thus silently deceiving you for margharita there is no such time of peaceful happiness in store for me i am dying nay do not start do not pity me do not fear i know it so well and i feel no pang no sorrow the limit of my days is fixednot in actual days or weeks but by events i shall live to see my desire accomplished and then i shall die the light may flicker but till then it will not go out you will ask me who am i that i dare to fix a limit to an existence which god alone controls i cannot tell you margharita why i know or how yet it is surely so the day which sees me free of my vow will also be the day of my death  trouble not my child at this thought nor wonder why i can write of the end of my days so calmly ask yourself rather what further life could mean for me there is no joy which i desire my wornout frame could find no pleasure in dragging out a tasteless and profitless existence i look for death as one looks for his couch who has toiled and labored through the heat of the day i shall find there rest and peace i have no other desire  for yourself margharita have no fear i have made your fortune my care and god grant that it may be a happy one honest men have made good profit out of my lands during my imprisonment i have wealth to leave and it is yours the castle of the marionis will be yours and well i know you will raise once more and uphold the mighty though fallen traditions of our race i leave all fearlessly in your hands at your entire disposal only one thing i beg of you and that without fear of refusal marry not an englishman marry one of the nobility of our own island if you can find one worthy of you if not there are nobles of italy with whom your alliance would be an honor and also a profit you will be rich as you are beautiful and the first lady in italy our distant kinswoman angela di carlotti will be your guardian and your friend may you be very very happy dearest and all that comes to you you will deserve for you have lightened the heart of a weary old man whose blessing is yours now and for ever  leonardo di marioni                                       letter from margharita briscoe to the count leonardo di marioni care of the princess di carlotti palazzo carlotti rome  my dear dear uncle i am inclined to scold you for your letter for it made me very sad why should you be so sure of dying just as the vengeance which is your due becomes yours you are not very old and i can nurse you even as i did before think how lonely i should be without you no you must not think of leaving me i forbid it it is morbid banish that fancy for my sake and try and think of a quiet happy life together away in some southern city where the sea and the sky are blue and the sun is warm and the breezes are soft and laden with the perfume of sweet flowers we would never live in this country would we i do not like it it is cold and damp and it chills me chills even my heart oh i know just the life we could live together and be very very happy write to me no more of death  i am quite settled down here waiting my duties are light and i do not find them irksome every day i realize that i did well in coming here as a governess and not as one seeking a home they think that it is because of my pride that i have willed it so they do not know  lady st maurice tries to be kind to me in her way but when the honeyed words are upon her lips i think of you and my heart is steel she must have been a very beautiful womannay she is beautiful now you asked me in your first letter to watch well and to tell you whether they were happy together you asked me and i tell you the truth  yes i think that of all the women whom i have ever seen her life seems to have flown along the most calmly and peacefully i have never seen a cloud upon her brow i hate her for it she has no right to be happy she who by such treachery condemned you to a living death once my anger rose up so fiercely that i nearly struck her and i had to hurry from the room lest i should betray myself before the time truly she deserves punishment and my hand shall not shrink from inflicting it  yet after all is death the most complete form of punishment sometimes i doubt it i would mar the beauty of her face for ever and laugh i would strike her blind gladly i would make her a cripple for life without remorse without hesitation to see her suffer would please me i should have no pity  but death uncle if anything of our religion be true would death be so terrible a thing against my will i see that her life is good she has made her home what it should be and her husband happy she is a devoted christian and wet or fine every sunday morning before breakfast she goes to the little church in the village and kneels before the altar she visits the sick and the poor and they love her for me religion has become something of a dream i was brought up a roman catholic what i am now i do not know when i vowed my life to its present purpose i filled it with new thoughts i put my religion away from me i could not kneel with hate in my heart i could not confess with the desire to kill in my bosom  yet let that pass supposing there be a heaven if we kill her for her treachery to you will not that sin be wiped out may she not gain heaven and if so what of our vengeance death is swift what will she suffer it will be those who are left behind who will feel the pain for her there will be a happiness beyond even the happiness of earth she will be shriven of her sin by our vengeance  think of this my dear uncle do not imagine that i am growing fainthearted do not imagine that i am drawing back from the task which i now claim as my right death or some other sort of punishment shall surely fall upon her she shall not escape only think what is best  write to me all that is in your heart fear not to speak out i would know all farewell your loving  margharita                                       letter from the count leonardo di marioni the palazzo carlotti rome to miss margharita briscoe mallory grange lincolnshire  beloved margharita i will confess that your letter troubles me if there be heaven for the woman who wrecked my life there is no heaven for me no religion no god you say that she is a good woman she is then a good woman through fear she seeks to atone but she can never atone she won a boys passionate love she wore his heart upon her sleeve she cast it away at the moment of her pleasure she broke the vows of an order which should have been as sacred to her as the face of god to the angels and she sent a marioni to rot through a useless life in a miserable prison the boy whose heart she broke and the man whose life she severed lives only to nurse his unchanging and unchangeable hate for her away with all other thoughts my vengeance knows but one end and that is death not sudden death mind but deathslow lingering and painful i would see the struggle against some mysterious sickness with my own eyes i would stand by the bedside and mock i would watch the cheeks grow thin and pale and the eyes grow dim she should know me in those last moments she should see me the wasted shadow of a man myself on the threshold of the grave standing by her bedside cold and unpitying and holding out toward her a white hyacinth  that is how i would have it though thus it may not be yet speak to me not of any other vengeance save death let none other dwell for a moment in your thoughts i solemnly charge you margharita  as to my search it has not yet alas been successful think not that i have lost heart or that i am discouraged never fear but that i shall find the man whom i seekif not there are others i give myself one month longer at the end of that time if paschuli be not found another must serve my purpose  the princess is much interested in you and sends her love she is impatient to take you under her care i have told her that it will not be longnor will it  farewell my child soon i shall send you the good newsyours  leonardo di marioni     chapter xxiv  white hyacinths   i am driven to what is either the vehicle for the sentimental vaporings of a school girl or the last resource of a desperate friendless woman i am going to set down on blank paper the record of events here just in the way they occur to me i am going to enjoy the luxury of being honest to myself i need not say in which of the above states i am that is soon shown  i would to god that i had died before i had come here before i had sought out my uncle count marioni and listened to the pitiful story of his wrongs i am pledged to a purpose so awful that i dare not think of it day by day i am expecting the time to arrive for the accomplishment of my hideous vow god keep it back keep me innocent a little longer  i write this in a weak moment there are times when my uncles wistful eyes seem turned upon me full of mute pleading and the old spirit of my race stirs up a great passion of hate in my heart then the thing seems easy i long for a weapon that i may end the struggle and avenge the man who looks to me to strike her gentle manners and kind words have no influence i am adamant i look across the sea and i see the figure of a man pale and lonely languishing year by year in a roman prison then indeed my heart is hard and my hand is ready  but there are other times such as these when i loathe myself and the part i am playing when an unutterable horror comes upon me and i see myself and my purpose in hideous ghastly colors it is such a mood that has driven me to make use of this dumb confidant that i may confess what this thing is which has dawned upon me my cheeks are stained with shame as i write it never could it have passed my lips oh my love my love cursed am i that i love you  he shall never know it he thinks me cold and capricious let him it is my purpose to make him suffer and he shall suffer in that i will be true to my oath i will make of this weakness a scourge no one will know what it costs me no one will know how sweet to me are the words which i train my lips to answer with scorn never a tender look or word shall he gain from me yet this much can i promise myself no one else shall ever be dear to me no other lover will i have save his memory he thinks that i dislike him he shall think so to the end he shall never knownever  i took up a novel this morning and tried to read but could not ah those fools who write about a womans lovewhat do they know about it nothing less than nothing i margharita am nineteen years old and i love i would die this moment cheerfully sooner than he should know it yet though i shall never hear one word of love from his lips or rest for one moment in his arms though i live to be an old woman i would starve beg die sooner than give myself to any other man to have loved even though the love be unknown and to have been loved even though it be silently is sweet to a woman she can crystallize the memory in her heart and pass through life sad perhaps yet content cold and deaf to all other voices they say that a man is not like this perhaps a womans nature is finer than a mansless passionate but more devoted  tonight as the dressing bell rang and i was coming upstairs to change my gown for dinner he met me in the hall and offered mea spray of white hyacinths how my fingers shook as i took them white hyacinths if he had only known what he had been doing white hyacinths what was that oathvengeance upon traitors does she remember it i wonder i think that she does for i wore them in the bosom of my dress and she turned pale when she glanced at them she looked at me as though she were afraid does my face remind her of the past i wonder she told me that my features are the features of the marionis and i know that i am like my mother i am glad of it i would have my face bring a pang to her heart every time she looks at it that is justice  she looked as though fascinated at the bunch of white flowers in my bosom i took care to let her know that lord lumley had given them to me i am never so gracious to him as in her presence  by the by mother he said during a pause in the conversation i have noticed that while you use every other color of hyacinths for table decorations you never use any white ones why is it  she looked at her husband i saw their eyes meet across the table and that look told me how near the past was to their thoughts  it is a flower i do not care for lumley she said quietly the perfume is too faint besides they are so suggestive of funerals  perhaps you would prefer my not wearing mine then i remarked carelessly i will throw them away  i saw him bite his lip and frown and i laughed to myself lady st maurice was hesitating  i should be sorry for you to do that she said groves can take them away until after dinner if you would not mind  they are scarcely worth keeping i went on drawing them from my corsage i care nothing for them after all and opening the window just behind my chair i threw them into the darkness  lord lumley came to me in the drawing room afterward  it was scarcely kind of you to throw my flowers away he said bending over my chair  i turned back with my hands clasped behind my head and laughed up at him  why not they were nothing to me it was kind to your mother at any rate  oh hypocrite hypocrite if he could only have seen me a few minutes before stealing along in the shadow of the shrubs outside looking about in the darkness till i had found them and holding them passionately to my lips they were in my pocket then wrapped in a lace handkerchief they are in a secret drawer of my desk now and there will they remain forever i do not mind confessing that they are very precious to me but he does not know that  he turned away offended and left me but i went to the piano and sang a wild neapolitan love song and when i had finished he was leaning over me with a deep glow in his pale cheeks and his eyes fixed upon mine does he know how handsome he is i wonder whence did i get the strength to look into those deep blue eyes burning with passion and mock at him  you sing divinely of what you know nothing he said  isnt that rather a rash assumption i answered lightly you are paying me a poor compliment in taking it for granted that i never had a lover lord lumley  have you  oh yes heaps  are you engaged then he asked fiercely  how like a man you jump at conclusions  but are you  is it your business lord lumley  yes  then if you make everybodys love affairs your concern you must find plenty to interest you  there is only one person in the world in whose love affairs i am interested  naturally i answered whose else should be so interesting as your own  i did not mean that he exclaimed almost angrily you are bandying words with me  on the contrary it is you who seem bent on mystifying me i answered laughing  you shall hear me speak more plainly then  i would rather not enigmas are so much more interesting will you allow me to pass  why he asked without moving an inch  because as your mother does not seem to be coming in again i should prefer going to my room  she is coming in again i heard her order coffee here in ten minutes  i dont want any coffee and i wont be kept here lord lumley be so good as to allow me to pass  in one minute margharita i  lord lumley i allow no man to call me by my christian name without permission  then give me permission  never  you dont mean that  i do lord lumley allow me to pass i will not be kept here against my will  he caught hold of my wrist but i snatched my hand away  margharita listen i love you why should you be angry i want you to be my wife  i believe he thought that i was won i had sunk down upon the music stool and covered my face with my hands my bosom was heaving with sobs with all my strength i was battling with a strange bewildering succession of feelings in reality i was more exquisitely and perfectly happy than i had ever dreamed of  i felt his strong hands close over my fingers and remove them one by one his head was quite close to mine and suddenly i felt his mustache brush my cheek  i sprang to my feet wildly fiercely angry my eyes were flashing and i had drawn myself up until i seemed almost as tall as he was if he had dared to kiss me oh if he had dared  let me pass i cried passionately let me pass at once i say  he fell back immediately he was half frightened half puzzled  lord lumley i never wish you to speak to me again i cried trembling all over with passionate indignation and dashing the tears from my eyes i hate you do you hear i hate you  he ought to have been abashed but he was not  you have no cause to hate me he said proudly surely a man does not insult a woman by offering her his love as i have offered you mine i scarcely see at least how i have deserved your anger  suddenly his voice broke down and he went on in a very altered tone  oh margharita my love my love give me one word of hope tell me at least that you are not really angry with me  and then without a moments warning the fire of indignation which had leaped up to help me suddenly died out he was standing respectfully away from me pale and dignified his face was full of emotion and his hands were trembling but some instinct seemed to have told him how i hated his touch and he did not attempt even to hold my hand oh that moment terrible as it was at the time will be very sweet to think upon in after days  my strength had come to an end i knew that i was in terrible risk of undoing all that i had done but i could not help it that moment seemed somehow sacred although my whole life was itself a lie i could not then have looked in his eyes and spoken falsely if i had let him see my face though only for an instant he would have known my secret so i buried it in my hands and swept from the room before he could stop me  am i more happy or more miserable i wonder since he has spoken those words which seem to be ever ringing in my ears both i think life is more intense it has other depths now besides that well of hate and pity which has brought me into this household at any rate i have felt emotions tonight which i never dreamed of before  if only he knewknew all how he would scorn hate despise me how he would hasten to drive me out of his memory to crush every tender thought of me to purge his heart of love for me to pluck it up by the roots and cast it away forever would he find it an easy task i wonder perhaps he loves his mother so much why should he not so far as he is concerned she deserves it she is a good mother and a good wife if it were not for the past i would call her a good woman sometimes i wish that she were not so that she was still vain and heartless the same woman who for the sake of an alien and a stranger brought down a living death upon the man who had trusted her with his most sacred secrets and that man the last of the marionis my uncle i think of it and coldness steals once more into my heart what she is now is of no account it is the past for which she must suffer     chapter xxv  among the pine trees   this morning i heard noises about the house quite early and heavy footsteps in the drive i was awakeit was only a few minutes since i had been sitting at the window watching the day break over the sea and i had the curiosity to look out i think that something must have told me what it meant for my heart sank even before i had any idea of what was going on there were two sailors from lord lumleys yacht in the bay carrying great hampers down from the house i guessed it all in a moment he was going away  i put on my dressinggown and sat down in a low chair to watch through a chink in the blind i could keep it lowered and still see quite plainly presently i saw him appear in his yachting clothes with oilskins on his arm would he glance up at all i wondered yes at the bend in the shrubbery he turned and looked for a full minute up at my window it was all i could do to keep from waving him to come back how pale he was and how dejected his walk seemed my eyes grew dim and there was a lump in my throat as he turned and walked away would it have made any difference i wonder if he had known of my being there if he could have seen my poor sad tearstained face i think that it would  he has gone i have seen the last of him am i glad or sorry i wonder glad that my task has become so much easier or sorry for my own unreasoning selfish sake why should i be a hypocrite these pages are to be the mirror of my heart to others my whole life is a lie i write here so that i may retain some faint knowledge of what truth really is i am sorrydesperately foolishly sorry i know that my cheeks are leaden and my heart is heavy there is no light in the day none of that swift keen struggling with myself which his presence always imposed he is gone and i miss them i should have laughed a few short days ago to have believed this true but it is true  the first bell has gone and i have drawn up my blind the promise of that bloodred sunrise has been fulfilled i wish that he had waited another day i have an idea that there is going to be a storm there is a pale yellow light in the sky which i do not like and as far as one can see the waves are crested with white foam it is an ugly sea and an ugly sky i wish that i were going with him and that a storm might come and we might die together i would not mind his holding me in his arms then we would die like that and death would be joy  at breakfast i was able to take the news of his departure without making any sign i fancy that lady st maurice was watching me when she made the announcement if she was expecting to read my thoughts and fears she was disappointed she could have seen nothing but the most utter indifference i felt that my mask was perfect  but as the day wore on my task grew harder the wind which had been blowing hard all the morning became a hurricane and even in the house with closed doors and windows we could hear the faroff thunder of the sea sweeping in against the cliffs every one in the household became strangely restless and anxious lord st maurice with a field glass under his arm went out upon the cliffs and he returned hatless and with his coat ripped up shaking his head with illaffected cheerfulness there was no sign of the stormy petrel  lumley would make for yarmouth harbor directly he saw this beast of a gale blowing up he declared walking up and down the morning room with troubled face he is a little careless but he is an excellent sailor and he must have seen that there was dirty weather brewing it isnt as though it were a sudden squall you know or anything of that sort there was plenty of warning all the same i wish he hadnt started it was very foolish and i dont like such whims i didnt hear him say anything about a cruise yesterday did you adrienne  was it my fancy or did lady st maurice indeed glance at me as she answered  no i heard nothing late last night he came to my room and told me that he had given groves some orders and that he should leave quite early this morning  lord st maurice frowned  it is most extraordinary he said he gave you no reason whatever then  none  did he say where he was going to we were shooting together all yesterday afternoon and he said not a word about going away on the contrary he arranged to go to norwich on thursday to look at some horses  the countess shook her head  i know no more than you do geoffrey i asked him where he was going and he did not seem at all sure he said that he would write if he remained away more than a day or two you know how uncertain he is  it is very inconsiderate of him lord st maurice declared leaving the room abruptly i am surprised at lumley  lady st maurice and i were alone she was pretending to read and i to work so far as she was concerned i could see that it was a pretence for she held her book upside down and for my part i did not make a correct stitch i knew that i ought to have been calm that i was imperiling my secret every moment when at last she spoke to me i made a great effort to control my tone  lord lumley said nothing to you i suppose margharita about going away  nothing whatever i answered quietly he would be scarcely likely to mention his plans to me and not to you or lord st maurice  i was forced to look up and i met her eyes fixed upon me with a look which i had seen there once or twice before it was almost a look of fear as though she saw in my face something which aroused a host of sad dimlyveiled memories was she wondering whether the presence of a marioni in her house boded illfortune to herself and those who were dear to her it may have been so  she did not answer immediately and i took advantage of the pause to leave the room i could not bear to talk to her  ought i not to have been glad at all thisto have watched her pale suffering face with satisfaction and even with inward joy was she not in trouble greater than any i could bring upon her and indeed had i not had a hand in it was it not i who had driven her son out into this danger should i not have rejoiced alas alas how could i when my own heart was beating fast in a very agony of sickening fear  my little pupil was away for the daygone to play with the clergymans children down in the village and my time was my own i was thankful for i could not possibly have forced myself into the wearisome routine of lesson hearing and teaching solitude was my only relief  the day wore on servants had been sent to every point along the coast and the harbor master at yarmouth had been telegraphed to every hour i stood by my window looking out in the fast gathering twilight until i could bear it no longer dashing the tears from my face i caught up a thick cloak and running softly down the back stairs left the house unobserved  at first i could scarcely stand and indeed as i turned the corner of the avenue and faced the sea a gust of wind carried me off from my feet and i had to cling to the low iron railings for support the thunder of the storm and the waves seemed to shake the air around me the sky was dark and riven with faint flashes of stormlight which slanted down to the sea by hard struggling i managed to make my way on to the cliffs and stood there looking downward with my arm passed round a tall fir sapling for support what a night it was the spray of the waves breaking against the cliff leaped up into my face mingled with the blinding rain and dimmed my vision so that i could only catch a faint view of the boiling seething gulf below beyond all was chaos for a gray haze floated upon the water and met the low hanging clouds and clear above the deep thunder of the sea came the shrill yelling of the wind in the pine groves which fringed the cliffs sounding like the demoniacal laughter of an army of devils shall i ever forget the horror of that day i wonder i think not it is written upon a page of my memory in characters over which time can have no power  and in that moment of agony when my thoughts were full of his peril i wrestled no longer with my secret i knew that i loved him i knew that he was dear to me as no other man could be i knew that i was face to face with a misery unchanging and unending  were not the fates themselves fighting against me in my task that it should be of all men upon this earth he the son of the woman whose death would be at my door a murderess should i be that the wind caught up the word which had burst from my pale lips and i seemed to hear it echoed with fiendish mirth among the bending tree tops of the plantation a murderess and of his mother the mother whom he loved so fondly if he should know it if the day should come when my sin should be laid bare and he should know that he had given his love to such a one sin was it a sin was my love turning the whole world upside down had it seemed so to me before was it sin or justice oh to whom should i look for strength to hold me to my purpose to pray would be blasphemous for me there was no god no friend on earth no heaven i could only think of that one shattered life and hug it to my memory  i wandered backward and forward in the storm drenched and cold yet all unmindful of my state i could have borne no roof over my head in those hours of my agony the thought of his danger maddened me even though i knew so well that he could be nothing to me that if he knew the truth he would loathe me that soon the day would come when i should scarcely dare to raise my eyes to his before we parted forever all these things seemed to make me long the more passionately to look once more into his face to know that he was safe it was my fault that he was in this danger horrible thought  i was exhausted worn out in body and mind by the sickening fears which no effort of will seemed able to quell even my limbs at last gave way beneath me and i sank upon my knees holding my face in my hands had the edge of the cliff been a little nearer could i have done it without any physical effort i had been content to close my eyes and throw myself into the sea if there are no joys in death at least there is rest  then a voice came to me  margharita  i leaped up from the wet ground with wildlybeating heart was it some mocking trick of the stormthat voice in my ears that dear dear voice my eyes seemed dilated and through the deep gloom i saw a tall figure striding toward me then i know that i cried out and called to him by his name and alas by the tone of my voice and the light that flashed into my face my secret was gone for evil or for good he knew then that i loved him     chapter xxvi  storms   there came a time then of blessed and grateful unconsciousness the tumult of the storm was reduced to a mere singing in my ears and darkness seemed to have closed in around me when i opened my eyes i was resting in his arms and a delicious sense of happiness was stealing through me sensation had overpowered memory and i was happy ah if life could have ended thenthat was how i felt if only the future and that shrunken relentless figure pointing me on to tragedyif only they could have melted away alas alas  he had become bold at my mute selfyielding and at something which he must have seen in my face i felt him bending down over me and suddenly my lips partly opened to frame the feeblest of protests were closed in a long passionate kiss and his arms drew me toward him still i made no effort to release myself a desperate selfabandonment had crept in upon me the happiness of that moment should recompense me for the misery to come time took to itself wings then i had no power or will to measure it if hell itself had been yawning at my feet i was content  it was he who spoke at last still clasping my hands and looking eagerly into my face  margharita my love i have come back to you how shall i bless this storm  have you been in danger i asked softly  nothing to speak of he laughed we ran for yarmouth harbor directly we saw what was coming and only lost a few spars what a sea it was though wave after wave broke over our bows and swept the deck it was a miracle we lost no men  and how is it that you are home so quickly  i took the first train from yarmouth and wired for a special from the junction i knew that my mother would be anxious and they told me that there was very little chance of telegrams being delivered safely so much damage had been done to the wires  you thought of no one but your mother i whispered a little reproachfully  my darling how was i to know that any one else cared  ah  the sense of relief in my heart was overpowering i seemed to have no desire for speech the sound of his voice was like music to me and i preferred to listen  it seems to me that i have had no thought save of you margharita he went on slowly in all that storm when flying clouds and spray and driving rain shut us in on every side i thought of nothing else save of you no one knows the boat so well as i and for the last four hours i was lashed to a board steering margharita all that time and all the time i stood on the bridge i seemed to see you always sometimes it was the mist of rain and spray which opened to let you through and sometimessometimes i almost fancied that you were by my side think of you margharita why i was a haunted man in all that thunder of sea and wind when i had to use a speaking trumpet to make my men hear me a few yards away i could only hear your voice in my ears as distinctly as you hear me now they say that when one is in danger or near death that the imagination is quickened it must have been so with me for your presence and the sound of your voice were very real to me  how did you find me here i asked  well as soon as i could decently get away from my people i asked for you they sent to your room and could not find you then one of the servants thought that she had seen you leave the house and come this way so i started off in search  it was foolish of me to come out i could not rest indoors  why eagerly  the storm was so dreadful  and so you came out into it a bad reason was there no other  i was anxious too i think i wanted to see what the sea looked like  why were you anxious what about  somebody was in danger  my darling  his lips met mine again my strength seemed altogether gone i made no effort to escape  i didnt say who somebody was i protested weakly  he laughed gaily  but i know  sure  quite sure  i may have relatives who are sailors  you may have but you havent  i considered for a moment  it was purely a matter of responsibility you know i felt that i had something to do with your going away i was disagreeable last night and you were offended see  not a bit  you are very stupid  i am not now i was last night  what do you mean  i will answer you by asking a question will you promise to reply to it  cela d√©pend i wont be rash  do you care for mejust a little he asked tenderly but hopefully  oh horrible a vision seemed to float suddenly before my eyes the darkness faded away to be replaced by a little whitewashed chamber in a distant land i saw an old man dying with his eyes fixed upon me full of mute reproach his trembling fingers pointed at me with scorn and his lips framing a feeble curse suddenly his look changed his arm fell his face grew suddenly bright and joyful and the curse changed into a fervent blessing then the room widened and the little figure under that spotless coverlet faded away it was a chamber in a palace and i saw lady st maurice also on her deathbed her husband and her son knelt by her side with bared heads and the air was laden and heavy with the sound of their sobs she alone did not weep and her pale spiritualized face glowed like the face of a martyred saint and as i watched i seemed to hear one word constantly escaping from those who watched by her side and caught up and echoed a thousand times by the sad wailing wind until it rang in my ears unceasinglyand the word was murderess  it passed awayvanished in a phantom of mist like some weird morbid fancy but the joy of those last few minutes was quenched i drew myself from his arms and pressed my hand to my side there was a sharp pain there  we must go back to the house i said i have been a little mad i think and i am very wet  he looked at me amazed  wont you answer my question first he pleaded margharita make me very happy be my wife  his wife oh the grim grotesque agony of it all my strength would never be sufficient to carry me through all this my heart was faint and my speech was low yet it was as cold and resolute as i could make it  never never i would sooner die than that let us go back at onceat once  he caught me by the wrist and forced me to look into his face it was unwise of him to touch me against my will for the fire flashed into my eyes and my anger gave me strength  margharita what does this mean you do care for a me a little dont you  no  i lied god knows and all in vain  perhaps not so very much now he said with a little sigh but you will some day i know that you will be generous margharita give me a little hope  i laid my hand upon his arm how could i convince him anger lies reasoning all seemed so weak and ineffective and he was so strongstrong in his own love strong unconsciously in mine  lord lumley i can only give you one answer and that isno nothing can change me i would sooner throw myself from these cliffs than become your wife  he considered for a moment while i watched him anxiously  i have a right to know your reason for that speech he said in a low but firm tone give me your hands for one moment margharitaso now look me in the eyes and tell me that you do not care for me  i was a fool to try i might have known that after all i had passed through that day it was beyond my strength i got as far as the first three words and then i burst into tears his whole face lit up with joy at my failure  i am satisfied he said drawing my hand through his arm come we will go back to the house i must not have you catch cold  he spoke with an air of fond proprietorship which made my heart tremble but i had no more words left with which to fight my battle my strength was gone i did not even try to withdraw my hand  we walked away and i did my best to choke the hysterical sobs which threatened me directly we left the shelter of the pine grove speech became impossible we had to fight our way along step by step with the wind and rain beating in our faces i was thankful for it for the physical effort seemed to stimulate and calm me  when at last we reached the house and stood inside the hall he turned to me and spoke for the first time  that walk was quite an event wasnt it let me feel how wet you are  he ran his fingers down my arm and back and then rang the hall bell violently  you are wet through he said gravely and it is my fault instead of bringing you home at once as i ought to have done i kept you out there talking run upstairs at once margharita please and change all your things i will send up hot water  he had been hurrying me to the stairs all the time and i began slowly to ascend them he stood down in the white stone hall watching me anxiously  you wont be long will you he said as i reached the corner i want to talk to you before dinner  i answered him mechanically and turning away went along the corridor to my room and flung myself upon the bed i had scarcely been there five minutes when there was a knock at the door  who is there i asked sitting up and hastily drying my eyes  a servants voice answered and i recognized cecile the countesss own maid  her ladyship has sent you a cup of tea miss and hopes you will be sure to change all your clothes there is a letter for you too miss  i bade the girl come in and put the tea down when she had gone i stretched out my hand and took up the letter with trembling fingers it was from my uncle and the postmark was rome     chapter xxvii  a life in the balance   i suppose it is absurd to talk about presentiments and yet i knew what was in that letter as plainly as though i saw it written up in characters of fire i knew its contents and my doom the climax of all things was at hand the time was approaching when i must keep my vow or confess myself foreswornan unworthy daughter of the marionis it was a bitter choice for there was a life in either balance the life of this traitress of fiveandtwenty years ago or of an old man sick to the heart with disappointment deceived by a woman in his youth and a woman again in his old age  i bathed my eyes and face and throwing off my wet things wrapped myself in a dressing robe then i poured out a cup of tea and drank it over the fire all the while that letter lay before me on the tray face upward and my eyes kept straying unwillingly toward it it had a sort of fascination for me and in the end it conquered i had meant to give myself a few hours more freedomto have put it away until bedtime but a sudden impulse came to me and i yielded i caught it up with firm fingers and tore it open                                       palezzo carlotti rome  margharitabeloved success success my search is over my purpose is accomplished i have found paschuli enclosed in this letter you will find a smaller envelope it contains the powder  can you wonder that my hand is shaking and that there is a mist before my eyes i am an old man and great joy is hard to bear harder still after a weary wretched life such as mine you will understand thoughyou will be able to decipher this faint uncertain handwriting and you will forgive me if it tires you ay you will do that margharita i know  let me tell you how i found him it was by the purest accident i turned aside into an old curio shop to buy some trifle for you which took my fancy and it was paschuli himself who served me thus you see how indirectly even your star always shines over mine and leads me aright if it had not been for you i should never have dreamed of entering the place but i thought of you and your taste for roman jewelry and behold i found myself in the presence of the man for whom i was making vain search my margharita my good angel i have you to thank even for the successful accomplishment of my part in that edict of our order which you and i are banded together to carry out  at first paschuli did not recognize me and it was long before i could make him believe that i was indeed that most unfortunate of men leonardo di marioni but when he was convinced he promised me what i sought that same evening he gave it to me  margharita there is no poison in the world like that which i send you in this letter the merest grain of it is sufficient in wine or water or food of any sort there is no art of medicine which could detect itno means by which the death which will surely follow can be averted so you run no risk my child bide your time and thenthen  margharita i am coming to you nay do not be alarmed i run no risk i shall come disguised and no one will know me but i must see something of the end with my own eyes or half its sweetness would be untasted i would see her face and die i would trace day by day the workings of the poison and in the last moments of her agony i would reveal myself and would point to my withered frame and the hand of death upon my forehead and cry out to her that the order of the white hyacinth had kept its vow i would have her eyes meet mine as the mists of death closed in upon her i would have her know that the oath of a marioni in friendship or in hate in protection or in vengeance is one with his honor this may not be margharita i cannot see all this i cannot even stand by her bedside for a moment and show her my face that she might know whose hand it is which has stricken her down yet i must be near fear not but that i shall manage it safely i would not bring danger or the shadow of danger upon you my beloved  i leave rome tonight and i leave it with joy you cannot imagine how inexpressibly sad it has been for me to find myself in the place where the greater part of my youthmy too ambitious youth was spent all is changed and strange to me there are new streets and many innovations which puzzle me and although my friends are kind twentyfive years have crushed our sympathies to them i am like a sad figure from a bygone world a banquo at the feast something to pity a littleno more i am nothing to anybody beyond that i am a wearisome old man whose mind is a blank and who only cumbers the way ah well it is not for long the day of my desire is at hand and god has given me you margharita to accomplish it and to close my eyes in peace bless you my dear dear child you have sweetened the end of a marred and wretched life yours has been an angels task and you will have an angels reward  we shall meet before long but of the manner of our meeting i cannot tell you yet till then adieuyours in hope  leonardo di marioni  p si forgot to say that the whole of the poison or even half a teaspoonful would produce sudden and abrupt death just a pinch administered twice perhaps in order to be quite secure would be sufficient                                       enclosed in the letter was the oblong envelope he spoke of which i carefully opened it contained only a small quantity of pale pink powder which emitted a faint pungent odor i locked it up in my desk and destroyed the letter  all my strength had returned i felt myself free from the madness of this overmastering love another passion for the moment had taken its place the vision of that old man wandering about the streets of rome with a sad weary heart and tottering limbs out of touch with the times a figure for a halfcontemptuous pity that is the picture which i saw steadily before me to nerve my heart and purpose and well it succeeded  the second bell roused me from my thoughts i hastily rose from my chair and attired myself in the plainest gown which i possessed i unlocked my desk and thrust the little packet into my pocket then without jewelry or flowers and with my hair plainly coiled upon my head i went downstairs  they had commenced dinner when i arrived and lord lumley glanced reproachfully at me as i took my seat from the sudden silence directly i entered i imagined they had been talking of me and i made my excuses with a momentary nervousness there was something unusual in the air it seemed to me that lady st maurice was regarding me with a new and kindly interest she said nothing as i had dreaded she would of my long absence from the house and lord st maurice with a courtesy unusual even for him rose when i entered and motioning the butler away himself held my chair what did it all mean at another time i might have wondered more but just then there were other thoughts in my mind should i have an opportunity to commit my crime that night i feared not  i gave no one any chance for sentimental conversation during dinner time for i talked more than usual and in a lighter vein i wanted nothing said which could bring back to my memory that wild scene on the cliffs or the hours of agony which i had been through all such things were of the past i desired to be able to look back upon them as upon some strange nightdreamfair enough of itself but gone with the first breath of morning to my relief the others too avoided the subject there was nothing said about lord lumleys escape which even bordered upon the pathetic  dinner which seemed to me to last longer than usual came to an end at last i had planned to make some excuse to the countess and leave the drawingroom before lord lumley could follow but as i had half expected that he might lord lumley accompanied us there without waiting to smoke to my surprise lady st maurice before i could frame an excuse to her for my own departure left us alone lord lumley held the door open for her and it seemed to me that a meaning glance passed between them it was beyond my understanding i could only see that my plans were frustrated and that i must prepare for another struggle  he shut the door carefully and then came back and stood over me i looked at him calmly how could he read the agony in my heart  i am waiting for my answer margharita he said simply  you have had the only answer which i can ever give you lord lumley i answeredno  then he did a thing which sounds very absurd but which did not indeed seem so he sank on one knee and took possession of my hand i was on a low chair and his face now was on a level with mine  margharita my love he whispered no is an answer which i shall never take yesterday i went away and left you today i am wiser nothing can undo those few minutes on the cliffs dearest you love me ah you cannot deny it have i not read it in your face and in your eyes take back your no margharita by the memory of those few minutes you are mine forever you have not the power or the right to deny yourself to me you are mine you belong to me  i shrank back i began to be frightened at his earnestnessat the note of triumph in his voice how strong and masterful he was should i be able to hold out against him only my will and the memory of a wasted life against my heart and such pleading as this it was a hard unequal battle  margharita i love you all the more that you are not lightly won he continued drawing me closer to himalmost into his arms listen i believe that i have some idea as to the reason of your answer you think perhaps that my people might not be willing you are proudtoo proud tell me is this not so  a governess is no fitting wife for you you should choose one from among the noble women of your country i  he interrupted me if i had not drawn back quickly he would have stopped my lips with a kiss  no one in this world could be as fit as you for it is you and you only whom i love but listen i have spoken to my mother i have told her  you have told her what i cried  that i love you that i have asked you to be my wife  what did she say  what a true woman and good mother should say that if you were indeed my choice then she was ready to welcome you as her daughter and my wife  you cannot mean it i cried she knows nothing of me and i am penniless  she knows that i love you and that would be sufficient dearest but as it happens she knew more about you than i did from her i learned for the first time that your mother came from a family which was great and noble before ours was ever founded she told me a sad story of your uncle margharita which you too doubtless know of and she seemed glad to think that our marriage would be in a certain sense an act of poetic justice she told me too margharita that if your uncle died unmarried you could if you chose take his name and call yourself the countess di marioni why sweetheart i am not sure that i ought to aspire to the hand of so great a lady  your mother the countess of st maurice told you all this she desires our marriage she knows what you are asking me i repeated breathlessly  most certainly shall i call her she will tell you so herself  do not speak to me for a moment please  i was an idiot but i could not help it i buried my head in the sofa cushion and sobbed everything seemed fighting against me to make my purpose more difficult  i think that tears have a softening effect i had steeled my heart against my lover and yet he conquered i felt his strong arms around me and his lips were pressed against my wet cheeks oh for strength to thrust him from meto deny my love but i could not  why should i try to recall his words nay if i could i would not set them down here i felt every fiber of my nature glowing with delight as i listened every chord seemed quivering with heartstirring music i had given up all idea of resistance a strange drowsy peace had stolen in upon me one of his arms was around my waist and my hand was imprisoned in his so we sat and the moments became golden  interruption came at last the door opened and lady st maurice entered my lover rose at once still holding my hand  mother he said margharita has made me very happy will you speak to her  she came to us and bent over me her face looking very soft and sweet in the shaded light in another moment she would have kissed me i sprang to my feet pale with horror  no no it cannot be i cried i am not fit to be his wifeto be anybodys wife lady st maurice will you not tell him so for me let me go away  she looked surprised at my agitation but she little guessed its cause how was she to know anything of that little packet which seemed to be burning a hole in my heart  no i will not tell him that she said smiling he loves you and i believe that you are worthy of his love that is quite sufficient i shall be glad to have you for a daughter margharita  lord lumley thanked her with a look and took her hand they stood together on the hearthrug and i was on the other side facing the window suddenly my heart gave a great leap and the color died out of my face pressed against the dark pane i could see a pale white face watching us it was the face of my uncle count di marioni  i stood swaying backward and forward for a moment sick and dizzy with the horror of it my eyes grew dim and a mist seemed to fill the room then i felt myself sink back into my lovers arms and memory became a blank i had fainted     chapter xxviii  one days respite   the sun has risen upon the last day which i shall spend on earth and i sit down calmly to write all that happened to me yesterday and my reason for the step which i am about to take  it is a fair still morning and the birds are singing gaily in the grove my window is open and the early freshness of the autumnal air is filling the room for hours i have been on my bed there hot and restless praying for the dawn that i might carry out my purpose and as soon as the first faint gleam of light in the east broke through the dark night clouds i arose and bathed my eyes and sat down here to wait i have watched the sun rise up from the ocean slowly gathering strength until its first quivering beams glanced across the dull gray sea and even penetrated into my chamber and with the dawn has come peace i sit here calm and prepared for the trial to come  it was the evening before yesterday when i saw my uncles face pressed against the window pane and fainted with the shock early on the following morning a note from him was brought up to me having been left by a messenger from the village here it is                                       my beloved margharitamany a time have i reproached myself for my imprudence last night and the effects which i fear it had upon you it was thoughtless and rash of me to come near the house at all but indeed i meant only to watch from a safe distance only as i crouched behind a shrub upon the lawn i saw her face and the sight drew me nearer against my better judgment i met your eyes and i knew that you were overcome with fright but i feared to linger lest they might ask what it was that alarmed you and seek for me and although i fancy that i am altered past recognition yet i would run no risks  i too had a great surprise margharita you will not wonder what i mean by that when i tell you that in the light which streamed from the uncurtained window everything in the room was distinctly visible to me was i dreaming child or were you indeed assenting to the embrace of the man whose arms were surely around you him i could not see for his back was turned to the window but will you laugh at me i wonder if i tell you that i felt strangely jealous of him i am a foolish old man margharita but all the love of my heart is yours and i had begun almost to look upon youin my thoughtsas my own child i cannot bear the thought of giving you up to any one you will not think me very very selfish i have only a few more months to live and i know that you will not grudge that much out of your future that you will stay by me to the end afterwards i have no wish save for your happiness and although i must confess that i had hoped you might have married one of the sons of our own country still it is you who must choose and i owe you or shall owe you soon too great a debt to press upon you any desire of mine which is not at one with your wishes but tell me thisis he an englishman alas i fear so send me a word by the bearer and tell me tell me too of what family he is and whether he is noble but of that i feel already assured if he be indeed the man to whom your love is given  you must surely have sustained a shock at my sudden and rash appearance doubtless you wonder at seeing me here at all i could not keep away i must have news day by day almost hour by hour it is all that keeps me alive i must be near to feel that i am breathing the same air as the woman on whom a longdelayed vengeance is about to fall  i have taken a furnished cottage on the outskirts of this village and a little more than a mile from mallory grange but do not come to me dearly as i would love to have you talk to me and hear from your own lips that all goes well yet at present it were better not i will devise some means of communication and let you know of it shortly i am living here as mr angusyours ever  l m                                       i folded up this letter with a shudder and sitting down dashed off my reply it is here                                       my dear unclei am a culprita miserable pleading culprit it is true that i love an englishmanthe man who was standing by my side last night and it is true that he has asked me to marry him but i have not told him so and i have not promised to marry him that is not all of my confession not only is he an englishman but his name is lord lumley st maurice and he isher son  now you know the terrible trouble i am in last night he was telling me of his love and assuring me of his mothers sanction and approval when your face appeared at the window can you wonder at my start and that i fainted can you wonder that i sit here after a sleepless night with eyes that are dim and a heart that has become a stone i dread to stir from the room my position is horrible i have tried my utmost to avoid him to treat him with disdain to send him away from me i have steeled my heart and clothed my face with frownsin vain the bald fact remains that i love him do you despise me uncle sometimes i feel that i deserve it but i have suffered i am suffering now i am punished do not add your anger to my load  immediately you get this sit down and write to me write to me just what is in your heart your words i shall set before me as my law do not delay and if you blame do not fail to pity meyours ever unchanged  margharita                                       i sent this letter off with a certain sense of relief and then finding by my watch that it was late finished dressing hastily and went down into the schoolroom instead of my pupil lord lumley was there lounging in my low basketchair yawning over a german grammar he sprang up as i entered and throwing the book into a corner of the room advanced toward me with outstretched hands  margharita you are better dear i have been waiting here more than an hour for you  then before i could prevent him he had kissed me let me be honest though here at any rate did i really try to prevent him i think not  where is gracie i asked looking round and what have you done to my ottos  gracie has gone out with the nurse he answered laughing and as for that wretched volume well ive got a good mind to send the rest after it youve a nasty brainworrying lot of lesson books here ive been looking through them  one cannot teach without them elementary books always look tiresome but they are indispensable  not for you any longer im glad to say he remarked  why not  he looked at me surprised  surely you dont expect to go on teaching that child he asked you are a visitor here now and i am responsible for your entertainment to commence with i have invited myself to breakfast with you the tray is here as you perceive and the kettle is boiling kindly make the tea  i did as i was bid with a meekness which astonished myself and he sat opposite to me the servant brought in the remainder of the things and closed the door gracie was not coming  well how do you like the first item in my programme he asked taking my hand for a moment between his a t√™te√†t√™te breakfast was not a bad idea was it  does lady st maurice know i asked suddenly conscious of the utter impropriety of what we were doing  he laughed reassuringly  of course she does sweetheart in fact she as good as suggested it she thinks you feel a little strange about it all and that a long quiet day alone with me would help you to realize matters accordingly i am having a luncheon basket packed and after breakfast we are going for a sail just you and i you see the sea is as calm as a duck pond this morning shall you like it do you think  like it oh how long was this mockery to go on how long before i could find strength to tell him the truththat this thing could never be i tried to tell him then but the words died away upon my lips i would give myself one more day after that there must be action of some sort or other my uncles reply would have come and i should know exactly what lay before me  i should like it yes i answered looking into my lovers handsome glowing face you are sure that your mother will not mindthat she approves  quite he answered confidently we talked it over together for some time tonight i am going to speak to my father he has an inkling of it already but he will expect me to tell him dearest there is nothing to be frightened about why should you tremble so you are not well  i shall be better out of doors i answered faintly i will get my hat and we will start  he rose up at once and opened the door for me  do there must be a little pink coloring in those cheeks before we get back he said fondly  let us meet at the boathouse in a quarter of an hour shall you be ready by then  yes i answered i will be there     chapter xxix  there is death before us   i did not give myself time to think i had made up my mind with a sort of desperate determination that this day should be my very own my own to spend in paradise without scruples or after thought in a few minutes my black dress was changed for a navy blue one and a straw hat and i was hurrying down to the beach our boat a dainty little skiff only large enough for two was ready when i got there and lord lumley was standing up unfurling the sail  i settled myself down comfortably in the cushioned seat and we were off almost at once gliding over the smooth surface of the water with a scarcely perceptible motion we were about a quarter of a mile from the shore when we met lord lumleys yacht rounding the point on her way back from yarmouth lord lumley stood up in the bows and hailed her  all well dyson he cried as she swept past  all well my lord was the prompt reply  is the breeze stiffening do you think its calm enough here but i see the white horses are showing their heads outside the bay  ay ay my lord its blowing hard round the headland youll have to keep her well away shall we take you up  lord lumley shook his head  you would not prefer the yacht he asked turning to me  i like this best i answered it is more exciting  well stick to the skiff dyson lord lumley called out  the man looked doubtful but while he hesitated we shot far ahead so that his voice only reached us faintly  theres a heavy sea running my lord and itll blow great guns before night  are you nervous margharita he asked tenderly  not in the least i answered carelessly wiping the spray from my face i like it and hope it will be rougher  cant say that i do he laughed what a plucky girl you are now that were in a quieter sea i think that i may venture to come and talk to you  so he came and sat by my side it is not my purpose to set down all that passed between us that day there are pages in our lives which we never willingly open which have for us a peculiar sacredness and a sweetness which never altogether fades away there came a sort of abandon upon me the forerunner of a fit of nervous desperation which wellnigh sent us both hand in hand into another worldclosed the gates of my memory upon the past and withdrew my shuddering thoughts from the future to steep them in the delight of the present my lover sat by my side and his words were filling my heart with music the strong sea breeze blew in our faces and the salt spray leaped like glittering silver into the sunlight over our heads the seagulls screamed and the coast line grew faint in the distance so we sailed on hand in hand heart whispering to heart in the golden silence till the sun lay low in the west and our tiny craft pitched and tossed in the trough of the ocean waves  then my lover suddenly became conscious of time and place and he sprang up bewildered  a miracle he cried the sun is low and it cannot yet be afternoon  flatterer i laughed showing him my watch it is past five oclock  he looked round as he gathered in the sail and a shade of anxiety crept into his face especially he looked with bewildered eyes at the faint blue line where land lay  what an idiot i have been he said knitting his brows port margharita the left string thats right now sit firm and when we go down lean to the other side you mustnt mind if you get a little wet we are running in the teeth of the wind and it will be roughish  it was deliciously exhilarating the breeze without our noticing it had been gradually freshening and now it was almost a gale the sky above was mackerelhued and windswept the sea seemed to be getting rougher every minute lord lumley had to pass his arm round the frail mast which creaked and bent with the straining of the sail once we heeled right over and were within an ace of being capsized i only laughed and the color came into my cheeks death would be a sweet and welcome thing i thoughtdeath here on the ocean with my lovers arms around me so i had no fear and lord lumley found time to glance at me admiringly  youre the pluckiest woman i ever knew in all my life he exclaimed lightly gad that was a shave its no use dear we must tack this is too good to last  round we swept first one way then another but we made no headway in an hours time we were no nearer land and in the gathering twilight the coast line was dim and blurred here and there we could see a few lights burning from the villages along the shore and away northward the revolving light from gorton headland shone out like a beacon  what will become of us i asked softly for lord lumley had ceased his exertions for a moment with a little gesture of despair his face was very pale but it might have been from fatigue  nothing very serious fortunately the sail is a new one and very strong i think it will hold and while it does i can keep her in position we shall be tacking about most of the night though i am afraid it is such a provoking shifty wind i cant depend upon it for a moment  and supposing the sail went  we have the oars it would be uncommonly hard work rowing but it would keep us afloat it was just a chance that i put them ina lucky one as it happens  supposing you had forgotten them and that we had no oars  lord lumley shook his head  dont add to the horrors he said smiling id rather not suppose anything of the kind its bad enough as it is  there would be danger then  yes  in what way  he shrugged his shoulders  do you really want to know  yes please  well we should drift out to sea and the first heavy wave that caught us broadside would probably swamp us the great thing is you see to keep our head to the waves are you cold love  i shook my head i had no thought of it  frightened  not a bit of it do i look it  that you dont he answered smiling you are brave dearest i shall never forgive myself for being so careless though  i think that it was then that the madness first came to me i held my hands up to my head and strove to fight against that frantic impulse the air seemed full of voices whispering to me to end by one swift stroke this hideous dilemma into which i had drifted of my own foolish will it was so simple so easy a manner of escape and she too would be punished in a manner my oath would have been accomplished what vengeance could be sweeter to the heart of that desolate old man than the death of her sonher only son it could be done so easily so secretly and as for me should i not die in his arms with his dear face pressed close to mine his kisses upon my cold lips and his voice the last to fall upon my ears what was life to me a pledged murderess would not such a death be a thousand times better the wind rushing across the waters seemed to bring mocking whispers to my ears i seemed to read it in the silent stars and in the voices of the night death painless and sudden death in my lovers arms my heart yearned for it  in the darkness i stretched down my hand and felt for the oars my lovers back was turned to me for he was on his knees in the bows gazing ahead with strained eyesight one oar i raised and balanced on the side of the boat a quick push and it was gone the dull splash in the water was lost in the rushing of the wind and the creaking of the ropes i watched it drift away from us with anxious eyes it was gone irrevocably gone  there was only the sail now i had not meant to touch that to leave so much to chance but the desire for death had grown i was no longer mistress of myself a small pocketknife was lying in the bottom of the boat and i stooped down cautiously and picked it up just as my fingers closed upon it lord lumley looked round my eyes fell before his and i trembled thankful for the darkness  frightened yet dearest he asked tenderly  i laughed there was no fear in my heart if only he had known  no i am not afraid i am happy  he looked at me wondering well he might  how your eyes are gleaming love after all i dont think that we need a lantern  a lantern what use would it have been to us  to warn anything off from running us down if the sail holds till morning and i think it will we shall be all right if we escape collisions  is that what you are fearing i asked  yes i fancy that we must be getting in the track of the coal steamers if only the moon would rise this darkness is our greatest danger even if they had a smart lookout man i am afraid that they would never see us  he turned round again and remained gazing with fixed eyes into the darkness then i held my breath and stooping forward with the penknife in my hand commenced steadily sawing at the bottom knot which bound the sail to the mast directly it parted i cut a great slit in the sail itself  the knife was sharp and my task was over in less than a minute i dropped it into the sea and leaned back breathless the wind was coming  lumley i faltered will you come to me i am afraid  he turned round with a quick loving word at that moment the catastrophe happened a sudden gust of wind filled out the sail there was a crash as it parted from the mast a confused mass of canvass and limp rope the whole of the strain for a moment was upon the topmost portion of the mast and the result was inevitable it snapped short and the whole tangled heap fell down half in the bottom of the boat half in the sea  we heeled right over and it seemed as if we must be capsized but my lover had presence of mind and a strong desire to live he leaned heavily on the other side of the boat and whipping a large sailors knife from his pocket cut away the whole of the wreckage from the stump of the mast with a few lightninglike strokes it fell away overboard at once and though we shipped a lot of water the boat righted itself again while it was yet trembling with the shock he leaned across to me pale but with no fear in his set face or his clear resolute tone  courage margharita the oars quick dear  then for the first time my heart smote me for what i had done for the passionate desire of life was alight in his eyes what right had i to make him share my fate my deep joy was suddenly numbed i was a murderess  i handed him the remaining one and pretended to feel about in the bottom of the boat in that moment i recovered myself  there is only one here i announced calmly  impossible he cried i saw the pair laid out myself  he dropped on his knee and felt anxiously around then he struck a match with the same result the oar was gone  he knew then that my words were true and he came over to my side with a great despair in his dark eyes  margharita he cried taking me into his arms there is death before us and it is i who have brought it upon you oh my love my love  his kisses fell upon my lips and my head fell upon his shoulder then i drew a sigh of deep content and i felt that i had done well  i do not mind i whispered softly let us stay like this i am happy  my darling     chapter xxx  the dawn of a new life   to desire death is to live and to desire life is to die it is the mockery of human existence the experience of all i had willed to die at that moment without further speech or opportunity for thought and death seemed to have turned his back upon me  we drifted on tossed high and low by the tall waves which rose around us like black shadows threatening destruction at every moment often when we had seen one towering above us we had thought that the end had come and i had felt my lovers arms tighten around me and my lips had clung close to his but again and again a reprieve was granted to us although every timber in our frail craft shivered we survived the shock and drifted into smoother water  a little before midnight the wind dropped although there was a heavy sea still running through a dimly woven mist we could see the stars faintly shining between the masses of black clouds rolling across the windswept sky but there was no moon nothing to show us whither we were drifting upon the waste of waters there was something inexpressibly weird in that darkness it seemed less a blank darkness than a darkness of moving shapes and figuresa living darkness somehow suggesting death it will live in my memory forever  do you mind dying lumley i asked him once  yes he answered solemnly i do i am just learning how sweet it would be to live  i held him tighter for at that moment a great wave had broken over us i dreaded nothing but separation  supposing that if we lived something came between us i whispered suppose there was something between us which nothing could alter nothing could movewhat then  i cannot suppose it he answered nothing could come between us that i would not overcomenothing in life  still if it were so i persisted  then i would sooner die like this if we are to die we are in gods hands  i shuddered at that last sentence if indeed we were on the threshold of eternity what had i to hope from god alas at that moment my earthly love was so strong that the fear of death was weak and faint  we sat there silent and full of strange emotions and expecting every moment the end to come all of a sudden we both of us gave a great cry and my lover leaped up so that our boat rocked violently and nearly capsized for my part i sat still gazing with distended eyes and parted lips upon the strangest sight which i had ever seen  a great blaze of brilliant light seemed suddenly to flash into the horizon and falling into one long level ray to travel slowly across the surface of the water toward us everything which lay in its path was revealed to us with minute and wonderful distinctness so vivid was the illumination that we could see the white foam on the top of the green waves and the floating seaweed rising and falling outside that one level blaze more brilliant even than the sunlight the darkness seemed blacker and more impenetrable than ever it was a sight so marvelous that i held my breath awed and wondering then my lover gave a great cry  margharita my love my love we are saved  what is it i whispered  the electric search light i had it fitted to the stormy petrel by the purest chance a few months ago here it comes put your hand before your eyes sweetheart oh god that they may see us  swiftly it passed across the great desert of waters and reached us we seemed suddenly bathed in a blinding glare of white light and notwithstanding our anxiety were forced to cover our eyes there was a moments suspense then the sound of a cannon came booming across the sea and a rocket sped up into the air  thank god thank god my lover cried they have seen us look up margharita they are more than a mile away now but they will be here in a quarter of an hour we are saved  he was right in less than that time a boat from the stormy petrel had picked us up and we were standing in for land firing rockets all the way to announce the news to lord and lady st maurice so ended this the most eventful day of my life  and with its close has ended that sworn purpose which has brought me

our love may ring once more through heart and soul farewell farewell     chapter xxxi  an old mans hate   margharita you have come at last it is done then say that it is done  she stood quite still in the humble redtiled sittingroom and looked at him with a great compassion shining out of her dark clear eyes he was worn almost to a shadow and his limbs were shaking with weakness as he half rose to greet her only his eyes were still alight and burning save for them he might have been a corpse  something of the old passionate pity swept through her as she stood there but its fierceness had died away her heart leaped no longer in quick response to the fire in those still undimmed eyes she had been a girl then a girl with all the fierce untrained nature of her mothers race she was a woman now a sadfaced sorrowful woman he was quick to see the change  margharita my child you have been ill  still she did not answer silently she knelt down by the side of his armchair and took his withered delicate hand in hers a great bowl of white hyacinths stood on a table by the window and the air was faint with their perfume  i am not ill she said gently i was frightened on my way here and had to run there was a fire last night at the lunatic asylum at fritton and some of the mad people have escaped i saw one of them in the distance and the keepers after him they wanted me to go back but i would come  he stooped down and kissed her forehead with cold dry lips  i knew that you would be here soon he said my letters reached you safely  yes  she shuddered at the gathering strength in his tone and the fierce light which had swept into his face  it is done child say that it is done  no  something in her sad tone and subdued manner seemed to strike a note of fear in his heart he leaned forward grasping the sides of his chair with nervous quivering fingers and looked hurriedly into her face  no you have had no chance then but you will have soon is it not so soon very soon  she threw her arms around his neck he made no response nor did he thrust her away he remained quite passive  it is not that uncle oh listen to me do not thrust me away i cannot do this thing  he sat as still as marble there was no change no emotion in his face yet her heart sank within her  oh listen to me she pleaded passionately you do not know her as she is now she is good and kinda gentlehearted woman it was so long ago and it was not out of malice to you but to save the man she loved you hear me do you not you are listening she has not forgotten you often she sorrows for you it was crueli know that it was cruelbut she was a woman and she loved him let us steal away together and bury these dark dreams of the past i will never leave you i will wait upon you always i will be your slave forgiveness is more sweet than vengeance oh tell me that it shall be so why do you not speak to me  he sat quite still like a man who is stunned by some sudden and unexpected blow he seemed dazed she wondered even whether he had heard her  uncle shall it not be so she whispered let us go away from here and leave her i am not thinking about him i will not see him again i will never dream of marrying him let us go this very day this very hour  then he turned slowly toward her thrust her hand from around his neck and stood up  you have been false to me margharita he said in a slow quiet tone after all it is only natural when you first came to me i thought i saw your mothers spirit blazing in your dark eyes and i trusted you i was to blame i forgot the tradesmans blood i do not curse you you do not understand that is all learn now that the oath of a marioni is as deathless and unchangeable as the hills of his native land will you go away at once please i do not wish to see you again  his speech so quiet so selfcontained bewildered her there was not a single trace of passion or bitterness in it she stretched out her hands toward him but she felt chilled  uncle you  will you go away please he interrupted coldly  she turned toward the door weeping she had not meant to go faronly out on to the gardenseat where she might sit and think but he saw another purpose in her departure and a sudden passion fired him she heard his step as he rose hastily and she felt his cold fingers upon her wrist  you would go to warn her he cried his voice trembling with anger i read it in your face you are as false as sin but you shall not rob me of the crown of my life no one shall rob me of it vengeance belongs to me and by this symbol of my oath i will have it  he snatched a handful of white blossoms from the bowl and crushed them in his fingers then he threw them upon the ground and trampled upon them  thus did she betray the sacred bonds of our order when for her lovers sake she added treachery to cunning and wrecked my life made leonardo count of the marionis the lonely inmate of prison walls the scorn and pity of all men thus did she write her own fate upon a far future page of the tablets of time talk to me not of forgiveness or mercy girl my hate lives in me as the breath of my body and with my body alone will it die  his withered figure seemed to have gathered strength and dignity and his appearance and tone as he gazed scornfully down at the girl at his feet was full of a strange dramatic force her heart sank as she listened to him this was no idle vulgar passion no morbid craving for evil which animated him it was a purpose which had become hallowed to him something which he had come to look upon as his sacred right she understood how her drawing back must seem to him as though a flash of light had laid bare his mind she saw how weak how pitifully weak any words of hers must sound so she was silent  he had commenced walking up and down the room and watching him fearfully she saw that his manner was gradually changing the unnatural calm into which he had momentarily relapsed was leaving him and he was becoming every moment more and more excited fire flashed in his eyes and he was muttering broken words and sentences to himself once he raised his clasped hands to the roof in a threatening gesture and in the act of doing so she saw the blue flash of a stiletto in his breast pocket it frightened her and she moved toward the door  it seemed almost as though he read her purpose in her terrorstricken face and it maddened him he caught her by the wrist and thrust her back  you shall not leave this room girl he cried wait and soon i will bring you news  she stood still panting overcome for a moment by the strength of his grip before she could recover herself he had caught up his hat and was gone outside she heard the sound of a key in the lock she was a prisoner  her first thought was the window alas it was too small even for her to get her head through she cried out no one answered there was no one to answer she was alone in the cottage and helpless and away over the cliffs toward mallory grange she could see a small dark figure walking steadily along with bent head and swift steps the cottage stood by itself a mile from the village and was approached only by a cliff path she turned away from the window in despair it seemed to her then that the time for her final sacrifice had indeed come  it was a warm drowsy morning and the air which floated in through the open lattice window was heavy with the perfume of flowers mingled with the faint ozone of the sea outside the placid silence was broken only by the murmurous buzzing of insects and the soft lapping of the tide upon the shingly sands within the room a palefaced girl knelt upon the floor with her long slim fingers stretched upward and the passionate despair of death in her cold white features the sunshine laughed upon her hair and glanced around her bathing her beautiful face in its fresh bright glory was it an answer to her prayer she wonderedher prayer for peace and forgiveness oh that it might be so god grant it  there was no fear in her face though only a moment before she had taken out and swallowed the contents of that little packet of poison which had burned in her bosom for those last few days but there had been just one passing shade of bitterness her life had been so short so joyless until there had come to her that brief taste of wonderful amazing happiness she was young to dieto die with the delirium of that passionate joy still burning in her veins  yet after all it is best she whispered softly at the end of that unspoken prayer and with those words of calm resignation a change crept softly in upon her face it seemed almost as though while yet on earth there had come to her a touch of that exquisite spiritual beauty which follows only upon the extinction of all earthly passion and the uplifting into a purer sweeter life and her eyes closed upon the sunlight and darkness stole in upon her senses she lay quite still upon the floor but the smile still lingered upon her lips making her face more lovely even in its cold repose than when the glow of youth and life had shone in her dark clear eyes and lent expression to her features saints like st francis of assisi may die thus but seldom women     chapter xxxii  the keeping of the oath   help for gods sake help  a womans cry of agony rang out upon the sweet morning stillness count marioni who had been hurrying on with downcast head stood still in the cliff path and lifted his head it was the woman whose memory he had cursed who stood before himthe woman on whom his vengeance was to fall  her face was as white as his own and in the swiftness of her flight her hat had fallen away and her hair was streaming in the breeze yet in that moment of her awful fear she recognized him and shrank back trembling as though some unseen hand had palsied her tongue and laid a cold weight upon her heart they stood face to face breathless and speechless a host of forgotten sensations kindled by her appearance had leaped up within the sicilians heart he had indeed loved this woman  merciful god to meet you here she faltered you will help me oh you will help me my husband is being murdered there on the cliff by an escaped lunatic oh leonardo save him and you may strike me dead at your feet it is i whom you should hate not him oh come come or it will be too late  he stood quite still looking at her curiously  and it is i to whom you dare to come for helpi whom you ask to save himyour husband adrienne do you remember my words on the sands at palermo  she wrung her hands frantically imploring  how can i remember anythingthink of anything now for the love of god help him she begged seizing his hand that was all so long ago you would not have him killed here before my eyes come oh do come  lead the way he answered sternly call your loudest for other help i make no promise but i will see this tragedy  she ran back along the path and he followed her they turned suddenly an abrupt corner and came upon two men locked in one anothers arms and swaying backward and forward upon the short green turf the lunatic an immense fellow more than six feet high was clutching his opponents throat with his left hand while with his right he brandished a long tableknife with keenlysharpened edge the struggle was virtually over the madmans strength was more than human and desperately though he had struggled lord st maurice was lying exhausted and overcome in his arms  with a final effort he turned his head at the sound of footsteps and saw them comehis wife and this shrunken little old man but close at hand though they were nothing could help him now he saw the steel flashing in the sunlight and he closed his eyes  the knife descended but lord st maurice remained unhurt with a swiftness which seemed almost incredible the sicilian had sprung between them and the knife was quivering in his side behind the lunatic was struggling helplessly in the grasp of three keepers  there was a wild cry of horror from lady st maurice a choking gasp of relief from her husband and a horrid chuckle of triumph from the madman as he gazed upon his handiwork but after that there was silencea deep awestricken silencethe silence of those who stand in the presence of death  count marioni lay on the turf where he had sunk very white and very still with the blood dropping slowly from his wound upon the grass and his eyes closed at first they thought that he was already dead but as though aroused by lady st maurices broken sobs he opened his eyes and looked up his lips moved and she stooped low down to catch the sound  will you tell margharita that this was best he faltered i have heard a whisper from over the sea andand the white hyacinth forgives i forgive she will understand  leonardo she sobbed your vengeance  he interrupted her  this is my vengeance he said i have kept my oath  then he closed his eyes and a gray shade stole into his pallid face a breeze sprung up from the sea and the tall bloodred poppies which stood up all around him like a regiment of soldiers bent their quivering heads till one or two of them actually touched his cheek he did not move he was dead                                       lord and lady lumley had lingered long in rome and now on the eve of their departure they had spent nearly the whole of a bright november afternoon buying curios of a wizened old dealer whose shop they had found in one of the dark narrow streets at the back of the piazza angelo lady lumley had taken up a curious old ring and was examining it with a vague sense of familiarity  ten pounds for that ring my lady the curio dealer remarked and it has a history you will see that it bears the arms and motto of the marionis once the most powerful family in sicily i had it from the late count himself  lady lumley sank into the little chair by the counter holding the ring tightly in her hand  will you tell us the history she asked in a low tone  the man hesitated  if i do so he said doubtfully will you promise to keep it absolutely secret  yes  well then i have told it to no one yet but i will tell it to you many years ago i was a chemist and among my customers was count leonardo di marioni his history was a very sad one as doubtless you may have heard when he was quite a young man he was arrested on some political charge and imprisoned for fiveandtwenty yearsa cruel time well scarcely more than twelve months ago he came to me here so altered that i found it hard indeed to recognize him poor old gentleman when he had talked for a while i felt quite sure that his long confinement had affected his mind and his errand with me made me sure of it he came to buy a celebrated poison which i used at one time to be secretly noted for and i could tell from his manner that he wanted it for some fatal use well i thought at first of refusing it altogether but what was the use of that some one else would have sold him an equally powerful poison and the mischief would be done all the same so after a little consideration i made up quite an innocent powder which might cause a little momentary faintness but which could do no further harm and i gave it to him as the real thing i couldnt take money for doing a thing like that so he pressed this ring upon me you see it really has a history  lord lumley took his wifes hand and pressed it tenderly in the deep gloom of the shop the curio dealer could not see the tears which glistened in her dark eyes  we will have the ring lord lumley said taking a note from his pocketbook and handing it across the counter  the man held it up to the light  one hundred pounds he remarked i shall owe your lordship ninety  lord lumley shook his head  no signor paschuli you owe me nothing it is i who owe you a wife come margharita let us get out into the sunshine again  and signor paschuli kept the note but he has come to the conclusion that all englishmen traveling on their honeymoon are mad     the great awakening   sir powers fiske though far from being a sybarite possessed a fundamental but crudely developed love of the beautiful before all things with him came his devotion to science and scientific investigation but for his unexpected accession to the title and estates he would without doubt have become a denizen of harley street and made his way without difficulty into the front ranks of his profession with the passing away of all necessity for work came a curious era of halfdoubtful dilettanteism a time during which he read hugely traveled a good deal and finally returned to england with the seeds of a great unrest sown in his mind  mysticism and psychology which he had dabbled in at first halfcontemptuously had become serious studies to him dimly he felt the fascination of that unending effort which from the days of the chaldeans had swayed the lives of a long succession of the worlds masters the effort to establish some sort of communication however faint however speculative between the world of known things and the world beyond at times he found himself moved to the most profound selfridicule he would ask himself how it was possible for a man of science seriously to investigate problems whose very foundation must be an assumption he looked at his walls lined with books and he smiled grimly as he realized how little after all they had taught him the sum of all that he had learned from them amounted to nothing yet he remembered what spencer trowse a fellow student had said to him a sudden flush had lightened his thin cheeks pallid with the ceaseless energy of their student life  after all powers i think that we are wasting our days he exclaimed those ancients saw no farther behind the veil than we i am tired of all this musty lore this delving among cobwebs  what then powers had asked modern scholarship has taught us little enough  let us have done with all scholarship trowse answered it is the laws of humanity we want to understand let us study them at first hand let us go down among the people  what can this rabble teach us powers had asked himself full of the intellectual contempt of the young student for the whole pleasureloving world whether their wings be soiled or pure they are only butterflies  trowse smiled grimly  they are the living evidences he said of laws which are worth studying if we would understand humanity we must not start by despising any part of it  with characteristic impetuosity the two young men had thrown themselves heart and soul into their new enterprise they haunted police courts and places of entertainment they lived for a while in a great industrial center they listened to the hoarse tragic undernote of the millions underneath they made their bow at the reception of a duchess and spent a whole bank holiday dancing upon hampstead heath these and many other phases of life they had encountered with an amusement in powers case partly genuine in trowses wholly tolerant for all the time they kept strenuously in view their real end they wanted to understand the causes of all that they saw they wanted to discover laws  the end of their enterprise came suddenly a disaster in his family left trowse unexpectedly poor it was necessary for him to take at once some wageearning position the two young men parted curiously enough without regret powers though no sentimentalist possessed his due share of the affections had an innate love for the beautiful and a longing for a catholic and universal understanding of his fellows where trowse would gaze with unmoved face and pursue his calm calculations powers could only peer with barely veiled horror they held together through those three years of unorthodox study but toward the end of it they had drawn wide apart trowse entered the ranks of his profession a man of steel without nerves or sentiment or pity powers with his fuller understanding of life had no longer any desire for a regular career possessed of ample means the necessity for it had never existed he left england almost at once and entered upon a somewhat restless but comprehensive scheme of travel  at last shortly after his return home one afternoon fate cast into his way on the edgware road the very subject that he sought it was in the fringe of a city fog the sky was heavy with clouds the pavements were sloppy with recent rains the broad thoroughfare was almost deserted when there glided by him the figure of a woman who held herself with a distinction oddly at variance with her shabby clothes there was in her eyes the look of one in extremityof a woman who had none of the ordinary fear of death and who would dare great things to pass from the evil place in which fate had set her to even a momentary draft from the cup of life  sir powers fiske approached her his eyes held hersthey were bright with a certain steely radiance she felt her heart beating fast the noise of the traffic beyond seemed to her to come from some distance he spoke to her and her eyes which mirrored dark months lost resentment after a moment and seemed to understand  they gazed steadfastly at one anothersomething greater than their surroundings greater even than themselves seemed to pass between them with swift intelligence she felt him to be no more a boulevardier than she was light he murmured a few conventionalities and when he asked her to have tea with him she accepted inside the warm little tearoom he told her of his work and of himself and once secure in the knowledge of the mere unit of humanity she represented to him she told him of herself the human note was strong in all she said and he declared in all her talk the marks of a cultured intellect that must have rendered beyond endurance the shoddy environment of a drapers establishment where she passed her days he offered her the means of escape from her present slavery by becoming his subject for experiment and she did not shrink on her own testimony she stood alone in the world and upon her sudden removal from her present life there would be no one with even the right to search for her he looked into her frail beautiful face marveling at the depth of misery which produced this brave despair and rising held out his hand  i must thank you very much for your societyand for your confidence he said i have your address and i will write to you  tonight he was in a curiously disturbed mood all the evening eleanor surtoes had figured in his thoughts he had seen her several times since that first meeting on the edgware road she was one of the more tragic figures in that world which he had spent so much strenuous effort seeking to understand the possibilities in connection with her loomed large in his imagination he was oppressed with fears which were altogether new to him fortune could never have provided him with a human creature modeled more exactly according to his requirements he knew her life and the ways of it the confidence which he felt as to her ultimate decision was not exaggerated she would come to him for an explanation of his words and she would accept his proposition yet never since his idea had first begun to loom large in his thoughts did he look upon it with less enthusiasm than at this moment a few hours ago he had written to herasked her to spend a day upon the river with him he knew that she would come the crisis was close at hand he hoped to be able to delay it  the door was quietly opened his servant stood upon the threshold  there is a young lady asking for you sir powersthe name i believe is surtoes  show her in at once  the man bowed a moment later he ushered eleanor in her hat was beaten about with wind and rain even her hair was disordered she was breathless with rapid walking her cheeks were wet and the raindrops hung about her clothes powers held out his hand and drew her toward the fire  so you have come to see me he said in a tone as nearly matteroffact as he could make it i am delighted i was just looking forward to a lonely and a particularly dull evening  he wheeled an easy chair to the fire and placed her in it he saw that she was nervous and embarrassed and he continued to talk  tonight he said is one of the most horrible instances of our marvelous climate i had just written to ask you to have a day upon the river with me imagine it  she smiled and the color began to reappear in her cheeks  i want you please to tell me the exact truth she said my coming here i know is very foolish i want to know whether it inconveniences you in any waywhether your mother or any one else might think it strange  he laughed reassuringly  mine is entirely a bachelor establishment he declared my mother and sister live in berkeley square there is no one here to whom your visit would be even a subject of remark  she gave a little sigh of relief and leaned back in her chair the warmth and comfort of the room after that dreary walk through the rain and hail outside were like a strong sweet sedative a curious sense of rest of finality took possession of her with the closing of the front door with the first breath of that air of indefinable luxury which everywhere pervaded her new surroundings she seemed to pass into a new order of things there had been a single moment of breathless excitement of trembling speculation as to the nature of his greeting but his welcome had been so easy and natural that her fears had been all dispelled by his first few words  it is perhaps very foolish of me to come here she said but i have never quite forgotten what you said to me in the tearoom it was probably nonsense if so please tell me and let me go  his brows went up in vague surprise then ignoring her words he lighted a cigarette and stood thoughtfully puffing it his elbow resting on the broad oaken mantelpiece  i must tell you something more about myself he said presently it chanced that when i was at calcutta several years ago i met a native indian doctor to whom i was fortunate enough to be of some service my meeting with this man was the most wonderful thing which has ever happened to me i shall never cease to be grateful to him if the world knew his name and what he has made possible to science he would be the most famous man of this or any generation he reawakened all my old interest in my profession  his pale face had become fervid the bright light of the enthusiast was burning in his dark eyes eleanor felt that she had become once more only a unit in his eyes a mere atom of humanity whose interest to him was purely scientific and impersonal she found herself trembling what had these things to do with her she was afraid of what might come she remembered that he had spoken of death  oh that wonderful east he continued in a low tone how puny it makes us feel with our new civilization our shoddiness our materialism which is only another name for hopeless ignorance what treasures of art lie buried there what strange secrets sleep forever in the tombs of their wise men halkar told me that he was but the disciple of one immeasurably greater who had died indeed with many of the primal secrets of existence locked in his bosom because there was no one left behind with whom he dared to trust them  tell me about these secrets eleanor said were they of the past or of the future and what have you or i to do with them  we are children of the ages he answered and it is our heritage to learn halkar taught me much he set me down at the gate of that wonderful inner world he placed in my hands the key with your aid it is possible that i may pass inside  with my aid eleanor exclaimed breathlessly how can that be what could i do  he smiled at her and eleanor felt again that vague fear stirring in her heart  one day halkar took me to a native village we went to the house of a rich man we found him at home just returned from hunting he was handsome hospitable and it seemed to me intelligent but just before we left halkar asked him a question about the great storm which laid waste the village and the whole countryside only a year before he looked puzzled answered us courteously but vaguely he remembered nothing  he paused  there was an english nursegirl he continued halkar took me to see her she was plump rosy and goodnatured she was engaged to be married to a gentlemans servant and she chattered away gaily and told me all about it a year before a mad fakir had run amuck had killed a soldier to whom she was to have been married the next day and both the children who had been in her charge the shock had nearly sent her mad yet when halkar spoke to her of these things she looked puzzled she remembered nothing  well eleanor asked  their memory he said slowly was gone their reason was saved halkar was the physician  she shivered and sat looking into the fire with eyes full of fear  halkar he said had learned much but there was more still it has taken me many years but at last i believe that i have learned the secret which baffled him all his days all that i need is a subject  there was a short tense silence eleanor sat quite still nervously clasping and unclasping her hands her eyes steadfastly fixed upon the fire he watched her covertly  you know so little of me she murmured i am almost a stranger to you how can you tell whether i should be suitableeven if i were willing  you will remember the two cases which i have mentioned to you he answered the man was chosen by halkar because in the great storm he had lost wife and friends and children and in his grief he prayed for forgetfulness the girl was chosen because the tragedy which she had witnessed had driven her far along the road to madness and this merciful loss of memory was her salvation also the reason you have been chosen is because i looked into your eyes and it seemed to me that i saw there more than the ordinary weariness of life then i heard you speak and in your tone too was more than the ordinary bitterness of misfortune listen i will tell you more i will tell you what as yet i have not breathed to a living soul  she caught his enthusiasma fierce compelling thing  you are a christian he asked  i have tried to be she faltered  you believe at least in the eternity of human life you must believe in it in nature there is no death no annihilation all that takes place is transmutation that is obvious he declared  well  so in human life the body rots the spirit passeswhere  he continued with scarcely a moments pause  down the broad avenues of time to appear in a thousand different forms and shapes a king in one age is a serf in another a savage this century is a scholar in the next has there never been a moment in your life when a sense of unreality has seized you you doubt for a moment your own identity you are haunted by miragelike thoughts beautiful or sad you are strangely out of touch with your surroundings watch a great concourse of people it is the most fascinating thing in the world  you will see a beggar who has now and then some trick of carriage or gesture or speech which has survived his bodys degradation and which reminds you of a king or you will see one of the great ones of the earth if you watch closely enough do some small thing or speak some chance word which has crept out unheeded very likely repeated yet which could have no kinship with his present state  there are people who have visited a strange country for the first time in their lives and found there a streetcorner a shop or byway which has awakened a peculiar and inexplicable sense of familiarity they have never been there before never read of the place yet the sense of familiarity is there i have seen a boy fall asleep and heard him croon an old mexican warsong a song of the time of cortez and the incas in an almost forgotten languagea boy who awake is a messenger at a drapers unimaginative ignorant stupid the secret of these things will one day be yielded up to science you and i together may become immortal  he ended with a little laugh the fierce eagerness had burned itself out of the two eleanor was now the more disturbed  i should like to know how it feels she said thoughtfully to be without a memory to start life at twentytwo  the things outside your own personal experiences are never lost to you he said they come back in a perfectly effortless manner you will find yourself accepting them as a matter of course  how do you know that she asked one might have to learn to read and write again life without any background at all would become a gigantic embarrassment  there is no fear of anything of the sort he assured her halkars friend and the girl related to me their own experiences they were precisely similar it was of events and persons alone that their mind was swept bare their stock of acquired knowledge remained unimpaired sometimes they even dimly remembered people  but there are also many other considerations she said what will become of me afterward  my dear young lady he said i do not ask you to risk your life however remotely for nothing i would give half my fortune were it necessary to win your consent as it is i promise you freedom and independence you shall live the life which seems good to you you will be removed into another sphere altogether and it is possible that you may take with you a somewhat cloudy recollection of this portion of your life your reward will be an established position in the world and an honorable one beyond this i cannot say a single word in fact you must consider the whole thing as only a possibility  i consent she said simply  there was a momentary flash in his gray eyesotherwise he showed no emotion he had long since taken her consent as a matter of course  there is one thing more which is necessary he said you must tell me who you are and if you have any friends who would be likely to make inquiries for you i take it for granted that you have no closer ties it is imperative that i have this knowledge  she looked up at him with white face do you mean that  you can surely see the necessity for it yourself he answered you are virtually going to change your identity the eleanor surtoes of a month hence will know nothing of your past some one must be entrusted with that knowledge  it is a great pain to me she said wearily to speak of it at all but tonight nothing seems to matter my name is eleanor surtoes marston my father was sir robert marston he was a banker at hullellifield marston and ellifield you read the papers i dare say you remember  he inclined his head slowly  my mother was dead i had neither brother nor sister nor any friends save those whom my fathers prodigality had brought together when exposure came my father killed himself he left a letter telling me where to find a large sum of money which he had put on one side he had meant to leave england secretly i returned the money to the bank they heard afterward that i was destitute and they sent me ten pounds i came to london and did my best to get a situation but i was ignorant ill brought up and uselessly educated i could do a great many things in a small way but nothing well enough to teach with only a few shillings left i wrote to a large firm of drapers in hull with whom i had dealt they sent me an introduction to bearmains and i entered their employ as a shop girl ten months ago i have done my best but i left tonight knowing that whatever happened i should never return  there is no one then he asked who is likely to make inquiries about you no one who could trace you here  there is no one she answered bitterly  powers looked at his watch  i am going to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour he said i do not think that it will make any difference but i should like you to have that time for unbiased reflection  as you like she answered i shall not change my mind i am ready  she sat before the fire her eyes fixed upon the burning coals she heard muffled voices in the hall she heard powers enter an adjoining room and close the door behind him her fingers clutched the sides of her chair her eyeballs were hot for the first time a spasm of physical fear seized her he had gone to make ready what if it should be death she had spoken boldly of it but a moment before yet she was young for good or evil her life was as yet unlived then with a rush came back the memory of the last ten months the hopeless weariness of those days behind the counter the miserable humiliation of it the web of bitter despair drawn so closely and inevitably around her all the petty tyrannies to which she had been subject all the fettering restrictions which had gone to turn servitude into slavery were suddenly fresh in her mind a hideous vista of dreary days and lonely nightsnowhere a ray of hope the same yesterday today and all other days the fear passed away from her death might have its terrors but a return to bearmains would be a living hell she heard the door open without a single tremor she even smiled as she saw powers standing upon the threshold  you have not changed your mind he asked  there was never any fear of that she answered i am quite ready  he held open the door will you come this way he said  she rose at once without reluctance or feareven gladly he was beckoning her into a new life                                       sir powers fiske permitted himself the luxury of a rare emotion his patient had come back to life the faint flush of recovery was upon her cheeks the light of a dawning intelligence was in her eyes the first stage of his great experiment had been successfully reached  so you are better i see he remarked standing by her bedside  she answered him a little weakly but distinctly enough  i suppose i am i feel quite well enough to get up only  well  there was trouble in her eyes as she looked up at him  it seems as though i must be dreaming i cant remember what has happened to mewhy i am here  he smiled at her reassuringly  i wouldnt bother about it he said you are with friends and you must try to get well quickly i dare say when you are stronger that it will all come back to you  she looked at him reflectively  you are a stranger to me she said slowly is there no one here whom i have ever seen before  he felt a sudden chill yet after all it was what he had expected  i do not suppose that there is he answered you see you are in london now i thought perhaps that you might have remembered me i was in india and came to see you when you were a little girl  in india she repeated vaguely why what can have happened to me i do not remember anything about india  she raised her hand to her temples her eyes were full of an undefined fear the words came from her lips in a broken stream  you are my doctor they say and this is your house tell me what it meanstell me i try to think and there is nothing something has happened to my head have i been ill for long who am i where did i come from why am i here  i will answer all your questions he said quietly but you must please not excite yourself your name is eleanor hardinge and you were shipwrecked on your way from india here your father is an old friend of mine and you were coming to england to visit my mother you met with a very unusual accident you will notice that your head is still bound up and no doubt it will affect your memory for some little time you must try to make the best of it you are among friends and we shall all do our best to look after you  she felt the bandage around her head  i cant even remember the accident she said i suppose it will all come back some day  there is no doubt about it he answered all that you have to do now is to keep as quiet as you can the less you try to think the better  the nurse entered with a tray eleanor sat up and smiled with the satisfaction of a child  you are hungry he remarked  i think so she answered i should like some chicken please no more beef tea  you remember what chicken tastes like then he said that is a proof you see that your memory still lives let me ask you another question who is your favorite author  shakespeare she answered promptly  he nodded approvingly  you see that you need have no fear he said your loss of memory is only partial now i am going to leave you to have your dinner do not talk too much and try to sleep as much as you can  her eyes sought his fixedly pathetically she seemed suddenly moved by a new fear her large eyes a little sunken now were dilated  ii have forgotten my name again she cried it is horrible what is it tell me quickly  you are eleanor hardinge he said you are perfectly safe and you will soon be quite well  but i am afraid she cried with a sudden shrill note of terror my head is going round i cannot think clearly  he took her hand in his there was something soothing in the touch of his firm cool fingers  you have no cause for fear he said reassuringlynone whatever you are getting better and stronger every hour  she raised herself a little from among the pillows her eyes sought his eagerly her hands refused to let his go  i am afraid she moaned there are shadows everywhere among my thoughts tell me have i been mad am i going to be mad  his fingers strayed to her pulse he smiled upon her as one smiles upon a child  nonsense look at me  his eyes held her  you are not going to be mad you are merely suffering from a great shock by and by everything will be clear to you you must not be impatient i promise you that you will soon be well  outside the door on the landing he stood and wiped the dampness from his forehead he knew that she had been on the verge of brain fever that even now she was scarcely safe the impulse which had taken him into her room was an irresistible one he felt that he must see her he had looked into her opened eyes he had heard her speak the change which he alone could understand which he alone was responsible for appalled him he was bewildered by a feeling of personal loss the soul of eleanor surtoes seemed to have passed away with her sense of personal consciousness it was another woman who lay there in his guestchamber  afterward she slept he dined mechanically and without the ghost of an appetite the rest of the night he spent with a pile of medical books and a notebook kept during his stay in india open before him in the early morning he looked out upon the gray dawnlit streets haggard and with a gnawing fear at his heart he was unnerved the ordinary sounds of the waking household the street cries outside the rattling of carts jarred upon him he glanced in the lookingglass and was startled at his own reflection softly he opened the door and made his way into the room where eleanor lay  her deepbrown hair lay about the pillow in some confusion one long white arm thin but graceful hung over the coverlet her face notwithstanding its pallor was like the face of a little child a certain almost pathetic sharpness of outline which in the days of his first acquaintance with her had been only too noticeable seemed to him to have faded away her closed eyes were no longer windows through which shone the tragical misery of her bitter life the lines about her mouth and forehead had all been smoothed away and with these thingssomething else he found himself struggling with a sense of unfamiliarity after all it was still eleanor if only he could persuade himself of it  he looked at her long and steadily then he left the room and entered the library for a time he sat at his desk irresolute more than once he drew notepaper toward him and dipped his pen in the ink he was wholly unaccustomed to this indecision yet the way before him which had seemed so clear only a short while back seemed now beset with anxieties it was not technical skill or knowledge that he needed so far as these were concerned his selfconfidence was unimpaired only a new sense of responsibility a strange new web of fears seemed suddenly to have paralyzed his enthusiasm  for the first time in his life he felt the need for advicethe stimulus of sympathy yet for hours that note remained unwritten he was unable to account for his hesitation the man whom he was about to summon would approve of all that he had done he was sure of that yet he was oppressed by the shadow of some nameless fear some instinct that seemed to be doing its utmost to warn him against this course which from any ordinary point of view was both natural and advisable afterward those hours of hesitation ranked as history with him at the time he was ashamed of them  the note was written at last and despatched by an urgent messenger he bathed changed his clothes and ate some breakfast just as he had finished a small brougham stopped at the door doctor trowse was announced it was the man for whom he had sent even at the moment of his entrance powers found himself struggling with an insane desire to abandon his purpose to invent some trifling excuse and to keep silence  the two men shook hands silently  trowse looked ten years younger than his age which was fortyfive and he was now the greatest known authority upon diseases of the brain he eyed powers curiously  what is wrong with you he asked  nothing replied the other  you sent for me trowse reminded him and if you waste my time youll have to pay for it these are my busiest hours  powers came back to the present it was too late to hesitate he smiled grimly  you wont want payment he said when you have heard why i sent for you  a light like the flashing of fire upon polished steel lit up for a moment those strangecolored eyes yet in other respects the man was unmoved not a muscle of his face twitched  you have found a subject he said  i have  you are going to attempt the operation or you want me to  it is done  trowse set down his hat and deliberately selected a chair  youve pluck he remarked dead or alive  alive  the absence of any sentiment of triumph in powers face or tone made its impression upon the older man he decided at once that the thing had gone wrong  alive in what condition is he  its a she powers answered  better subject perhaps go on  she has recovered consciousness so far everything has gone according to calculation  you administered your indian drug  yes i was going to tell you she is conscious and physically unhurt  the memory  gone  trowse rose briskly  let me see her he insisted then we will talk  silently they made their way to the bedroom she had made a somewhat fastidious toilet and wore with the air of one who has been used to such things all her life a dressingjacket trimmed with lace which was among the things which marian fiske had sent her hair was tied up with ribbon and skilfully arranged to hide the bandages on her head the delicacy of her face and hands seemed heightened by the faint spot of color which flushed her cheeks as the two men entered the room  i have brought a friend of mine powers said after a few words to eleanor and the nurse to congratulate me upon my case this is doctor trowse nurse i know that he considers me a dangerous amateur and i want to convince him that i am nothing of the sort  trowse moved a little forward and eleanor turned her head to meet his earnest gaze almost immediately there was a change in her expression the color faded from her cheeks she shrank a little away a curious troubled light filled her eyes trowse if he noticed her agitation ignored it he bent over the bedside and touched her fingers asked a few apparently careless questions and let his hand rest for a moment upon her head then he turned away and addressed the nurse  sir powers has justified himself he said with a faint smile your patient is going to have the good sense to get well very quickly  eleanor drew a little breath as though immensely relieved she turned her head a little so as to leave him altogether out of her range of vision powers who to some extent misunderstood her action exchanged quick glances with trowse the desire for life was there once more then  i am glad to hear it sir the nurse answered quietly she seems to be going on very nicely  without turning her head toward him eleanor addressed trowse  will you please tell me something  if i can  when shall i remember things  he looked at her thoughtfully she kept her eyes averted but she seemed to be shivering a little  perhaps tomorrow he answered perhaps not for a year it is one of those things which science is powerless to determine  but i shallremembersome day  some daycertainly let me ask you a question  well  are you very anxious to remember  it is so puzzling she answered sometimes i want to very much sometimes i am content  there was a moments silence as though against her will she turned her head and looked up at him standing over her bedside again there was the faint shrinking away again her troubled eyes seemed held by his against her will  i will give you some advice young lady he said let things go you have made a marvelous recovery the completion of it is in your own hands accept the present if the past eludes youlet it you will remember this  eleanor remained speechless though her lips seemed to move every word though easily spoken seemed to come to her charged with a precise and serious meaning his tone was unemotional his manner was not even earnest yet she never forgot the two men left the room by common consent they turned into the study trowse eyed his friend curiously  i wonder he said what the devil made you send for me  sir powers fiske did not immediately reply the two men stood side by side upon the hearthrug trowse who seemed to have forgotten his hurry lit a cigarette and threw the match into the fire  i scarcely see he said where i come in you have your chance you have taken it and you have succeeded very well what do you want with me if it had been before the risk was over i could have understood it at present i must admit that i cannot  powers answered as one who makes a confession  i have lost my nerve he said  trowse looked at him oddly  i might believe that of some men he said not of you besides the risk is over the girl will live you know that as well as i do  she will live powers answered yes that is certain and yet since she opened her eyes since i heard her speak i have felt myself nothing less than a murderer that is what i am a murderer trowse  trowse stared at his friend for several moments without speakinga cold deliberate inspection then he sighed  you are not the man you were powers he said speaking softly and as though to himself it isnt drink and you dont smoke much what has happened to your nerves  powers looked steadfastly and gloomily out of the window  i cannot tell you he answered you know me better than most men trowse you have never seen me turn a hair at any operation yet together we have watched death come to strong men and to beautiful women these things have never troubled me i have never felt anything more than curiosity yet there is a weak spot somewhere i have learned what fear is  trowse eyed his friend with interest  if the girl were dead he remarked meditatively it might have turned out awkwardly for you as it is you seem to have stumbled across a very nearly perfect physical creature she is less likely to die than you or i in a fortnight she will be recovered  powers frowned impatiently  you have not made a study of this thing as i have trowse he said yours is the purely scientific point of view you do not seewhat lies beyond  trowse shook his head  i do not understand you he said simply  i want you to understand powers declared we have talked of this thing many times until it has grown to seem a simple thing we forgot  forgot what  forgot that the continuity of life after all is purely physical behindthere is a woman slainup there a woman created  trowse for a moment was bewildered a searching glance into the others face showed him that powers was in earnest he became contemplative  i am not sure that i understand you powers he said slowly in fact i am sure that i do not we have watched operations together when to our certain knowledge the knife has gone a little deeper has gone a little more to the left or right in order that some addition might be made to the sum of human knowledge you have never blenched we have seen men die whose lives might have been prolonged if not altogether spared that the race to come might benefit tacitly you and i have always recognized the principle that the individual must be the servant of humanity therefore as i say i do not understand your present attitude  i am not sure trowse that i can make you understand powers answered only remember this our point of view is probably not the same you are a materialist pure and simple i am not  proceed  in the cases which you have mentioned it is the body only which has suffered in this case the body has survived but something elsehas been destroyed you know the danger which still exists  trowse nodded  lunacy that of course is a possibility  powers shivered slightly  it is a possibility he admitted even if she remains sane will you tell me this what connection can there be between the mind of the girl of a month ago and the woman of a month to come  it is an interesting psychological problem trowse answered which we shall know more about shortly i must admit though that your position is inexplicable to me fortune has given you a marvelous opportunity i cannot conceive how you could have acted differently i cannot understand your present hesitation if you wish for any sort of cooperation on my part tell me how you first met this young woman and under what circumstances you persuaded her to become your patient  in a few words powers told him  there was a short silence trowse was regarding his friend with cold surprise  all that you tell me he said makes your present hesitation the more extraordinary your scruples are unworthy of you they would be unworthy of you even if you belonged to that sickly order of sentimentalists who would shrink from killing a poisonous snake because the reptile had been given life according to your own showing the girl was in an intolerable position she enters upon her new life with every prospect of happiness believe me powers the hand which struck away the bridge between her past and future was the hand of a benefactor  i suppose you must be right powers murmured  right it is hopelessly obvious trowse answered if this hesitation is anything more than a passing mood with you i shall be amazed you probably saved the girl from moral shipwreckyou have transported her into a life which she could certainly never have reached by any other means  in his tone and in his face were signs of a rare and intense enthusiasm the eyes of the two men met trowse continued with a gesture stiff but almost dramatic  man it is wonderful i could kill you as you stand there for envy it is among the possibilities that you a dilettante a dabbler may solve the secret of all the ages past and to come it may be that she will sing to you the songs that pocahontas sang to the great god of the indians or you may wake in the night to hear the wail of one of those daughters of judah led captive into egypt perhaps she was a priestess in the timeforgotten cities of africa gone before our history crept into being swept who knows where off the face of the earth  powers was shaking with excitement this sudden eloquence from the one man on earth whose cold selfrestraint had become a byword moved him strangely  well he said for good or for evil the thing must go through as it has been arranged i am glad that you are interested trowse it may be that i shall need your help  likely enough trowse answered shortly it seems to me that you have let go some of the old ideas believe me they were the safest the man who has work to do in the world has no greater enemy than this shifting sentimentalism may i come and see your patient tomorrow  you may see her as often as you like powers answered so long as you let me know beforehand that you are coming  i thank you trowse answered with a cold smile you need have no fear that i shall attempt any singlehanded experiments only if you want my advice dont give her over to society no matter what your promise was why on earth dont you keep her quietly to yourself here instead of sending her to her mother what do you want to go publishing her to the world at all for a thousand things may happen if you carry out this hairbrained scheme of yours she may even want to marry she is goodlooking enough you might easily lose her altogether  powers was suddenly pale there were indeed many possibilities which he had not seriously considered yet he never hesitated  i must keep my word to her he said i shall do it at all costs  you are a fool trowse declared bluntly make her your wife bind her to you make sure of her  powers walked to the door with his visitor  it is useless to argue with you he said we look at the matter from different points of view the girl risked her life to gain a certain end she has won and she shall have her reward                                       with the passage of the months eleanor little by little entered upon a strange new life in accordance with what had been promised her through the london social season she went about with lady fiske and was admired and sought after everywhere it was as though a magician had touched her face and there had passed away from it all sense of trouble all evil memories every trace of suffering the troubled mouth seemed ever ready to break into laughter the faint lines and wrinkles had faded completely away she was years younger the light of past sorrows had gone from her eyes they remained only the mirror of the brightest and gayest things in life in her youth her beauty and her almost assertive joie de vivre she seemed like a child among the little company by whom she was constantly surrounded wherever she went in her soulless indefatigable quest for amusement  are you not afraid eleanor that some day you will grow tired of amusing yourself powers asked her one night at a dinner where she had outshone all others  a peal of light sweet laughter rang out above the babel of conversation everyone looked toward eleanors table she was leaning a little forward in her chair her lips parted her cheeks flushed her eyes alight with enjoyment a single row of pearls encircled her long graceful neck her shoulders and bare arms were dazzlingly soft her hair gleamed in the shaded lamplight  no why on earth should i what else is there to do  what about amusing other people sometimesby way of change  she smiled delightfully  how dull i suppose you mean have a night class for boys or get up concerts to send ragged children to the seaside  why not such things are kindly enough they do good they are excellent things for a girl to interest herself in  but it wouldnt amuse me at all powers i should be bored to death  and you are going to think of nothing but amusing yourself all your life he asked slowly  why not she answered lightly  powers turned his face away in quick vexation to encounter his mothers disapproving glance focused on eleanor from a nearby table  for lady fiske ever ready to further her sons scientific projects had lent the girl her social patronage and had tried to blind herself to the arrant selfishness and inconsideration that she everywhere encountered in their intercourse between eleanor and powers sister marian there was almost less in common for the eleanor of a month ago had ceased to exist beautiful brilliant hard she flitted like a butterfly through the world that powers had promised her beating her wings in a mad pursuit of amusement and pleasure commanding homage and selfsacrifice with a touch as hard as steel  powers breathed a long sigh and there was a careworn look in his eyes as he glanced again at the girl in front of him  almost immediately lady fiske rose and the women passed out trowse stood back among the shadows behind the small table at which he had been sitting and steadfastly watched the girl of whom he and marian fiske had been talking prosperity had indeed had a wonderful effect upon eleanors looks the light of perfect health had flushed her delicate cheeks her figure had filled out she carried herself with a grace and confidence which took no count of those days of slow torture through which she had passed yet there was about her beauty some faint note of peculiarity which had puzzled others before trowse he asked himself what it was as she passed out a queen running the gantlet of a court of admiring eyes fresh exquisitely natural the living embodiment of lighthearted gaiety when at last the door was closed and the men drew nearer together he smiled quietly to himself  it is like one of those pictures he murmured which come near to breaking the heart of the painter it is perfect in color and form it is beautifuland yet it does not live there is no background  he moved to a table nearer the center of the room from which he could watch his host the heavily shaded lights were kind enough to the faces of the men who sat laughing together over their cigarettes but trowse was a keen watcher and he saw things which were hardly apparent to a casual observer powers had altered during the last few months there were curious lines about his mouth his eyes were a little sunken his geniality was a trifle forced trowse smiled grimly  conscience he muttered to himself powers was never quite free from the sentimentalities of life what a fool to trifle with such an opportunity  he waited for his chance and moved up presently to his hosts table powers welcomed him but without heartiness it happened that for the moment the two were virtually isolated trowse leaned over toward the other  how does the great experiment go he asked in a low tone  powers visibly flinched he glanced around him nervously  i want to talk to you about her trowse he said i cant expect your sympathy and you cant help meyou nor any other man but ive got to talk to some oneor go mad  trowse nodded with the air of a sphinx well  she is so horribly changed powers said cant you see it of course you cant judge because you did not know her before trowse i feel like a man who has created a monster who has breathed life into some evil thing and let it loose upon the world  trowse smiled grimly  personally he said i admit that i am no judge i understand however that society in general scarcely takes the same view of miss hardinge isnt she supposed to be rather a beauty  powers beat impatiently with his hand upon the table  you know that i am not talking about her looks shes beautiful enough to bewitch every man who comes near herand she does it  it must be a little inconvenient for you trowse remarked beyond that i scarcely see your point  man you have eyes powers exclaimed with subdued passion i have seen you studying her closely when you fancied yourself undisturbed you can see what i see she is like a marvelous piece of mechanism the working of it is perfect but it isnt human she is ready to be amused at anything she is never serious for a single moment she is only alive upon the sensuous side confound it trowse dont look at me like that she has no soul there is nothing alight inside  trowse broke the short silence  i am to take it then he said coldly that you abandon the experiment in your present condition it is i suppose inevitable you have lost all influence over her it would be hopeless to expect her to respond to your will  i have already abandoned it powers answered i curse the day and the thought which made me ever attempt it  it is as well then trowse answered to give you fair warning i do not propose to stand by quietly and watch your folly  what do you mean powers demanded  this that if you do not carry this thing throughi shall  powers sprang to his feet his face was dark with passion  if you should dare to interfere he cried if you should make the slightest attempt to  stop  the monosyllable came like a pistolshot incisive compelling there was a breathless silence trowse continued and his words were cold and hard  do not threaten me he said you should know better than that you should know exactly of how much account i hold my life when it comes to a question of adding to the sum of human knowledge i shall do as i say my decision is unalterable  powers was a man again  it is well to be prepared he said i thank you for your warning take mine in return i have as little fear of death as you and i think that my love for eleanor is a passion as strong as your devotion to science i tell you that i will not have her made the subject of your experiments i will not have her life or reason imperiled even to solve the greatest of all mysteries  trowse shrugged his shoulders  i think he said that we understand one another perfectly  their talk fanned a growing distrust of trowse that fiske had felt for weeks he knew the mans hypnotic power he saw the fascination with which his friend haunted eleanors side at gatherings where her clear bright laugh would suddenly cease and a look almost of terror creep into her eyes with trowses entrance then she forgot every one else and yielded herself to his spell  very subtly very deftly trowse pursued his coldblooded course of experiment while powers in vain sought to end it at last he forbade trowse to enter his home and all went well until returning one day at an unexpected hour powers heard from his library ringing through the house through closed doors and curtained hallways the cry of a woman in mortal fear  he sprang to the door and threw it open outside all was silent there was no repetition of the cry then a fainter sound reached hima low convulsive moaning as of some creature in pain he crossed the hall ran wildly down a long passage and flung open the door of the little sittingroom which had been given to eleanor for her own with his foot upon the threshold he paused for a second he heard stealthy movements in the hall the front door softly opened and shut on the floor before him white and motionless eleanor was lying  he knew that this was trowses work he ran to the front door with murder in his heart but there was no sight of anyone marian too from the drawing room had heard the door close softly  powers sat with eleanors hand in his watching for her return to consciousness her fingers lay in his cold and passive her hair was in wild disorder and her face was still deadly pale he bent over the closed eyes and a fierce passionate desire crept into his heart if only she might wake up as he had known her first if only these terrible months of her second existence might be blotted out forever he was content to have failed in his great experiment he had no longer any ambition to add to the sum of human knowledge the memory of halkar and his patients had become a nightmare to him forever he would have been content to remain ignorant of those things which lay now so short a distance beyond it was an unexpected lesson which he had learned a strange fever which had wrought so marvelous a transformation in him the old ideals were dead and buried life itself had become centered around the girl who lay by his side now white and inanimate  at last with a little shiver she opened her eyes                                       physically eleanor became at that time a puzzle both to powers and to the physician whom he called in to attend upon her from an almost animal perfection of health she passed after her recovery from that prolonged fainting fit into a state of nervous prostration the more remarkable from its contrast to her former robustness she lost her color her light gracefulness of movement her brilliant gaiety of manner she moved about listlessly with pallid cheeks and always with a strange gleam in her eyesof expectancy mingled with apprehension  it is so absurdso horribleto look backand to remember nothing she said one day with a little break in her voice i want to see some one who really belongs to memy father or my uncle or some one perhaps that would help meto remember  my dear powers said i am afraid that you would never be able to find your father he is in china on a secret mission for the government that is why he cannot write or receive letters you must be content with us for a little longer we may hear from your uncle any day  there was a dead silence in her face were traces of a strange new nervousness  if i could get awaya long distance away eleanor exclaimed with a sudden tremulous emotion if only i could  powers took one of her restless hands in his  eleanor he said we have been talking about taking you to a little place we have in lincolnshire close to the sea there will be only marian and i you shall be alone as much as you choose no one shall come near you whom you do not care to see  she looked at him almost wistfully  tomorrow she repeated  they left london early the next morning and eleanor with a face that was almost haggard leaned wearily back in the train and scarcely spoke during the entire trip  toward the end of dinner on the evening of their arrival powers threw open the french windows and let in the deep music of the sea she started to her feet with a strange little cry  hark  it was the first sign of her awakening interest in life  the tide is coming in powers said you see the beach is just below the gardens  she stepped through the window and crossed the lawn from there a winding path led down to the beach she never paused until she stood upon the shingle with her pale rapt face turned seaward powers followed noiselessly close behind almost to their feet the long waves came thundering in weird and ghostlike she stood like a statue her lips parted her bosom rising and falling quickly under her dinnergown  listen she murmured it is the old cry unending everlasting where have i heard it before oh tell me tell me  i cannot he answered i would that i could  she paid no more attention to him she stood with her face turned seaward listeningalways listening he went back to the house and brought wraps she let him adjust them without thanks or remark soon the gathering darkness blotted out everything except the faint phosphorescent light on the tops of the breaking waves  come he said at last touching her arm gently it is late and we have left marian alone  she did not move but soon marian came out and called to them then she permitted him to lead her slowly toward the house pausing every now and then to listen a faint moon was shining through a misty sky and he caught a glimpse of her face which startled him it was as though she were listening to voices which he could not hear there was the breath of another world about her  are you afraid of being dull here he asked you see we have no neighbors and the village is a mile away  she smiled curiously  there is never any dullness she said where that is  he was prepared for changes in her but this sudden transition from a materialism almost gross was staggering it was only a few weeks ago that he had watched in vain for a single sign of feeling in her face now she was pale almost to the lips with emotion  the next afternoon she called to him he sprang up and found her standing in the open window dressed for walking even in his first rapid glance he saw a wonderful change in her appearance her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright once more she carried herself with the old lightsome grace she called to him gaily  come for a walk powers i am going to take you somewhere  he caught up his stick and hat and followed her then he saw that the color in her cheeks was not wholly natural she was nervous and excited  why not inland eleanor he suggested let us go to turton woods  she seemed scarcely to have heard him already she was well on her way shoreward  he caught her up in a few strides the tide had gone down and they walked dryfooted along the road above their heads the larks were singing and in their faces the freshening sea wind blew  her head was thrown back her lips were parted she drank in the breeze as though it were wine  this is the wind which ulric and his men always loved she murmured a wind from the north to the shore cant you feel the sting of the iceland snows  not i he answered laughing to me it is soft and warm enough but then you know i have no imagination  powers she said suddenly i want to ask you a question is there any fear of my going mad  he started violently  certainly not he answered why do you ask me such a question  i know that i am not like other girls she said wistfully i cannot remember my father or my life in india or the voyage when i try to think about these things my head plays me such strange tricks i cannot remember where i was or what i was doing a year agobut  go on tell me exactly how you feel he said encouragingly it will help me to put you right  but behind all that she continued hesitatingly i seem to remember many strange thingsthings which must have happened a long long time ago they are not things i have been told about or read of i can remember them they must have happened to me powers it makes me afraid  he looked at her with illconcealed excitement  it is the sea she murmured which seems always to be reminding me of things  she came a little closer to him his heart beat fiercely her eyes sought histhe appeal of the weak to the strong he crushed down his joyyet it shone in his face trembled in his tone  shall i ever be like other girls  he took her hands in his she yielded them readily but they were cold as ice  i am perfectly sure of it he declared you must trust in me and be patient  she held his hands tightly as though wrung with a sudden emotionan emotion which he realized was one of fear alone  powers she begged will you lock my door at night lock all the doors in the house  you have been walking in your sleep he said tell me about it you must tell me everything eleanor if i am to succeed  not in my sleep she answered in a low tone but at night when everything is quiet the sea calls and calls and i cannot rest i woke suddenly this morning at three oclock and i went out powers as i walked and listened the wind and the sea came to me like old friends i remembered many strange things i remembered people whose graves the sea has stolen from the land ages ago i was back in those days myself powers i sang their songs my heart beat with their joys  powers was silent it had come then after allthe great awakening he looked at her with a curiosity almost reverent his voice trembled  tell me of those days he begged  she shook her head impatiently  they came back to me then she said in the twilight when the whole world slept and only the sea kept calling to me now they are blotted out i am afraid to think of them powers help me to forget  for a moment his love was in the balance against that unconquerable thirst for knowledge which had seemed to him once the whole aim of life he must look if only for a second into that land beyond  eleanor he said thickly tell me what you remembered of those days sing me that song you need not be afraid it is no sign of madness this  she burst into tears stretched out her handsthe impulsive gesture of a child and the desire of his life became suddenly a faint thing beside his great love of her he drew her tenderly to him  eleanor he whispered you know that i love you give yourself to me to guard and to keep you are the first woman who has ever come into my life you will be the last i will keep you from all harm i will help you stifle those evil memories you shall be my wife and i will teach you that love is the greatest and the sweetest thing in the world  he held her from him and looked anxiously into her face there was scant comfort there for him  when you talk like that she murmured i feel that i must be different from all other people you expect something from me which i know nothing about i do not feel toward you in the least like you say you feel toward me why is it  it will come he declared confidently i am sure of it in the future it must come  she moved away and powers watched her wistfully she was thinner than he had ever known her and of that wonderful fresh beauty which had taken london by storm there remained but few traces yet to him there came at that moment a wonderful impulse of love the wistfulness which shone in her eyes the wasted cheeks the pallor of her once beautiful complexion seemed in a sense to have spiritualized her the child whose frank sensuousness had horrified him seemed to have passed away  once more she was the girl whom he had met on the wet pavement of the city brave and womanly although in desperate straitsthe woman who however unexpectedly had first found her way to his heart never even in those days when her beauty had been unrivaled and her train of admirers a constant source of embarrassment had she seemed to him more to be desired than at that moment  as she walked she began to sing softly and to herself he wondered at the strange chanting tune and at the timeforgotten words and as she sang the color brightened her cheeks and the wakening breezes blew the hair about her face  a great seabird disturbed by her voice rose from the ditch below with a flapping of wings and drifted away seaward  it is only a bird she said if you had seen as many of them as i have you would not heed them i have seen them in droves when their wings darkened the sky and i have heard them calling to one another down the north wind where have you lived all your life that you know nothing of these things  she laughed softly  come and sit with me on the sandhill there she said and i will tell you about the sea  he followed her almost to their feet the long waves made harsh music upon the shingle  poor man she said softly listen have you never heard this when the north wind blows  and again she sang that wonderful song when her voice died away he shook his head  no i have never heard that he said it is very beautiful i have never heard the music and i do not know what language it is  she smiled  it is the song of ulric the dane she told him many a time he has sung it to me as we stood on the prow of his ship and the spray broke over our heads and leaped high into the sunshine he sang it to me when the cold sleet stung our cheeks and the wind came rushing about us and we heard no longer the swirl of the oars he sang it to me in the darkness while we stole into the harbor and below his men sharpened their swords and fitted their spearheads  who was ulric he asked tentatively  ulric was my lover she answered every night when the tide comes in he calls to me but i do not know where he is i do not think that i shall ever see him any more  tell me about him he begged  her eyes shone  he was tall and strong like a god she answered with yellow hair and beard and wonderful blue eyes no man save he could wield his sword and in battle men gave way before him as the corn falls before the scythe and because he loved me he brought me here with him from over the seas i sat in the ship while he and his men fought on the land and at night when the villages were burning back came my lover with skins and ornaments corn and wine and we were all happy together  he watched her still with fascinated eyes  do you mean that you remember these things he asked you have read about them in a book  a book she exclaimed scornfully what need have i of books to tell me of these thingsi to whom their happening was but as yesterday only then my name was hildegarde and now they call me eleanor  but this all happened very long ago he protested you are only twentyfive you know it isnt possible for you to remember  she eyed him with tolerant scorn  you foolish man she exclaimed you do not understand the days when i was hildegarde and ulric was my lover are as clear to me as moonlight i could tell you many things of those days if you cared to listenhow ulric slew his brother because he lifted his eyes to me and how once we were both taken prisoners by the king of east mercia and ulric burst his bonds the strongest they could forge and slew the guards one by one  it was just such a dawn as this when we came running to the seashore and when we smelled the salt wind how we laughed in one anothers faces for the joy of our freedom behind the britons were staggering with fatiguefor ulric ran like a god and when i was weary he caught me up by the waist and i lay upon his shoulder and never troubled him or i could tell you how he slew his chief captain because one night he whispered in my ear  he clasped her fingers in his they were hot and feverish  shall we turn now dear he said we have walked far enough in this sun you shall tell me more of ulric another day  they had left the shore but she turned to the right along a low range of sandhills  does this lead to any place in particular he asked  it leads to rayston church she answered we are going there  he looked at her in quick surprise  how did you know that he asked i have heard of a place called rayston but there is no church there  she laughed softly  i will show you where it stood then she answered i will show you too what sort of man ulric was it was the last of our raids we had twelve ships and nearly five hundred men and everywhere the people fled without fighting for no one could stand against ulric and his men for once i too was allowed to land for we knew that our coming was unexpected and there was no fear of defeat village by village they plundered and sacked and burned night by night we made great fires by which the ships followed us along the coast and i sang to them till the embers burned low  she stopped short with a little cry and pointed inland to their left was a plowed field and in the top corner were three grass and ivycovered stone walls of immense thickness  see she cried there stood rayston church when we came here an old man met us waving a green bough he told ulric that all the folk had fled and that their dwellings might be spared they had collected all their treasures and belongings and stored them in the church ulric believed him and they hastened to the church all shouting and singing together for joy of such an easy victory but when they were within a dozen yards of the building there came suddenly upon them from the slit apertures and the tower a cloud of poisoned arrows and ulric lost more men in those few minutes than ever in his life before i was far away behind but i saw all i saw ulric raise his great twoedged sword and cut down to the ground the old man who had led them there i saw them drag the trunk of a tree to the church door and batter it in and not one briton escaped ask that old man powers what they have found in the fields here  powers called a laborer digging on a potatopatch close at hand  what is the name of that ruin he asked  the man surveyed it doubtfully  there aint any one as rightly knows sir he admitted our vicar has looked at the walls and reckoned it must have been a church  have any danish trophies ever been found about here  the old man smiled  you see this field sir he answered ive heard my grandfather say that when he used to plow that one day it must have been sown with human bones theres an old horn mug been found here too that they say from the shape of it must have belonged to some foreigners its in the british museum in london  powers threw him a shilling and turned away with eleanor  you have been here before he said in a low tone  never since i came with ulric she answered dreamily and that must have been a very very long time ago there were no houses in those days nor any fields yet the land is the same the land and the sea they do not change  they sat down on a sandy knoll powers took her hand in his  dear he said softly it is not well for you to dwell upon these fancies try and think instead of the futureour future  fancies she repeated scornfully they are not fancies they are memories  call them what you will dear he said but let them lie they belong to a dead past it is the future which concerns us  she drew a little closer to him for the first time he felt his pressure upon her fingers returned  it seemed to him as she sat there with quivering lips that it was indeed the weary shopgirl of the edgware road who was with him once more there was a light in her eyes as of some new understanding  a great yearning swept over powers with the memory of that rainswept windtossed bay all the scientific aspirations the quiet culture and the easy pleasant days of sybaritical studentship which had filled his life were suddenly things of the past his passionate love for eleanor was predominant he was like a man afflicted with a strange fever of unknown origin which no physician could prescribe for and which he himself was powerless to resist  in his room that night he sat under his students lamp into the small hours writingwriting  it was the last chance and he was going to stake his all upon it he was appealing to the old german professor of his student days the man who more than any other could aid him at this time  a week later he took eleanor back to london and placed her in the great specialists hands and then followed weary days and nights of anxious waiting when all but hope seemed fled then came a day when his library door opened softly and the great german doctor looked at powers benevolently through his double glasses  my young friend he said the work is finished my last visit to this most interesting of patients has been paid i await now only the confirmation of our theories  powers though outwardly cool was trembling with excitement  i can go to her he asked you recommend it the moment has arrived  it has arrived herr rauchen affirmed she is strong enough to bear your presenceto talk in moderation i will await here the result it is an experiment the most interesting of any i have ever known  powers moved toward the door but the professor called him back  my young friend he said one moment theres no hurry i would ask a question  well  you say the room is the same the nurse is the same good have you the clothes she arrived in  they are there in full view powers answered she has come back to consciousness among precisely the same surroundings as when she first came to me eight months ago  very good indeed the professor declared now you shall go to her meanwhile i wait for you here  once more powers hesitated with his foot upon the threshold of her room it seemed so short a time ago since he stood there before on his way to his first interview with her since his great experiment but his interest was no longer scientific he knew very well that the next few minutes must make or mar his life  the professor had given him hope their theories had been based upon a sound basis but the issue was the greatest he had ever put to the test with it was bound up the whole welfare of the woman he loved he entered the room without his usual confidence yet the moment he saw her his heart beat with passionate hope  she was lying upon a sofa her hair loosely coiled upon the top of her head clad in a becoming morning wrap white with streaming ribbons at the sound of the opening door she turned her head and she greeted him with a faint smile as their eyes met he felt once more that passionate thrill of hope for the change in her face was manifest this was neither the brilliantly beautiful but soulless child who had taken london by storm nor the mystic moody girl hovering ever on the brink of insanity who had sung to him upon the seashore it was the eleanor of his earlier knowledge who greeted him now halfshyly yet with a certain mischievous look in her clear soft eyes  so after all she murmured looking up at him i am a disappointment the great experiment is a failure i really havent forgotten a single thing  hang the experiment he declared cheerfully i lost all interest in that long ago all that i have been anxious for has been your recovery  i am so glad she said i was afraid you would be terribly disappointed it really isnt my fault is it  not in the least he assured her heartily you were an excellent subject i suppose he added struggling to keep the anxiety out of his tone there is no doubt about the failure of it  not the slightest my memory feels particularly clear you can crossexamine me if you like  well i will ask you a few questions he said tell me your last recollection before you came to yourself  she answered him readily  i came to you here she said and told you that i was dismissed from bearmains i heard your proposals and agreed to them you sent for a nurse and you gave me chloroform here the very last thing in my mind is that you walked to the window and looked at your watch just before i went off  he drew a quick breathit sounded almost a gasp it is wonderful he exclaimed  everything before that daymy miserable life at bearmains your kindness to me and our little jaunts together she said i can remember quite clearly i am sorry to wound your vanity but your experiment has been shockingly unsuccessful  he smiled  it was a very foolish one he declared i have been terribly worried about you  their eyes met for a moment and a spot of color burned in her cheeks  you need not have worried she said softly you made it all quite clear to me before i consented i knew the risk i ran  he braced himself up for the final test  you have been unconscious for a very long time he said often i used to listen to you talking to yourself you dont mind do you you see it was part of the experiment  of course not she answered was i very foolish  you spoke of a lot of things which of course i did not understand he said for instance there was ulric who was he  ulric she repeated the name wonderingly there was no comprehension in her face  are you sure of the name she asked i never heard it in my life before  he smothered his agitation with a strange laugh  perhaps he suggested ulric was one of your companions when you were a child  perhaps she assented yet the name is so uncommon that i think i should have remembered it  well he continued there was a person of the name of trowsean enemy i should think or some one you disliked what of him  again the blankness of noncomprehension she shook her head at him and smiled  do you know she said i shall believe soon that it is you who have been raving trowse ulric i never heard such names in my life tell me was there any one else  you spoke of my mother and sister as though you knew them he said  she shook her head  i saw them with you in a box at the theater one night you know she reminded him  he was watching her closely and permitted himself a little sigh of relief she was looking out of the window at the faint april sunshine which was doing its best to brighten the dull afternoon  a few days later powers made his way to her room in the twilight it was easy to see that her recovery was now an assured thing she was standing by the window when he entered and he fancied for the first time that she greeted him a little nervously  your mother and sister have been to see me sir powers she said wasnt it delightful of them  well i dont know he answered it seems to me a very natural thing for them to do i hope you liked my mother eleanor  how could any one help it she said simply your sister was very kind too they spoke as thoughi was to go and stay with thembut  well he said  she was very nervous under his gaze all her words took flight with her long carefully planned idea of a livelihood that she had wanted to consult him about  the feeling in his eyes was unmistakable a delicate flush stole into her cheeks and she closed her eyes in the strong light he noticed more clearly the fragility of her appearance he rose hastily  eleanor he said do not think that i expect too much from you now but i love you very dearly and today i ask from you only the right to give you my name so that i may protect you from all evil whensoever it may come for the rest i am content to wait  the hot color burned in her cheeks she looked at him confusedreproachful  but you never seemed as though you cared at all she faltered i dont understand  he caught her to him his eyes were bright his face hungry with the love of her  dear he cried look at me what does it matter when first i cared for you look at me nowlisten i love you eleanor you believe me you must  she laughed as she leaned toward him  it is so easy she murmured to believe when one wants tovery much
