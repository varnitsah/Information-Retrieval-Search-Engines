73674271	the buffalo runners a tale of the red river plains by rm ballantyne    here once again ballantyne is on familiar ground  the theme is the trials and tribulations suffered by the early settlers the pioneers in the lands to the east of the rockies in particular in the red river basin where it flows northwards into lake winnipeg  there are problems with bad men of their own settlement bad men from the other main fur company our heroes worked with the hudson bay company the norwesters sioux and salteaux indians a plague of grasshoppers a plague of mice storms that destroyed fishinggear such as nets cree indians as well as the other two tribes bad decisions and actions by the advisors of lord selkirk who was in charge of the whole operation of settlement accidental wounds  the heroes of the tale are two young boys one of whom is disabled and weak but both are shining examples of goodness and bravery  the women of the tale are of course all beautiful and devoted members of their various households  the men of the tale vary between the competent and the incompetent the lazy and idle and the industrious  the cunning and the stupid  it might be quite a good idea to read the book more than once so that you can get it clear in your mind who is on whose side    the buffalo runners a tale of the red river plains by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a tale of the red river plains  help  a blizzard was blowing wildly over the american prairies one winter day in the earlier part of the present century  fresh free and straight it came from the realms of jack frost and coldbitterly coldlike the bergs on the arctic seas to which it had but recently said farewell  snow fine as dust and sharp as needles was caught up bodily by the wind in great masseshere in snaky coils there in whirling eddies elsewhere in rolling clouds but these had barely time to assume indefinite forms when they were furiously scattered and swept away as by the besom of destruction while earth and sky commingled in a smother of whiteygrey  all the demons of the far north seemed to have taken an outside passage on that blizzard so tremendous was the roaring and shrieking while the writhing of tormented snowdrifts suggested powerfully the madness of agony  two white and ghostly pillars moved slowly but steadily through all this hurlyburly in a straight line  one of the pillars was short and broad the other was tall and stately  both were very solidagreeably so when contrasted with surrounding chaos  suddenly the two pillars stoppedthough the gale did not  said the short pillar to the tall one  taniel tavidson if we will not get to the settlement this night it iss my belief that every one o them will perish  fergus replied the tall pillar sternly they shall not perish if i can help it  at all events if they do i shall die in the attempt to save them  come on  daniel davidson became less like a white pillar as he spoke and more like a man by reason of his shaking a good deal of the snow off his stalwart person  fergus mckay followed his comrades example and revealed the factfor a few minutesthat beneath the snowmask there stood a young man with a beaming countenance of fiery red the flaming character of which however was relieved by an expression of ineffable goodhumour  the two men resumed their march over the dreary plain in silence indeed conversation in the circumstances was out of the question  the brief remarks that had been made when they paused to recover breath were howled at each other while they stood face to face  the nature of the storm was such that the gale seemed to rush at the travellers from all quarters at onceincluding above and below  men of less vigour and resolution would have been choked by it but men who dont believe in choking and have thick necks powerful frames vast experience and indomitable wills are not easily choked  it blows hardwhatever muttered fergus to himself with that prolonged emphasis on the last syllable of the last word which is eminently suggestive of the scottish highlander  davidson may have heard the remark but he made no reply  day declined but its exit was not marked by much difference in the very feeble light and the two men held steadily on  the moon came out  as far as appearances went she might almost as well have stayed in for nobody saw her that night  her mere existence somewhere in the sky however rendered the indescribable chaos visible  hours passed by but still the two men held on their way persistently  they wore fivefeetlong snowshoes  progress over the deep snow without these would have been impossible  one traveller walked behind the other to get the benefit of his beaten track but the benefit was scarcely appreciable for the whirling snow filled each footstep up almost as soon as it was made  two days and a night had these men travelled with but an hour or two of rest in the shelter of a copse without fire and almost without food yet they pushed on with the energy of fresh and wellfed men  nothing but some overpowering necessity could have stimulated them to such prolonged and severe exertion  even selfpreservation might have failed to nerve them to it for both had wellnigh reached the limit of their exceptional powers but each was animated by a stronger motive than self  fergus had left his old father in an almost dying state on the snowclad plains and davidson had left his affianced bride  the buffalohunt had failed that year winter had set in with unwonted severity and earlier than usual  the hunters with the women and children who followed them in carts to help and to reap the benefit of the hunt were starving  their horses died or were frozen to death carts were snowed up and the starving hunters had been scattered in making the best of their way back to the settlement of red river from which they had started  when old mckay broke down and his only daughter elspie had firmly asserted her determination to remain and die with him fergus mckay and daniel davidson felt themselves to be put upon their mettlecalled on to face a difficulty of the most appalling nature  to remain on the snowclad prairie without food or shelter would be death to all for there was no living creature there to be shot or trapped  on the other hand to travel a hundred miles or so on footand without food seemed an impossibility  love however ignores the impossible  the two young men resolved on the attempt  they were pretty well aware of the extent of their physical powers  they would put them fairly to the test for onceeven though for the last time  they prepared for the old man and his daughter a shelter in the heart of a clump of willows near to which spot they had found a group of the hapless hunters already dead and frozen  here as far from the frozen group as possible they made an encampment by digging down through the snow till the ground was reached  as much dried wood as could be found was collected and a fire made  the young men left their blankets behind and of the small quantity of provisions that remained they took just sufficient to sustain life  then with cheery words of encouragement they said goodbye and set out on their journey to the settlement for help  the object at which they aimed was almost gained at the point when we introduce them to the reader  taniel said fergus coming to a sudden halt  well exclaimed the other  it iss sleepy that i am  maybe if i wass to lie down  he ceased to speak  davidson looked anxiously into his face and saw that he had already begun to give way to irresistible drowsiness without a moments hesitation he seized the highlander by the throat and shook him as if he had been a mere baby  iss it for fightin ye are said fergus whose goodnature was not proof against such rough and unexpected treatment  yes my boy thats just what i am for and i think youll get the worst of it too  what iss that you say  ay ay  you will hev to bend your back then taniel for it iss not every wan that can give fergus mckay the worst of it  davidson made no reply but gave his comrade a shake so violent that it put to flight the last vestige of his goodhumour and induced him to struggle so fiercely that in a few minutes the drowsiness was also and effectually driven away  youll do now said davidson relaxing his grip and panting somewhat  ay taniel i will be doin now  an youre a frund in need whatever returned the restored highlander with a smile of appreciation  about an hour later the travellers again stopped  this time it was davidson who called a halt  fergus he said we have been successful so far thank god  but we must part here  halfanhour will take me to my fathers house and i want you to go down to the hut of francois la certe it is nearer than our house you knowand get him to help you  surely tan that will be wasted time objected the highlander  of all the lazy useless scamps in rud ruver francois la certe iss the laziest an most useless  useful enough for our purpose however returned davidson  send him up to fort garry with a message while you lie down and rest  if you dont rest you will yourself be useless in a short time  la certe is not such a bad fellow as people think him specially when his feelings are touched  that may be as you say tan  i will trywhatever  so saying the two men parted and hurried on their several ways    chapter two  a lazy couple describedand roused  francois la certe was seated on the floor of his hut smoking a long clay pipe beside an open wood fire when fergus mckay approached  his wife was seated beside him calmly smoking a shorter pipe with obvious enjoyment  the man was a canadian halfbreed  his wife was an indian woman  they were both moderately young and well matched for they thoroughly agreed in everything conceivableor otherwise  in the length and breadth of the settlement there could not have been found a lazier or more goodnatured or goodfornothing couple than la certe and his spouse love was if we may venture to say so the chief element in the character of each  love of self was the foundation  then happily love of each other came next  rising gracefully the superstructure may be described as love of tobacco love of tea love of ease and love of general comfort finishing off with a topdressing or capital of pronounced decided and apparently incurable love of indolence  they had only one clear and unmistakable hatred about them and that was the hatred of work  they had a child about four years of age which was likemindedand not unlikebodied  in the wilderness as in the city such individuals are wellknown by the similarity of their characteristics  it is not that they cant work but they wont workthough of course if taxed with this disposition they would disclaim it with mild indignation or an expression of hurt remonstrance for they are almost too lazy to become enraged  take life easy or if we cant take it easy let us take it as easy as we can is or ought to be their motto  in low life at home they slouch and smile  in high life they saunter and affect easygoing urbanityslightly mingled with mild superiority to things in general  whatever rank of life they belong to they lay themselves out with persistent resolution to do as little work as they can to make other people do as much work for them as possible to get out of life as much of enjoyment as may be attainableconsistently of course with the incurable indolenceand to put off as long as may be the evil day which they perceive or suspect must inevitably be coming  the curious thing about this race of beings is that whether in high or low station they are never ashamed of themselvesor of their position as drones in the worlds hive  they seem rather to apologise for their degradation as a thing inevitable for which they are not accountable and sometimes in the case of the rich as a thing justifiable  im glad i did not go to the plains this fall said la certe stirring the logs on the fire with his toe and emitting a prolonged sigh of mingled smoke and contentment while a blast from the bleak norwest shook every blackened rafter in his little hut  heel hee responded his wife whose indian nametranslatedwas slowfoot and might have been slowtongue with equal propriety for she was quite an adept at the art of silence  she frequently caused a giggle to do duty for speech  this suited her husband admirably for he was fond of talkingcould tell a good story sing a good song and express his feelings in a good hearty laugh  yes it will be hard for the poor boys who have gone to the plains the weather is so awful to say nothing of the women  ho replied slowfootthough what she meant to express by this no mortal knowsnor perhaps cares  it meant nothing bad however for she smiled seraphically and sent forth a stream of smoke which mingling with that just emitted by her husband rose in a curling harmony to the roof  slowfoot was not a badlooking woman as north american indians go  she was brown unquestionably and dirty without doubt but she had a pleasant expression suggestive of general goodwill and in the budding period of life must have been even pretty  she was evidently older than her husband who might perhaps have been a little over thirty  i should not wonder continued la certe if the buffalo was drove away and the people starved this year  but the buffalo perhaps will return in time to save them  hm responded the wife helping herself to some very strong tea which she poured out of a tin kettle into a tin mug and sweetened with maple sugar  do you know if cloudbrow went with them asked the halfbreed pushing forward his mug for a supply of the cheering beverage  no he stopped in his house replied the woman rousing herself for a moment to the conversational point but relapsing immediately  the man spoke in patois french the woman in her native cree language for convenience we translate their conversation as near as may be into the english in which they were wont to converse with the scotch settlers who some time before had been sent out by the earl of selkirk to colonise that remote part of the northern wilderness  la certes father was a french canadian his mother an indian woman but both having died while he was yet a boy he had been brought or left to grow up under the care of an english woman who had followed the fortunes of the la certe family  his early companions had been halfbreeds and indians  hence he could speak the english french and indian languages with equal incorrectness and facility  you dont like cloudbrow remarked the man with an inquiring glance over the rim of his mug  why you not like him  hee hee was slowfoots lucid reply  then with an unwonted frown on her mild visage she added with emphasis  no  i not like him  i know that returned the husband setting down his mug and resuming his pipe but why  to this the lady answered with a sound too brief to spell and the gentleman being accustomed to his wifes little eccentricities broke into a hilarious laugh and assured her that cloudbrow was not a bad fellowa capital hunter and worthy of more regard than she was aware of  for said he cloudbrow is willing to wait till spring for payment of the horse an cart i hired from him last year  you know that i could not pay him till i go to the plains an get another load of meat an leather  you will go with me slowfoot an we will have grand times of it with buffalohumps an marrow bones an tea an tobacco  ah it makes my mouth water  give me more tea  so  that will do  what a noise the wind makes  i hopes it wont blow over the shed an kill the horse  but if it do i cannot help that  cloudbrow could not ask me to pay for what the wind does  there came another gust of such violence as he spoke that even slowfoots benignant expression changed to a momentary glance of anxiety for the shingles on the roof rattled and the rafters creaked as if the hut were groaning under the strain  it passed however and the pair went on smoking with placid contentment for they had but recently had a square meal of pemmican and flour  this compost when cooked in a fryingpan is exceedingly rich and satisfyingnot to say heavyfood but it does not incommode such as la certe and his wife  it even made the latter feel amiably disposed to cloudbrow  this sobriquet had been given by the halfbreeds to a young scotch settler named duncan mckay in consequence of the dark frown which had settled habitually on his browthe result of bad temper and unbridled passion  he was younger brother to that fergus who has already been introduced to the reader  having been partially trained while in scotland away from the small farmhouse of his father and having received a better education duncan conceived himself to stand on a higher level than the sedate and uneducated fergus  thus pride was added to his bad temper  but he was not altogether destitute of good points  what man is  one of these was a certain reckless openhandedness so that he was easily imposed on by the protestations and assurances of the sly plausible and lazy la certe  the couple were still engaged in smoking quaffing tea and other intellectual pursuits when they heard sounds outside as of some one approaching  another moment and the door burst open and a man in white stepped in  he saluted them with a familiar and hasty bonjour as he stamped and beat the snow vigorously from his garments  what  antoine dechamp exclaimed la certe rising slowly to welcome his friend you seem in hurry  ayin great hurry  they are starving on the plains  many are dead davidson has come in  he is more than halfdead  can hardly tell the news  drops asleep when he is speaking  luckily i met him when going home in my cariole  okematan the indian was with me  so he got out and said he would pilot davidson safe home  he said something about fergus mckay which i could not understand so i have come on and will drive to fort garry with the news  but my horse has broke down  is yours in the stable  dechamp was a sturdy young halfbreed and an old playmate of la certe he spoke with obvious impatience at the delay caused by having so much to tell  is your horse in the stable he demanded sharply a second time while his friend began with exasperating composure to assure him that it was but that the horse was not his  cloudbrow is its owner he said and you know if anything happens to it he will   stay i will get you lantern  he stopped for dechamp observing a large key hanging on the wall had seized it and rushed out of the hut without waiting for a lantern  strange how easy some men get into a fuss remarked la certe to his surprised but quiet spouse as he lighted a large tin lantern and went to the door  looking out with an expression of discomfort he put on his cap and prepared to face the storm in the cause of humanity  he held the lantern high up first however and peered under it as if to observe the full extent of the discomfort before braving it  just then a furious gust blew out the light  ha  i expected that he said with a sigh that was strongly suggestive of relief as he returned to the fire to relight the lantern  on going the second time to the door he observed the form of his friend leading the horse pastboth of them looking dim and spectral through the driving snow  dechamp have good eyes he remarked halting on the threshold  there is light enough without the lantern besidesha there it is out again  what a trouble it is  impossible to keep it insuch a night  hee hee giggled slowfoot who was busy refilling her pipe  la certe was still standing in a state of hesitancy troubled by a strong desire to help his friend and a stronger desire to spare himself when he was thrown somewhat off his wonted balance by the sudden reappearance of dechamp leading or rather supporting a man  need we say that it was fergus mckay almost blind and dumb from exhaustion for the parting from dan davidson which we have mentioned had proved to be the last straw which broke them both down and it is probable that the frozen corpse of poor dan would have been found next day on the snow had he not been accidentally met by dechamp and taken in charge by the indian okematan  fergus having a shorter way to go and perhaps possessing a little more vitality or endurance had just managed to stagger to la certes hut when he encountered the same man who an hour previously had met and saved his companion further down the settlement  the moment fergus entered the hut he looked wildly round and opened his mouth as if to speak  then he suddenly collapsed and fell in a heap upon the floor scattering flakes of snow from his person in all directions  la certe and his wife though steeped in selfishness were by no means insensible to the sufferings of humanity when these were actually made visible to their naked eyes  like manytoo manypeople they were incapable of being impressed very deeply through their ears but could be keenly touched through the eyes  no sooner did they behold the condition of ferguswho was wellknown to themthan they dropped their apathetic characters as though they had been garments  in her haste slowfoot let fall her pipe which broke to atoms on the floorbut she heeded it not  la certe capsized his mug of teabut regarded it not and while the former proceeded to remove the shawl from ferguss neck and chafe his cold hands the latter assisted dechamp to drag the exhausted man a little nearer to the fire and poured a cup of warm tea down his throat  their efforts though perchance not as wisely directed as they might have been were so vigorously conducted that success rewarded them fergus soon began to show signs of returning animation  a hunter of the western wilderness is not easily overcome neither is he long of reviving as a rule if not killed outright  they set him up in a sitting posture with his back against a box and his feet towards the fire  heaving a deep sigh fergus looked round with a bewildered anxious expression  in a moment intelligence returned to his eyes and he made a violent attempt to rise but dechamp held him down  let me up he gasped life and death are in the matterif it iss not death already  be still fergus mckay said dechamp with that firmness of manner and tone which somehow command respect i know all about it  take one bit of bread one swig more of tea and you go with me to fort garry to tell the govnor what you know  he will send help at once  great was the relief of fergus when he heard this  submitting to treatment like an obedient child he was soon fit to stagger to the sleigh or cariole into which he was carefully stuffed and packed like a bale of goods by la certe and his wife who to their credit be it recorded utterly ignored for once the discomforts of the situation  fergus was asleep before the packing was quite done  then dechamp jumped in beside him and drove off in the direction of the hudsons bay companys establishment fort garry while our worthy couple returned to their hut to indulge in a final and wellearned pipe and a mug of the strongest possible tea    chapter three  to the rescue  winnipeg city with its thousands of inhabitants now covers the spot to which antoine dechamp drove his friend fergus mckay  at the time we write of the only habitation there was fort garry a solitary stone building of some strength but without regular troops of any kind and held only by a few employes of the hudsons bay company who were there only in the capacity of furtraders  here the governor of the colony received the unexpected guests with hospitality heard the tale of fergus with a sympathetic ear and at once organised a rescueexpedition with dogsledges and provisions  while this was being done at the fort dan davidson was similarly employed at prairie cottage the residence of his mother who since the death of her husbanda farmer from the scottish lowlandshad managed her farm with the aid of her two sons dan and peter the latter being a youth of seventeen  she was also assisted by her only daughter jessie who was over thirteen years of age and already esteemed an authority on the subjects of poultry cookery and dairy produce  a small servanta french halfbreed named louisecompleted the household of the widow davidson  on reaching home dan like fergus mckay experienced difficulties that he had not counted on for his overtaxed strength fairly broke down and he found himself almost incapable at first of telling his tale of disaster  then when he tried to go about the needful preparations for rescue he found himself unable to resist drowsiness and if he ventured to sit down for a moment he fell sound asleep at once  those who have experienced this condition know how overwhelming and intensely disagreeable it is especially if resistance to it is rendered imperative by a matter of life or death  davidson struggled bravely against it of course but the struggle had already been so long continued that his efforts were now in vain  starting up from the supper which jessie had spread before him and which he was languidly attempting to eat he said almost fiercely where is the washtub louise  the surprised little domestic pointed to the article in question  here fetch some cold water  it is full said louise with a strong french accent and a pretty lisp  without the ceremony even of throwing back his collar dan plunged his head into the water and after steeping it for a few seconds drew it out refreshed  his younger brother entered the room at that moment  peter he said drying his head violently with a jacktowel have you got the sledge ready and the provisions packed and the empty sledge wi the buffalorobes  ayall ready answered the other for he was a sprightly willing youth who rejoiced in any unexpected demand on his superabundant energies  but i say dan you are quite unfit to start off again without rest  he looked in his brothers face anxiously for dan had seated himself once more to his food but seemed unable to deal with it properly why youve got the knife and fork in the wrong hands dan  you must have an hours rest before we start  impossible returned the other with a dazed look as he seized a mug of water and drank it off  an hours delay may mean death to elspie and old duncan mckay  but let me start off at once returned peter eagerly  ive a pretty good guess from your description where you left them  besides the gale is not so bad now  after an hours sleep you will be able to start fresh maybe overtake me  jess will be sure to waken you in  he stopped for his brothers head had bent slowly forward while he was speaking and now rested on his arms on the table  the wornout man was sound asleep  just leave him peter and be off wi the dogs said mrs davidson okematan will keep you in the right track  ill be sure to wake him in time to catch you up  no mother not without his leave said the youth firmly  dan dan rouse up old boy  shall we start without you  yes yesim ready said the poor fellow starting up and swaying to and fro like a drunken man buti say peter im done for  i depend on you lad to keep me up to the scratch  lay the dogwhip across my shoulders if i try to lie down  promise me that  dee hear  yes i understand returned the youth with intense earnestness  now look here dan you know me will you trust me  of course i will answered dan with a languid smile  well then come along well rescue elspieyou may depend on that okematan and i will look after you and see that all goes right  come  he took his brother by the arm and led him unresistingly away followed by the darkskinned indian who with the usual reticence of his race had stood like a brown statue silently observing events  jessie davidson who was a fair and comely maiden touched him on the arm as he was passing out  oh take care of him okematan she said anxiously  okematan replied ho in a sort of grunt  it was an expressively uttered though not very comprehensible reply but jessie was satisfied for she knew the man well as he had for a considerable time been not exactly a servant of the house but a sort of selfappointed hangeron or unpaid retainer  for an indian he was of a cheerful disposition and made himself generally useful  when they were outside it was found that the gale had abated considerably and that the moon was occasionally visible among the clouds which were driving wildly athwart the heavens as though the elemental war which had ceased to trouble the earth were still raging in the sky  peter said the brother as they stood for a moment beside two indian sledges one of which was laden with provisions the other emptypeter dont forget your promise  lay the whip on heavy nothing else will keep me awake  all right  sit down there for a moment  were not quite ready yet  id better not  no  i will stand till its time to start returned dan with a dubious shake of his head  didnt you say you would trust me  yes i did old boy  does it look like trusting me to refuse the very first order i give you  what an example to okematan  i am in command dan  do as youre bid sir and sit down  with a faint smile and a still more dubious shake of the head dan obeyed  he sat down on the empty sledge and the expected result followed  in a few seconds he was asleep  now well pack him in tight observed his brother as he and the indian stretched the sleeper at full length on the sledge wrapped him completely up in the warm buffalorobes and lashed him down in such a way that he resembled a mummy with nothing visible of him except his mouth and nose  four strong large dogs were attached to each sledge in tandem fashion each dog having a little collar and harness of its own  no reins were necessary  a track beaten in the soft snow with his snowshoes by the indian who stepped out in front was guide enough for them and a tailline attached to the rear of each sledge and held by the drivers sufficed to restrain them when a stretch of hard snow or ice tempted them to have a scamper  the road thus beaten over the prairie by okematan though a comparatively soft one was by no means smooth and the rough motion would in ordinary circumstances have rendered sleep impossible to our hero but it need hardly be said that it failed to disturb him on the present occasion  he slept like an infant throughout the whole night cared nothing for the many plunges down the prairie waves and recked not of the frequent jerks out of the hollows  hour after hour did peter davidson with his silent companion trudge over the monotonous plainshope in the ascendant and vigour apparently inexhaustible  the dogs too were good and strong  a brief halt now and then of a few minutes sufficed to freshen them for every new start night passed away and daylight came in with its ghostly revelations of bushes that looked like bears or buffaloes and snowwreaths that suggested the buried forms of frozen men  then the sun arose and scattered these sombre visions of early morning with its gladdening soulreviving rays  at this point the rescueparty chanced to have reached one of those bluffs of woodland which at that time speckled the plainsthough they were few indeed and far between  breakfast said peter heaving a profound sigh as he turned about and checked the teams for at that point he happened to be in advance beating the track  okematan expressed his entire concurrence with an emphatic ho  the wearied dogs lay down in their tracks shot out their tongues panted and looked amiable for well they knew the meaning of the word breakfast and the relative halt  the sudden stoppage awoke the sleeper and he struggled to rise  hallo  whats wrong  where am i  have the redskins got hold o me at last  ay that they have  at least one redskin has got you said peter have a care man dont struggle so violently  okematan wont scalp you  the sound of his brothers voice quieted davidson and at once restored his memory  cast me loose peter he said youre a good fellow  i see you have brought me along wi you and i feel like a giant refreshed now tho somewhat stiff  have we come far  i dont know how far weve come but i know that weve been pegging along the whole night and that we must have breakfast before we take another step  its all very well for you dan to lie there all night like a mere bag o pemmican enjoying yourself but you must remember that your brother is mortal and so are the dogs to say nothing o the redskin  while he was speaking the youth undid the fastenings and set his brother free but dan was far too anxious to indulge in pleasantries just then  after surveying the landscape and coming to a conclusion as to where they were he took a hurried breakfast of dried meatcold the dogs were also treated to a hearty feed and then resuming the march the rescuers pushed on with renewed vigourdan davidson now beating the track and thus rendering it more easy for those who came behind him  all that day they pushed on almost without halt and spent the next night in a clump of willows but dan was too anxious to take much rest they rose at the first sign of daybreak and pushed on at their utmost speed until the poor dogs began to show signs of breaking down but an extra hour of rest and a full allowance of food kept them up to the mark while calm weather and clear skies served to cheer them on their way    chapter four  tells of love duty starvation and murder  pushing on ahead of them with that sometimes fatal facility peculiar to writers and readers we will now visit the couple whom dan and his party were so anxious to rescue  a single glance at elspie mckay would have been sufficient to account to most people for the desperate anxiety of daniel davidson to rescue her from death for her pretty sparkling face and evervarying expression were irresistibly suggestive of a soul full of sympathy and tender regard for the feelings of others  nutbrown hair dark eyes brilliant teeth and many more charms that it would take too much time and room to record still further accounted for the desperate determination with which dan had wooed and won her  but to see this creature at her best you had to see her doing the dutiful to her old father  if ever there was a peevish crossgrained crabbed unreasonable old sinner in this world that sinner was duncan mckay senior  he was a widower  perhaps that accounted to some extent for his condition  that he should have a younger sonalso named duncana cross neerdoweel like himselfwas natural but how he came to have such a sweet daughter as elspie and such a good elder son as fergus are mysteries which we do not attempt to unravel or explain perhaps these two took after their departed mother  we know not for we never met her  certain it is that they did not in the least resemble their undeparted fatherexcept in looks for mckay senior had been a handsome man though at the time we introduce him his good looks like his temper had nearly fled and he was considerably shrivelled up by age hard work and exposure  the poor man was too old to emigrate to a wilderness home when he had set out for the red river colony and the unusual sufferings disappointments and hardships to which the first settlers were exposed had told heavily on even younger men than he  elspies love for her father was intense her pity for him in his misfortunes was very tender and now that he was brought face to face with perhaps the greatest danger that had ever befallen him her anxiety to relieve and comfort him was very touching  she seemed quite to forget herself and the fact that she might perish on the bleak plains along with her father did not seem even to occur to her  it wass madness to come here whatever said the poor old man as he cowered over the small fire which his son fergus had kindled before leaving and which elspie had kept up with infinite labour and difficulty ever since  the remark was made testily to himself for elspie had gone into the surrounding bush axe in hand to find if possible and cut down some more small pieces of firewood  when she returned with an armful of dry sticks he repeated the sentiment still more testily and addedif it wass not for tuncan i would have been at home this night in my warm bed wi a goot supper inside o me instead o freezin an starvin oot here on the plain among the snow  its mischief that boy wass always after from the tay he wass born  but you know that poor duncan could not guess we were to have such awful weather or that the buffalo would be so scarce  come now dear daddy said the cheery girl as she heaped on wood and made a blaze that revived the old man ill warm up some more of the tea  theres a very little leftandandit surely wont be long till god sends daniel and fergus back to us with food  old mckay was somewhat mollified by her manner or by the fire or by the prospect of relief held out for his tone improved decidedly  try the bag again lass he said maybe youll find a crumb or two in the corners yet  it will do no harm to try  obediently poor elspie tried but shook her head as she did so  theres nothing there daddy  i turned it inside out last time  wow but its ill to bear exclaimed old duncan with a halfsuppressed groan  meanwhile his daughter put the tin kettle on the fire and prepared their last cup of tea  when it was ready she looked up with a peculiar expression on her face as she drew something from her pocket  look here daddy she said holding up a bit of pemmican about the size of a hens egg  the old man snatched it from her and biting off a piece began to chew with a sort of wolfish voracity  i reserved it till now said the girl for i knew that this being the second night you would find it impossible to get to sleep at all without something in you however small  if you manage to sleep on this and the cup of hot tea youll maybe rest well till morningand then  god forgive me exclaimed the old man suddenly pausing as he was about to thrust the last morsel into his mouth hunger makes me selfish  i wass forgettin that you are starvin too my tear  open your mouth  no father i dont want it  i really dont feel hungry  elspie my shild said old duncan in a tone of stern remonstrance when wass it that you began to tell lies  im telling the truth daddy  i did feel hungry yesterday but that has passed away and today i feel only a little faint  open your mouth im tellin you repeated old duncan in a tone of command which long experience had taught elspie promptly to obey  she received the morsel ate it with much relish and wished earnestly for more  now youll lie down and go to sleep she said after her father had washed down the last morsel of food with the last cup of hot tea and ill gather a few more sticks to keep the fire going till morning  i think it is not so cold as it was and the wind is quite gone  they have been away five days now or more  i think that god in his mercy will send us relief in the morning  you are a goot lass my tear said the old man allowing himself to be made as comfortable as it was in his daughters power to accomplish what you say is ferry true  the weather feels warmer and the wind is down  perhaps they will find us in the mornin  gootnight my tear  it was one of the characteristics of this testy old man that he believed it quite possible for a human being to get on quite well enough in this world without any distinct recognition of his maker  once in conversation with his youngest son and namesake duncan junior he had somehow got upon this subject not by any means in a reverential but in an argumentative controversial spirit and had expressed the opinion that as man knew nothing whatever about god and had no means of finding out anything about him there was no need to trouble ones head about him at all  i just go about my work tuncan he said an leave preachin an prayin an psalmsingin to them that likes it  theres elspie now she believes in god an likes goin to churches an meetins an that seems to make her happy  ferry gooti dont pelieve in these things an i think im as happy as hersel  humph grunted the son in a tone of unconcealed contempt if ye are as happy as hersel faither yer looks give the lie to your condeetion whatever  an theres this great dufference between you an her that shes not only happy hersel but she does her best to mak other folk happybut you wi your girnin an snappin are always doin the best ye can to mak everybody aboot ye meeserable  tuncan retorted the sire with solemn candour it iss the same compliment i can return to yoursel with interest my boywhatever  with such sentiments then it is not remarkable that duncan mckay senior turned over to sleep as he best could without looking to a higher source than earth afforded for help in his extremity  happily his daughter was actuated by a better spirit and when she at last lay down on her pile of brushwood with her feet towards the fire and her head on a buffalo robe the fact of her having previously committed herself and her father to god made her sleep all the sounder  in another clump of wood not many miles distant from the spot where the father and daughter lay two hunters were encamped  one was duncan mckay to whom we have just referred as being in discord with his father  the other was a canadian named henri perrin  both men were gaunt and weakened by famine  they had just returned to camp from an unsuccessful hunt and the latter being first to return had kindled the fire and was about to put on the kettle when mckay came in  ive seen nothing remarked mckay as he flung down his gun and then flung himself beside it  did you see anything  no nothing answered perrin breaking off a piece of pemmican and putting it into the pot  how much is left asked mckay  hardly enough for two daysfor the two of us four days perhaps for one answered the other  mckay looked up quickly but the canadian was gazing abstractedly into the pot  apparently his remark had no significance  but mckay did not think so  since arriving in the colony he had seen and heard much about deception and crime among both indians and halfbreeds  being suspicious by nature he became alarmed for it was evident enough as perrin had said that food to last two men for three days would last one man for six and the one who should possess six days provisions might hope to reach the settlement alive even though weakened by previous starvation  the dark expression which had procured for duncan mckay junior the sobriquet of cloudbrow from la certe and his wife deepened visibly as these thoughts troubled his brain and for some time he sat gazing at the fire in profound abstraction  young mckay was not by any means one of the most depraved of men but when a man is devoid of principle it only requires temptation strong enough and opportunity convenient to sink him suddenly to the lowest depths  starvation had so far weakened the physique of the hunters that it was obviously impossible for both of them to reach the settlement on two days short allowance of food  the buffalo had been driven away from that neighbourhood by the recent storm and the hope of again falling in with them was now gone  the starving hunters as we have said had broken up camp and were scattered over the plains no one could tell where  to find them might take days if not weeks and even if successful of what avail would it be to discover groups of men who were in the same predicament with themselves  to remain where they were was certain and not fardistant death  the situation was desperate and each knew it to be so  yet each did not take it in the same way mckay as we have said became abstracted and slightly nervous  the canadian whatever his thoughts was calm and collected and went about his culinary operations as if he were quite at ease  he was about to lift the pot off the hook that suspended it over the fire when his companion quietly and as if without any definite purpose took up his gun  perrin observed the action and quickly reached out his hand towards his own weapon which lay on the ground beside him  quick as lightning mckay raised his gun and fired  next moment his comrade lay dead upon the groundshot through the heart  horrorstruck at what he had done the murderer could scarcely believe his eyes and he stood up glaring at the corpse as if he had been frozen to death in that position  after standing a long time he sat down and tried to think of his act and the probable consequences  selfdefence was the first idea that was suggested clearly to him and he clung to it as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw  was it not clear he thought that perrin intended to murder me  if not why so quick to grip his gun  if i had waited it would have been me not perrin that would be lying there now  his memory reminded him faithfully however that when he first thought of taking up his gun conscience had sternly saiddont  why should conscience have spoken thus or at all if his motive had been innocent  there are two ways in which a wicked man gets rid of conscientious troublesat least for a time  one way is by stouthearted defiance of god and ignoring of conscience altogether  the other is by sophistical reasoning and a more or less successful effort to throw dust in his own eyes  duncan mckay took the latter method  it is an easy enough method especially with the illogicalbut it works indifferently and it does not last long  conscience may be seared may be ignored may be trampled on but it cannot be killed it cannot even be weakened and is ever ready at the most unseasonable and unexpected times to start up vigorous and faithful to the very end with its emphatic dont and no  dragging the body out of the camp mckay returned to take his supper and reason the matter out with himself  i could not help myself he thought when i took up my gun i did not intend to kill the man  conscience again reminded him of its dont  and would not every man in rud ruver justify me for firing first in selfdefence  conscience again said no  here the hunter uttered a savage oath to which conscience made no reply for conscience never speaks back or engages in disputation  we need not attempt further to analyse the workings of sophistry in the brain of a murderer  suffice it to say that when the man had finished his supper he had completely though not satisfactorily justified himself in his own eyes  there was he felt a disagreeable undercurrent of uneasiness but this might have been the result of fear as to how the canadian halfbreeds and friends of the slain man would regard the matter in the event of its being found out  there was reason for anxiety on this head for poor perrin was a great favourite among his comrades while cloudbrow was very much the reverse  having finished the supper which he had purchased at such a terrible price the young man gathered his things together packed the provisions on his back put on his snowshoes and left the scene of the murder  although a dark night there was sufficient moonlight to enable him to pick his steps but he had not advanced more than two miles when he came upon the track of a party that had preceded him  this rendered the walking more easy and as he plodded along he reflected that the wolves would soon find perrins body and by tearing it to pieces render recognition of the victim impossible  suddenly it occurred to him that if any of the scattered band of hunters should come on the camp before the wolves had time to do their work the print of his snowshoes might tell a talefor snowshoes were of various shapes and sizes and most of his companions in the settlement might be pretty well acquainted with the shape of his  the danger of such a contretemps was not great but to make quite sure that it should not occur he turned round and walked straight back on his track to the camp he had just leftthus obliterating or rather confusing the track so as to render recognition improbable  as he walked over it a third time in resuming his march to the settlement all danger on this ground he considered was effectually counteracted  of course when he reached the tracks of the party before mentioned all trace of his own track was necessarily lost among these  that murder will out is supposed to be an unquestionable truism  we nevertheless question it very much for while the thousands of cases of murder that have been discovered are obvious the vast number it may be that have never been found out are not obvious however probable  the case we are now describing seemed likely to belong to the class which remains a mystery till altogether forgotten  nevertheless nemesis was on the wing  while duncan mckay junior was thus pushing his way over the plains in the direction of red river settlement two poor halfbreed women were toiling slowly over the same plains behind him bound for the same haven of hopedfor and muchneeded rest and refreshment  the poor creatures had been recently made widows  the husband of one louis blanc had been killed by indians during this hunt that of the other antoine pierre had met his death by being thrown from his horse when running the buffalo  both women were in better condition than many of the other hunters wives for they had started on the homeward journey with a better supply of meat which had not yet been exhausted  it happened that marie blanc and annette pierre came upon mckays camp soon after he left it the second time  here they prepared to spend the night but on discovering marks of fresh blood about they made a search and soon came on the unburied corpse of the murdered man lying behind a bush  they recognised it at once for perrin had been wellknown as well as much liked in the settlement  neither of the women was demonstrative  they did not express much feeling though they were undoubtedly shocked but they dug a hole in the snow with their snowshoes and buried the body of the hunter thereinhaving first carefully examined the wound in his breast and removed the poor mans coat which exhibited a burnt hole in front as well as a hole in the back for the bullet had gone quite through him  then they returned to the camp and made a careful examination of it but nothing was found there which could throw light on the subject of who was the murderer  whether a comrade or an indian had done the deed there was nothing to show but that a murder had been committed they could not doubt for it was physically almost impossible that a man could have shot himself in the chest either by accident or intention with one of the longbarrelled trading guns in use among the buffalohunters  another point justifying the supposition of foul play was the significant fact that perrins gun with his name rudely carved on the stock still lay in the camp undischarged  seehere is something said one woman to the other in the cree tongue as they were about to quit the camp  she held up a knife which she had found half buried near the fire  it is not a common scalpingknife said the other woman  it is the knife of a settler  the weapon in question was one of the large sheathknives which many of the recently arrived settlers had brought with them from their native land  most of these differed a little in size and form from each other but all of them were very different from the ordinary scalpingknives supplied by the furtraders to the halfbreeds and indians  i see no name on itno mark said the woman who found it after a critical inspection  her companion examined it with equal care and similar result  the two women had at first intended to encamp at this spot but now they determined to push forward to the settlement as fast as their exhausted condition permitted carrying the knife with the coat and gun of the murdered man along with them    chapter five  saved  duncan mckay senior was dreaming of and gloating over the fleshpots of red river and his amiable daughter was rambling over the green carpet of the summer prairies when the sun arose and shone upon the bushes which surrounded their winter campstarvation camp as the old man had styled it  there is no saying how long duncan would have gloated and the fair elspie wandered if a hair of the buffalo robe on which the former lay had not entered his nostril and caused him to sneeze  old mckays sneeze was something to be remembered when once heard indeed it was something that could not be forgotten  from the profoundest depths of his person it seemed to burst and how his nose sustained the strain without splitting has remained one of the mysteries of the norwest unto this day  it acted like an electric shock on elspie who sat bolt upright at once with a scared look that was quite in keeping with her tousled hair  oh daddy what a fright you gave me  elspie said remonstratively  it iss goot seventeen years an more that you hev had to get used to it whatever growled the old man  i suppose weve got nothin for breakfast  he raised himself slowly and gazed at elspie with a disconsolate expression  nothing returned the girl with a look of profound woe  it is said that when things are at the worst they are sure to mend  it may be so the sayings of man are sometimes true  whether or not the circumstances of elspie and old mckay were at the worst is an open question but there can be no doubt that they began to mend just about that time for the girl had not quite got rid of her disconsolate feelings when the faint but merry tinkle of sleighbells was heard in the frosty air  the startled look of sudden surprise and profound attention is interesting to behold whether in old or young  it is a condition of being that utterly blots out self for a brief moment in the person affected and allows the mind and frame for once to have free unconscious play  elspie said sh and gazed aside with wide and lustrous eyes head a little on one side a hand and forefinger slightly raised as if to enforce silence and her graceful figure bent forwarda petrifaction of intensely attentive loveliness  old mckay said ho and with both hands resting on the ground to prop him up eyes and mouth wide open and breath restrained presented the very personification of petrified stupidity  another moment and the sound became too distinct to admit of a doubt  here they are at long last exclaimed the old man rising with unwonted alacrity for his years  thank god ejaculated elspie springing up and drawing a shawl round her shoulders at the same time making some hasty and futile attempts to reduce the confusion of her hair  it need scarcely be said that this was the arrival of the rescueparty of which daniel davidson was in command  before the starving pair had time to get fairly on their legs daniel strode into the camp and seized elspie in his arms  we need not repeat what he said for it was not meant to be made public but no such reticence need trouble us in regard to old duncan  hoot  taniel said he somewhat peevishly keep your coortin till efter breakfast man  it iss a wolf that will be livin inside o me for the last few taysa hungry wolf tooan nothin for him to eat thats right okematan on wi the kettle it iss yourself that knows what it iss to starve  blow up the fire peter tavidson  youre a cliver boy for your age an hes goot lungs i make no doubt  that i have mr mckay else i should not be here said the lad laughing as he knelt before the embers of the fire and blew them into a blaze  wow  dan hev ye not a pit pemmican handy asked mckay  it iss little i care for cookin just now  here you are said dan taking a lump of the desired article from his wallet and handing it to the impatient man at the same time giving a morsel to elspie  i knew you would want it in a hurry and kept it handy  where is duncan  i thought he was with you  so he wass taniel when you left us to go to rud ruver but my son tuncan was never fond o stickin to his father  he left us an no wan knows where he iss now  starvin maybe like the rest of us  i hope not said elspie while her sire continued his breakfast with manifest satisfaction  he went off to search for buffalo with perrin and several others  they said they would return to us if they found anything  but as they have not come back we suppose they must have been unsuccessful  did you meet any of the poor people on the way out dan  ay we met some of them replied the hunter in a sad tone  all struggling to make their way back to the settlement and all more or less starving  we helped them what we could but some were past help and we came upon two or three that had fallen in their tracks and died in the snow  but we have roused the settlement and there are many rescueparties out in all directions now scouring the plains  you hev stirred it enough okematan said old mckay referring to the kettle of food which was being prepared  here fill my pannikin i can wait no longer  whenever you have finished breakfast we must start off home said davidson helping elspie to some of the muchneeded and not yet warmed soup which was quickly made by mixing pemmican with flour and water i have brought two sleds so that you and your father may ride and we will carry the provisions  we never know when the gale may break out again  or when heavy snow may come on added peter who was by that time busy with his own breakfast  okematan occupied himself in stirring the contents of the large kettle and occasionally devouring a mouthful of pemmican uncooked  an hour later and they were making for home almost as fast as the rescueparty had travelled outthe provisions transferred to the strong backs of their rescuersold mckay and elspie carefully wrapped up in furs reposing on the two sledges    chapter six  discord and deceit etcetera  it was found on their arrival at the home of duncan mckay senior that duncan junior had got there before them he having been met and brought in by one of the settlers who had gone out with his cariole to do what he could for the hunters  the two women who discovered the body of perrin however had not yet arrived and nothing was known of the murder in the settlement  it iss little troubled you wass what came over us remarked old duncan angrily on entering his house and finding his younger son engaged with a pipe beside the kitchen fire  an how could i know where you wass efter i had been huntin for nothin for two days retorted his son  wass i to think you would be stoppin in the lame camp till you died  wass it not more likely that some wan would find you an bring you inas they did  no thanks to you that they did tuncan whatever  where did you leave the other boys  how should i know returned the son sharply they dropped offwan here an wan theresayin they would try for a buffalo in wan place or another or that they would rest awhile an so i wass left by myself i found it quite enough to look efter number wan  it hes always been as much that as ye could manitch tuncan even when things wass goin easy said the old man with a sarcastic laugh that induced the young man to rise and quit the room  he went towards a small shop or store as such places were styled in the norwest  it fell to his lot in the family arrangements to look after and manage this store  indeed the youths anxiety for the ease and comfort of number wan had induced him to select the post as being a part of the family duties that was peculiarly suited to himself  on reaching the store he went straight to a large roll of canadian twist tobacco cut off a piece refilled his pipe and sitting down on a bale began or rather continued to smoke  he had not been seated long when the door opened and the head of a halfbreed peeped cautiously in with an uncommonly sly look  that you francois la certe said mckay rather sternly for he knew the man well  what iss it you will be wantin now  francois wanted many thingsthings almost too numerous to mention but first he would pay his debts to cloudbrow  come thats something new said mckay with a cynical laugh  you must have come by a fortune or committed a robbery before ye would be so honest  how much are you goin to pay  the sledge that you lent me i have brought back said the halfbreed with a deprecatory air  so you call returning a loan paying your debts said duncan  la certe did not quite say that but he thought it bore some resemblance to a payment to account and at all events was proof of his good intentions  and on the strength of that youll want plenty more credit i hev no doubt  nonot plenty said la certe with the earnest air of a man who is exposing his whole soul to inspection and who means to act this time with the strictest sincerity to say nothing of honesty  it is only a little that i want  not much  just enough to keep body and soul from sayin goodbye  but you have not paid a fraction of your old debt  how will you be expectin to meet the new one  oh  la certe could easily explain that  he was going off immediately to hunt and trap and would soon return with a heavy load for there were plenty of animals about  then in the spring which was near at hand he meant to fish or go to the plains with the hunters and return laden with bags of pemmican bales of dried meat and buffalorobes enough to pay off all his debts and leave something over to enable him to spend the winter in luxurious idleness  and you expect me to believe all that nonsense said mckay sternly  la certe was hurt  of course he expected to be believed  his feelings were injured but he was of a forgiving disposition and would say no more about it  he had expected better treatment however from one who had known him so long  a trip to the plains requires more than powder and shot said the storekeeper where will you be goin to get a horse an cart for you can hev mine no longer  dechamp he promise to sole me a horse an mrs davisn will loan me a cart returned the halfbreed with lofty independence  hm an you will be returnin the cart an payin for the horse when the hunt is over i suppose  yes that was exactly the idea that was in la certes brain and which he hoped and fully expected to reduce to practice in course of timeif duncan mckay would only assist him by making him a few advances at that present time  well what do you want asked mckay getting off the bath  the halfbreed wanted a good many things  as he was going off in the course of a few days and might not be able to return for a long time he might as well take with him even a few things that he did not absolutely need at the moment  of course he wanted a good supply of powder shot and ball  without that little or nothing could be done then a new axe as his old one was much wornthe steel almost goneand it was wellknown that a trapper without an axe was a very helpless creature  a tin kettle was of course an absolute necessity and the only one he possessed had a small hole in it  a few awls to enable him to mend his bark canoe when open water came and a couple of steel traps some gunflints and o yes he had almost forgotten a most essential thingtwine to make a net and some fishhooks  it iss a regular outfit you will be wanting remarked the storekeeper as he handed over the various articles  o nonot a regular oneonly a very little one considering the length of time he should be away and the wealth with which he would return but again he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten something else  well what iss it  some glovers needles and sinews for making leather coats and moccasins needles and thread and scissors for it was quite clear that people could not live without suitable clothing  a new capote also and anda yard or two of scarlet cloth with a few beads  as he made the last request la certe attempted to speak insinuatingly and to look humble  come that iss pure extravagance said mckay remonstrating  la certe could not dare not face his wife without these articles  he pleaded earnestly  slowfoot is so clever wi the needle he said see she send you a pair of moccasins  the wily man here drew from the breast of his capote a pair of beautifully made moccasins soft as chamois leather and richly ornamented with dyed quills of the porcupine  mckay laughed nevertheless he swallowed the bait and was pleased  he finally handed the goods to la certe who when he had obtained all that he could possibly squeeze out of the storekeeper bundled up the whole made many solemn protestations of gratitude and honest intentions and went off to cheer slowfoot with the news of his success  it chanced that antoine dechamp the very man about whom he had been talking to duncan mckay had dropped in to see him and his spouse and was sitting beside the fire smoking when he entered  displaying his possessions with much pride he assured dechamp that he had paid for the whole outfit and meant to return in the spring a rich man with means enough to buy a horse and cart and start with the buffalohunters for the plains  you have a horse to sellthey say he remarked to his friend in a careless way  yesand a good one too answered dechamp  well if you will loan him to me in the spring i will pay for him when i come back  it takes all i have to fit me out to start you see  dechamp did not quite see his way to thatbut there was plenty of time to think over it  have you heard said dechamp willing to change the subject there is some talk that perrin has been killed  george mcdermid was out like many others huntin about for the starvin people an he came across the wives of blanc and pierrepoor things theyre widows now for blanc and pierre are both dead  well the women had wellnigh given in i had dropped down they were so tired and were crawlin on their hands and knees when mcdermid found them  i didnt hear all the outs and ins of it but there is no doubt that poor perrin has been murdered for he was shot right through the breast  perhaps he shot hisself suggested la certe  nothat could not be for the women have brought his coat which shows that the ball went in at the breast and came straight out at the back if he had shot himself he must have pulled the trigger with his toe an then the ball would have slanted up from his breast to somewhere about his shoulders  it was a saulteaux may be said slowfoot who had been listening with all the eagerness of a gossip  there were no marks of redskins snowshoes about returned dechamp an the tracks were too confused to make them out  a knife was found but there were no marks about it to tell who owned itonly it was a settlers knife but there are lots of them about an many have changed hands since the settlers came  at the time we write of the colony of red river of the north was in a very unhappy and disorganised condition  there were laws indeed but there was no authority or force sufficiently strong to apply the laws and discord reigned because of the two great fur companiesthe hudsons bay and the norwestwhich opposed each other with extreme bitterness carrying firewater dissension and disaster all over the wilderness of ruperts land  happily the two companies coalesced in the year 1821 and from that date onward comparative peace has reigned under the mild sway of the hudsons bay company  but at the period which we describe the coalition had not taken place and many of the functionaries of the hudsons bay company in red river from the governor downward seem to have been entirely demoralised if we are to believe the reports of contemporary historians  some time previous to this the earl of selkirkchiefly from philanthropic views it is saidresolved to send a colony to red river at different times bands of scotch swiss danes and others made their appearance in the settlement  they had been sent out by the agents of the earl but there was a great deal of mismanagement and misunderstanding both as to the motives and intentions of the earl the result was that the halfbreeds of red riverinfluenced it is said by the norwest companyreceived the newcomers with suspicion and illwill  the indians followed the lead of the halfbreeds to whom they were allied  not only was every sort of obstruction thrown in the way of the unfortunate immigrants but more than once during those first years they were driven from the colony and their homesteads were burned to the ground  there must have been more than the usual spirit of indomitable resolution in those people however for notwithstanding all the opposition and hardship they had to endure they returned again and again to their farms rebuilt their dwellings cultivated their fields and so to speak compelled prosperity to smile on themand that too although several times the powers of nature in the shape of grass hoppers and disastrous floods seemed to league with men in seeking their destruction  perhaps the scottish element among the immigrants had much to do with this resolute perseverance  possibly the religious element in the scotch had more to do with it still  the disastrous winter which we have slightly sketched was one of the many troubles with which not only the newcomers but all parties in the colony were at this time afflicted    chapter seven  vixen delivered and wolves defeated  with much labour and skill had the davidsons and mckays erected two timber cottages side by side in the land of their adoption  these two families were among the first band of settlers  they were very different in characterone being highland the other lowland scotch but they were more or less united by sympathy intermarriage and long residence beside each other on the slopes of the grampian hills so that on the voyage out they made a compact that they should stick by each other and strive and work and fight the battle of life together in the new land  all the members of the davidson family were sterling sedate hearty and thoroughgoing  daniel and peter were what men style dependable fellows and bore strong resemblance to their father who died almost immediately after their arrival in the new country  little jessie was like her mother a sort of bottomless well of sympathy into which oceans of joy or sorrow might be poured without causing an overflow except perchance at the eyelidsand out of which the waters of consolation might be pumped for evermore without pumping dry  the idea of self never suggested itself in the presence of these two  the consequence was that everybody adored them  it was rather a selfish adoration we fear nevertheless it was extremely delightfulto the adorers we meanand doubtless not unpleasant to the adored  the love of god in christ was the foundation of their characters  of the mckay family we cannot speak so confidently  elspie indeed was all that could be desired and fergus was in all respects a sterling man but the head of the family was as we have seen open to improvement in many respects and duncan junior was of that heartbreaking character which is known as neerdoweel  possibly if differently treated by his father he might have been a better man  as it was he was unprincipled and hasty of temper  little wonder that when thrown together during a long voyageto an almost unknown landelspie mckay and daniel davidson should fall into that condition which is common to all mankind and less wonder that being a daring youth with a resolute will daniel should manage to induce the pliant loving elspie to plight her troth while they were gazing over the ships side at the first iceberg they met  we may as well hark back here a little and very briefly sketch the incident  it may serve as a guide to others  the two were standingaccording to the report of the bosn who witnessed the whole affairabaft the main shrouds squintin over the weather gangway  we are not quite sure of the exact words used by that discreditable bosn but these are something like them  it was moonlight and dead calm therefore propitious so far to daniels designfor daniel undoubtedly had a design that night obvious to his own mind and clearly defined like the great iceberg though like it too somewhat hazy in detail  what a glorious magnificent object exclaimed elspie gazing in wonder at the berg the pinnacles of which rose considerably above the masthead  yes very glorious very magnificent said daniel gazing into the maidens eyes and utterly regardless of the berg  i wonder how such a huge mass ever manages to melt said elspiefor the human mind even in pretty girls is discursive  i wonder it does not melt at once said dan with pointed emphasis  what do you mean she asked turning her eyes in considerable astonishment from the berg to the man  i mean said he that under the influence of your eyes the iceberg ought to melt straight away  they have melted my heart elspie and that has been an iceberg i find till now  he seized her hand  it had all come on so suddenly that poor elspie was quite unprepared for it  she turned as if to fly but daniel put his arm round her waist and detained her  elspie dearest elspie it must be settled nowor  he would notcould notsay never  o daniel dont entreated elspie  but daniel did  brayvo exclaimed the bosn with enthusiasm for he was a sympathetic man though unprincipled in the matter of eavesdropping  that cut it short  they retired precipitately from the weather gangway abaft the main shrouds and sought refuge in a sequestered nook near the companionhatch which was in name as well as in every other way much more suited to their circumstances  the steersman had his eye on them there but they fortunately did not know it  apologising for this reminiscence we return to the thread of our story  mrs davidson was seated at breakfast one morning with all her family around her in prairie cottage  she had named it thus because from one of the windows there was to be had a peep of the prairies lying beyond the bushes by which it was surrounded  old mckay had named his cottage ben nevis either because the country around was as flat as a pancake or out of sheer contradictiousness  have they found out anything more about the murder of that poor fellow perrin asked mrs davidson  more than four months have passed since it happened  nothing more mother said dan who now filled his fathers chair as you say four months have passed and one would think that was time enough to discover the murderer but you see it is nobodys business in particular and weve no regular police and everybody is far too busy just now to think about it  in fact not many people in these parts care much about a murder i fear  ah if they went to see perrins old mother said jessie it would oblige them to care a great deal for he was her only son  ay her only child added mrs davidson  while she was yet speaking it so happened that duncan mckay junior himself entered the room with that overdone freeandeasiness which sometimes characterises a man who is ill at ease  whose only child are you speaking about mrs davidson he asked carelessly  mrs perrins she replied with a familiar nod to the visitor who often dropped in on them casually in this way  the reply was so unexpected and sudden that mckay could not avoid a slight start and a peculiar expression in spite of his usual selfcommand  he glanced quickly at dan and peter but they were busy with their food and had apparently not noticed the guilty signs  ah poor thing returned the youth in his cynical and somewhat nasal tone it iss hard on her  by the way dan hev ye heard that the wolves hev killed two or three of mcdermids horses that had strayed out on the plains and elspies mare vixen iss out too  some of us will be going to seek for her  the day bein warm an the snow soft we hev a good chance of killin some o the wolves  i thought peter might like to go too  so peter does said the youth rising and brushing the crumbs off his knees theres nothing i like better than to hunt down these sneaking murderous brutes that are so ready to spring suddenly unawares on friend or foe  again duncan mckay cast a quick inquiring glance at peter but the lad was evidently innocent of any double meaning  it was only a movement within the manslayer of that conscience which makes cowards of us all  louise shouted dan as he also rose from the table  oui monsieur came in polite deferential tones from the culinary department and the little halfbreed maiden appeared at the door  did you mend that shotbag last night  oui monsieur  fetch it here then please and jessie stir your stumps like a good girl and get some food ready to take with us  will you tell me the precise way in which good girls stir their stumps asked jessie for im not quite sure  dan answered with a laugh and went out to saddle his horse followed by his brother and duncan mckay  rescuing seems to be the order of the day this year remarked peter as they walked towards the stable behind the cottage  weve had a good deal of rescuing men in the winter and now we are goin to rescue horses  rescuing is the grandest work that a fellow can undertake said dan whether it be the body from death or the soul from sin  what you say iss truewhatever remarked mckay whose speech although not so broad as that of his father was tinged with similar characteristics  it will be better to rescue than to kill  this was so obvious a truism that his companions laughed but duncan had uttered it almost as a soliloquy for he was thinking at the moment of poor perrin whose body had long since been brought to the settlement and buried  indeed thoughts of the murdered man were seldom out of his mind  meanwhile far out on the lonesome and still snowcovered prairie the steed which they were going to rescue stood on a low mound or undulation of the plain surrounded by wolves  it was a pitiful sight to see the noble mare almost wornout with watching and defending herself while the pack of those sneaking hounds of the wilderness sat or stood around her licking their chops and patiently biding their time  they formed a lean gaunt savagelooking crew as they sat there calculating apparently how long their victims strength would hold out and when it would be safe to make a united and cowardly rush  one wolf more gaunt and rugged and grey than the others with black lips and red tongue and bloodshot eyes moved about the circle uneasily as if trying to screw up its craven spirit to the sticking point  the others evidently regarded this one as their leader for they hung back from him a little and kept a watchful eye on his movements  so did vixen the mare  she kept her tail always turned towards him looking savagely back at him with her great eyes glittering her ears laid flat and her heels ready  poor vixen  elspie had given her the name when in a facetious frame of mind as being descriptive of the very opposite of her character for she was gentle as a lamb tender in the mouth playful in her moods and sensitive to a degree both in body and spirit  no curb was ever needed to restrain vixen nor spur to urge her on  a chirp sent an electric thrill through her handsome frame a quiet vic sufficed to calm her to absolute docility  any child could have reined her in and she went with springy elasticity as though her limbs were made of vivified steel and indiarubber  but she was getting old and somehow the wolves seemed to be aware of that melancholy fact  they would not have troubled her in the heyday of her youth  an impatient howl from one of the pack seemed to insinuate that the grey old leader was a coward  so he was but evidently he did not relish being told so for he uncovered his glittering fangs and made a sudden dash at the mare  with a whisk of the tail worthy of her best days she lashed out behind and planted both her pretty little feet on the ribs of the grey chief with such a portentous whack that he succumbed at once  with a gasp and a longdrawn wail he sank dead upon the snow whereupon his amiable friendswhen quite sure of his demisetore him limb from limb and devoured him  this was a fortunate respite for vixen most of whose remaining strength and pluck had been thrown into that magnificent fling  old duncan had he seen it would probably have styled it a goot highland fling  but the respite was not of long duration  their leader formed but a mouthful to each of the pack  when done they returned to encircle their victim again lick their chops and wait  evening was drawing on and a sort of grey desolation seemed to be creeping over the plains  a decided thaw had been operating all that day rendering the snow soft if the mare had only known the advantage thus given to her a successful effort at escape might have been made  when snow on the prairie is frozen with a hard crust on the surface the light wolf can run easily on the top of it while the heavy horse breaks through at every stride and is soon knocked up  the case is reversed when a thaw softens the surface for then the shortlegged wolf flounders helplessly in its depths while the longlimbed and powerful horse can gallop through it with comparative ease  but the good mare intelligent though she was did not consider this fact and the wolves you may be sure did not enlighten her  besides by that time she was wellnigh wornout and could not have made a vigorous run for life even over a good course  gradually a worthy lieutenant of the old grey chief began to show symptoms of impatience and the hungry circle closed in  vixen looked up and whinnied slightly  it seemed a pitiful appeal for help from the human friends who had cared for her so well and so long  perchance it was the last wail of despaira final farewell to the green fields and the flowering plains of memory  whatever it was an answer came in the form of several dark specks on the horizon  vixen saw them and whinnied again in a decidedly different tone  the wolves also saw them and moved about uneasily  on came the black specks increasing in size as they drew near  the wolves looked at each other inquiringly moved still more uneasily appeared to hold a consultation and finally drew off to a neighbouring knoll as if to await the result of this unlookedfor interruption and return to business when it was past  the intelligence of the lower animals is greatin some cases very greatbut it does not amount to reason  if it did those wolves would not have sat there in the pride of physical strength and personal freedom calmly awaiting their doom while daniel and peter davidson duncan mckay junior okematan the cree indian another indian named kateegoose and jacques bourassin a halfbreed came thundering down towards them like infuriated centaurs  at last they seemed to realise the truth that discretion is the better part of valour and began to retire from the sceneslowly at first  vixen recognising friends trotted off with reviving strength and a high head and tail to meet them  seeing this dan who led the party drew rein so as to allow the steeds to recover breath before the final burst  the wolves with that presumption which is usually found to be the handmaid of ignorance halted and sat down again to watch the progress of events  fatal selfconfidence  they little knew the deep duplicity of man  o you stupid brutes murmured dan to himself advancing in a somewhat sidling manner as if he meant to pass them  they evidently believed this to be his intention until they saw the six horsemen turn their steeds straight in their direction and charge them at full gallop with a yell that drove rapid conviction to their brains  then with tails between legs and ears flat they fled  but it was too late  the horses scattered the soft snow with comparative ease  the wolves plunged through it with difficulty  first to overtake them was peter davidson  he put the muzzle of his gun to the side of the grey lieutenant and shot him through the heart  his brother dan selecting another of the pack pointed at the ear and blew out its brains okematan partial to the weapons of his forefathers sent an arrow through the ribs of a third while kateegoose transfixed a fourth duncan mckay shot a fifth and bourassin knocked over a sixth at comparatively long range his horse being too poor or too tired to come fairly up with the pack  there was no wasting of powder shot or shaft in this affair  each man was an expert with his weapon and cool as the proverbial cucumber though considerably excited  loading as they ran they fitted and shot again stretching six more of the enemy on the plain  then they pulled up and suffered the rest to escape being afraid to leave vixen out of sight behind them for that happy creature following and enjoying the sport as long as she could found that her powers were too much exhausted to permit of her keeping up with the chase  shes not fit to travel another mile said dan stroking her glossy neck and allowing her to rub her nose affectionately on his shoulder  that iss true whatever assented duncan  i think we could not do better than camp on the nearest bluff  this was agreed to by all  provision for one meal it will be remembered had been prepared at prairie cottage in the morning  a hunters meal when properly divided makes two or three average meals and a hunters powers of endurance are proverbial  each man had his blanket strapped to his saddle  branches of various kinds of trees make a good mattress and the air of the prairie is wellknown to conduce to appetite and slumber  with such environment it is scarcely necessary to add that the hunters enjoyed themselves and that vixen had a restful night probably without even a dream about hungry wolves    chapter eight  stirring events described  the proverbial slip twixt the cup and the lip and the wellknown uncertainty of all human affairs received striking illustration in the person and prospects of our hero daniel davidson not long after the events narrated in the last chapter  up to this period the unfortunate colonists of the red river settlement had led a life chiefly of disappointment and disaster  although everything had been done for them by their patron the earl of selkirk with the best intentions the carrying out of his plans had been frustrated by the feuds of the rival fur companies the misunderstandings and the jealousies of indians and halfbreeds and to some extent by the severity of the climate  an open rupture took place between them and the northwesters  encounters between the contending parties occurred in which several on both sides were killed and at last the northwesters attacking the settlers in force drove them from the colony and burnt their dwellings and homesteads  retreating to the north end of lake winnipeg the colonists found refuge at jack riverthree hundred miles distant  from this place they were ultimately recalled by the hudsons bay company which took them under its protection  returning to red river the unfortunate but persevering people proceeded to resume their farming operations  but the prospect before them was gloomy enough  the lawless proceedings of the rival companies had convulsed the whole indian country and the evil seemed to culminate in the red river colony to which retired servants of the furtraders voyageurs adventurers and idlers gravitated as to a centre so that there was little prospect of their being allowed to prosecute their agricultural operations in peace  the dissensions at last became so great that a large proportion of the new settlers including many of the scotch highlanders dispersed to seek a precarious livelihood among the indians on the prairies bordering the waters of the missouri or to sustain themselves and their families by fishing in the distant lakes and hunting on their shores  on the advent of spring however most of these returned to the colony with renewed hope in agriculture and set to workevery man woman and childto get some seed into the ground  but at this point an event occurred which threw the colony into great consternation and induced vigorous action on the part of lord selkirk which was the first step towards more peaceful times  the northwest party consisting chiefly of halfbreeds had augmented to upwards of three hundred warriors  it would be more correct perhaps to style them banditti for they had penetrated through every part of ruperts land set law at defiance pillaged and destroyed many of the establishments of their rivals and kept the whole country in a state of ferment and alarm  one band of these men numbering between sixty and seventy advanced upon red river colony  they were a motley crew all mounted on horseback and armed with guns spears tomahawks bows and scalpingknives besides which they were painted and plumed a la sauvage and were in the habit when rushing to battle of yelling like the redmen whose blood mingled with that of the whiteman in their veins  what was the precise intention of these men at this time it is difficult to say but it was not difficult to see that peace was not their object  governor semple of the hudsons bay company a mild just and much respected man was in charge of the colony at the time  daniel davidson was engaged in a very important conversation with old duncan mckay at the time the formidable troop of northwesters swept through the settlements  the old man was seated in the hall parlour drawingroomor whatever you choose to call itof ben nevis house  it was an uncarpeted unpainted unadorned room with pine plank flooring plank walls a plank ceiling a plank table and a set of plank chairs ornament was dispensed with in the hall of ben nevis house for although elspie would fain have clothed it with a little feminine grace its proprietor would not hear of such proposals  stick as many gimcracks as you like about your own room elspie he had remarked when the first attempt was made but leave me my hall in peace  it iss quite pleased with it i am as it iss  opposite the door of the hall there was a large open fireplace without a grate  doors all round the walls of the hall opened into the other rooms of the establishment  above what would have been the mantelpiece had one existed there was a row of tobacco pipes  old duncan was a great smoker  indeed he would have been almost unrecognisable without his pipe  he was smoking when daniel davidson visited him in order to hold the very important conversation to which we have referred  it iss as you say taniel remarked the old man frowning at his pipe which was not drawing properly  marrit life iss more to be desired than single blessedness whatever an it is a my opeenion that you will do more work with elspie helpin you than by yourself  when iss it you will be wantin to call me your father  the old man asked the question with a somewhat humorous smile for he was to say truth not a little proud of the staid sensible and strong young fellow who aspired to his daughters handbesides the pipe was drawing well by that time  as soon as you like answered dan or rather as soon as elspie likes  you see things are beginning to look a little more hopeful now people who seem to know bestor seem to think they dotell us that the norwesters are beginning to see that a colony here wont interfere in any way with their business a good deal of seed has been sown and if all goes well we may look for a better year than we have yet had therefore i dont see why we should wait any longer  your observations are ferry true  there iss just wan little word you mention that requires consideration returned the old man with a brow wrinkled so as to suggest profound sagacity of thought  you said if all goes well  but supposin for the sake of argument that all does not go wellwhat then  why then answered the young man with a laugh we shall be no worse off than other people who have to make the best of things as they find them  no doubtno doubtthat iss the true an pheelosophical way to look at the matter  but dont you think taniel that it would be as well to putt off till our munister arrives  i would not be havin my daughter marrit without a munister if i can help it  an you know his lordship has promised more than wance to send us wan  he will not be long o coming now  yes a minister has been promised again an again returned dan somewhat bitterly an i suppose he will go on promising again and over again but i have not much faith in these promises  the earl has too many agents who are not as true as himself  i would rather not delay my marriage on that account  what ails you at mr sutherland  well taniel i hev nothing to say against muster sutherland  he iss a ferry goot mani will not be denyin that buthe iss not an ordained munister  what of that retorted dan  he is an ordained elder of the church of scotland and that is much the same thing  and he is a good christian man respected by every one in the settlement  well well taniel hev it your own way returned old duncan with a resigned look  of course it would have been pleesanter if he had been a regular munister whatever but as you say my boy what of that so as things look a little more peaceable than they wassthough not ferry muchi will be  he was interrupted at this point by the sudden entrance of jacques bourassin with the astounding intelligence that a band of northwesters had gone up the settlement to attack fort garry  hoot nonsense man exclaimed old mckay starting up and flinging his pipe away in the excitement of the moment  nonot nonsense said bourassin in broken english it be true  i knows it  i come to say that we go to the fort to help them  right boy right exclaimed the old man hastily belting on his capote  fergus  tuncanelspie where are these boys  in the stable father  i saw them just  let them saddle all the nagsquick cried the old man  taniel you better  he stopped for daniel had already run out to saddle and mount his own horse  in a few minutes a cavalcade of a dozen powerful young fellows headed by old duncan mckay and armed with guns were galloping at full speed in the direction of fort garry  but before this cavalcade had set out the rencontre at the fort had already taken place and been fatally decided  the approach of the enemy had been announced to those nearest the scene of action by the women and children of that part of the settlement who were seen running about in frantic alarm trying to hide themselves and some of them seeking refuge in the fort  among these were two brothers named sinclair  one of them archie by name was a stout healthy fellow of twelve or thereabouts the other was a thin delicate boy of ten whose illness whatever it was had reduced him to skin and bone taken all the colour out of his cheeks and rendered him quite unable to run or play like other boys  they had recently become orphans their father and mother who were among the most recent arrivals having died suddenly within a few weeks of each other  when the alarm of the threatened attack was given the brothers were amusing themselves on the sunny side of the cottage which had been for only one year their happy home  in a moment archie took his brother on his back and scampered away with him to a place near the river and hid him in a hollow under the bank where they had been wont to play at grizzly bears and hunters  meanwhile governor semple with several gentlemen and attendants walked out to meet the party of halfbreeds and indians not to offer battle but for the purpose of parlance and conciliation  it is admitted however that governor semple committed a grave error of judgment in allowing his small party to carry arms  they numbered only twentyeight in all and being untrained could have had no chance in an open fight with such opponents  if the governor had gone out unarmed with only one or two attendants he would it was thought have appealed irresistibly to the honour of the party  as it was when the hudsons bay party drew near they thought the look of their opponents so suspicious that the governor halted his men and they stood in a group as if in consultation  seeing this the halfbreeds divided themselves into two bodies and commenced firing from behind some willowsat first a shot or two and then a merciless volley  no fewer than twentyone of the twentyeight fell to rise no more among whom were the governor himself mr wilkinson his secretary captain rogers a mineralogist mr white the surgeon mr holt of the swedish navy and mr mclean a principal settler  indeed the whole party would have probably been killed and the settlers massacred at that time but for the courageous interposition of the chief of the halfbreeds cuthbert grant who at the risk of his life stood between the settlers and their foes only one of which last was killed  when old mckay and his party drew near to the scene the massacre was completed and most of his little bandwhich had been slightly augmented on the way upturned rightabout and rode away to defend their respective homes  but the warrior spirit of old mckay and his sons had been roused  they refused to turn tail and in company with dan and peter davidson made a furious charge into a detached party of the halfbreeds which they chanced to encounter  they scattered them like sheep though they did not succeed in killing any  then they also wheeled round and galloped back to their respective homes  come elspie tear said the old man as he dismounted putt what ye value most in your pocket an come away  the duvles are down on us and we are not able to hold out in ben nevis  the settlers must choin altogether an do the best we can to defend ourselves  while he was speaking the highlander was busy stuffing some of the smaller of his household goods into his pocketsamongst them a large quantity of tobacco  meanwhile fergus hastened to the stable to saddle vixen for elspie while the poor girl ran to her room and secured some small objects which she valuedamong them a miniature portrait of her mother and a bible which the good lady had given to her a short time before her death there was no money and no valuable documents had to be looked after so that preparations for fight were soon completed  now there was a member of old duncan mckays household who has not yet been introduced to the reader but whose character and influence in the household were such as to demand special notice  this member was an old woman named peg  probably this was an abbreviation of peggy but we cannot tell  neither can we say what her surname was for we never heard it and no one spoke of the old creature by any other name than that of old peg  although old peg was by no means feebleindeed judged by her capacities she might have been pronounced middleaged for she could walk about the house all day actively engaged in miscellaneous selfimposed duties and could also eat like a man and sleep like a dormouseshe was nevertheless withered and wrinkled and grey and small  her exact age nobody knewand for the matter of that nobody seemed to care  extreme amiability and selfobliteration were the chief characteristics of old peg  she was silent by nature and deaf as a postwhether by art or nature we know not probably both  well noon second thoughts not quite as deaf as a post for by means of severe shouting she could be made to hear  smiles and nods however were her chief means of communication with the outer world  when these failed a yell might be tried with advantage  no one of the mckay household ever thought of giving old peg anything in the shape of work to do for the very good reason that being an extremely willing horse she was always working and she possessed a peculiar faculty of observation which enabled her to perceive long before any one else what ought to be done and the right time to do it so that when any one bounced round with the sudden intention of telling her to do anything old peg was found to have done it already or to be in the act of doing it  it is almost superfluous to say that she patched and mended the household garments washed the most of things washable sewed the sewable darned the sock and generally didup the whole mckay family  when not engaged in definite or specific work she had a chronic sockknitting which helped to fill up and round off the corners of her leisure hours  old peg had been the nurse consecutively of fergus elspie and duncan junior  she was now equivalent to their second mother having nursed their first mother to the end with faithful untiring affection and received from the dying woman a solemn commission never to forsake duncan senior or his progeny  no sentiment of a religious nature ever escaped old peg but it was observed that she read her bible regularly and was occasionally found asleep on her kneesgreatly to the amusement of that irritable old rascal duncan senior and to the gratification of elspie who came to the conclusion that the old woman must have learned well off by heart such words aswhatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might  do good to all men as thy hand findeth opportunity  be clothed with humility  trust in the lord at all times  probably elspie was right for she judged of people in the oldfashioned way namely by their fruits  her judgment of the two duncans on this principle by the way could not have been very exalted but we cannot tell  she was much too loyal and loving a daughter and sister to give any sign or opinion  at the time of the sudden call to flight just described the mckay family had totally forgotten old peg in their hurry  elspie was the first to miss her  old peg she exclaimedalmost screamedwhile fergus was assisting her to mount vixen where is she  ill find her said fergus and bring her on in the cart  you be off after father  weve no time to lose  be sure you bring her fergus said elspie  all right no fear  thus assured elspie was about to gallop away after her fatherwho had started in advance to overtake and stop the prairie cottage family so that they might travel in one bandwhen the clatter of hoofs was heard and next moment dan davidson galloped round the corner of the house  i came back for you elspie he said pulling up  why did you not come on with your father  i expected to overtake him dan  you know vixen is swift  besides i missed old peg and delayed a few minutes on her account  is she with your party  noat least i did not see her  but she may have been in the cart with louise  shall i look for her while you gallop on  no fergus has promised to find and bring her after us  come i am ready  the two galloped away  as they did so young duncan issued from the stable behind the house leading out his horse  he was in no hurry having a good mount  at the same time fergus came out at the backdoor of the house shouting old peg  hallo old woman where are ye  hev ye seen her duncan he asked impatiently  it iss seekin high an low i hev been an it iss of no use shoutin for she hears nothin  im sure i saw her in the cart wi the davidsons said duncan  are you sure asked fergus  weel i did not pass quite close to them as i ran up here for my horse on hearin the news replied duncan but i am pretty sure that i saw her sittin beside louise  hm that accoonts for her not being here said fergus running into the stable  hold on a bit duncan  ill go with ye in a meenit  in the circumstances he was not long about saddling his horse  a few minutes more and the brothers were galloping after their friends who had got a considerable distance in advance of them by that time and they did not overtake them till a part of the settlement was reached where a strong muster of the settlers was taking place and where it was resolved to make a stand and face the foe  here it was discovered to the consternation of the mckay family that old peg was not with the davidson party and that therefore she must have been left behind  she must be found and rescued exclaimed elspie on making the discovery  she must echoed dan davidson who will go back with me  a dozen stout young fellows at once rode to the front and old mckay offered to take command of them but was overruled and left behind    chapter nine  old peg  meanwhile accustomed to think and act for herself old peg on the first alarm had made up her mind to do her fair share of work quietly  she did not require to be told that danger threatened the family and that flight had been resolved on  a shout from some one that norwesters were coming coupled with the hasty preparations might have enlightened a mind much less intelligent than that of the old woman  she knew that she could do nothing to help where smart bodily exercise was needed but down by the creek close by there was a small stable in which a sedate lumbering old carthorse dwelt  the horse she felt sure would be wanted  she could not harness it but she could put a bridle on it and lead it up to the house  this animal which was named elephant on account of its size had been totally forgotten by the family in the hurry of departure  old peg found the putting of a bridle on the huge creature more difficult work than she had expected and only succeeded at last by dint of perseverance standing on three or four bundles of hay and much coaxingfor the creature had evidently taken it into its head that the old woman had come there to fondle itperhaps to feed it with sugar after the manner of elspie  she managed the thing at last however and led the horse up towards the house  now while she had been thus engaged the family had left and the halfbreedshaving combined their forceshad arrived  ben nevis was the first house the scoundrels came to  dismounting and finding the place deserted they helped themselves to whatever was attractive and portableespecially to a large quantity of canada twist tobacco which old duncan had found it impossible to carry away  then they applied fire to the mansion and in a wonderfully short time ben nevis was reduced to a level with the plain  another party treated prairie cottage in a similar manner  it was when the first volume of black smoke rose into the sky that old peg came to the edge of the bushes that fringed the creek and discovered that ben nevis had suddenly become volcanic  she instantly became fully aware of the state of matters and rightly judged that the family must have escaped else there would have been some evidence of resistance  fortunately the old woman had not yet passed quite from the shelter of the bushes  she drew back with a degree of caution worthy of a redskin leading the horse with her  when well out of sight she paused for the purpose of meditation  what was now to be done  as we have said she possessed decision of character in an eminent degree  she never at any time had taken long to make up her mind she was not going to begin now though the position was probably the most perplexing that she had ever experienced  suddenly she raised her head and laughed  in the circumstances it would not have been surprising had hysteria seized old peg but there was nothing hysterical in her nature  calm cool calculating courage dominated her every thought and feeling but the idea of what she was driven to in her old age had tickled her fancy leading the big carthorse close up to a bank she prepared to mount himhaving previously broken off a good strong switch from a neighbouring bush  never before in her life had peg mounted a steed of any kind whatever she knew the ladys position on horseback by sight of course but not by practice  to attempt it even with a sidesaddle would have been impossible but elephant was barebacked  fortunately he was fat and broad and without a visible backbone  old peg at once made up her mind and climbing the bank scrambled on his back in gentlemans position  it was more comfortable than she had dared to hope  but now an unexpected difficulty met her  elephant declined to move she pulled at his bridle and he turned sluggishly but he would not advance  peg administered a sounding whack with the switch  she might as well have hit a neighbouring tree  elephants hide was like that of his namesake and he had no feelings to speak of that could be touched or hurt or worked upon  in this dilemma the old woman had recourse to a weapon with which her broad bosom was at all times furnished  she drew a large pin and drove the point into elephants flank  the result was instantaneous  up went his hindquarters and peg found herself sprawling on his bushy mane she held on to that however and gradually working her way back regained her old positionthankful that she had not been thrown to the ground  another result was that elephant condescended to walk  but this was not enough  escape at such a pace was impossible  old peg prodded him againthis time on the shoulder for she rightly conjectured that he could not well kick up with his forelegs  but he might rear  the thought caused her to grasp the bushy mane with both hands and hold on he did not rear but he trotted and poor old peg came to the conclusion that there were disagreeable novelties in life even for her  when elephant at length burst out of the fringe of wood and gained the track that followed the course of the river she was immediately seen by the plunderers who laughed at the strange rider but did not follow her with the exception of one manan indian painted and featheredwho started in pursuit hoping possibly for an easy scalp  he soon came close up and being armed with a bow sent an arrow in advance of him  the shaft was well aimed  it grazed the flank of elephant inflicting a painful wound  this woke up the old horse surprisingly so that it not only broke into a gallop but set off at racing speed as it used to do when young  the indian was badly mounted and gradually lost ground whereupon he sent after the fugitives several more arrows which all fell wide of the mark  the change to old peg was as a reprieve from death  the trot had almost dislocated her bones and shaken her up like an addled egg and the change to racing speed afforded infinite relief  she could scarcely credit her senses and she felt a tendency to laugh again as she glanced over her shoulder  but that glance removed the tendency for it revealed the indian warrior in all his paint and feathers and streaming scalplocks in hot pursuit while the whiz of another arrow close past her ear convinced our heroine that it was not a dream  the jolting to which the poor old creature was subjected had disturbed her costume not a little  her shawl came nearly off and holding on by one pin fluttered like a flag of defiance  her slippers which were of the carpet pattern were left behind on the prairie to perplex the wolves and her voluminous haironce a rich auburn but now a pearly greyhaving escaped its cap and fastenings was streaming out gaily in the breeze as if to tempt the fingers and knife of the pursuer  a sternchase is a long one whether ashore or afloat  pursuer and pursued went rapidly down the settlement until they came in sight of the band which had come to rescue peg  they received her with a wild cheer of surprise and joy which turned the redskin to the rightabout and sent him back to his friends much faster than he had come  on receiving his report the halfbreeds at once dashed off in pursuit of the settlers and did not draw rein until they reached the place where the scotchmen had made a stand  the latter were greatly outnumbered at least in fighting men but they showed such a resolute front that cuthbert grant the halfbreed leader again interfered to prevent bloodshed if possible  after calming his men and advising forbearance he turned to duncan mckay senior who was the settlers spokesman and said  if you will go peaceably away out of the colony we will spare you but if you show fight your blood be on your own heads for i cannot restrain my men much longer  iss it sparin us you will be talkin of cuthbert grant answered the highlander with scorn  wow but if it wass not for the weemen an children thats with us you would hev a goot chance o bein in need o sparin yoursels an it iss not much o the blood o the grants either thats in your veins or ye would scorn to consort wi such fireraisin cutthroats  it iss the fortune of warwhatever and we cant affoord to leave our weemen an bairns defenceless  so we accept your terms if we are not hindered from carryin away our arms  carry away whatever you like replied grant quietly only be off at once or ill not answer for the consequences  thus the angry highlander was dismissed and in the end the unfortunate settlers being a second time driven into exile took refuge as before at jack river    chapter ten  archie and little bill do wonders  we change the scene now to the margin of a small lake embosomed like a gem in the great wilderness of the far north  it is autumn  the sun is bright the air is calm and clear  there is a species of warm haze which paradoxically does not seem to interfere with the clearness and a faint zephyr which appears rather to emphasise than break the calm  it sends a soft catspaw now and then across parts of the lake and thus by contrast brings into greater prominence the bright reflection of trees and cloudland mirrored in its depths instead of being the proverbial dead calm it is if we may so put it rather a lively cheerful calm  the liveliness of it is vastly increased by hundreds of waterfowl which disport themselves on the surface of the lake as if coquetting with their own reflections or whistle round its margin while busy on the feedinggrounds  myriads of mosquitoes were wont there to murmur their maddening career in search of blood but happily at the period we write of an incidental and premonitory nightfrost had relegated these to the graves of their forefathers or to the mansions of hibernawe know not and care not which  we have styled the lake a little one but we must remind the reader that we use the expression in an american sense and that where lakes are two and three hundred miles long a little one can well afford to be twenty or thirty miles in diameter with perchance a boundless horizon  the lake in question however was really a little onenot more than two miles in length or breadth with the opposite shore quite visible and a number of islets of various sizes on its bosomall more or less wooded and all more rather than less the temporary homes of innumerable wildfowl among which were noisy little gulls with pure white bodies and bright red legs and bills  on the morning in questionfor the sun was not yet much above the horizona little birchbark canoe might have been seen to glide noiselessly from a bed of rushes and proceed quietly yet swiftly along the outer margin of the bed  the bowpaddle was wielded by a stout boy with fair curly hair  another boy of gentle mien and sickly aspect sat in the stern and steered  little bill said the stout boy in a low voice youre too light this will never do  archie returned the other with a languid smile i cant help it you knowat least not in a hurry  in course of time if i eat frightfully i may grow heavier but just now theres no remedy except the old one of a stone  thats true little bill responded archie with a perplexed look as he glanced inquiringly along the shore nevertheless if thought could make you heavier youd soon be all right for youre a powerful thinker  the old remedy you see is not available for this side of the lake is low and swampy  i dont see a single stone anywhere  never mind get along well come to one soon i dare say said the other dipping his paddle more briskly over the side  the point which troubled archie sinclair was the difference in weight between himself and his invalid brother which as he occupied the bow resulted in the stern of the light craft being raised much too high out of the water  of course this could have been remedied by their changing places but that would have thrown the heavier work of the bowpaddle on the invalid who happened also to be the better steersman of the two  a large stone placed in the stern would have been a simple and effective remedy but as we have seen no large stone was procurable just then  it didnt much matter in the clumsy wooden things at red river said archie but this eggshell of okematans is very different  ho theres one at last he continued with animation as they rounded a point of land and opened up a small bay on the margin of which there were plenty of pebbles and some large waterworn stones  one of these having been placed in the stern of the canoe and the balance thus rectified the voyage was continued  dont you think that breakfast on one of these islets would be nice said billie  just the very thing that was in my mind little bill answered his brother  it was a curious peculiarity in this sturdy youth that whatever his invalid brother wished he immediately wished also  similarly when billie didnt desire anything archie did not desire it  in short billies opinion was archies opinion and billies will was archies law  not that archie had no will or opinion of his own  on the contrary he was quite sufficiently gifted in that way but his love and profound pity for the poor and almost helpless invalid were such that in regard to him he had sunk his own will entirely  as to opinionswell he did differ from him occasionally but he did it mildly and with an openness to conviction which was almost enviable  he called him bill billie or little bill according to fancy at the moment  poor boys  the sudden death of both parents had been a terrible blow to them and had intensified the tenderness with which the elder had constituted himself the guardian of the younger  when the scotch settlers were banished from the colony pity as well as friendship for their deceased parents induced the davidson family to adopt the boys and now in exile they were out hunting by themselves to aid in replenishing the general store of provisions  it need scarcely be said that at this period of the year the exiled colonists were not subjected to severe hardships for the air was alive with wildfowl returning south from their breedinggrounds and the rivers and lakes were swarming with fish many of them of excellent quality  this will dowont it said archie pointing with his paddle to an islet about a hundred yards in diameter  yes famously responded little bill as he steered towards a shelving rock which formed a convenient landingplace  the trees and shrubs covered the islet to the waters edge with dense foliage that glowed with all the gorgeous colouring for which north american woods in autumn are celebrated  an open grassy space just beyond the landingplace seemed to have been formed by nature for the express purpose of accommodating picnic parties  nothing could have been better said archie drawing up the bow of the canoe and stooping to lift his brother out  i think ill try to walkits such a short bit said billie  dye think so well ive no doubt you can do it little bill for youve got a brave spirit of your own but theres a wet bit o moss youll have to cross which you maynt have noticed  would you like to be lifted over that and so keep your moccasins dry  archie youre a humbug  youre always trying to make me give you needless trouble  well have it your own way little bill  ill help you to walk up  no carry me said billie stretching out his arms ive changed my mind  i will if you prefer it little bill said archie lifting his brother in his strong arms and setting him down on the convenient spot before referred to  billie was not altogether helpless  he could stand on his weak legs and even walk a little without support but to tramp through the woods or clamber up a hill was to him an absolute impossibility  he had to content himself with enjoyments of a milder type  and to do him justice he seemed to have no difficulty in doing so  perhaps he owed it to his mother who had been a singularly contented woman and had taught billie from his earliest years the truth that contentment with godliness is great gain  billie did not announce his belief in this truth but he proclaimed it unwittingly by the more powerful force of example  breakfast is a pleasant meal at any time if the operator be hungry but who shall describe the delights of breakfast when eaten in company with several thousand wildfowl in a romantic wilderness with fresh air laden with the perfumes of the vegetable kingdom encircling the person the glorious sunshine dazzling the eyes the sweet songs of animated nature thrilling the ears and the gentle solicitations of an expectant appetite craving within  words are wasted in such an effort  we feel constrained to leave itas we have not seldom left many a thing before nowto the readers more or less vivid imagination  a blazing fire of pinelogs boiled two tin kettles and roasted two fat wildducks  in one of the kettles archie compounded and stirred robbibooof which perhaps the less said the better  in the other billie infused a small quantity of tea  the roasting duckssplit open impaled on sticks and set up before the firelooked after themselves till they began to burn when they were turned by archie and again neglected for a few minutes  it was a glorious meal in all respects and even billie whose appetite was moderately strong enjoyed it immenselynone the less that he had asked a blessing on it before beginning and all the more that he sympathised fully with his brother in his possession of an amazinga shamelessly robustcapacity for food  now well go to work remarked archie wiping his mouth with a sigh of contentment he had nothing else to wipe it with after finishing the last spoonful of robbiboo the last limb of duck and the last mug of tea  such a remark at such a period in the entertainment caused billie to laugh  why archie youve been at work this halfhour and theres nothing left to go to work upon now  you know quite well little bill that i refer to the days work what is it to be  provisions must be got if the camp is not to starve and you and i are bound to do our share  shall we go to willow point and shoot ducks and geese or cross the lake and trawl for fish  both answered the invalid with decision  well do both  we will paddle to willow point and try for jackfish on the way  just sothe very thing little bill  are you ready to start  billie professed himself quite ready  archie took him on his back replaced him in the stern of the canoe in company with the big stone and then stepped gently into his own place at the bow where a common trading gun with the oldfashioned flint lock and single barrel rested against the gunwale  pushing off they soon left breakfastisle far behind them and crept swiftly along by the margin of the reeds  on the way billie cast out his fishingline  it was a strong codline with a great codhook attached and a lump of fat pork on it for archie in the fervour of hope coupled with piscatorial ignorance and a sanguine disposition had strongly advised his brother to err if err he must on the safe side and be prepared for anything from a great lakeserpent to a freshwater whale  no civilised fish would have deigned to give a second thought to the obvious deception which a mass of indigestible pork presented but fish of the backwoodsespecially in the early years of this centurywere not suspicious  an enormous pike or jackfish coveted that bait and took it  not only so but it took the great codhook and ten inches of the line besides  a shout such as billie had not uttered for many months announced the fact  hi hold on archie  back water  i say id believe i had hanked the bottom if it didnt tug in such a lively way  pay out line little bill cried the other looking over his shoulder with blazing eyes but unable to render any assistance owing to the small size and crank nature of the canoe  stay ill turn about and become steersman while you play thewhew  its a whale  i sayease off  ease off cried billie in desperation how can i ease off with only a few yards o the line left  pitch the reel back to me then  ill manage it cried archie who had converted the bow of the canoe into the sternboth ends being alikeby the simple process of turning himself round and sitting with his face towards his brother  what archie had styled the reel was simply a piece of stick with the line wound round it  his brother pitched it to him with one hand while the desperate jerking of the otherindeed of his whole bodytold at once of the size and the impatience of the fish  unwinding the line in haste archie fastened the extreme end of it to two spare paddles and flung them overboard  now little bill he said you may let him have his head and if you cant hold on without risking the line just let it go  as he spoke the captive made another rushnot very frantic indeed for the pike is a sluggish creature in all watersbut with a steady persistency that meant resolution of purpose  in a few seconds our invalid was compelled to let go and the line tightening the paddles disappeared with a jerk  soon after they reappeared and the boys paddled towards them with a cheer picked them up and the battle was renewed  it would be tedious to recount all the incidents of that fight  we can only say that after a struggle that lasted an houraccording to the younger brother two hours and a half according to the eldera pike of about four feet in length was hauled into the canoe  thats enough of fishing for one day remarked billie wiping his heated brow  quite enough assented the other shall we make for willow point now little bill  yes  we will try the shooting now  in accordance with this plan the direction of the canoe was changed and early in the afternoon the young hunters found themselves alongside of a low point of rocks which stretched well out into the lake leaving a deep bay on either side  the extreme end of the point consisted of naked rock but the greater part of it was covered with a dense undergrowth of low willow bushes  here they disembarked and archie as before carried his brother to the highest part of the low point where a piece of green sward free from bushes formed an attractive restingplace  sit there now billie till i get some brush an make yourself useful by cutting out goose heads  see here are some branches o the right sort ready to hand  no doubt some redskins have been at work here before us  he picked up some pieces of wood which nature had formed more or less to resemble the heads and necks of geese  by a very slight use of the knife billie converted these into excellent portraits  when he had finished halfadozen of them his brother had cut and brought to the spot a number of bushy branches about two or three feet high  these were soon stuck into the ground in a small circle so as to resemble a growing bush behind or rather in the midst of which they could effectually conceal themselves by crouching  while this was being constructed the elder brother went down to the edge of the water and made halfadozen mudheaps well within gunshot which when the artificial heads and necks were attached to them formed such exact counterparts of geese that the wild birds might well be excused for mistaking them for friends  indeed tyros at this work have been known to fire at such decoys believing them to be genuine birds  even while they were thus engaged one and another flock of ducks and geese passed them on their way to warmer climes of course sheering off as they passed  but when the arrangement was completed and the two boys crouching low gazed at the horizon with eager looks the wild birds no longer avoided the spot  on the contrary seeing the decoys they rather inclined to pass close to the place  in flying down a river or along the margin of a lake wild birds may diverge a little to follow the sinuosities of bank or shore but they will not get out of the way of a projecting promontory they rather make a short cut by crossing over it  the young hunters had not to wait long  theres a flock of geese coming said archie in a whisper though the birds were at the moment some miles away  take the first shot little bill  they had only one gun between them  i dont like to said billie that thing gave me such an awful kick last time and i cant stand it now  o theres no fear i put in only a small charge of powderandshot on purpose  it wont kick hard this time  try  well ill try said billie taking the gun  aim well in advance bill  they fly fast and primin gets damp sometimes  a flock of small geese was approaching  the boys became dumb but they had remarkably speaking eyes  animated by curiosity the flock descended to observe the decoys  how often that feeling of curiosity has proved fatalnot only to feathered geese  little bill raised his gun  puff went the priming  bang went the charge  one of the birds describing a beautiful curve fell with bursting violence on the ground  well done billie cried his brother enthusiastically as he leaped over the sheltering brush and ran to secure the prize  a few like that will give a supper to the whole camp  now then he added on returning youll try again  no archie  its your turn nowand the thing did give me a tremendous kick  but i will put in still less powder this time little bill and less shot too so youll have to be careful of your aim  see theres another flock comingthere take it and down with you  i do believe they are big fellows  thus encouraged billie took the gun and crouched low  his brother was right  it was a flock of the great grey geese of canada which now approached  the hearts of both boys beat high for they were not only actuated by what is termed the sporting tendency but by the desire to contribute their fair share to the general larder of their friends who were encamped a considerable distance off at the other end of the lake  okematan will open his eyes if we take back a goose or two like these why they are swans almost whispered archie as the birds approached in the form of an angle  take the big fat one on the leftthe one now squintin down at the decoys  billie obeyed and fired  the result was in a manner threefold first the boys aim was so good that the big fat fellow dropped like a stone not three yards from their position  second the hitherto silent and symmetrically arranged flock went into dire confusion and sheered off in trumpeting convulsions and third a scattering shot having found its billet in the head of another goose immediately behind the first one caused it to plunge right into the camp straight for the head of little bill  archie ignorant of this was in the very act of leaping over the brush to secure the first goose and had fortunately got in front of his brother at the right moment when the second goose caught him on the shoulder and knocked him into the poor invalids arms  he was stunned at first and rose in a few moments in some degree of mental confusion but he was not much the worse for the accident and greatly rejoiced at his fortunate escape as well as the splendid shooting of little bill  it must not be supposed that the brothers continued to shoot at this rate  comparatively few flocks of geese passed over willow point that day but numerous flocks of wildducks did and before evening had put an end to their work they had secured a fair canoeload of game  that night they lighted their campfire among the neighbouring willows feasted luxuriously on part of the days hunt lay down side by side under one blanket with the upturned canoe partially covering them dreamed at first of okematan gazing in wonder at their load and afterwards of being knocked head over heels by an enormous grey goose whose persistent pugnacity was only equalled by its strange incapacity to achieve its murderous ends  ultimately oblivion came to their rescue and the young hunters fell into a dreamless slumber with the smoking campfire sending an occasional gleam of ruddy light on their recumbent forms and the dark sky with its hosts of twinkling stars serving for a gorgeous canopy    chapter eleven  shows some of the troubles of pioneer colonists  okematan was not the only person who opened his eyes on the return of the sinclair boys to camp next day with their heavily laden canoe  the davidson and mckay families were much more emphatic in their astonishment for the boys they knew had not hitherto performed any exploits in shooting  they had not supposed them gifted with even ordinary powers as sportsmen and had imagined that the poor invalid little bill was utterly helpless  on the other hand okematan was not unacquainted with the sudden rise to unexpected celebrity of indian boys in his tribe and knew something about the capacity of even cripples to overcome difficulties when driven by that stern taskmaster necessity  the abundant supply of provisions thus unexpectedly received was very acceptable because during the day on which the boys were absent a fresh band of immigrants had arrived on their way to red river and one party of these hailing from switzerland had come on to the little lake where our scotch friends were encamped for the purpose of consulting as to their future movementsfor it was evident that it would be dangerous as well as useless for them to proceed to red river in the existing state of affairs  the leader of the party was a fairhaired youth who could speak english very well  the scotch families were having their midday meal around the campfires when the switzers arrived and introduced themselves  of course they were made heartily welcome by mr sutherland who acted as spokesman for his countrymen  we are unfortunate said the leader of the new arrivals whose name was andre morel  we hoped that the severe climate would be our only foe to fight withespecially in a land where the people are so few  sutherlandwhose sedate and quiet manner was consistent with his position as an elder and spiritual guide of his countrymen at that timesmiled gravely shook his head and stroked his chin  you will find he said that whatever part of this world you go to the passions of man are always more deadly in their consequences than surroundings or climates or anything else  hm what you say iss ferry true remarked old mckay who was busy picking the drumstick of a wildgoose at the moment  if it wass not for the jealousy an illwill o the northwesters we should hev been at this goot hour in our comfortable houses amang the green fields of rud ruver  wheesht faither interposed duncan junior mr sutherland wass speakin an yeve stoppit him  an what if i hev tuncan  can he not continoo to speak when i hev done retorted the old man resuming his drumstick  you are right mr mckay said the elder  but for the unfortunate jealousies of the two companies we might have been in very different circumstances today  if the northwesters could only see that the establishment of a colony in red river would in no way hinder the furtrade we could all get along peaceably enough together  but it seems to have been ordained that man shall reach every good thing through much tribulation  i do not agree wi you at all muster sutherland said old mckay there iss many of rich people in this world who hev all that hert can wush an are born to it without hevin any treebulation at all  but i did not say all that heart could wish mr mckay  i said every good thing  well an iss not wealth a goot thing muster sutherland  only if gods blessing goes along with it returned the elder  if it does not wealth is a curse  hm  i wush i had a little more o that cursewhatever answered the irreverent old man  besides continued sutherland not noticing the remark the rich are by no means exempt from tribulation  they are sometimes afflicted with bad children not infrequently with bad health which doctors at two or three guineas a visit cannot cure and many of them are much troubled with poverty  you are talking in ruddles now muster sutherland said old duncan who having finished the drumstick and its duplicate was preparing his pipe for action  it is not much of a riddle mr mckay  i suppose you consider a man with ten thousand a year rich and a man with two hundred poor  well yes i wull not be denyin that  wellif the rich man spends ten thousand and fifty pounds a year and never has anything to spare or to lay by is he not miserably poorpoor in spirit as well as in purse  for at the end of the year his purse is empty and he is in debt  on the other hand if the man with two hundred a year spends one hundred and fifty gives away twenty and lays by thirty every year is he not rich  ferry true muster sutherland said mckay with a peculiar smile as he emitted his first whiff  i wull not be arguin wi you for you always get the best of it  nevertheless it is my opeenion that weve had treebulation enough in rud ruver since we came oot an i would be ferry gled of a luttle prosperity nowif only by way of a pleesant change  recurring to this subject a few days later young morel asked dan davidson while they were paddling back to camp together one evening with the proceeds of a days hunt has your life in the colony since the beginning been as bad as old mckay made it out the other day  well making due allowance for the old mans use of strong language his account of matters has not been much overdrawn answered dan who in virtue of his superior canoecraft acted the part of steersman you see when we came out here we expected like you that all would be plain sailing except as regarded climate and ordinary difficulties but our eyes were soon opened to the true state of things  instead of the wilderness with a few peaceful inhabitants living under the mild sway of the hudson bay company we found another company apparently as strong as the hudsons bay one in violent opposition  they regarded our coming as likely to ruin their trade for lord selkirk was a share holder in the hudsons bay company and it was supposed his object in planting the colony was to advance his scheme of monopolising the whole furtrade of the far west  i cannot myself see how this colony could injure the furtrade but anyhow i know that the opposition has affected the colonists very severely for we have been deceived by the contending parties and misled and delayed or thwarted in all our operations  at the very outset on our arrival a band of the norwesters composed of halfbreeds and indians warned us that our presence was unwelcome and tried to frighten us away by their accounts of the savage nature of the natives  then the fear of perishing for want of food induced a lot of us to take their advice leave the farms allotted to us and go to a place called pembina about seventy miles distant from the colony there to spend the long and hard winter in tents according to the indian fashion and live on the produce of the chase  i should have thought that was a pleasant way of spending the first winter remarked andre morel who besides being young was strong and enthusiastic  so thought some of us at first returned dan but when we found that the thermometer fell to somewhere between 40 and 50 degrees below zero that walking in snowshoes trapping hunting buffalo and shooting were not to be learned in a few days and when we saw our women and children dependent sometimes on the charity of indians and reduced almost to starvation we changed our minds as to the pleasure of the thing  however if the school was rough it made the scholars all the quicker and now i think that most of us are equal to the redskins themselves at their own work  when that winter came to an end continued dan we returned to red river in the month of may wiser men thoroughly determined to plant and sow and make ourselves independent of the savages  but hunger followed us for fish were scarce that season so were roots and berries and if it had not been for a kind of parsnip which grows wild in the plains and a species of eatable nettle i do believe some of us would have gone under altogether  and did your first sowing turn out well asked the young swiss who having been bred a watchmaker had only hazy notions as to farming  ay there was a gleam of prosperity there that led us to hope great things for the future answered dan but the gleam did not continue why one fellow not far from our place sowed four quarts of wheat and reaped twelve and a half bushels but we had terrible trouble to save our crops from the birds  in the spring and fall blackbirds and wild pigeons pass over the prairies on their way north or south in immense numbers  they pass in such numbers that they could i do believe swallow our whole harvest if they got only a grain apiece  the berries failed them that year an men women and children had to work hard wi guns birdnets and rattles from morning to night to say nothing o scarecrows  we had resolved never to go near pembina again but what we saved of the harvest was little more than enough for seed so we were forced to try it for another winter  troubles again awaited us there  the halfbreeds and indianswho had been kind at first became jealous  a plot was discovered to murder two of our party who had undertaken to hunt so we were obliged to buy our provisions at a high price and even to barter away our clothing to avoid starvation and we returned halfnaked to the settlement the following spring then coming upon us in armed bands and superior numbers they drove us out of the settlement altogether at last and we came here to jack river to spend the winter as we best could  after that we went back and struggled on for some time but now here have they a second time banished us  what the end is to be who can tell  truly if such be the country i have come to i will go back to my native land and make watches remarked the swiss in a tone from which the sanguine element had almost entirely disappeared    chapter twelve  round the campfires  had any one been watching the campfires of the banished colonists that night the last idea that would have entered the observers mind would have been that of suffering or distress  the night was brilliantly fine and just cold enough to make the blazing fires agreeable without being necessaryexcept indeed as a means of cooking food  the light of these fires shining through the green yellow and golden foliage and illuminating the sunburnt faces of men women and children gave to the scene a strain of the free the wild and the romantic which harmonised well with the gypsylike appearance of the people and formed a ruddy contrast to the pure cold light of the innumerable stars overhead which with their blueblack setting were reflected in the neighbouring lake  over every fire pots and kettles were suspended from tripods or rested on the halfburned logs while impaled wildfowl roasted in front of it food being in great abundance hearts were light in spite of other adverse circumstances and men and women forgetting to some extent the sufferings of the past and the dark prospects of the future appeared to abandon themselves to the enjoyment of the present  the children of course were full of glee and not altogether empty of mischief and there were fortunately no infants of age so tender as to induce a squalling protest against the discomforts of a situation which could be neither understood nor appreciated  it iss a pleesant night whatever remarked old mckay lighting his pipe with a brand plucked from the fire which his family and the davidsons shared in common an if it wass always like this it iss myself that would not object to be a rud savitch  i dont know that a rud savitch is much worse than a white wan growled duncan junior in an undertone  what iss that you say demanded the old man with a look of suspicion for his hearing was imperfect  surely the water must be boiling now daddy said elspie by way of checking the conversation  i dont know whuther it iss boilin or not answered duncan senior applying another brand to his pipe  archie boy exclaimed dan davidson youre letting that goose roast to a cinder  no dan im notbut billie cant abear meat underdone so its better to blacken the outside than have the inside raw  who iss that singing  wheesht boys said fergus mckay turning his head a little on one side as if to listen  there was profound silence for a few moments as a rich manly voice was heard to swell forth from the neighbourhood of one of the campfires  it comes from the camp of the switzers i think said elspie mckay  i know it said jessie davidson who was seated on a log beside her friend  it is francois la certe  he came to our meetingplace in red river you know just after cuthbert grant and his men left us and hearing that we were starting off to jack river again he resolved to follow  i heard him tell slowfoot to get ready to go along with us  i wonder why he came said mrs davidson coming out of her tent at the moment and joining the party round the fire  he did not say answered jessie  he did not require to say remarked duncan mckay with a sarcastic laugh  every wan knows that wherever there iss a chance of gettin ammunition and plenty of victuals for nothing there la certe iss certain to be found  he knew that we would be sure to hev plenty at this season o the year an that we would not see him an his wife sterve when our kettles wass full  iss not that so okematan  you know him best  thus appealed to the indian whose usual expression was one of intense gravity shut his eyes opened his mouth displayed his superb teeth and uttered a low chuckle but made no further reply  it was enough  those who understood okematan and his ways were well aware that he thought la certe uncommonly sly  the halfbreed had indeed followed the expelled colonists in the belief that they would certainly possess plenty of powder and shotwhich he had not the means of purchasing  he also knew that the whole of ruperts land swarmed with game in autumn and spring and that the scotch were an openhanded race when approached in the right way putting these things together he carefully gummed his canoe put his wife and child into italso some of the provision which had been supplied to him by duncan mckay juniorand followed the settlers over lake winnipeg to jack river  here finding that a new party of immigrants had arrived who were necessarily unacquainted with his little peculiarities la certe attached himself to them and made himself agreeable  this he could do very well for the switzers understood his bad french as well as his good tuneful voice and appreciated his capacity for telling a story  did you never he said to andre morel after his song was finished hear of how my old mother saved her whole tribe from death one time in the rocky mountains  never morel replied with a somewhat sceptical but goodnatured smile  no  i wonder much for every one in this land heard about it an i thought the news must have spread over europe andand perhaps africa well i will tell you  where is my baccybag  never mind fill your pipe from mine said morel tossing him a little bag of the coveted weed  thank you  well you must know that my mother had a beautiful voice o much more beautiful than mine  indeed i do not joke so you need not laugh  it was so sweet that men were always forced to listen till she was done  they could not help it  did they ever want to help it asked morel quietly  o yesas you shall hear  well one day my mother was living with all our tribei say our tribe because my mother was an indianwith all our tribe in a great dark gorge of the rocky mountains  the braves had gone out to hunt that day but my mother stayed behind with the women and children  i was a little foolish child at that timetoo young to hunt or fight  my fathera french canadianhe was dead  we knewmy mother and ithat the braves would be home soon  we expected them every minute  while we were waiting for them my mother went into the bush to pick berries  there she discovered a warparty of our enemies  they were preparing to attack our village for they knew the men were away and they wanted the scalps of the women and children but they did not know the exact spot where our wigwams were pitched and were just going after a feed to look for it  my mother ran home with the news and immediately roused the camp and made them get ready to fly to meet the returning men  but my daughter said an old chief who had stayed in camp our enemies are young and active they will quickly overtake us before we meet our men  no said my mother i will stop them  get ready and set off quickly  she then ran back on her trailmy mother was a tremendous runner superb  she came to a narrow place where our enemies would have to pass  a very thick tree grew there  she climbed it and hid among the branches  it projected beyond a precipice and overhung a stream  soon after that she saw the enemy advancing step by step slowly cautiously like men who dread an ambush and with glances quick and solemn from side to side like men who see a foe in every stump and stone  la certe paused at this point  he was an adept at storytelling  his voice had slowed by degrees and become increasingly deep and solemn as he proceeded  now continued he in a higher tone my mother did not fear that they would see her if they looked up when they passed the tree  she was too well hidden for that but she was not sure what the effect of her voice would be for she had never tried it in that way before  however she was full of courage  she resembled me in thatbold as a lion  she began to sing  low and soft at the beginning like a dream of song  at the first note the indians haltedevery man each in the position in which he was fixed  if a foot was up he kept it up  if both feet were down he left them down  the feet that were up came slowly to the ground when the indians got tired but no one took another step  my mothers voice was a weird voice  it sounded as if the place from which it came was nowhereor anywhereor everywhere  slowly the painted heads turned from side to side as far as they could go and the glaring eyes turned a little further  a creeping fear came over them  they trembled  they turned pale  that could be easily seen through the paint  my mother saw it  she became more courageous and sang out in her most pathetic strain  the indians wept  that was quite visible my mother saw it  her great object was to delay the attack until our men had time to arrive  she tried a warsong but that was not so successful  it was too commonplace  besides in her energy she shook the branches and that drew attention to the tree  my mother thought that she was in danger then but fortune favoured her  it always favours the brave  i know this from experience  she had just come to a terrific whoop in the warsong when she slipped off her branch and the whoop increased to a deathyell as she went crashing headlong through the branches and down into the stream at the foot of the precipice  water water exclaimed la certe at this point holding out both hands  i can never pass this part of my story without burning thirst  a mug of water was handed him  poor fellowhave some brandy in it said a sympathetic hearer hastily getting out his bottle  la certe held out his mug impatiently for the brandy drained the mug and cleared his voice  waswas your mother killed asked the sympathiser earnestly  killed  no  impossible  my mother could not be killed because her destiny was not yet fulfilled  no there was a deep pool right under the tree  she fell into that with a plunge that echoed from cliff to cliff  the indians were profoundly superstitious  all indians are not so but these indians were  they waited not for more  they turned and fled as if all the evil spirits in the rocky mountains were chasing them  they reached their wigwams breathless and told their squaws that one of the spirits of a mountain stream had sat among the branches of a tree and sung to them  it had told them that the right time for attacking their foes had not yet come  then it sang them a warsong descriptive of their final victory and just after uttering a tremendous warwhoop it had dived back into its native stream  well done exclaimed an enthusiastic canadian  but what became of your mother asked morel  oh she swam ashore  my mother was a splendid swimmer  i know it for she taught me  was it a long swim asked a sceptical sailor who was one of the emigrants  howwhat mean you demanded la certe sternly  i only want to know if she took long to swim ashore out o that pool said the sceptic simply  la certe cast on him a glance of suspicion and replied that his mother had found no difficulty in getting out of the pool  is the old lady alive yet asked the pertinacious sceptic  of course not  she died long long agothirty years ago  what before you was born  thats strange isnt it  no but you not understand  i suppose my speech is not plain to you i said three years ago  ah thats more like it  i only missed what you said returned the sceptic whose name was fred jenkins for ive lived a while in france and understand your lingo pretty well  pass that goose morel if you have left anything on it  this air o the wilderness beats the air o the sea itself for givin a fellow a twist  the remarks of jenkins while they did not absolutely destroy the confidence of the swiss party shook it enough to show the wily halfbreed that he must do something if possible to reestablish his credit  he therefore volunteered another song which was gladly accepted and highly appreciated for as we have said la certe possessed a really good and tuneful voice and these immigrants were a musical people  while this was going on at the swiss campfires an incident occurred at the fire round which the mckaydavidson party was assembled which deserves particular notice  old mckay was giving some directions to fergus duncan junior was seated opposite dan davidson smoking his pipe and elspie had gone into her tent when slowfoot the spouse of la certe drew near  come along old girl exclaimed mckay senior  it iss some baccy you will be wantin ill wager  slowfoot did not reply in words but the smile upon her face was eloquent  come away then continued the hospitable highlander  you shall hev a pipe of it whatever  he handed her a large plug of tobacco and the woman sitting down close to young duncan produced her pipe and drew out a knife for the purpose of cutting up the tobacco  hallo exclaimed duncan where did you get hold o my knife  he stopped abruptlya little confused in spite of himself  for the moment he had quite forgotten that the knife had been left in the camp where he had slain perrin and the sudden sight of it had thrown him off his guard  it was now too late to unsay the words but not too late to mislead his hearers  i got it from marie blanc said slowfoot with a look of surprise does the knife belong to cloudbrow  i think it does  im almost sure it iss mine  let me see it returned duncan taking the knife from the womans hand and examining it with cool and critical deliberation  no continued he it iss not mine but very like one that i lostso like that i felt sure at first it wass mine  men who lie usually overact their part  duncan glanced suspiciously at dan to see how he took the explanation as he returned the knife to slowfoot and dan observed the glance as being uncalled for unnaturalin the circumstances  dan was by no means of a suspicious nature nevertheless the glance haunted him for many a day after that  suspicion once aroused is a ghost which is not easily laid  he tried to shake it off and he carefully loyally kept it confined in his own breast but do what he would he could not banish entirely from his mind that duncan mckaythe brother of his elspiehad some sort of guilty knowledge of the murder of poor henri perrin    chapter thirteen  difficulties of various kinds overcome  when the bright warm days and cool starry nights of the indian summer gave place to the sharp days and frosty nights of early winterwhen young ice formed on the lakes and rendered canoeing impossible and the ducks and geese had fled to warmer climes and the frost king had sent his first messengers of snow to cover the wilderness with a windingsheet and herald his return to the winter palacethen it was that the banished red river settlers began to feel the pinch of poverty and to understand the full extent of the calamity that had befallen them  we have not space to follow them through all the details of that winter at jack river  some died all suffered more or less but they had to endure it for escape from the country to the civilised world was even more difficult and hopeless than escape from the dreaded wilds of siberia  the men hunted fished under the ice trapped and sustained themselves and their families in life during the long dreary winter the only gain being that they became more or less expert at the redmans work and ways of life  only two of the indians remained with them to help them over their difficultiesnamely okematan and kateegoose with their respective squaws  these last were invaluable as the makers of moccasins and duffle socks and leathern coats without which existence in such a climate would have been impossible  they also imparted their knowledge in such matters to the squaws of the white men  there was one friend however who did not remain with the settlers when things began to look dismal around them  this was the amiable musical storytelling la certe  that tenderhearted man could not endure the sight of human distress  if he could not relieve it he felt constrained to shut his eyes to it and to flee from it  at the first indication of the approach of winter he had come to old mckay with that peculiarly mild humble deprecatory expression of countenance with which he was wont to preface an appeal for assistance of some sort  what iss it you will be wantin now demanded the old man rather testily for he had an aversion to the halfbreeds sneaking ways surely you will not be wantin more powder an shot efter the supply i gave you last week  o no nothing could be further from the mind of la certe  he had plenty of ammunition and provisions  he had only come to say that he was going back totored river  weel weel returned the highlander there is no call for hesitation man in tellin me that  i will not be breakin my heart when ye are gone  i suppose that now ye hev got the best the season can supply ye think the comforts o the settlement will be more to your taste  the remonstrative expression on la certes face deepened  the idea of his own taste or comfort had not once entered his head but he had a wife and child whom he was bound to consider and he had a huta home in red river which he felt constrained to look after  besides he had social duties of many kinds which claimed attention  ive no doubt ye hev said mckay with a short sarcastic laugh an ye will attend to them tooill be bound  but ye did not come here i suppose to take a tender farewell o me  what iss it you will be wantin  oot wi it man  there is a canoe said la certe with some hesitation  there iss many a canoe returned mckay with a peculiar grin  true but there is one on the shore now close to the flat rock which  my own canoe interrupted the other what will ye be wantin wi that  la certe did not wish to appear greedy but the season was late and his own canoe was not in a very fit condition to carry a family round the shores of a lake so large as lake winnipeg  would the white father lend his canoe to him  it could not be wanted much longer that fall and the one he would leave behind him was an excellent canoe for ordinary fishing and hunting purposes  he would be quite willing to hire the canoe or to pay the full price for it if any accident should happen to it  no said mckay firmly  no la certe your hiring means borrowing and your payin means owin a debt for the remainder o your natural life  i will see you at the bottom o lake winnipeg before i will be lending you my canoe  la certe smiled sadly and gazed at the cap with which his hands played as if appealing to it for sympathy  with an aspect of the profoundest resignation he made his bow and left the presence  but la certe was not in the least put out by this failure  he went to his tent and recounted the interview to his squaw who when he entered was in the act of giving her child a creature of about four years of age one or two draws of her pipe to let it taste how nice it was  smoking in calm placidity the amiable pair discussed the subject  the conclusion they came to was as usual harmonious  i think he will agree to lend it next time i go to him said la certe hopefully  he will give in replied slowfoot decidedly  the fouryearold could not understand the subject and made no comment but it howled for another smoke and got it  la certe was wrong and his wife was rightas usual  old mckay did not agree to lend his canoe the next time or the next again but he did give in at last more perhaps to get rid of the halfbreeds importunity than because of goodwill and sold the canoe to himon credit  when that winter was over the hudsons bay company again encouraged the settlers to return under promise of protection and the spring found the persevering people in spite of all difficulties and previous failures busy putting into the ground what little seed they possessed and otherwise cultivating the soil  some of them there were however who after lending a hand in this work determined to provide second strings to their bows by following the buffalohunters to the plains  these were chiefly the young and strong men such as dan davidson and his brother peter fergus mckay antoine dechamp and jacques bourassin among many others  la certe also went as well as his squaw and the fouryearold  he managed the thing characteristically thus  when the halfbreeds were making preparations for their spring hunt he paid a visit to duncan mckay who was busy at the time helping his father and brother to rebuild their house  indeed the edifice was almost rebuilt for the erection of small wooden houses does not usually take long  youve come to beg borrow or steal no doubt said cloudbrow who was worthy of his nickname for he was as short of temper as duncan senior  no la certe had come to do none of these things he said with a conciliatory smile  well then you cant have come to buy or to ask advances growled duncan for you see that our store and all we possessed has been burnt by your precious countrymen  la certe knew this and professed himself profoundly grieved as well as indignant with his countrymen  no he did not come to buy or to borrow but to hire  the mckays had still some horses left and carts  could they not spare a horse and cart to him on hire  no we can do nothing of the sort said duncan shortly resuming his axe and work  you can go to the company  perhaps they will trust youthough they are fools if they do  la certe was regretful but not cast down  he changed the subject commented on the building that was going on the prospects of a good harvest and finally took refuge in that stale old subject the weather then he said in a casual wayas if it had just occurred to him  by the waythat knife that my wife got from marie blanc  young mckay stopped and looked quickly up for a moment with a slight flush but instantly resumed work  well he said quietly what about the knife  would you like to have itmy wife bade me inquire  why should i like to have it he asked carelessly  oh  i thought it was yours said la certe  you are mistaken  i said it was very like mine  but it is not mineand i have no wish for what does not belong to me  of course not  well i must be going said the halfbreed preparing to leave  i wished much to have your horse and cart for they are both good and i would offer you 4 pounds for the trip which you know is double the usual charge for i never grudge a good price for a good thing  yes all the more when you hev no intention to pay it said mckay with a laugh  however since you seem so anxious and offer so good a price i am willing to oblige you this time in the hope that you are really becoming an honest man  the halfbreed was profuse in his thanks and in his assurance that cloudbrows hopes would certainly not be disappointed  having thus attained his chief object our archbeggar went off to obtain provisions  those which had been supplied him the previous autumn by young mckay had been quite consumed by himself and his friendsfor the man you see had a liberal heart and hand  but his first attempts were unsuccessful  he wanted ammunition  to go to the plains without ammunition was obviously useless  he wanted foodsugar tea flour pork  to go to the plains without these would be dreary work  but men knew la certes character and refused him one after another he tried his friends  then he tried them again  then he tried comparative strangers  he could not try his enemies for strange to say he had none  then he went over them all again  at last by indomitable perseverance he managed to wear out the patience of one of his friends who believed in the restoration of the incorrigible and he found himself fully equipped to take the field with his hardworking comrades  it may be remarked here that the buffalo runners generally went on the credit system trusting to a successful hunt to pay off their debts and leave them supplied with food for the winter  but then most of these men were in earnest and meant to pay off their debts loyally  whereas la certegood humorous easygoing manhad not the slightest intention of paying his debts at all    chapter fourteen  treachery in the air  at this time the halfbreeds of the colony of red river formed a small party compared with the numbers to which they multiplied in after years and the band of hunters who annually went to the plains to chase the buffalo was proportionally small  nevertheless they were numerous enough to constitute a formidable band capable of holding their own when united against any band of wandering indians who might feel disposed to attack them  they were a brave hardy race of men but of course there were some black sheep among them like la certe  about sixty or a hundred miles from the settlement the party under command of antoine dechamp found the buffalo and preparations were at once made to attack them  it was dusk however when the herds were discovered so that the hunt had to be postponed to the following day  a small clump of bushes afforded wood enough for campfires  the carts were ranged in a circle with the trains outward  sentries were posted the horses were secured the kettles put on pipes lighted and noise laughter song and story mingled with the shrill voices of children were heard far on into the night  among the children if we may venture so to class them were archie and billie sinclairthough we suspect that archie would have claimed and with some reason to be classed with the men  they belonged to the campfire which formed a centre to the party composed of dan and peter fergus dechamp and fred jenkins the sailor  the latter who it was thought had come out to the country by way of a skylark rather than as a settler had followed the hunters bent he said on firing a broadside into a buffalo  he had brought with him a blunderbuss which he averred had been used by his greatgrandfather at the battle of culloden  it was a formidable old weapon capable of swallowing at one gulp several of the bullets which fitted the trading guns of the country  its powers of scattering ordinary shot in large quantity had proved to be very effective and had done such execution among flocks of wildfowl that the indians and halfbreeds although at first inclined to laugh at it were ultimately filled with respect  i doubt its capacity for sending ball straight however remarked dan to jenkins who was carefully cleaning out the piece especially if charged with more than one ball  no fear of it returned the sailor with a confident air  of course it scattered the balls about six yards apart the only time i tried it with a lot of em but that was at fifty yards off an they tell me that you amost ram the muzzle against the brutes sides when chasin buffalo  so theres no room to scatter dee see till they get inside their bodies and when there it dont matter how much they scatter  its well named a young cannon by la certe said peter davidson who like the seaman was out on his first buffalohunt  i never heard such a roar as it gave that time you brought down ten out of one flock of ducks on the way up here  ay peter she barked well that time remarked the sailor with a grin but then there was a reason  i had doubleshotted her by mistake  an ye did it too without an aim for you had both eyes tight shut at the time remarked fergus  iss that the way they teach ye to shoot at sea  in course it is replied jenkins gravely  thats the beauty o the blunderbuss  theres no chance o missin so what ud be the use o keepin yer eyes open excep to get em filled wi smoke  youve ony got to point straight an blaze away  i did not know that you use the blunderbuss in your ships at all said dechamp with a look of assumed simplicity  ho yes they do said jenkins squinting down the bellmouthed barrel as if to see that the touchhole was clear  aboard o one manowar that i sailed in after pirates in the china seas we had a blunderbuss company  the firstleftenant who was thought to be queer in his head he got it up  the first time the company was ranged along the deck he gave the order to load with ball cartridges  there was twentysix of us all told  weve got no cartridges for em sir whispered the man nearest him  if you dont obey orders growled the leftenant tween his teeth ill have ye strung up for mutiny every man jack of youload he repeated in a kind of a yell  we had our ornary belts and pouches on so we out wi the ornary cartridgessome three some fouran biting off the ends poured in the powder somehow shoved in the balls anyhow an rammed the whole consarn down  presentfire roared the leftenant  bang went the six an twenty blunderbusses an when the smoke cleared away there was fourteen out o the twentysix men flat on their backs the rest o us was raither stunned but hearty  take these men below cried the leftenant an send fourteen strong men here  we dont want weaklings for this company  after that we loaded in moderation an got on better  and the pirateswhat did they think o the new weapon asked peter davidson with an amused expression  o they couldnt stand it at all answered the sailor looking up from his work with a solemnity that was quite impressive  they stood fire only once  after that they sheered off like wildcats  i say mistress la certe how long is that lobscouseor whatever you call itgoin to be in cookin  slowfoot gave vent to a sweet low giggle as she lifted the kettle off the hook and thus gave a practical answer to the question  she placed before him the robbiboo or pemmican soup which the seaman had so grievously misnamed  during the time that the hunters were appeasing their appetites it was observed that antoine dechamp the leader of the expedition was unusually silent and thoughtful and that he betrayed a slight look of anxiety  it therefore did not surprise dan davidson when the supper was nearly ended that dechamp should rise and leave the fire after giving him a look which was a silent but obvious invitation to follow  dan obeyed at once and his leader conducting him between the various campfires led him outside the circle of carts  a clear moon lit up the prairie all round so that they could see its undulating sweep in every direction  anything wrong antoine asked dan in a low voice when they were out of earshot of the camp  nothing wrong dan  surely continued the other while dechamp paused as if in perplexity surely there can be no chance of redskins troubling us on a clear night like this  i can distinguish every bush for miles around  there is no fear o redskins  no i am not troubled about them  it is matters concerning yourself that trouble me  hows that  what do you mean antoine  is your brotherinlawtobe duncan mckay coming to join us this spring asked dechamp  i believe he isafter he has helped his father a bit longer wi the farm  why do you ask  well to say truth i cant give you a very good reason for my bein anxious  only i cant help havin my ears open and ive heard some talk among the lads that makes me fear for the young man  they say or hint that he knows more about the murder o poor perrin than he chooses to tell  ive not been quite able to find out what makes them suspect him but they do suspect him an it would be well to warn him not to come here for you know there are many opportunities to commit murder on a buffalohunt  the incident of the knife and of duncan mckays significant glance at once flashed across davidsons mind and he felt a terrible sinking of the heart when the suspicion once before roused within him seemed now to be confirmed  he resolved however to reveal his thoughts to no onespecially not to elspie  i think it a shame he said that men should allow such rumours to circulate when nothing certain has arisen to rouse suspicion  that affair of the knife was clearly explained when young mckay declared that it was not his though it looked like it  if he knew anything about the murder would he not have been certain to have told us long ago  and surely you cannot suppose that duncan killed perrin with his own hand speak dechamp  why do you shake your head  i know nothing returned the leader  what right have i to suppose anything  i only know that mens deeds are often mysterious and unaccountable and that our men have strong suspicion  for myself i have no opinion  duncan mckay is probably innocent for he and perrin were not enemies  i hope he is so but i advise you to stop his coming to the camp just now if you can  his life may depend on it  i cannot stop him returned dan with a perplexed look  he is headstrong as you know and if he has made up his mind to come nothing will stop him  perhaps if he knew his life would be in dangerthat might stop him  i doubt it but i will give him the chance  i will ride back to red river without delay and warn him  good  when will you start  tonight  the moon is clear and will not set till morning  i shall be well on my way by that time  will you ride alone  no there may be bad indians about  i will ask okematan or fergus mckay to ride with me  why did you not speak to fergus instead of to me  because he has not been spoken to by any one answered dechamp and i would not be the first to put suspicion into his head about his own brother  besides your head is clearer and your interest in duncan for elspies sake is greater than his no doubt  well you may be right antoine  at all events if i take fergus with me i shall send him back before reaching the settlement and say nothing whatever about my reason for going there  pressing business you know will be sufficient  im not so sure of that returned dechamp with a laugh  men are apt to want to know the nature of pressing business  however it may be as well to take fergus  at any rate you cannot have okematan for he is not in camp he left soon after we pitched and i know has not yet returned  it matters not  fergus will do better  he is more companionable  returning to camp dan davidson made the proposal to fergus mckay  that worthy was as he said ready for anything and the two were soon mounted  they were also well armed for the risk of meeting a party of hostile indians was not altogether out of the question though improbable  each horseman carried his blanket and provision wallet his gun a long knife almost equal to an ancient roman sword and a cavalry pistolrevolvers not having been invented at that time at least they had not come into general use  thus provided for all contingencies they set forth  as we have said the night was clear and fine so that the plains were open to view in all directions save where a few scattered clumps of willows and small trees grew like islets in the ocean  it iss this that i like better than farming said fergus as the fresh horses carried them swiftly and lightly over the prairie waves and down into the grassy hollows now swerving to avoid a badgerhole or clearing a small shrub with a little bound  i do think that man wass intended to live in the wilderness an not to coop himself up in the cities like rabbits in their holes  why fergus you should have been born a savage said dan  ay it iss savitch i am that i wass not born a savitch returned fergus with a grim smile  what in all the world iss the use of ceevilisation if it will not make people happy  a man wants nothing more than a goot supper an a goot bed an a goot shelter over him an it is a not five hunderd pound a year that we will want to buy that whatever  but surely man wants a little more than that fergus  he wants breakfast and dinner usually as well as supper and a few comforts besides such as tea and sugarat least the women dobesides pipes an baccyto say nothing of books  oo ay i will not be denyin that  but weve no need for wan half the luxuries o ceevilisation  an ye know ferry weel tan that my sister elspie would be content to live wi you in a ferry small hoose and the bare necessaries of life but here you are forced to put off the merritch because our hooses wass burnt and you are obleeged to wait till you get a sort o palace built i suppose and a grand farm set agoin  indeed fergus you touch me on a sore point there but with all your scorn of luxury im sure youd be the last man to let his sister marry a fellow who could take her only to a hut or a wigwam  you are right tan  yet i hev spent many a comfortable night in a hut an a wigwam since i came to red river  i wish the place wass more peaceable  it will never be more peaceable as long as there are two rival companies fighting for the furs said davidson but theres worse than that goin on for some of the indians it seems are mad at the agreement made between them and lord selkirk  wow that iss a peety  where heard ye that  i heard it from la certe whose wife slowfoot you know is a cree indian  it seems that the crees have always claimed red river as their lands but when lord selkirk came to make a treaty with the natives he found some saulteaux livin on the soil an his lordship in ignorance gave them an interest in the treaty though they were mere visitorsan indeed dont even claim to be owners of the soiltheir lands lying far to the east of red river  well continued dan guiding his horse carefully down the next hollow for the moon had gone behind a cloud just then when the crees found out what had been done they were naturally very angryan i dont wonderan they threaten now to expel the saulteaux from red river altogether an the white men along wi them unless the names of the saulteaux chiefs are wiped out o the contract an the annual payment made to the crees alone  that iss bad taniel ferry bad said fergus as they reached the bottom of the hollow and began to ascend the succeeding undulation an i am all the more sorry to hear it because our goot frund okematan is a cree  ay fergus he is a great chief of the crees and a man of considerable influence among his people  i should not like to have him for an enemy  stop said fergus in a whisper at that moment laying his hand on davidsons arm  dan drew rein at once and looked at his friend but could not clearly see his face for the moon was still behind thick drifting clouds  they had just risen high enough on the prairie wave which they had been ascending to be able to see over it and dan could perceive by the outstretched neck of his companion that he was gazing intently at something directly in front  what do you see fergus he asked in a low voice  do you see nothin taniel was the highlanders reply  why yes  i see the plains stretching away to the horizonan dark enough they are too at this moment  i also see a few small clumps that look like bushes here an there  dont you see the clump thats nearest to youright foment your nose said the other  of course i do and he stopped abruptly for at that moment he saw a spark in the clump referred toa spark so small that it might have been taken for a glowworm had such a creature existed there  savitches whispered the highlander  lets get into the hollow as fast as we can  this retrograde movement was soon effected and the friends dismounted  now fergus whats the best thing to be done  i will be leavin that to you taniel for youve a clearer head than mine  we dare not ride forward said dan as if communing with himself an it would be foolish to make a long detour to escape from something until we know there is something worth escaping from  my notion is that we hobble or picket our horses here and go cautiously forward on foot to see what it is  youll be doin what ye think best captain taniel an you will find that private fergus will back you upwhatever  this being settled the two men picketed their steeds in the hollow fastened their guns to the saddles as being too cumbrous for a creeping advance and armed only with their long knives and pistols reascended the prairie wave  with feet clothed in soft moccasin and practised by that time in the art of stealthy tread they moved towards the summit noiseless as ghosts  on gaining the ridge they sank slowly down into the tall grass and disappeared  after a prolonged and somewhat painful creep on hands and knees the two men reached the edge of the clump of bushes already referred to  before reaching it they discovered from the sound of voices that a party of some kind was encamped there but of course as they knew not who it became needful to proceed with extreme caution  when they gained the edge of the clump and raised their heads over a low bushcovered bank they beheld a sight which was not calculated to cheer them for there in the centre of the bush encircling a very small fire sat a warparty of about fifty painted and befeathered braves of the cree indians  they were engaged in council at the moment  a creeping sensation about their scalps was experienced by the two eavesdroppers on observing that they had passed not a hundred yards from a sentinel who occupied a low knoll on their left  neither dan nor fergus dared to speaknot even to whisper  still less did they dare to move for a few moments after they reached the bank just referred to the moon came out from behind the clouds and flooded the whole scene as with the light of day  there was nothing left for it therefore except to lie still and listen  but this gave them small comfort for although quite within earshot of the warparty the language spoken was utterly unintelligible to either of them  their eyes however were not so useless as their ears for they could clearly see each warrior as he rose to harangue his comrades and from the vindictive expression of their faces as well as their frequent pointing in the direction of the buffalohunters it was abundantly evident that an attack upon them was being discussed  at last after many braves had spoken a chief of tall and noble mien arose  his back was towards the two spies but the moment they heard his voice they turned their heads and gazed at each other in speechless amazement for the voice was quite familiar  no word did they dare to utter but fergus made formations with his lips of a most extravagant nature which however clearly spelt okematan when he had finished he nodded and turned his gaze again on the crees  both men now understood that treachery was in the wind and that a night attack was highly probable and of course they felt desperately anxious to jump up and fly back to the camp to warn their comradesfor their only fear was a surprise  the halfbreeds being far more numerous than the indians and well entrenched there could be no fear for them if prepared  just then as if to favour them the moon retired behind a huge black cloud  without a moments hesitation dan began to creep away back closely followed by fergus  they gave a wide berth of course to the sentinel and soon regained the hollow where the horses had been left  here they breathed more freely  who would have thought this of okematan muttered dan as he hastily tightened his saddlegirths  the rascal exclaimed fergus in deep tones of indignation  you must gallop back to camp at once fergus said dan as they mounted  i will go on to red river alone  what will you not be coming with me asked the highlander in some surprise  there is no need for there will be no fighting returned the other our fellows far outnumber the redskins and when the latter find that we have been warned and are on our guard they wont attack us depend on it  but youll have to ride fast for when such fellows make up their minds to strike they dont usually waste time in delivering the blow  my business presses i must go on  a minute later and dan davidson was galloping towards the settlement alone while fergus made the best of his way back to the camp of the buffalo runners    chapter fifteen  a friend in need is a friend indeed  whether or not okematan was as thorough a rascal as fergus mckay thought him will be best shown by harking back and setting down a little of what was said by some of the cree braves at the time that fergus and dan were eavesdropping  standing in a dignified attitude worthy of an ancient roman with his blanket thrown togafashion over one shoulder one of the braves looked round on the warrior band with a dark scowl before he began  his comrades were evidently impressed by his looks  whether owing to a freak of fancy a spice of eccentricity or simple vanity we know not but this brave had among other ornamental touches to his visage painted his nose bright red  the effect on his brother braves was solemnising  it was not so impressive to his white observers as it suggested to them the civilised toper  the great white chief began rednose with a slow deliberation that was meant to convey a settled and unalterable conviction is a fool  waugh exclaimed the audience with emphasis for the language was strong and uttered with intense vigour and that quite accorded with their tastes so they agreed with the sentiment without regard to its signification  this species of rhetoric and its effects are sometimes observed in connection with civilised gatherings  the great white chief thus irreverently referred to we regret to say was lord selkirk  the great white chief continued rednose availing himself of the force of emphatic repetition is a fool  he is a child  he knows nothing  he comes across the great salt lake from the rising sun with the air and aspect of an owl thinking to teach usthe great cree nationwisdom  waugh from the audience one of whom having a cold in his head sneezed inadvertently and was scowled at by the orator for full two minutes in absolute silence  if that cree warriorhe was on his first warpathpossessed anything akin to the feelings of the paleface he must have suffered martyrdom  every one knows continued the orator resuming that the crees are wise  they can tell a fox from a buffalo  they understand the difference between fire and water  no paleface sage needs to come from the rising sun to tell them to eat when they are hungryto drink when they are dry  but this paleface chief comes with the eyes of the great northern owl and says he comes to do us good  and how does he begin to do us good  here there was a very decided waugh as though to say ay thats the question and then a solemn pause for moreduring which the man with the cold drew the reins very tight  how does he begin to do us good proceeded the orator  by entering into an agreement with us for the use of our landsand asking our enemies the saulteaux to take part in that agreement  the sounds of indignation and ferocity that followed this statement are not translatable  after a gaze of unutterable meaning round the circle rednose went on  this this is the way in which the owleyed chief of the palefaces begins to do us good  if this is the way he begins in what way will he continue andhere his voice deepened to a whisperhow will he end  the ideas suggested by his question were so appalling that for some minutes the orator appeared unable to find words to go on and his audience glared at him in dread anticipation as though they expected him to explode like a bombshell but were prepared to sit it out and take the consequences  and he did explode after a fashion for he suddenly raised his voice to a shout that startled even the sentinel on the distant knoll and said  i counsel war to the knife  the great white chiefthe owleyed foolwill not blot from our agreement the names of the saulteaux chiefschiefs there are no saulteaux chiefs  all their braves are cowards on the same dead level of stupidity and their women areare nothing fit for nothing can do nothing and must soon come to nothing what then  the duty of cree warriors lies before us  we will drive the saulteaux into lake winnipeg and the palefaces off the face of the earth altogether  waugh  having thus given vent to the opinions and feelings that consumed him rednose sat down his audience breathed freely the distant sentinel recovered his composure and the young novitiate brave with the cold in his head sneezed with impunity  it would be tedious to recount all that was said at that council of war the next brave that rose to address the house very much resembled the first speaker both in sentiment and personal appearance except that he had chosen skyblue for his nose instead of red  the only additional matter that he contributed worth noting was the advice that they should begin their bloody work by an immediate attack in the dead of night on the camp of the buffalo runners  this advice was hailed with a good many waughs as well as approving nods and looks and it seemed as if the plan were about to be carried into action without delay when as we have seen okematan arose to address the assemblage  okematan was a great chiefmuch greater in the estimation of his tribe than the whites with whom he had been associating in red river were aware of  he had purposely reserved his address till near the conclusion  the cree warriors he said with an air of quiet dignity that was far more effective than the more energetic tones and gestures of the previous speakers know very well that the cree nation considers itself the wisest in creation  far be it from okematan to say otherwise for he does not know  okematan is a child  his eyes are only beginning to open  he paused at this point and looked round with solemn dignity and the braves unaccustomed to such selfdepreciative modes of address gazed at him with equal solemnity not unmingled with surprise though the latter feeling was carefully concealed  when the last great palaver of the cree braves was held on the bluepine ridge continued okematan the chiefs chose me to go to red river and learn all that i could find out about the palefaces and their intentions  i went as you know  i attached myself to a family named daaveedsin and i have found outfound out much about the palefaces much more that i did not know before though i am a chief of the cree nation  okematan looked pointedly at rednose as he said this  after a brief pause he continued  the great white chief meaning lord selkirk is not a fool  it is true that he is not a god he is a man and a paleface subject to the follies and weaknesses of the palefaces and not quite so wise as it is possible to be but he is a good man and wishes well to the indian  i have found weaknesses among the palefaces  one of them is that their chiefs plansometimes wisely sometimes foolishlybut they leave the carrying out of their plans to other men and sometimes these other men care for nobody but themselves  they tell lies they mislead the great white chief and tell him to do what is wrong  so it was when our agreement came to be made  the great white chief found when he came to red river a few families of saulteaux whom we had permitted to hunt on our lands  he thought the land belonged to the saulteaux as well as to the crees  he was mistaken ignorant he knew no better and the palefaces who did know did not put light into him so the names of saulteaux chiefs were put in the writing  then the great white chief went away across the great salt lake to the lands of the rising sun leaving his small chiefs to carry out his plans  some of these are very small chiefs unfit to carry out any plans  others are bad small chiefs that will carry out only such plans as are sure to benefit themselves  it is these men with whom we have to deal  it is these who deserve to be swept off the face of the earth  a number of emphatic nods and waughs at this point showed that okematan had at last touched a keynote with which his braves could shout in harmony  but resumed the chief impressively we cannot sweep them off the earth we cannot even sweep them off the banks of red river  we might easily sweep the saulteaux into lake winnipeg if we thought it worth while to try but the palefacesnever  okematan has travelled far to the south and seen the palefaces there  they cannot be counted  they swarm like our locusts they darken the earth as our buffaloes darken the plains  they live in stone wigwams  i have seen one of their wigwams that was big enough to hold all the crees wigwams bundled together  if we killed or scalped all the palefaces in red river the great white chief would come over the great salt lake with an army that would swallow us up as the buffalo swallows up a tuft of grass  besides continued okematan with a slight touch of pathos in his tone there are good and bad men among the palefaces just as there are good and bad among ourselves  i have dwelt for many moons with a tribe called scoshmin  okematan loves the scoshmin  they speak a wonderful language and some of them are too fond of firewater but their braves fear nothing and their squaws are pretty and work hardalmost as hard as our squawsthough they are not quite as goodlooking as ours  they are too whitetheir faces are like buffalo fat  a waugh which might be translated hear hear greeted this statement of opinion  now continued our chief if we swept away all the people of red river we would sweep away the good scoshmin which would be foolish and we would gain nothing in the end but would bring worse trouble on our heads  my counsel therefore is for peace  i advise that we should let the buffalo runners and the people of red river alone send a message with our grievances to the great white chief ask him to come back over the great salt lake to put things right and in the meantime wait with patience attend to our own business hunt fish eat drink sleep and be happy  having delivered his harangue okematan sat down amid murmurs of mingled applause and disapprobation  it was evident that he had created a serious division of opinion in the camp and it seemed as if on the impression made by the next speaker would depend the great question of peace or war  presently an old warrior arose and a profound silence followed for they held him in great respect  my braves said the old man sententiously i have lived long and my fighting days are nearly over  if wisdom has not accumulated on my head it must be my own fault for i have had great experience both of war and peacemore of war perhaps than of peace  and the opinion that i have come to after long and very deep consideration is this if there is something to fight for fightfight well if there is nothing to fight for dont fightdont fight at all  the old man paused and there were some waughs of approval for the truth contained in his profound conclusion was obvious even to the stupidest redskin of the bandsupposing that a stupid brave among crees were possible  i have also lived to see continued the old man that revenge is nothingnothing at all and therefore not worth fighting for  as this was flying straight in the face of the most cherished of redskins beliefs it was received in dead though respectful silence  my young braves do not believe this  i know it  i have been young myself and i remember well how pleasant revenge was to me but i soon found that the pleasure of revenge did not last  it soon passed away yet the deed of revenge did not pass away and sometimes the deed became to my memory very bitterinsomuch that the pleasantness was entirely swallowed up and forgotten in the bitterness  my young braves will not believe this i know  they go on feeling they think on feeling they reason on feeling they trust to feeling  it is foolish for the brain was given to enable man to think and judge and plan  you are as foolish as if you were to try to smell with your mouth and eat with your nose but it is the way of youth  when experience teaches then you will come to know that revenge is not worth fighting forits pleasantness will pass away but the bitter it leaves behind will never pass away  what is the meaning of revenge continued this analytical old savage what is the use of it  does it not mean that we give up all hope of getting what we want and wildly determine to get what pleasure is still possible to us by killing those who have thwarted us  and when you have killed and got all the pleasure there is what does it come to  your enemy is dead and scalped  what then  he does not know that he is dead  he does not care that he is dead and scalped  you cannot keep him alive for ever killing and scalping him  but you have made his wife and children miserable  what of that  it was not his wife and children who opposed you therefore you have revenged yourself on the wrong persons  he does not know that you have rendered his wife and children miserable and does not care therefore i ask why are you pleased  if your enemy was a good man your revenge has only done him a kindness for it has sent him to the happy hunting grounds before his time where you will probably never meet him to have the pleasure of being revenged on him there  if he was a bad man you have sent him to the world of desolation where he will be waiting to receive you when you get there and where revenge will be impossible for men are not allowed to kill or scalp there  at least if they are i never heard of itand i am an old man now  there is nothing then to fight for with the palefaces of red river and my counsel is like that of okematan that we should decide on peacenot war  whatever may have been the private opinion of the braves as to this new and very unexpected style of address the effect of it was pacific for after a little more palaver the peaceparty carried the dayor rather the nightand next morning the cree warriors went back to their tents and hunting avocations leaving okematan to return to the camp of his friends the buffalo runners    chapter sixteen  an evening in the camp  it was daybreak when fergus mckay galloped into camp with the startling news that an attack by hostile indians might be expected that day or the following night  he was of course unaware of the fact that the peacemaking okematan had been unwittingly following his tracks at a more leisurely pace  some readers may think that the indian with his traditional power of following a trail should have observed and suspected the fresh track of the hunter but it must be remembered that some hundreds of buffalo runners had passed over the same track a day or two previously and that hawkeye or pathfinder himself would have become helpless in the midst of such trampled confusion  besides okematan had no reason to suspect that he had been followed still less that the camp of the warparty had been accidentally discovered  now boys said fergus after detailing his adventures during the night we will hev to give up all notion o buffalo runnin this day an putt the camp in a state o defence  there was a good deal of grumbling at this especially among some of the younger men for they were very keen to commence the sport and had not much belief in the power of a small band of savages to do them harm some of them even suggested that half of their number should remain behind to guard the camp while the other half should go after the buffalo  this proposal however was not received with favour as it would certainly be a matter of disagreement which half was to go out and which to remain behind  where is kateegoose asked dechamp at this crisis  stuffin imself of course said fred jenkins amid a general laugh ive noticed since we set sail on this trip that kateegoose always turns out at daybreak lights the galley fire an begins the dooties o the day by stuffin imself  ay and ive noticed observed one of the young hunters that it takes a deal o stuffin to fill him out properly for he keeps on at it most part o the day  except remarked another when he stops to smoke what o the stuffin has been already shoved down  moreover added the seaman ive noticed that francois la certe always keeps im company  hes a sympathetic sort o man is francois fond o helpin his matesspecially when theyre eatin an smokin  at this moment kateegoose having been called came forward  he was an illfavoured savage with various expressions on his ugly visage which were not so much natures gifts as the result of his own evil passions jealousy was one of them and he had often turned a green eye on okematan  there were indications about his mouth and fingers as he came forward that justified the commentaries on his habits and betrayed recent acquaintance with fat pork  you hear the reports that have just been brought in said dechamp  kateegoose hears was the laconic answer  kateegoose is a cree continued dechamp he knows the spirit that dwells in the hearts of his tribe  what does he think  the thoughts of the indian are many and deep  he has for many moons watched the behaviour of okematan and he has long suspected that the heart of the serpent dwells in the breast of that chief  now he is sure  but what about your people demanded the campchief  they are not at war with us  are they all villains because one among them turns out to be bad  kateegoose drew himself up with a look of dignity and pouted his greasy lips as he replied  the crees have always been a brave and true and upright people  they never attack friends until by their conduct these friends have become enemies  but the crees are human  they are not perfectneither are the palefaces  there are bad men among thema few not manyas well as young men and foolish  sometimes when on the warpath a clever bad man can reason with them till he blinds them and they are ready to do wrong  it may be so now  okematan is clever  kateegoose does not know what to advise  kateegoose was not asked to advise returned dechamp sternly  he may return to his tent  thus summarily dismissed this hangeron or campfollower returned to his pork and pipe with a feeling that somehow he had failed to make the exact impression on the leader that he desired  la certe however consoled him and helped him to continue the duties of the day  come with me mckay said dechamp after giving all needful directions regarding the safety of the camp  i dont believe that rascal kateegoose  hes a greedy idler something like la certe but by no means so harmless or goodnatured  moreover i find it hard to believe that okematan has turned traitor  i agree with you said fergus  it iss ferry hard to believe that a man who has been so long among us and got such a good character should suddenly turn against usan that too without provocation  but what will you be sayin to what taniel and myself has seen with our two eyes  it looks bad i confess answered dechamp as they paced to and fro in a retired part of the camp but you must remember that your two eyes are not your two ears and that you heard nothing that you could understand  fery true dechamp  but the language of the eye is sometimes as clear and understandable as the language of the ear  no wan could mistake the meanin o some o the warriors when they scowled an pointed in the direction of our camp here an gripped the handles o their scalpin knives and tomahawks  moreover okematan also pointed in the same direction though i am bound to say he did not grip his knife  whether he scowled or not i do not know for he was standin wi his back to us  well i cannot tell  im not willin to believe okematan a traitor but what you have seen is enough to make me put the camp in defence instead of startin out to hunt  at that moment the sharp click of a gun was heard as a neighbouring sentry put his piece on full cock  dechamp and fergus hastened towards him  have a care andre dont be too quick with your gun said the former i see only one man coming  he can do us no harm  as the approaching figure drew near it was seen to be that of an indian on horseback  he rode carelessly at a jogtrot  it looks like okematan said dechamp glancing at his companion in surprise  it iss okematan returned fergus  before another word could be spoken a shot was heard in the camp and horse and man were seen to roll upon the ground  the latter rose immediately but the horse lay stiffevidently shot dead  for a few seconds profound silence followed the incident as if men were too much taken by surprise to think and act  then when the dismounted indian was seen to walk leisurely as if unhurt towards them there was a hubbub in the camp while men women and boys ran towards the spot whence the shot seemed to have been fired but no one was to be found there  only a very faint puff of smoke overhead told where the marksman had stood  it had been a wellchosen spot where a low bush or two mingled with several carts that had been rather carelessly drawn up and several horses had been picketed together  these had afforded concealment enough for at least a few moments  the tent of la certe was not far from this corner  at the time the shot was heard the selfindulgent halfbreed was inside recumbent on his back in the enjoyment of a pipe  thats odd he said to slowfoot who was seated opposite to her lord scraping the remnants of something out of a tin kettle with the point of a scalpingknife  somebodys gun gone off by accident i suppose  i hear some one at our fire  look out slowfoot and ask what has happened  slowfoot finished the scraping of the kettle before obeying then lifted the curtain that closed the opening of their tent and peeped out  it is kateegooseloading his gun i think  la certe got up with a sigh of regret at the necessity for exertion and lifting the curtaindoor stepped out  what are they firing at kateegoose  the indian did not know  some one he thought might have let off his gun by accident  he thought it wise however to be ready and had just sent the ramrod down the barrel of his gun to make sure that it was loaded with ball  to make still surer that all was ready the indian shook the priming out of the pan of his gun wiped it and reprimed then he laid the weapon down by his side and resumed the pipe which he had apparently laid down to enable him to perform these operations more conveniently and at the same time with more safety  at that moment dechamp walked smartly towards the fire in front of la certes tent  does kateegoose know who fired that shot he asked with a keen glance for his suspicions had been aroused  some one over there answered the indian languidly as he pointed in the right direction  it does not need a medicineman to tell me that said dechamp sternly  i heard the shot and saw the smoke  have you any idea who fired it la certe  i have not replied the halfbreed  i was lying in my tent when i heard it  kateegoose was smoking beside the fire  we both thought it was an accident or some one trying his gun till we heard the shouting and running  then i jumped up seized my gun and sprang out to see what it was all about  i found kateegoose equally on the qui vive he was shoving his ramrod down to make sure his gun was loaded when you came up  what is it all about  only that the horse of okematan has been shot under him by some one and that there is a wouldbe murderer in the camp  okematan  has the traitor ventured to return exclaimed kateegoose with an expression of surprise that was very unusual in an indian  ay he has ventured responded dechamp and some one has ventured to fire at him with intent to kill  by good luck he was a bad shot  he missed the man though he hit and killed the horse  but i shall find the rascal out before longhe may depend on that  so saying the commandant left the spot  do you know anything about this asked la certe turning full on the indian  kateegoose is not a medicineman  he cannot be in two places at once he knows nothing  for a sly man la certe was wonderfully credulous  he believed the indian and returning to his tent lay down again to finish the interrupted pipe  kateegoose was trying his gun to see if it was loaded he said to his better half  thats a lie returned slowfoot with that straightforward simplicity of diction for which she was famous  indeed  what then was he doing my slowfoot  he was loading his gunnot trying it  are you sure  am i sure that our little child loves tobacco  well i suppose you are  at any rate the child often asks you for a pipe and gets it too  hm if kateegoose fired that shot he must be a bad man  but our chief is sure to find it outandit is no business of mine  fetch me the tobacco slowfoot  that same morning archie sinclair was seated beside his brother little bill in the tent that was shared by fred jenkins and several young halfbreeds  he was alone with his brother jenkins having gone out with the blunderbuss to assist if need be in the defence of the camp he was manufacturing a small bow for his brother to amuse himself with while he should be away seein the fun as he said with the hunters the instant the sailor left however he looked at billie mysteriously and said in a low voice  little bill although youre not good for much with your poor little body youve got a splendid headpiece and are amazing at giving advice i want advice just now very bad  youve heard what theyve all been saying about this shot that was fired at okematan and some o the men say they think it must have been kateegoose that did it  now billie i am sure that it was kateegoose that did it  oh exclaimed little bill making his eyes and mouth into three round os  how dye know that  did you see him do it  noits that that bothers me  if i had seen him do it i would have gone straight and told dechamp but i didnt quite see him you see  i was in lamartines cart at the time rummagin about for a piece o wood to make this very bow an the moment i heard the shot i peeped out an sawnothing  that wasnt much remarked little bill innocently  ay but i soon saw something continued archie with increasing solemnity i saw kateegoose coming slinking round among the carts as if he wanted not to be seen  i saw him only for a momentgliding past like a ghost  its a serious thing said little bill musing gravely to charge a man with tryin to kill another man if thats all youve got to tell for you know its a way the redskins have of always glidin about as if they was for ever after mischief  but thats not all little bill returned his brother for im almost certain that i saw a little smoke comin out o the muzzle of his gun as he passedthough i couldnt exactly swear to it  archie had overrated his brothers powers in the way of advice for although they talked the matter over for some time they failed to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion  meanwhile okematan having entered the camp was met by dechamp and led by him to a retired part  you have an enemy here okematan he said inquiringly  it would seem so returned the indian gravely  friends do not shoot each others horses and if the poor horse had not tossed his head when the shot was fired his rider would have bit the dust  i fear it looks something like that said dechamp but i hope okematan believes that i know nothing of the matternor can i tell who the cowardly villain is that did it  okematan knows that answered the indian sternly  no halfbreed fired the shot  there is no indian in the camp but kateegoose rejoined the other quickly surely you dont think that a man of your own tribe would try to kill you  i know not  kateegoose hates me  no other man in the camp hates me  it is strangeunaccountable returned dechamp  if the indian did it he shall forfeit his horse and leave the camp  but tell mehere the halfbreed commandant turned a searching gaze on his companion why did okematan leave us and spend all night alone on the prairie  did he spend the night in conversation with the buffaloor in the company of his departed forefathers  no sign of surprise or of any other emotion was visible on the countenance of the redman as he replied okematan went out to meet a party of his tribe on the warpath  dechamp was not so successful in concealing his own surprise at this answer  does the cree chief he asked with something of doubt in his tone and look choose the hours of night to consult with warriors about secret assaults and surprises on friends  he does not answered the indian decidedly but calmlythough he was unquestionably astonished at being questioned so pointedly and correctly as to his recent proceedings and felt that he must have been followed he was not the man however to betray his feelings or to commit himself in any way therefore he took refuge in silence  come now okematan said his companion in a confidential tone  dont let a misunderstanding arise between you and me  what is this that i have heard  you spent last night as you admit with a party of crees on the warpath  you were seen and heard and the men of the camp think you have turned traitor and they are even now expecting an attack from this warparty  is it true that we are to be attacked  you say i was heard answered the indian looking the halfbreed straight in the face  if so those who heard must know what i said  nay they did indeed hear but they did not understand for they know not your language but they know the language of signs and by the looks and gestures of the warriors they guessed what was said and planned  is it likely asked the indian in a low voice that okematan would return to your camp alone and put himself in your power if an attack was intended  true true returned dechamp with a hearty air and to say truth i myself did notdo notbelieve you false  if you tell me the truth okematan and give me your word that this report is a mistaken one i will believe you and trust you  the indian seemed pleased with the assurance thus heartily given but still maintained his dignified gravity as he said  okematan always tells the truth  he had hoped that the folly of some young braves of his tribe should never have been known to any one but since it has been found out he will tell all he knows to his palefaced brother  hereupon he related all that had transpired at the council of war and the final success of his own speech with that of the old warrior in producing a peaceful solution  but are you sure they will follow your advice asked dechamp  yes okematan is quite sure  well then as i said i will trust you returned dechamp extending his hand which the indian gravely grasped and i will give you undeniable proof by giving my young men orders to start after the buffalo at oncewithout further delay    chapter seventeen  the buffalohunt  in accordance with the assurance given to okematan antoine dechamp at once gave orders to make preparation for an immediate start after the buffalomuch to the satisfaction of the hunters especially the young ones  buffaloesor to speak more correctly bisonsroamed over the north american prairies at the time we write of in countless thousands for the indians although extremely wasteful of animal life could not keep their numbers down and the aggressive whiteman with his deadly gun and rifle had only just begun to depopulate the plains  therefore the hunters had not to travel far before coming up with their quarry  in a very brief space of time they were all drawn up in line under command of their chosen leader who at least up to the moment of giving the signal for attack kept his men in reasonably good order  they had not ridden long when the huge ungainly bisons were seen like black specks on the horizon  still the horsemeneach armed with the muzzleloading singlebarrelled flintlock gun of the periodadvanced cautiously until so near that the animals began to look up as if in surprise at the unwonted intrusion on their great solitudes  then the signal was given the horses stretched out at the gallop the buffalo began to runat first heavily as if great speed were impossible to them but gradually the pace increased until it attained to racing speed  then the hunters gave the rein to their eager steeds and the long line rushed upon the game like a tornado of centaurs  from this point all discipline was at an end  each man fought for his own hand killing as many animals as he could so that ere long the plain was strewn with carcases and the air filled with gunpowder smoke  we have said that all the hunters set out but this is not strictly correct for three were left behind  one of these had fallen sick one had sprained his wrist and another was lazy  it need scarcely be told that the lazy one was francois la certe  there is no hurry he said when the hunters were assembling for the start plenty of time  my horse has not yet recovered from the fatigues of the journey  and who knows but the report of the buffalo being so near may be false  i will wait and see the result  tomorrow will be time enough to begin  then slowfoot you will see what i can do  your hands shall be busy  we will load our cart with meat and pemmican pay off all our debts and spend a happy winter in red river what have you got there in the kettle  pork answered slowfoot with characteristic brevity  will it soon be ready  soon  have you got the tea unpacked  yes  send me your pipe  this latter speech was more in the tone of a request than a command and the implied messenger from the opposite side of the fire was the baby baby la certe  we never knew its name if it had one and we have reason to believe that it was a female baby  at the time baby was quite able to walkat least to waddle or toddle  a brief order from the maternal lips sent baby la certe toddling round the fire towards its father pipe in hand but short though the road was it had time to pause and consider  evidently the idea of justice was strongly developed in that child  fair wage for fair work had clearly got hold of it for it put the pipe which was still alight in its mouth and began to draw  at this the father smiled benignly but slowfoot made a demonstration which induced a rather prompt completion of the walk without a reasonable wage  it sucked vigorously all the time however being evidently well aware that francois was not to be feared  at that moment the curtain of the tent lifted and little bill sinclair limped in  he was a favourite with la certe who made room for him and at once offered him the pipe but billie declined  no thank you la certe  i have not learned to smoke yet  ha you did not begin young enough said the halfbreed glancing proudly at his own offspring  we may explain here once for all that although he had lived long enough in the colony to understand french billie spoke to his friend in english and that although la certe understood english he preferred to speak in french  what have you been doing he asked when the boy had seated himself  ive been shooting at a mark with my bow and arrowbrother archie made it for me  let me seeyes it is very well made  where is brother archie  gone after the buffalo  whaton a horse  he could not go very well after them on footcould he replied the boy quietly  dan davidson lent him a horse but not a gun  he said that archie was too young to use a gun on horseback and that he might shoot some of the people instead of the buffalo or burst his gun or fall off  but i dont think so  archie can do anything  i know for ive seen him do it  and so he has left you in camp all by yourself  what a shame billie  no francois it is not a shame  would you have me keep him from the fun just because i cant go  that would indeed be a shame wouldnt it  well perhaps youre right billie  i know im right returned the boy with a decision of tone that would have been offensive if it had not been accompanied with a look of straightforward gentleness that disarmed resentment  but i say francois why are you not out with the rest  oh becausebecausewell you know my horse is tired andand im not quite sure that the buffalo really have been seen as near as they say  and i can go tomorrow just as well  you see billie there is no need to hurry oneself  no i dont see that  i think theres always need for hurry specially with men like you  i know the reason you dont go out better than yourself francois  yeswhat is it asked the halfbreed with a slight laugh  its laziness  thats what it is and you should be ashamed of yourself  the large mild eyes and low voice and pale earnest face of the plainspoken invalid were such that it would have been impossible for any one to be offended with him much less la certe whose spirit of indignation it was almost impossible to arouse  he winced a little at the homethrust however because he knew it to be true  youre hard on me little bill he said with a benignant look as he picked a stick from the fire and inserted its glowing end in his pipe  no im not hard returned the boy gravely  indeed he was always grave and seldom laughed though he sometimes smiled faintly at the jokes and quips of his volatile brother and fred jenkins the seaman im not half hard enough he continued i like you francois and thats the reason why i scold you and try to get you to mend  i dont think theres such a lazy man in the whole settlement as you  you would rather sit and smoke and stuff yourself with pork all day than take the trouble to saddle your horse and get your gun and go out with the rest why are you so lazy francois  im sure i dont know little bill unless it be that im born to be lazy  other people are born i suppose to be active and energetic they like activity and energy and so they do it  i like repose and quiet andso i do that  not much difference after all  we both do what we like best  little bill was perplexed  although philosophical in tendency he had not had sufficient experience in sophistical reasoning to enable him to disentangle the sinuosities of bad logic  but he was a resolute little fellow and not easily quelled  what would happen he asked if everybody in the world did as you do  well i suppose everybody would enjoy themselves  there would be no more fightings or wars or any trouble of that sort if everybody would only take things easy and smoke the pipe of peace  hm  i dont know about that returned the boy doubtfully but im quite sure there would not be much pemmican in red river this winter if all the hunters were like you  i wonder youre not ashamed francois sometimes i think that youre not worth caring about but i cant help it you knowwe cant force our likings one way or other  la certe was a good deal taken aback  he was not indeed unaccustomed to plain speaking and to the receipt of gratuitous abuse but his experience invariably was to associate both with more or less of a stern voice and a frowning brow  to receive both in a soft voice from a delicate meekfaced child who at the same time professed to like him was a complete novelty which puzzled him not a little  after a few minutes profound consideration he put out his pipe and arose quickly with something like an appearance of firmness in his look and bearing  slowfoot whose utter ignorance of both french and english prevented her understanding the drift of the recent conversation was almost startled by the unfamiliar action of her lord  where go you she asked  to follow the buffalo answered la certe with all the dignity of a man bursting with good resolutions  are you ill asked his wife anxiously  to this he vouchsafed no reply as he raised the curtain and went out  little bill also went out and sitting down on a package watched him with his large solemn eyes but said never a word until the halfbreed had loaded his gun and mounted his horse  then he said good luck to you francois  la certe did not speak but with a grave nod of his head rode slowly out of the camp  little bill regarded him for a moment  he had his bow and a bluntheaded arrow in his hand at the time  fitting the latter hastily to the bow he took a rapid shot at the retreating horseman  the arrow sped well  it descended on the flank of the horse with considerable force and bounding off fell to the ground  the result was that the horse to la certes unutterable surprise made a sudden demivolt into the airwithout the usual persuasionalmost unseated its rider and fled over the prairie like a thing possessed  a faint smile ruffled the solemnity of little bill at this but it vanished when he heard a low chuckle behind him  wheeling round he stood face to face with slowfoot whose mouth was expanded from ear to ear  clever boy she said patting him on the back come into the tent and have some grub  she said this in the cree language which the boy did not understand but he understood well enough the signs with which the invitation was accompanied  thanking her with an eloquent look he reentered the tent along with her    chapter eighteen  adventures of archie and the seaman  meanwhile the buffalohunt progressed favourably and the slaughter of animals was considerable  but there were two members of that hunt whose proceedings were not in exact accord with the habits and laws of the chase as usually conducted on the red river plains  these were the seaman jenkins and archie sinclair  a mutual attachment having sprung up between these two they had arranged to keep together during the chase and when the signal for attack was given by dechamp as before related they had set sail according to jenkins fairly well with the rest  but they had not gone more than a few hundred yards when the boy observed that his nautical friend was hauling at both reins furiously as if desirous of stopping his horse  having a gun in one hand he found the operation difficult  archie therefore reined in a little  bad luck to it growled jenkins as his young friend drew near the jaws o this craft seem to be made o castiron but ill bring him to if i should haul my arms out o the sockets  heaveto my lad  maybe hell be willin to follow a good example  archie pulled up and as the seaman had hoped the hardmouthed steed stopped while the maddened buffalo and the almost as much maddened hunters went thundering on and were soon far ahead of them  whats wrong jenkins asked archie on seeing the sailor dismount  not much lad only i want to take a haul at the main brace  here hold my gun a bit like a good chap the saddle you see aint all right an if it was to slew round you know id be overboard in a jiffy  there thats all right  now well up anchor an off again i know now that the right way to git on board is by the port side  when i started from red river i was goin to climb up on the starboard side but dan davidson kep me rightthough he had a good laugh at me  all right now  hand me the gun  do you mean to say jenkins that you never got on a horse till you came to red river asked archie with a laugh as they galloped off in pursuit of the hunters who were almost out of sight by that time  well youve no occasion to laugh lad returned the seaman  ive bin at sea ever since i was a small shaver scarce half as long as a handspike so i aint had many opportunities dee see for we dont have cavalry at sea as a rulealways exceptin the horse marines  then im afraid youll find runnin the buffalo somewhat difficult returned the boy  not that i know anything about it myself for this is the first time ive been out an even now dan wont let me use a gun but ive often heard the men talkin about it an some o them have complained that they have found it uncommon difficult to load when at full gallopspecially when the horse is hard in the mouth  i make no manner o doubt youre right lad but ive got my sealegs on now so to speak leastwise ive got used to ridin in the trip out here as well as used to steerin wi the tillerropes in front which seems to me right in the teeth o natur though i couldnt see how it could well be otherwise  but i confess that my chief difficulty is the ordnance for it interferes a good deal wi the steerin howsevernever ventur never win you know  i never expected to take up a noo purfession without some trouble  as he spoke the seamans horsea large brown chestnutput its foot in a hole and plunged forward with great violence barely escaping a fall  hold on shouted archie in alarm  hold on it is sang out the sailor in reply  and hold on it was for he had the chestnut round the neck with both arms  indeed he was sitting or lying on its neck altogether  it aint an easy job he gasped while he struggled to regain the saddle when a fellow gets hove on to the bowsprit this way to git fairly back on the maindeck again  but a jenkins never was beaten in fair fight  thats all right  now then archie youre an obleegin cove  do git down an pick up the gun for me  you see if i git down its a tryin job to git up againthe side o this here craft bein so steep an so high out o the water  thankee why boy you jump down an up like a powdermonkey  it aint broke is it  no  it seems all right answered the boy as he handed the gun to its owner  but if you let it go like that often it wont be much worth when the runs over  let it go boy repeated the sailor  it was either let it or myself go an when it comes to a toss up o that sort fred jenkins knows how to look arter number one  it will be seen from all this that our seaman was not quite so much at home on the prairie as on the sea  indeed if the expression be permissible he was very much at sea on that undulating plain and did not take so kindly to the green waves of the rolling prairie as to the heaving billows of the restless ocean but as archie remarked he was fast getting broke in  the incidents which we have mentioned however were but the commencement of a series of disasters to poor jenkins which went far to cure him of a desire to excel in the noo purfession and to induce a somewhat violent longing for a return to his first love the ocean  i cant think what ever could have made you want to come out here said archie as they continued to follow up the still distant hunters  what was it made yourself want to come out lad asked the sailor  it wasnt me that wanted to come  it was father you know an of course i had to follow said the boy in a tone which induced his friend to say hastily and in a tone of sympathy  ah poor lad i forgot you was a orphing  well you see i think it must ha bin a love o change or a love o discontent or suthin o that sort as brought me cruising in these here waters for i cant say what else it was  you see i was born a sort o rooh  look out a badgerhole shouted the boy  his warning would have been too late but the chestnut fortunately leaped over the danger instead of stumbling into it and its rider was only partially shaken out of his seat  its well he said when fairly settled down again to an easy gallop that the tillerropes are stout else id ha bin over the starn this time instead of out on the bowsprit  let me see what was i sayin of  somethin about your bein born a sort of rooh though what that may be i havent a notion  ah jist soi was born a sort o rover when this longlegged brute took the badgerhole an ive bin to every quarter o the globe amost but if id lived to the age o methooslum id never ha thought o comin herefor the good reason that i knowed nothin o its existenceif i hadnt by chance in a furrin port fallen in wi andre morel an took an uncommon fancy to him  you see at the time i was well i was no better nor i should be praps a deal wuss an morel he meets me an sayshallo my lad says he where away  i looked at him grufflike a moment or two for it seemed to me he was raither too familiar for a stranger but hes got such a pleasant hearty look with himas you knowthat i couldnt feel riled with im so im goin on the spree says i  all right says he im with ee lad  dye know the town  no more than a mother careys chicken says i  come along then says he ill tak ee to a fustrate shop  so off we went arm in arm as thick as two peas an after passin through two or three streets he turns into a shop that smelt strong o coffee  hallo mate says i youve made some sort o mistake  this here aint the right sort o shop  o yes it is says he smilin quite affablelike  the best o tipple here an cheap too  come along  ive got somethin very partikler to say to you  look here waitertwo cups o coffee hot an strong some buttered toast an no end o buns etceterer  wi that he led me to a seat an we sat down  i was so took aback an amused that i waited to see what would foller an what hed got to say that was so partiklerbut i say archie them buffalo runners has got the wind o us an are showin us their heels i fear  never fear returned the boy rising in his stirrups and shading his eyes to look ahead  they do seem to be leavin us a bit but you see by the dust that the buffalo are holdin away to the right so if we keep still more to the right an cut round that knoll i think well be safe to catch them up  theyre doin good work as the carcasses weve passed and the rattle o shots clearly show  but get on wi your story jenkins  well it aint much of a story lad  what morel had to say was that hed arranged wi an agent o lord selkirk to come out to this country an he was goin out wi a lot o his relations an was beatin up for a few good hands an he liked the look o me an would i agree to go wi him  well as you may believe this was a poser an i said id think over it an let him know next day  you see i didnt want to seem to jump at it too eagerlike though i liked the notion an i had neither wife nor sweetheart nor father or mother to think about for im a orphing you see like yourself archieonly a somewhat bigger one  well when wed finished all the coffee an all the buns an all the etceterers he began to advise me not to ha nothin more to do wi grogshops  i couldnt tell ee the half o what he saidno nor the quarterbut he made such a impression on me that i was more than halfconvinced  to say truth i was so chokefull o coffee an buns an etceterers that i dont believe i could ha swallowed another drop o liquor  where are ye goin now says he when wed done  back to my ship says i  come an ha tea tomorrow wi me an my sister says he an well have another talk about ruperts land  i will says i  six oclock sharp says he  sharps the word says i  an sure enough i went to his house sharp to time next day an there i found him an his sister  she was as pretty a craft as i ever set eyes on wi a modest look an long fair ringletsjust borderin on nineteen or thereawaybut you know her archie so i neednt say no more  what is that the same woman thats keeping house for him now in red river  woman repeated the sailor vehemently shes not a womanshes a angel is elise morel  dont speak disrespectful of her lad  i wont returned archie with a laugh but what was the upshot of it all  the upshot of it answered the seaman was that ive never touched a drop o strong drink from that day to this an that im now blown entirely out o my old courses an am cruisin arter the buffalo on the plains o ruperts land  at this point their minds being set free from the consideration of past history they made the discovery that the buffalo runners were nowhere to be seen on the horizon and that they themselves were lost on the grassy sea  what shall we do said the boy when they had pulled up to consider their situation  you see although i came out here a good while before you did he added half apologetically ive never been out on the plains without a guide and dont know a bit how to find the way back to camp  the prairie is almost as bad as the sea youre so fond of with a clear horizon all round and nothing worth speaking of to guide us  an as you have never been in the plains before of course you know nothing in short jenkins i greatly fear that we are lost  why what are you grinning at  the terminal question was induced by the fact that the tall seaman was looking down at his anxious companion with a broad smile on his handsome sunburnt countenance  so were lost are we archie he said like two sweet babes on the prairie instead of in the woods  an you think i knows nothin  well praps i dont know much but you should remember lad that an old salt wi a compass in his weskitpocket is not the man to lose his recknin  ive got one here asll put us all right on that score for i was careful to take my bearins when we set sail an ive been keepin an eye on our course all the way  make your mind easy my boy  so saying the sailor pulled out the compass referred to and consulted it  then he pulled out a watch of the warmingpan type which he styled a chronometer and consulted that also after which he looked up at the cloudsseamanlikeand round the horizon especially to windward if we may speak of such a quarter in reference to a day that was almost quite calm  now archie boy the upshot o my cogitations is that with a light breeze on our starboard quarter a clear sky overhead an a clear conscience within you and i had better hold on our course for a little longer and see whether we cant overhaul the runners  if we succeed good and well  if not why boutship and homewardbound is the sailin orders  what say ee lad  i say whatever you say jenkins  if youre sure o the way back as ive no doubt you are why there couldnt be greater fun than to go after the buffalo on our own account  andi say look there  isnt that somethin like them on the top o the far bluff yonder  a fellow like you wi sharp sailoreyes ought to be able to make them out  you forget lad that i aint a buffalo runner an dont know the cut o the brutes jibs yet  it does look like somethin  come well go an see  putting their horses to the gallop the two curiously matched friends taking advantage of every knoll and hollow succeeded in getting sufficiently near to perceive that a small herd was grazing quietly in a grassy bottom between two prairie waves  they halted at once for consultation  now then archie said the sailor examining the priming of his gun here we are at last agoin to begin a pitched battle  theres this to be said for us that neither you nor me knows rightly how to go to work both on us havin up to this time bin trained so to speak on hearsay  but what o that  in the language o the immortial nelson england expecs every man to do his dooty  now it seems to me my dooty on the present occasion is to lay myself alongside of a buffalo an blaze away  isnt that the order o battle  yes  but dont go for a bull and dont go too close for fear he turns sharp round an catches you on his horns  you know the bulls are apt to do that sometimes  trust me lad ill keep clear o the bulls  and you understand how to reload asked the boy  o yes all right  dan put me thro the gunnery practice on the way out an i went through it creditably  only a slight hitch now and then  two or three balls in the mouth ready to spit into the gun  not all at once though jenkins  in course not lad one at a time no ramming hit the butt on the saddle blaze away one down another come oneh  thats it said archie eager for the fray  how i wish dan had let me have a gun  safer not lad  an keep well in rear for i may be apt to fire wide in the heat of action  with this final caution the mariner put his gun on full cock shook the reins and trotted quietly forward until he saw that the buffalo had observed him  then as he afterwards expressed it he clapped on all sailstunsls alow and aloft and skyscrapersand went into action like a true blue british tar with little archie sinclair full sail astern  he did not however come out of action with as much eclat as he went into it but justice obliges us to admit that he came out victorious  we cannot do better than give his own description of that action as related beside the campfire that night to a circle of admiring friends  well you must know he began after finishing his supper and lighting his pipe that longlegged frigate o mine that dan calls a chestnut though a cocoanut would be more like the thing if you take size into accounthes as keen for the chase as a small boy arter a butterfly an before i could say jack robinson amost he had me into the middle o the herd an alongside o the big bull  any one could tell it was him in spite o the dust we kicked up by reason o the sideglance o his wicked little eye his big hairy foreid an his tail stickin out stiff like a crookd spankerboom  in course i was not agoin to fire into him so i gave the frigate a dig wi my heelstho id got no irons on eman tried to shove up alongside of a fat young cow as was skylarkin on ahead  as we went past the bull he made a vicious dab wi his horn and caught the frigate on her flankright abaft the mizzen chains like  whew you should ha seen what a sheer she made right away to starboard  if it hadnt bin that i was on the lookout id ha bin slap overboard that time but i seed the squall comin an seizin my brutes mane held on like a monkey wi hand an leg  well before i knew where i was the cocoani mean the chestnut had me alongside the cow  i stuck the muzzle amost into her ribs and let drive  down she went by the head fairly scuttled an i could hear young archie givin a wild cheer astern  thats the way to go it jenkins he yelled  load again  but it was easier said than done i can tell you  you see ive bin brought up to cartridges all my life an the change to pullin a stopper out o a horn wi your teeth pourin the powder into your left hand wi the gun under your left arm an the pitchin o the frigate like as if it was in a cross sea was raither perplexin  howsever it had to be done for i was alongside of another cow in a jiffy  i nigh knocked out two o my front teeth in tryin to shove the stopper in my mouth  then when i was pourin the powder into my hand i as near as could be let fall the gun which caused me to give a sort of gasp of anxiety when two o the three bullets dropped out o my mouth but i held on to the third wi my teeth  just then a puff o wind blew the powder out o my hand into the buffalos eyes causin her to bellow like a foghorn an obleegin me to pour out another charge  i did it hastily as you may well believe an about three times what i wanted came out  howsever i lost a deal of it in pourin it into the gun then i spat the ball in gettin another nasty rap on the teeth as i did so but id bit the ball so that it stuck halfway down  it was no time to think o trifles  i gave the butt an extra bang on the pommel to send the ball home shoved the muzzle right in among the hair an pulled the trigger  there was a bang that sounded to me as if the ships magazine had blown up  it was followed by a constellation o fireworks andarchie sinclair must tell you what happened arter that for i misremember the whole on it  the fireworks closed the scene to me  archie nothing loath and with glistening eyes took up the narrative at this point while the hero of the hour rekindled his pipe  the fact is he said the gun had burstwas blown to atoms not a bit o the barrel left and a great lump o the stock struck jenkins on the head stunned him and tumbled him off his horse  that was the magazine explosion and fireworks explained jenkins  but the queer thing was continued archie that the buffalo fell dead and on examining it we found that a bit o the barrel had been driven right into its brain  ay boy but it was queerer still that none o the pieces struck me or my horse cept that bit o the stock  an im none the worse barrin this lump on the head that only serves to cock my hat a little more to one side than seems becomin to a soberminded man  we were sorry to be able to bring away so little o the meat said archie with the gravity of an old hunter but you see it was too late to send a cart for it after we got back  never mind said dan davidson when the narrative was brought to a close you have done very well for a beginning  moreover added fergus it iss a goot feast the wolves will be havin on the plains this night an so archie ill be wishin ye better luck next time    chapter nineteen  bright hopes terminate in furious war  turning once again to the colony at red river we introduce the reader to the scotch settlers in the autumn of the yearat a time when there was some appearance of the commencement of a season of prosperity after all the troubles that had befallen and surrounded and wellnigh overwhelmed them in time past  the davidson and mckay families had reestablished themselves on their farms rebuilt their houses and planted their fields and splendid crops of all kinds were now flourishing ready for spade and sickle  the soil was found to be excellent  in after years fortyfold was no uncommon return  in one case for a bushel of barley sown fiftysix bushels were reaped and from a bushel of seed potatoes were obtained one hundred and fortyfive bushels  industry however had not at that time been rewarded with such encouraging results but there was sufficient to indicate cheering prospects in the near future and to gladden the hearts of the pioneer settlers  as a good number of these had under the depressing influence of disappointment and failure in the past neglected to sow extensively not a few families were forced again to winter at pembina and draw their supplies from the chase to avoid consuming all the seed which alone ensured them against famine  among these were the swiss families most of whom being watch and clock makers pastrycooks mechanics and musicians were not well adapted for agricultural pursuits  perhaps they were as illadapted for the chase but seed takes time to sow and grow whereas animals need no prolonged nursingat least from manand are quickly killed if one can shoot  the young leader of the switzers however andre morel soon left his party at pembina under the care of his lieutenant and returned to red river settlement bent on mastering the details of husbandry so as to be able afterwards to direct the energies of his compatriots into a more profitable occupation than the chase  for this purpose he sought and obtained employment with the davidsons in the new and enlarged edition of prairie cottage  his sister elise was engaged by old mckay to act as companion and assistant to his daughter elspie  both the curlyhaired andre and the fair blueeyed elise proved to be invaluable acquisitions in the households in which they had found a home for both were lively intelligent companions hard workers at whatever they undertook and were possessed of sweet melodious voices  andre also performed on the violin an instrument which has played a prominent part in the wild norwest ever since the whiteman set down his foot there  what do you think elspie of my brothers plan of taking the farm just below this one after he has had enough experience to be able to work it himself asked elise  it will be very nice to have him settled so near us  do you think he will take the whole of it  i think so  you see the terms on which the earl has granted the land are so easy and the supplies of goods oatmeal clothing and farm implements sent us so generous that andre finds he will have money enough to enable him to start  then that strong goodnatured seaman fred jenkins has actually agreed to serve as a man on the farm for a whole year for nothing except of course his food and lodging  isnt it generous of him  do you know why he is going to serve him for nothing asked elspie with a quick look and smile  noi do not returned fair little elise with an innocent look  do you  o noof course i dont i can only guess replied her companion with a light laugh  perhaps it is because he knows his services as a farm servant cant be worth much at first  there you are wrong returned elise stoutly  no doubt he is ignorant as yet about sowing and reaping and the like but he is wonderfully strongjust like a giant at lifting and carryingand he has become quite knowing about horses and carting and such things  all that he stipulates for is that he shall board in our house  he says hell manage somehow to make enough money to buy all the clothes he wants  what a delightful kind of servant said elspie with an arch look which was quite thrown away on elise and so disinterested to do it without any reason  o but he must have some reason you know rejoined elise  i shouldnt wonder if it was out of gratitude to my brother who was very kind to himso he saysthe first time they met  did he say that was his reason asked elspie quickly  no he did not say so but he has said more than once that he feels very grateful to my brother and it has just occurred to me that that may be his reason  it would be very naturalwouldnt it  oh very naturalvery returned the other  but dyou know elise i dont like your brothers plan at all  no why  because dont you see foolish girl that it will take you away from me  you will of course want to keep house for your brother and i have become so used to you short though our intercourse has been that i dont see how i can get on at all without you  never mind elspie dear  it will be a long while before andre is ready to take the farm  besides by that time you know you and dan will be married so you wont miss me muchthough i confess i should like you to miss me a little  elspie sighed at this point  i suspect that our marriage will not be so soon as you think elise she said  dan has tried to arrange it more than once but there seems to be a fate against it for something always comes in the way  surely nothing will happen this time said the sympathetic elise everything begins to prosper now  the crops are beautiful the weather is splendid the house is ready to begin toall the logs are cut and squared  your father is quite willing and dan wishing for the day what more could you desire elspie  nothing all seems well but she finished the sentence with another sigh  while the two friends were thus conversing in the dairy old mckay and dan davidson were talking on the same subject in the hall of ben nevis  it iss a curious fact taniel said the old man with a pleased look that it wass in this fery room in the old hoose that wass burnt and about the same time of the year too that you would be speakin to me about this fery thing  an i do not think that we will be troubled this time wi the norwesters whateverthough wan never knows what a tay may bring furth  that is the very reason sir said davidson that i want to get married at once so that if anything does happen again i may claim the right to be elspies protector  quite right my boy quite right though i must say i would like to wait till a real munister comes out for although mr sutherland iss a fery goot man an an elder too he iss not chust exactly a munister you know as i have said before  but have it your own way tan  if my little lass is willin old tuncan mckay wont stand in your way  that night the inhabitants of red river lay down to sleep in comfort and to dream perchance of the coming though long delayed prosperity that had hitherto so often eluded their grasp  next day an event occurred which gave the poor settlers new cause for grief amounting almost to despair  dan davidson and elspie were walking on the verandah in front of ben nevis at the time  it was a warm sunny afternoon  all around looked the picture of peace and prosperity  does it not seem dan as if all the troubles we have gone through were a dark dreamas if there never had been any reality in them said elspie  it does indeed seem so responded dan and i hope and trust that we shall henceforth be able to think of them as nothing more than a troubled dream  what iss that you will be sayin about troubled dreams asked old mckay coming out of the house at the moment  we were just saying daddy that all our troubles seem  look yonder tan interrupted the old man pointing with his pipestem to a certain part of the heavens  what iss it that i see  a queer cloud whatever  i dont remember seein such a solid cloud as that in all my experience  it is indeed queer  i hope its not what fred jenkins would call a squall brewin up for that wouldnt improve the crops  a squall exclaimed jenkins who chanced to come round the corner of the house at the moment with a spade on his shoulder  thats never a squallno nor a gale nor a simoon nor anything else o the sort that i ever heard of  why its growin bigger an bigger  he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked earnestly at the object in question which did indeed resemble a very dense yet not a black cloud  for some moments the four spectators gazed in silence  then old mckay suddenly dropped his pipe and looked at dan with an expression of intense solemnity  it iss my belief he said in a hoarse whisper that it is them wee deevils the grasshoppers  a very few minutes proved old mckays surmise to be correct  once before the colony had been devastated by this plague and the memory of the result was enough to alarm the most courageous among the settlers who had experienced the calamity though the new arrivals being ignorant were disposed to regard the visitation lightly at first mckay himself became greatly excited when the air became darkened by the cloud which ever increasing in size rapidly approached  haste ye lads he cried to some of the farmservants who had joined the group on the verandah get your spades picks an shovels  be smart now it is not possible to save all the crops but we may try to save the garden whatever  follow me  the garden referred to was not large or of great importance but it was a favourite hobby of the highlander and at the time was in full bloom luxuriant with fruit flower and vegetable  to save it from destruction at such a time mckay would have given almost anything and have gone almost any lengths  on this occasion not knowing what to do yet impelled by his eagerness to do something he adopted measures that he had heard of as being used in other lands  he ordered a trench to be cut and filled with water on the side of his garden nearest the approaching plague which mightif thoroughly carried outhave been of some use against wingless grasshoppers but could be of no use whatever against a flying foe  it would have taken an army of men to carry out such an order promptly and his men perceived this but the master was so energetic so violent in throwing off his coat and working with his own hand at pick and shovel that they were irresistibly infected with his enthusiasm and set to work  old duncan did not however wield pick or shovel long  he was too excited for that  he changed from one thing to another rapidly  fires were to be kindled along the line of defence and he set the example in this also  then he remembered that blankets and other drapery had been used somewhere with great effect in beating back the foe therefore he shouted wildly for his daughter and elise morel  here we are father what can we do  go fetch out all the blankets sheets tablecloths an towels in the house girls  it iss neck or nothin this tay  be smart now  take men to help ye  two men were very busy there piling up little heaps of firewood namely dan davidson and fred jenkins  what more natural than that these two on hearing the order given about blankets and tablecloths etcetera should quit the fires and follow elspie and elise into the house  in the first bedroom into which they entered they found archie and billie sinclair the latter seated comfortably in an armchair close to a window the former wild with delight at the sudden demand on all his energies  for archie had been one of the first to leap to the work when old mckay gave the order  then he had suddenly recollected his little helpless brother and had dashed round to prairie cottage got him on his back run with him to ben nevis hall placed him as we have seen in a position to view the field of battle and then advising him to sit quietly there and enjoy the fun had dashed downstairs to resume his place in the forefront of battle  he had run up again for a moment to inquire how little bill was getting on when the blanket and sheet searchers found them  all right he exclaimed on learning what they came for here you are  look alive  dont stir little bill  he hurled the bedding from a neighbouring bedstead as he spoke tore several blankets from the heap and tumbled rather than ran downstairs with them while the friends he had left behind followed his example  by that time all the inmates and farmservants of prairie cottage had assembled at ben nevis hall attracted either by sympathy or curiosity as to the amazing fracas which old mckay was creating  of course they entered into the spirit of the preparations so that when the enemy at last descended on them they found the garrison ready  but the defenders might as well have remained quiet and gone to their beds  night was drawing near at the time and was as it were precipitated by the grasshoppers which darkened the whole sky with what appeared to be a heavy shower of snow  the fires were lighted water was poured into the trench and the two households fought with blanket sheet counterpane and towel in a manner that proved the courage of the ancient heroes to be still slumbering in men and women of modern days  but what could courage do against such overwhelming odds  thousands were slaughtered  millions pressed on behind  dont give in lads cried the heroic and desperate highlander wielding a great green blanket in a way that might have roused the admiration if not the envy of ajax himself  keep it up jenkins  ay ay sir responded the nautical warrior as he laid about him with an enormous buffalo robe which was the only weapon that seemed sufficiently suited to his gigantic frame never say die as long as theres a shot in the locker  elise stood behind him lost in admiration and giving an imbecile flap now and then with a towel to anything that happened to come in front of her  elspie was more selfpossessed  she tried to wield a jacktowel with some effect while dan fergus duncan junior bourassin andre morel and others ably but uselessly supported their heroic leader  la certe who chanced to be there at the time went actively about encouraging others to do their very best  old peg made a feeble effort to do what she conceived to be her duty and okematan stood by calmly looking onhis grave countenance exhibiting no symptom of emotion but his mind filled with intense surprise not unmingled with pity for the palefaces who displayed such an amount of energy in attempting the impossible  that selfdefence in the circumstances was indeed impossible soon became apparent for the enemy descended in such clouds that they filled up the halfformed ditch extinguished the fires with their dead bodies defied the blanketwarriors and swarmed not only into the garden of old duncan mckay but overwhelmed the whole land  darkness and exhaustion from the fight prevented the people of ben nevis hall and prairie cottage from at first comprehending the extent of the calamity with which they had thus been visited but enough had been seen to convince mckay that his garden was doomed  when he at last allowed the sad truth to force itself into his mind he suffered elspie to lead him into the house  dont grieve daddy she said in a low comforting tone perhaps it wont be as bad as it seems  fetch me my pipe lass he said on reaching his bedroom  gootnight to you my tear he added on receiving the implement of consolation  wont you eator drinksomething daddy dear  nothingnothing  leave me now  we hev had a goot fight whatever an it iss to bed i will be goin now  left alone the old man lay down in his warriorharness so to speak lighted his pipe smoked himself into a sort of philosophical contempt for everything under the sun moon and stars and finally dropped his sufferings as well as his pipe by falling into a profound slumber  next morning when the people of red river arose they became fully aware of the disaster that had befallen them  the grasshoppers had made what jenkins styled a clean sweep from stem to stern  crops gardens and every green herb in the settlement had perished and all the sanguine hopes of the longsuffering settlers were blighted once more  before passing from this subject it may be as well to mention that the devastating hosts which visited the colony at this time left behind them that which turned out to be a worse affliction than themselves  they had deposited their larvae in the ground and about the end of the june following countless myriads of young grasshoppers issued forth to overrun the fields  they swarmed in such masses as to be two three andin some places near watereven four inches deep  along the rivers they were found in heaps like seaweed and the water was almost poisoned by them  every vegetable substance was devouredthe leaves and even bark of trees were eaten up the grain vanished as fast as it appeared above ground everything was stripped to the bare stalk and ultimately when they died in myriads the decomposition of their dead bodies was more offensive than their living presence  thus the settlers were driven by stress of misfortune once again to the plains of pembina and obliged to consort with the redmen and the halfbreeds in obtaining sustenance for their families by means of the gun line trap and snare    chapter twenty  little bill becomes a difficulty  we must now pass over another winter during which the red river settlers had to sustain life as they best mightacquiring however in doing so an expertness in the use of gun and trap and fishingline and in all the arts of the savages which enabled them to act with more independence and to sustain themselves and their families in greater comfort than before  spring with all its brightness warmth and suggestiveness had returned to cheer the hearts of men and really those who have never experienced the long sixoreightmonths winter of ruperts land can form no conception of the feelings with which the bodyto say nothing of the soulopens up and expands itself so to speak in order to receive and fully appreciate the sweet influences of spring  for one thing seven or eight months of cold biting steely frost causes one almost to forget that there ever was such a thing as summer heat summer scents summer sounds or summer skies  the first thaw is therefore like the glad unexpected meeting of a dear old friend and the trumpet voice of the first goose the whirring wing of the first duck and the whistle of the first plover sounds like the music of the spheres to ones long unaccustomed ears  then the trickle of water gives one something like a new sensation  it may be but a thread of liquid no thicker than a pipestem faintly heard by an attentive ear tinkling in the cold depths far under the ice or snow but it is liquid not solid water  it is suggestive of motion  it had almost been forgotten as a sound of the long past which had forsaken the terrestrial ball for ever  it does not take a powerful imagination to swell a tiny stream to a rivulet a river a lake a mighty ocean  shut your eyes for a moment and in memory the ice and snow vanish the streams flow as in the days of old flowers come again to gladden the eyes andbut why trouble you good reader with all this  we feel sadly that unless you have tasted the northern winter no description however graphic will enable you to drink in the spirit of the northern spring  about this time okematan the cree chief took it into his head that he would go ahunting  this last word does not suggest to a dweller in the wilderness that crossing of ploughed lands on horseback and leaping of hedges etcetera which it conveys to the mind of an englishman  the cree chiefs notion of springhunting was getting into a birchbark canoe with or without a comrade and going forth on the lakes and rivers of the wilderness with plenty of powder and shot to visit the native home of the wildgoose the wildduck the pelican the plover and the swan  for such a trip not much is essential  besides the gun and ammunition referred to okematan carried a blanket a hatchet several extra pairs of moccasins a tin kettle in which to boil food a firebag for steel flint and tinder with a small supply of tobacco  on hearing of his intention dan davidson resolved to accompany him dan had by that time associated so much with the chief that he had learned to speak his language with facility  indeed nearly all the settlers who had a turn for languages had by that time acquired a smattering more or less of indian and french  you see said dan to the chief there is not much doing on the farm just now and i want to see a little of the country round about so if you dont object to my company id like to go  the cree chief will be proud to have the company of the paleface chief replied the indian with grave courtesy  dan wanted to say all right but was ignorant of the cree equivalent for that familiar phrase he therefore substituted the more sober and correct it is well  but said he you must not call me a paleface chief for i am only an ordinary man in my own landwhat you would call one of the braves  okematan is thought to have a good judgment among his people returned the indian though he has not the snows of many winters on his head and he thinks that if danel had stayed in the wigwams of his people beyond the great salt lake he would have been a chief  it may be so okematan though i doubt it replied dan but that is a point which cannot now be proved  meanwhile my ambition at present is to become a great hunter and i want you to teach me  the chief who was gratified by the way in which this was put gladly agreed to the proposal  there is another man who would like to go with us said davidson  my friend fergus mckay is anxious i know to see more of the lands of the indian  you have no objection to his going i supposein another canoe of course for three would be too many in your small canoe  okematan had no objection  three would not be too many in the canoe he said but two are better for hunting  very good  but we will want a fourth to make two in each canoe  whom shall we invite  okematans counsel is answered the chief to take a brave who is young and strong and active whose eye is quick and his hand steady whose heart never comes into his throat when danger faces him whose face does not grow pale at the sight of approaching death whose heart is as the heart of the grisly bear for courage and yet tender as the heart of a paleface squaw whose hand can accomplish whatever his head plans and whose tongue is able to make a sick man smile  davidson smiled to himself at this description which the chief uttered with the sententious gravity that would have characterised his speech and bearing in a council of war  a most notable comrade good okematan but where are we to find him for i know nobody who comes near to that description  he dwells in your own wigwam returned the chief  in prairie cottage exclaimed the other with a puzzled air  you cant mean my brother peter surely for he is about as grave as yourself  okematan means the young brave who loves his little brother  what  archie sinclair exclaimed dan with a surprised look  i had no idea you had so high an opinion of him  okematan has seen much of archee has watched him  he sees that he thinks nothing of himself that he thinks always for the sick brother leetle beel and that he will yet be a great chief among the palefaces  well now you come to mention it there is something about archie that puts him high above other boys and i suppose his unselfishness has much to do with it but dont you think hes too young and hardly strong enough  he is not young  he is fifty years old in wisdom  he is very strong for his size and he is willing which makes his strength double  but he will never consent to leave little bill said dan  okematan had fears of that returned the indian with for the first time a look of perplexity on his face  if archee will not go without leetle beel leetle beel must go too  it was found on inquiry that they were right in their surmise  when the proposal was made to archie that afternoon by dan the boys eyes seemed to light up and dance in his head at the prospect  then the light suddenly went out and the dancing ceased  why whats the matter archie asked his friend  cant go  impossible said archie  why not  whos to look after little bill i should like to know if i leave him  elspie of course said dan and elise to say nothing of jessie mother and brother peter  archie shook his head  no he said no  i cant go  elspie is all very well in her way and so is elise but they cant carry little bill about the fields and through the bush on their backs and peter wouldnt hes too busy about the farm  noever since mother died ive stuck to little bill through thick and thin  so i wont go  it was so evident that archie sinclairs mind was made up and fixed and also so obvious that a delicate little boy would be a great encumbrance on a hunting expedition that dan thought of attempting the expedient of winning little bill himself over to his side  he had no difficulty in doing that for billie was to the full as amiable and unselfish as his brother  after a short conversation he made billie promise to do his very best to induce archie to go with the hunters and leave him behind  for you know little bill said dan in conclusion and by way of consoling him although nobody could take such good care of you as archie or make up to you for him elspie would take his place very well for a time  o yes i know that well enough said the poor boy with some enthusiasm elspie is always very good to me  youve no notion how nice she is dan  hm well i have got a sort of a half notion maybe returned dan with a peculiar look  but thats all right then  youll do what you can to persuade archie andthere he is evidently coming to see you so ill go and leave you to talk it over with him  billie did not give his brother time to begin but accosted him on his entrance withim so glad archie that youve been asked to go on this hunting expe  o youve heard of it then  yes and i want you to go very very much becausebecause  dont trouble yourself with becauses little bill for i wont go so theres an end of itunless he added as if a thought had suddenly occurred to him unless they agree to take you with them  they might do worse  ill see about that  so saying archie turned about left the room as abruptly as he had entered it and sought out okematan  he found that chief sitting in la certes wigwam involved in the mists of meditation and tobaccosmoke gazing at slowfoot  that worthy womanwho with her lord and little child was wont to forsake her hut in spring and go into the summerquarters of a wigwam was seated on the opposite side of a small fire enduring okematans meditative gaze either unconsciously or with supreme indifference  hallo  okethus irreverently did archie address the chiefhad any one else ventured to do so he might possibly have been scalpedhallo oke ive been huntin for you all round  youre worse to find than an arrow in the grass  it may be said here that archie had learned like some of the other settlers a smattering of the cree language  how he expressed the above we know not  we can only give the sense as he would probably have given it in his own tongue  okematans friends can always find him answered the indian with a grave but pleased look  so it seems  but i say oke i want to ask a favour of you  dan davidson tells me you want me to go ahunting with you  well im your man if youll let me take little bill with me  will you  leetle beel is not strong objected the indian  true but a trip o this sort will make him strong perhaps  anyhow it will make him stronger  but for a sick boy there is danger said the chief  if archee upsets his canoe in a rapid archee swims on shore but leetle beel goes to the bottom  not as long as archee is there to hold him up returned the boy  waugh exclaimed the indian  humph remarked the boy  what dye mean by waugh oke  okematan means much that it is not in the power of the tongue to tell replied the indian with increasing gravity and as the gravity increased the cloudlets from his lips became more voluminous  archee hopes nevertheless that the tongue of oke may find power to tell him a little of what he thinks  this being in some degree indefinite the chief smoked in silence for a minute or two and gazed at slowfoot with that dreamy air which one assumes when gazing into the depths of a suggestive fire  apparently inspiration came at lastwhether from slowfoot or not we cannot tell for he turned solemnly to the boy  rain comes he said and when sick men get wet they grow sicker carryingplaces come and when sick men come to them they stagger and fall  frost often comes in spring and when sick men get cold they die waugh  humph repeated the boy again with a solemnity quite equal to that of the redman  when rain comes i can put up an umbrellaan umbrella  dyou know what that is  the indian shook his head  well its aa thinga sort of little tenta wigwam you know with a stick in the middle to hold on to and put it up  dyou understand  an expression of blank bewilderment so to speak settled on the chiefs visage and the lights of intelligence went out one by one until he presented an appearance which all but put the boys gravity to flight  well well its of no use my tryin to explain it he continued ill show it to you soon and then youll understand  intelligence began to return and the chief looked gratified  what you call it he askedfor he was of an inquiring dispositiona bumrella  no no replied the other seriously an umbrella  its a clever contrivance as you shall see  so you see i can keep the rain off little bill when hes in the canoe and on shore there are the trees and the canoe itself turned bottom up  then at carryin places i can carry little bill as well as other things  hes not heavy and doesnt struggle so we wont leave him to stagger and fall  as to frosthave we not hatchets and are there not dead trees in the forest  frost and fire never walk in company so that little bill wont get cold and die for well keep him warmwaugh  when human beings are fond of each other disagreement seldom lasts long okematan had taken so strong a fancy to archie that he felt it impossible to hold out therefore being a man of strong common sense he did not attempt the impossible  thus it came to pass that two days later a couple of birchbark canoes were launched on the waters of red river with dan davidson in the stern of one and fergus mckay acting as his bowman  okematan took the stern of the other while archie sinclair wielded the bowpaddle and little bill was placed in the middle on a comfortable green blanket with the celebrated bumrella erected over him to keep off not the rain but the too glorious sunshine    chapter twenty one  an auspicious beginning and suspicious ending  let loose in the wilderness  how romantic how inexpressibly delightful that idea seems to some minds  ay even when the weight of years begins to stiffen the joints and slack the cords of life the memory of gods great wild untrammelled beautiful wilderness comes over the spirit like a refreshing dream and restores for a time something like the pulse of youth  we sometimes think what a joy it would be if youth could pass through its blessings with the intelligent experience of age  and it may be that this is to be one of the joys of the future when man redeemed and delivered from sin by jesus christ shall find that the memory of the sorrows sufferings weaknesses of the past shall add inconceivably to the joys of the present  it may be so  judging from analogy it does not seem presumptuous to suppose and hope that it will be so  sufficient unto the day however is the joy thereof  when the two canoes pushed off and swept rapidly over the fair bosom of red river the heart of archie sinclair bounded with a feeling of exultant joy which it would have been very hard indeed to convince him was capable of increase while the bosom of his invalid brother was filled with a sort of calm serenity which constituted in his opinion at the time being a quite sufficient amount of felicity  when we add that the other hunters were in their several ways pretty much in the same condition as the boys we have said enough to justify the remark that their circumstances were inexpressibly delightful  proceeding some distance up stream they finally diverged into a minor tributary which led to waters that were swarming with waterfowl and other game  this is a grand burst little bill said archie as he plied his paddle vigorously and glanced over his shoulder at the invalid behind him  prime answered billie  isnt it he added with a backward glance at okematan  waugh replied the reticent savage  ay waugh thats all youll get out of him when hes puzzled said archie though what he means by it is more than i know  you must speak respectable english to a redskin if you want to convince him  why if he had understood you literally you knowand obeyed youhed have had something to do immediately with the lock of his gun  i have often wondered archie returned his brother with a languid smile what a lot you manage to say sometimes with nothing in it  ha haho ho what a wag youre becoming little bill  but i thank ee for the compliment for you know its only philosophers that can say an awful lot without amost sayin anything at all  look at oke there now what a depth of stupidity lies behind his brown visage what bucketsful of ignorance swell out his black pate but he expresses it all in the single word waugh because hes a philosopher  if he was like la certe hed jabber away to us by the hour of things he knows nothin about and tell us long stories that are nothin less than big lies  im glad you think me a philosopher little bill for it takes all the philosophy ive got to keep me up to the scratch of goin about the world wi you on my back  why im a regular sindbad the sailor only im saddled with a young man o the plains instead of an old man of the sea  dee understand what im saying oke  the chief who understood little more than that his own name and that of la certe were mentioned nodded his head gravely and allowed the corners of his mouth to droop which was his peculiar way of smilinga smile that might have been unintelligible to his friends had it not been relieved and interpreted by a decided twinkle in his eyes  while they were conversing the two canoes had rounded a rocky point and swept out upon a lakelike expanse in the river which was perfectly smooth and apparently currentless  several islets studded its calm breast and were reflected in the clear water  these were wooded to the waters edge and from among the sedges near their margin several flocks of wildfowl sprang up in alarm and went off in fluttering confusion  it chanced that just then a trumpetlike note was heard overhead as a flock of wild geese passed the spot and came suddenly close within range of the canoes which had been concealed from them by the bushes that fringed the river  guns were seized at once by the bowmen in each canoe but archie was smarter than fergus  before the highlander had got the weapon well into his hands the boy fired and one of the flock fell into the river with a heavy plunge  little bill signalised the successful shot with a hightoned cheer and the indian with a lowtoned waugh while fergus made a hurried and therefore bad shot at the scared flock  that wass a fery good shot archie remarked fergus as the canoes ranged up alongside of the dead bird  yours was a very good one too fergus returned the boy only not quite straight  the smile on the face of okematan proved that he understood the drift of the reply and that this was the style of humour he appreciated so highly in his young friend  we civilised people may wonder a little at the simplicity of the savage but when we reflect that the chief had been born and bred among the solemnities of the wilderness and had been up to that time wholly unacquainted with the humours and pleasantries that sometimes accompany juvenile cheek our wonder may perhaps be subdued  this would be a splendid place to camp for the rest of the day suggested davidson while they rested on their paddles after the goose had been secured  we must lay in a small stock of fresh provisions you know if we are to push on tomorrow or next day to our hunting ground  what say you okematan he added in cree turning to their guide  the will of the paleface chief is the wish of okematan  let him speak  well then i vote for encamping on the small island over there in the middle o the lakefor its far more like a lake than a river hereaboutsthat one over which the hawk is hovering  i vote for it too said archie  so do i chimed in little bill  i will be sayin ditto to that put in fergus  moreover suggested dan i vote for roasting the goose at once  ay and eating him right away said archie  as the invalid followed this up with a feeble cheer the proposal was carried into effect without delay  the islet was low and flat and so thickly covered with bush that it afforded a most enticing spot for a nightencampment  there was also plenty of dead wood on it with which to replenish the fire and various peeps through sundry openings afforded exquisite views of woodland and river with which to charm the eyes  over all the sun was pouring his noontide rays in a glorious flood  we need not waste time in going into the details of the feast that followed how the goose was delightfully plump and tenderespecially tender to teeth that would have scarcely observed the difference if it had been toughhow in addition to the goose they had wildducks enoughshot earlier in the dayto afford each one a duck to himself leaving a brace over of which okematan ate one as well as his share of the goose and seemed to wish that he might eat the other but he didnt for he restrained himself how they drank tea with as much gusto and intemperance as if it had been a modern afternoon and how after all was over the redman filled the pipehead on the back of his iron tomahawk and began to smoke with the air of a man who meant business and regarded all that had gone before as mere childsplay  the afternoon was well advanced when the feast was concluded for appetites in the wilderness are not easily or soon satisfied  i feel tight said billie with a sigh and something of pathos in his tone when he at last laid down his knifewe cannot add fork for they scorned such implements at that time  thats right little bill said archie try another leg or wingnow dont shake your head  weve come on this trip apurpose to make you fat an strong  so you musthere try this drumstick  its only a little one like yourself billie  true archie but im too little to hold it  i feel like an egg now  hallo  oke are you overcome already asked archie  the sun sinks to rest at night and the birds go to sleep  if we intend to hunt we must begin now  its always the way returned the boy with an air of discontent whenever a fellow gets into a state of extreme jollity theres sure to be something bothersome to come and interrupt us  obfusticate your faculties with some more smoke oke till billie and i finish our tea we cant shoot with halfempty stomachs you know  they must be threequarters full by this timewhatever remarked fergus wiping his claspknife on the grass  just then dan davidson who had gone to explore the islet returned with the information that some hunters must have recently visited the same place for he had discovered the remains of an encampment at the extreme eastern side which looked as if it had been recently occupied for bones of wildfowl were scattered about the meat on which was neither dried nor decayed  on hearing this okematan rose quickly put out his pipe and stuck the tomahawk in his belt  the sluggish goodnatured air of contentment with which he had been smoking vanished the halfsleepy eyes opened and a frown rested on his brow as he said shortly  okematan goes to look  may i go with you asked dan  no  okematan goes alone  it is known that a band of saulteaux have been seen  they are roused just now by the actions of the great white chief and the words of my nation  rest here till i come  go on eating if they are here they may be watching us now  dee hear that little bill  youve got to go on eating said archie our guide commands it  if you disobey the rascally saulteaux will come down upon us somehow  but archies lightheartedness was not shared by his older companions they knew too well that the disturbed state of the country at the time and especially the illwill engendered between the crees and saulteaux by the illadvised action of lord selkirks agents rendered an explosion not improbable at any time and a certain feeling of disappointment came over them when they reflected that the hunting expedition which they had entered on with so much enthusiastic hope might perhaps be brought to an abrupt close  if theres to be any fighting i shall only be in your way said the invalid in a tone in which there was much of sadness though none of fear  not a bit of it little bill returned dan quickly  youll be in nobodys way in the canoes  youre as light as a feather  if we had even to take to the bush archie could run with you an when he gets tired fergus and i would think no more o you than a grasshopper  iss it carryin him you will be taalkin of said fergus  ay ay  i would be forgettin that he wass on my back if i had him there  as he spoke the indian returned to the camp with the catlike tread so characteristic of the redman  a big band has been here he said  they slept on the island last night and the signs show that they do not come as friends  are you sure of that asked dan  okematan is sure of nothing  even the sun may not rise tomorrow  had we not better then return at once to the settlement and tell what we have seen said dan  if we did the saulteaux would see us and give chase  their canoes are big and have strong men in them  they would overtake us soon and our scalps would be swinging at their belts tomorrow  not pleesant to think ofwhatever said fergus  what then do you advise asked dan  you understand the ways of the wilderness and we will follow your lead  the chief appeared to think for a few moments  we will remain where we are he said only we will send the boys off in one of the canoes as if to shoot some ducks for us  the saulteaux will think that we are lazy idle men who like to lie in camp and sleep or smoke while the boys hunt for us  when night comes we will escape in the dark and go down the river to warn the settlers  but what if they attack us before night comes on asked dan  they will not do that answered the indian gravely  they know that we are well supplied with powder and shot  they know that some one must lead in every attack and that such leaders would be doomed to death saulteaux do not love death  they prefer life  they will not come till it is dark  ha ha laughed fergus who seemed greatly tickled with the latter part of the chiefs observation fery goot ho fery gootthey do not love death an it iss life they will be preferrin  ay ay  it iss the heelandman that will be of much the same opeenion only when fightin hes got to be done hes not afraid to do it in daylight  he may not be afraid fergus said dan yet i suspect that the redmans tactics are often the wisest for what would be the use of making an attack in daylight at the cost of several lives when the attack might be made quite as well if not better at night without the loss perhaps of any life at all  i will not be sayin returned fergus who was of an argumentative disposition anything at all about attackin by day or by night  i will only be remarkin that the heelandman iss like the savitch in that he prefers life to death  come along to the fire fergus said dan laughing i will argue that out with you  it will be difficult to argue then for there iss no argument in it at all  it is only a statement of opeenion  well but surely it is possible to controvert your opinion  besides we are somewhat exposed where we stand  even an arrow might reach us from the near bank  never you fear tan  they will not be so foolish as to fire now instead of attack at night  they are slywhatever  while the two friends were thus conversing the cree chief was arranging the smaller of the canoes for the use of the young huntersthat is he took out all the lading making it so light that it would skim over the water like an eggshell with the slightest impulse of the paddle  youll have to put a big stone in the stern oke said archie to make up for little bills lightness  for your heaviness you mean interrupted the invalid  no i mean what i say billie for you are lightheaded as well as lighthearteda sort o human balloon ready to go up like a rocket at any timeso that even an ornary man like me weighs you down  besides oke he steers better than me and i shoot better than him  also i like the hardest work so i always take the bow  arranging things according to directions the indian held the canoe steady while the brothers stepped carefully infor they had learned from experience that the birchbark canoe besides being easily broken is apt to overturn on small provocation  let not archee go near the riverbank on either side said the chief in a warning voice as he was about to shove the frail bark out upon the glassy water  the saulteaux might catch him  and let him not go far up or down stream  let him keep among the reeds round the island there are many ducks there  shoot plenty as if archee had no suspicionno fear of indians  i say oke demanded the lad with what was meant for an overwhelming frown do you mean to hint that i have any fear of the indians  okematan has the belief that archee never knew fear at all returned the chief earnestly that he has the courage of the young buffalobull  well im not quite so sure o that returned the boy with a modest look  i would not myself put it quite so strong you know  but youre a wise chief and i hope youve got a lot of brothers as wise as yourself  goodbye okeshove off  now then mind how you steer little bill    chapter twenty two  circumventing the redskins  for some time the brothers paddled about the sedgy shore of the small islet on which the camp had been pitched now setting up a flock of ducks and then slipping into the heart of some reeds and concealing themselves until a good chance was obtained at a passing flock of geese  archie sinclair soon laid in enough provision to serve the party for a few meals for his hand was steady and his eye true  little bill he said looking back after one of his successful shots you must take a shot now  we will go rightaboutface and convert the bow into the stern in the usual way  see catch hold of the gun  no archee as oke calls you i wont im quite content to look on for your gun kicks like a mexican mule  besides its easy work to steer and seeing you panting and toiling in the bow makes it seem all the easier  just you keep blazin away old man  but i say where shall i steer to now  im tired o steering among the reeds  let us push out into the clear water  you heard what oke said objected archie we must keep well clear o both shores  i know that returned billie but he did not forbid us to try the reeds round the other islands theres a much bigger one not a quarter of a mile up stream  i think there are some beautiful sedges there where geese are likely to live  im sure i would choose to live in such a place if i was a goose  o then we must go little bill for i think it would be hard to keep any one out of his native home  so saying he dipped his paddle with vigour and the light bark shot swiftly over the glancing water  the sun was beginning to descend towards the western horizon when they drew near to the island and several flocks of waterfowl had already sprung alarmed from the reeds when archie caught sight of a blackandredpainted visage peering at him from among the bushes  the boys heart seemed to bound into his throat and his first impulse was to turn the canoe and fly but archies mind was quicker even than his hand or eye  all he had ever heard or read of the cool stoicism of the redman seemed to flash across his memory and with a violent effort he crushed back the shout that rose to his lips  he could not indeed suppress the look of sudden surprise that swept across his expressive face but he cleverly adapted it to circumstances  look look  little bill he exclaimed eagerly pointing right over the indians head at a flock of geese that opportunely appeared at the moment in the far distance  crouch bill lie low ill call them steer a little more to the left and keep her so  thereupon he began a vociferous imitation of the sounds with which indians are wont to call to geese that may chance to be flying past at a distance  the obedient billie steered as directed and thus the canoe was slowly sheered off a little from the shore  it was cleverly done whether the savage was deceived or not we cannot tell but he showed no sign of intention to move or act though he was within easy range of the boys  little bill said archie in a low voice such as one might use when anxious not to alarm game can you do what youre bid at once and exactly  i can try was the quiet answer  well then try your best little bill for our lives may depend on our action now  keep your eyes fixed on that flock o geese as long as theyre in sight  dont look at the shore whatever i do or say look at anything you like but not at the shore  theres a redskin there  ive seen him though he thinks i havent  now steer right round and go back the way we have just come only keep always edging a little offshore  as he said this archie raised himself from his crouching attitude laid down his gun and resumed his paddle and in his ordinary freeandeasy tones exclaimed  weve lost that chance little billmores the pity  never mind answered billie in the same tone being resolved to act his part well theres lots more where these came from  better luck next time  where away now  keep her just as you go youre far enough out now  we should start some ducks here  thus speaking and with the air of a leisurely man enjoying himself with infinite contentment on his ruddy countenance and with much concern in his agitated soularchie took the canoe straight past the very spot where the indian lay concealed  he felt that audacity was the safest line of action for he knew that if the savage meant mischief to pretend absolute ignorance of his existence would be less likely to draw a shot than sudden flightwhich however swiftly carried out could by no means equal the flight of a bullet  besides it was of the utmost importance that he should reach the encampment and report what he had seen without the indian becoming aware that he had been discovered  in order to effect his purpose he not only repassed the hidingplace of the savage but actually shot and picked up another duck while still within range of the enemys gun  then he directed his brother to steer still more off the island but very slowly  were in no hurry you see little bill you havent looked at the shore i hope  never once  ha ha laughed archie in high glee at the success of this his first experiment in backwoods warfare youre a trump little bill  id rather be a trump than a trumpet archie  if there are more redskins about laughing like that will be sure to rouse them  never fear billie my boy  you do as i tell ee  we must keep up the game a bit longer yet  it wont do to hurry back till the sun is lower so well go over to that small island there an have a try for another duck  theres sure to be nobody on such a small island as that afterwards well drop down in an offhand idlelike way to the encampment  itll be natural to do this when the evenins beginning to set in an so well stump them redskins at their own game  dee understand  yes  youre a clever chap archie  in pursuance of this deeply laid plan the brothers crossed over to the small islet referred to and after apparently amusing themselves there for a short time dropped down stream in a leisurely way reaching the encampment before the evening had fairly set in  a council of war was immediately held  you were right in your guess okematan said davidson  the reptiles will be down on us tonight no doubt  what course does the cree chief advise  okematan advises that the kettle be boiled the duck roasted and a good big supper eaten  it iss fery pleasant advice no doubt said fergus with a broad and rather sarcastic grin but it iss not warlike  it seems not a bad preparation for war anyhow said dan and what after that  the two boys will sleep and rest while food is preparing continued the chief  the moon will set before we have done eating and it will be very dark  the saulteaux will not attack while the light lasts when it is quite dark we will go  if we fix to leave and they chance to attack at the same time it iss meetin them we will be okematan said fergus  to this remark the indian vouchsafed no reply  well well muster okematan it iss your own business you will know best yourself  i will see to stowin away my supperwhatever  by the time supper was over the moon had descended into a bank of black clouds on the horizon and profound darkness brooded over land and water  it was a night such as an attacking party would hail as being most suitable for its work and of course was proportionately unsuitable for the attacked  the indian chief displayed no more concern about it than if nothing unusual were pending  after supper however he directed that the canoes should be launched and loaded  at the same time he gathered together as much wood as he could and heaped it on the fire  you seem determined to give them plenty of light to do their work remarked davidson  they will wait till our fire burns low said the chief  by that time they will think we are asleep  a sleeping foe is not dangerous  they will comeslowly step by step with wide eyes glancing from side to side and no noise sly as foxes timid as squaws  but by that time we will be far on our way back to red river  ayif we do not meet them comin to attack us said fergus  and how shall we proceed asked dan  as we came answered the chief  okematan with the two boys will lead  danell an fergus will follow  come  led by their guide the party passed out of the firelight into the dense thicket by which the spot was encompassed almost completely so that the only visible sign of the encampment from outside was the forks of flame and sparks which rose high above the bushes  on reaching the shore they found the two boys holding the canoes close to the land  so intense was the darkness that they could not see the boys or canoes at all till close beside them  without uttering a word or making a sound with their moccasined feet they stepped into the canoes pushed gently off and glided ghostlike into the vast obscurity    chapter twenty three  a midnight chase and dan in extremity  for some time they advanced in absolute silence dipping their paddles so as to make no noise whatever dan following as close as possible in the wake of the chief for it was one of those nights which people describe as being so dark that one cannot see ones hand before ones face  on reaching the lower end of the lakelike expansion where the river narrowed suddenly and the stream began to be felt it was discovered that the enemy was in advance of themthat anticipating some such attempt at escape they had stationed an ambush at the narrows to cut off their retreat  archie was naturally the first to make this discovery being in the bow of the canoe  he heard no sound but suddenly there loomed out of the darkness another canoe close to themso close that they were on the point of running into it when the sharpwitted boy saw it and with an adroit turn of his paddle prevented a collision  then he ceased to paddle and held his breath  not knowing what to do next he wisely did nothing but left matters to oke and fate  as they passed the steersman in the strange canoe uttered something in a low tone  evidently he mistook them for his friends  sh was okematans prompt replyor the indian equivalent for that caution  they glided silently and slowly past but the suspicion of the strange indian had obviously been aroused for the paddles of his canoe were heard to gurgle powerfully  hearing this okematan made a stroke that sent his canoe ahead like an arrow and archie who appreciated the situation seconded the movement  stop exclaimed the strange indian in the saulteaux tongue but the cree chief did not feel the duty of obedience strongly upon him just then  on the contrary he put forth all his strength but quietly for he remembered that dan davidson was behind  as there was now no need for concealment the pursuer uttered a shrill warwhoop which was immediately answered and repeated until the woods rang with the fiendish sound while halfadozen canoes dashed out from the banks on either side and sought to bar the river  now archee said the cree chief in a low voice paddle for your life and be a man  ill be two men if you like oke answered the boy whose courage was of that type which experiences something almost like desperate glee in the presence of imminent danger  the canoe obedient to the double impulse and the power of the current was soon out of hearing of the pursuers  o if i only had a paddle i might help you said little bill eagerly  yes an bust your biler or explode your lungs or something o that sort said his brother  no no little bill you sit there like a lord or an admiral an leave men like oke an me to do all the dirty work  while he spoke thus flippantly it is but justice to say that archie was never more anxiously in earnest in his life and that he strained at his paddle with a degree of energy that made him perhaps more than equal to many an average man  so that the canoe forged well ahead of the pursuers and finally got to a part of the river where three islets divided it into several channels rendering further pursuit in the dark useless if not impossible  their comrades however were not so fortunate  left behind by the sudden spurt of his leader davidson and his companion exerted themselves to overtake him but the canoes of the enemy which were just too late to cut off the retreat of okematan were in time to intercept the second canoe  in this emergency dan swerved aside hoping to get to the bank before the saulteaux could discover his exact whereabouts  his intentions were thwarted by the want of caution in his companion  iss it to the land ye are going asked fergus  yesits our only chance whispered dan  it iss my opeenion murmured the highlander  hush ejaculated dan  but the caution came too late  a listening redskin overheard the sounds and with a sudden dash was alongside of them  he did not however know the vigour of the men with whom he had to deal  while he was in the very midst of a triumphant warwhoop dan cut him over the head with the paddle so violently that the instrument became splinters and the whoop ceased abruptly  at the same time fergus caught hold of the bow of the enemys canoe with an iron grasp and giving it a heave that might have put samson to shame fairly overturned it  ye can wet your whustle nowwhatever he muttered  as he spoke the canoe ran with extreme violence against the invisible bank  at the same moment a random volley was fired from the canoes in rear  fear lest they should wound or kill a comrade probably caused them to send the whizzing bullets rather high but for one instant the flame revealed the position of the fugitives and those who had reserved their fire took better aim  take to the bush fergus cried dan as he grasped his gun and leaped into the shallow water  the highlander stooped to lay hold of his weapon which lay in the bow of the canoe just as another volley was fired  the act was the means of saving his life for at least halfadozen bullets whizzed close over his head  before he could recover himself a strong hand grasped his neck and flung him backwards  probably a desperate handtohand fight would have ensued for fergus mckay had much of the bone muscle and sinew that is characteristic of his race but a blow from an unseen weapon stunned him and when his senses returned he found himself bound hand and foot lying in the bottom of a canoe  he could tell from its motion that it was descending the river  meanwhile dan davidson under the impression that his comrade was also seeking safety in the bush did his best to advance in circumstances of which he had never yet had experience for if the night was dark on the open bosom of the river it presented the blackness of erebus in the forest  dan literally could not see an inch in advance of his own nose if he held up his hand before his face it was absolutely invisible  in the haste of the first rush he had crashed through a mass of small shrubbery with which the bank of the stream was lined  then on passing through that he tumbled head over heels into a hollow and narrowly missed breaking his gun  beyond that he was arrested by a tree with such violence that he fell and lay for a minute or two halfstunned while lying thus experience began to teach him and common sense to have fairplay  a little more of this he thought and im a dead man  besides if it is difficult for me to traverse the forest in the dark it is equally difficult for the savages  my plan is to feel my way step by step with caution  that will be the quietest way too as well as the quickest youre an excited fool dan  when a man begins to think and call himself a fool there is some hope of him  gathering himself up and feeling his gun all over carefully to make sure that it had not been broken he continued to advance with excessive caution and in consequence was ere long a considerable distance from the banks of the river though of course he had but a hazy idea as to what part of the country he had attained or whither he was tending  as the first excitement of flight passed away dan began to feel uneasy prickings of conscience at having so hastily sought safety for himself though upon reflection he could not accuse himself of having deserted his comrades  okematan and the boys he had good reason to believeat least to hopehad succeeded in evading the foe and fergus he supposed had landed with himself and was even at that moment making good his escape into the forest  to find him in the circumstances he knew to be impossible and to shout by way of ascertaining his whereabouts he also knew to be useless as well as dangerous as by doing so he would make his own position known to the enemy  he also began to feel certain pricking sensations in his right leg as well as in his conscience  the leg grew more painful as he advanced and on examination of the limb by feeling he found to his surprise that he had received a bulletwound in the thigh  moreover he discovered that his trousers were wet with blood and that there was a continuous flow of the vital fluid from the wound  this at once accounted to him for some very unusual feelings of faintness which had come over him and which he had at first attributed to his frequent and violent falls  the importance of checking the haemorrhage was so obvious that he at once sat down and did his best to bind up the wound with the red cotton kerchief that encircled his neck  having accomplished this as well as he could in the dark he resumed his journey and after several hours of laborious scrambling at last came to a halt with a feeling of very considerable and to him unusual exhaustion  again he sat down on what seemed to be a bed of moss and began to meditate  impossible to go further he thought  i feel quite knocked up strange  i never felt like this before  it must have been the tumbles that did it or it may be that ive lost more blood than i suppose ill rest a bit now and begin a search for fergus by the first streak of dawn  in pursuance of this intention the wearied man lay down and putting his head on a mossy pillow fell into a profound sleep which was not broken till the sun was high in the heavens on the following day  when at last he did awake and attempted to sit up dan felt to his surprise and no small alarm that he was as weak as a child that his leg lay in a pool of coagulated gore and that blood was still slowly trickling from the wound in his thigh  although disposed to lie down and give way to an almost irresistible tendency to slumber dan was too well aware that death stared him in the face to succumb to the feeling without a struggle  he therefore made a mighty effort of will sat up undid the soaking bandage and proceeded to extemporise a sort of tourniquet with it and a short piece of stick  the contrivance rude as it was proved effectual for it stopped the bleeding but dan could not help feeling that he had already lost so much blood that he was reduced almost to the last stage of exhaustion and that another hour or two would probably see the close of his earthly career  nothing perhaps could have impressed this truth upon him so forcibly as his inability to shout when he tried to do so  in the faint hope that fergus might be within call he raised his voice with the full knowledge that he ran the risk of attracting a foe instead of a comrade  the sound that complied with the impulse of his will would have made him laugh if he had not felt an amazing and unaccountable disposition to cry  up to that period of his lifealmost from his earliest babyhooddan davidsons capacious chest had always contained the machinery and the power to make the nursery or the welkin ring with almost unparalleled violence  now the chest though still capacious and still full of the machinery seemed to have totally lost the power for the intended shout came forth in a gasp and ended in a sigh  it was much the same when he essayed to rise  his legs almost refused to support him everything appeared to swim before his eyes and he sank down again listlessly on the ground  for the first time perhaps in his life the strong man had the conviction effectually carried home to him that he was mortal and could become helpless  the advantage of early training by a godly mother became apparent in this hour of weakness for his first impulse was to pray for help and the resulting effectwhether men choose to call it natural or supernaturalwas at least partial relief from anxiety and that degree of comfort which almost invariably arises from a state of resignation  after a brief rest the power of active thought revived a little and dan again raising himself on one elbow tried to rouse himself to the necessity of immediate action of some sort if his life was to be saved  the spot on which he had lain or rather fallen down on the preceding night happened to be the fringe of the forest where it bordered on an extensive plain or stretch of prairie land  it was surrounded by a dense growth of trees and bushes except on the side next the plain where an opening permitted of an extensive view over the undulating country  no better spot could have been chosen even in broad daylight for an encampment than had been thus fallen upon by the hunter in the darkness of night  but the poor man felt at once that this advantage could be of no avail to him for in the haste of landing he had thought only of his gun and had left his axe with the bag containing materials for making fire in the canoe  fortunately he had not divested himself of his powderhorn or shotpouch so he was not without the means of procuring food but of what use could these be he reflected if he had not strength to use them  once again in the energy of determination he rose up and shouldered his gun with the intention of making his way across the plain in the hope that he might at all events reach the wigwam of some wandering indian but he trembled so from excessive weakness that he was obliged to give up the attempt and again sank down with feelings akin to despair  to add to his distress hunger now assailed him so violently that he would have roasted and eaten his moccasinsas many a starving man had done before him though without much benefitbut even this resource was denied him for the want of fire and raw moccasin was not only indigestible but uneatable  still as it seemed his only hope he gathered a few dry twigs and sticks together drew the charge from his gun and sought to kindle some mossy lichen into flame by flashing the priming in the pan of the lock recent rains had damped everything however and his attempts proved abortive  fortunately the weather was warm so that he did not suffer from cold  while he was yet labouring assiduously to accomplish his purpose the whir of wings was heard overhead  glancing quickly up he perceived that a small flock of willowgrouse had settled on the bushes close to him  he was not surprised though very thankful for these birds were numerous enough and he had heard them flying about from time to time but that they should settle down so near was exceedingly opportune and unexpected  with eager haste and caution he rammed home the charge he had so recently withdrawnkeeping his eyes fixed longingly on the game all the time  that the birds saw him was obvious for they kept turning their heads from side to side and looking down at him with curiosity  by good fortune grouse of this kind are sometimes very stupid as well as tame they did not take alarm at dans motions but craned their necks and seemed to eye him with considerable curiosity  even when he tried to take aim at them their general aspect suggested that they were asking mentally what next  but dan found that he could not aim  the point of the gun wavered around as it might have done in the hands of a child  with a shortalmost contemptuouslaugh at his ridiculous incapacity dan lowered the gun  stupid as they were the laugh was too much for the birds  they spread their wings  now or never exclaimed dan aloud  he pointed his gun straight at the flock took no aim and fired  the result was that a plump specimen dropped almost at his feet  if he had been able to cheer he would have done so  but he was not so he thanked god fervently instead  again the poor man essayed to kindle a fire but in trying to do this with gunpowder he made the startling discovery that he had only one more charge in his powderhorn  he therefore reloaded his gun wiped out the pan and primed with care feeling that this might be the last thing that would stand between him and starvation  it might have stood between him and something worsebut of that more hereafter  starving men are not particular  that day dan did what he would have believed to have been in him an impossibilityhe drank the blood of the bird and ate its flesh raw  after all thought he while engaged in this halfcannibalistic deed whats the difference between raw grouse and raw oyster  it is but right to add that he did not philosophise much on the subject having consumed his meal he lay down beside his gun and slept the sleep of the weary    chapter twenty four  a desperate situation  awaking next morning much refreshed but with a keen appetite for more grouse dan davidson sat up and reflected  he felt that although refreshed the great weakness resulting from excessive loss of blood still rendered him almost helpless and he knew that making new blood was a process that required good feeding and considerable time  what then was to be done  he had scarcely asked himself the question when a rustle in the bushes near him caused him to look quickly round and seize his gun  but the noise was not repeated and nothing could be seen to justify alarm still dan felt that the sound justified caution he therefore kept his gun handy and loosened in its sheath the scalpingknife which he always carried in his beltfor eating purposes not for scalping  thus he sat for nearly an hour with an uncomfortable sensation that danger of some sort lurked near him until he almost fell asleep  then rousing himself he proceeded to breakfast on the bones and scraps of the previous nights supper  while thus engaged he tried to make up his mind what course he ought to pursuewhether to remain where he was until his friends should have time to find himfor he felt sure that okematan would escape and reach the settlement in which case a search for him would certainly be set on footor whether he should make a desperate effort to stagger on and ultimately if need be creep towards home  the pain of his wound was now so great as to render the latter course almost impossible  he therefore resolved to wait and give his friends time to institute a search trusting to another shot at willowgrouse for a supply of food  he had scarcely made up his mind to this plan when the rustling in the bushes was repeated again  seizing his gun which he had laid down dan faced round just in time to see the hindquarters and tail of a large grey wolf disappearing in the bushes  to say that he felt considerable alarm when he saw this is not to stamp him with undue timidity for he would have rejoiced to have had the wolf in his clutches then and there and to engage in single combat with it weak though he was  what troubled him was his knowledge of the fact that the mean spirited and sly brute was noted for its apparent sagacity in finding out when an intended victim was growing too feeble to show fighteither from wounds or old ageand its pertinacity and patience in biding the time when an attack could be made with safety  had this horrible creature discerned by some occult knowledge that the sands in his glass were running low  was it to be his fate to face his glaring murderer until he had not vital power left to grapple with it or to guard his throat from its hideous fangs  these were questions which forced themselves upon him and which might well have caused the stoutest heart to shrink from the threatened and terrible doom  in the strength of his emotion he had almost fired at a venture at the spot where the brute had disappeared but luckily the remembrance that it was his last charge of ammunition came to him in time and he had the resolution to restrain himself even when his finger was on the trigger  dan now perceived that he must not venture to remain on the spot where he had passed the night because being surrounded on three sides by shrubbery it afforded his grisly foe an opportunity to approach from any quarter and spring on him the moment he should find him off his guard  there was a natural bank of earth out on the plain about three or four hundred yards off with neither trees nor bushes near it  the bank was not more than four feet high and the top slightly overhung its base so that it afforded some slight protection from the sun  to this spot dan resolved to betake himself and immediately began the journeyfor a journey it surely was seeing that the hunter had to do it on hands and knees lifting his gun and pushing it before him each yard or so as he went along  the inflammation of his wound rendered the process all the slower and more painful and a burning thirst which he had no means of slaking added to his misery  by the time he had passed over the short distance he was so much exhausted that he fell at the foot of the bank almost in a swoon  evidently the wolf imagined that its time had now come for it sneaked out of the wood when the hunter fell and began cautiously to advance but dan saw this and making a desperate effort arose to a sitting posture leaned his back against the bank and placed his gun across his knees  seeing this the wolf sat down on its haunches and coolly began to bide its time  ha you brute muttered dan i could easily stop your mischief if my strength wasnt all gone  as it is i dare not give you my last shot till you are so close that you can look down the barrel o my gun  from this point a watch of endurance began on both sidesthe brute of course unaware of the deadly weapon which its intended victim held and the man fully aware of the fact that if he should venture to lie down and sleep his doom would be sealed  it is impossible for any one who has not had trial of similar experiences to imagine the rush of thought and feeling that passed through the brain and breast of dan davidson during the long dreary hours of that terrible day  sometimes he fell into a halfdreamy condition in which his mind leaped over forests and ocean to bonnie scotland where his days of childhood were spent in glorious revelry on her sunny banks and braes  at other times the memory of schooldays came strong upon him when play and lessons and palmies were all the cares he had or thoughts of sabbaths spent with his mothernow in the church now in the fields or at the cottage door learning bible stories and hearing words of wisdom and the story of the crucified one from her lips  then the scene would change and he was crossing the stormy ocean or fighting with redskins or thundering after the buffalo on the wide prairies  but through all the varied fabric of his thoughts there ran two distinct threads one golden the other black  the first we need hardly say was elspie mckay the second was that awful wolf which sat there glaring at him with a hangdog expression with the red tongue hanging out of its mouth and from which he never for a moment allowed his eyes to wander  as evening began to draw on the situation became terrible for dan felt that the little strength he had left was fast sinking  the efforts by which he had succeeded in rousing himself in the earlier parts of the day were failing of their effect  then a strange and sudden change occurred for while he knew that the end of the trial was rapidly approaching he began to experience a feeling of indifferencethe result no doubt of excessive wearinessand almost a wish that all was over  nevertheless whenever that wolf moved or changed its position ever so little the instinct of selfpreservation returned in full force and dan pulling himself together prepared to defend himself desperately to the last gasp  while the two were thus glaring at each other dan was startled and thoroughly aroused from his irresistible lethargy by a loud report  next moment he saw the wolf extended dead upon the plain    chapter twenty five  adventures of fergus and his friends  in order to account for the sudden death recorded in the last chapter we must turn aside to follow for a little the fortunes of fergus mckay  it will be remembered that the vigorous highlander after overturning the indian canoe and running his own canoe on shore was seized by the neck while in the act of reaching forward to grasp his gun and captured  now fergus was of an unusually knowing and wily nature  he possessed what some would call more than his share of readiness in action and sagacity in counsel though his ordinary reticence and sluggishness of manner concealed those qualities to some extent  being endued also with more than the average allowance of that bodily strength for which his countrymen are famous his first impulse was to exert his powers and show fight but he had been taken suddenly at a disadvantage and thrown on his back into the bottom of the canoe and at least three pair of very muscular hands grasped his throat and other parts of his person  that they were strong hands he felt that they belonged to big strong savages he had every reason to believethough it was too dark to seeand that scalpingknives and tomahawks were handy to them he knew to be highly probable  he therefore promptly made up his mind as to his course of action and at once began to play his part making a very feeble resistancejust enough in short to deceivehe begged for mercy in soft rather tremulous and very abject tones  true his language was englishat least that sort of english to which the mountaineers of scotland are addictedbut he trusted to the tone and manner of his speech not to the sense which saulteaux he knew could not be expected to understand  oh then dont be hard on me  dont kill me goot shentlemen he whined  it iss a poor worthless thing i amwhatever  these remarks and a few similar appeals for mercy were accompanied with many dismal groans as his captors were dragging him up the bank of the stream  pausing for a moment one of them produced a cord with which they proceeded to bind their cowardly and unresisting prisoner  whether the indians were deceived by their victims tones and manner and the soft condition of his carefully relaxed muscles we cannot tell but it seemed as if such were the case for some of the brief remarks made by his captors had in them a smack of undisguised contempt and when the cord was being put round his arms he felt that the grip of his captors was slightly relaxed  now or never was his chance  hurling the men on either side of him right and left he delivered two random blows in front one of which happily took effect on a savage chest the other on a savage nose and cleared the way in that direction  with a bound like that of one of his own mountain deer he cleared the bank and plunged into the river  in ordinary circumstances an attempt of this kind would have been worse than useless for the indians would not only have jumped into their canoes and overtaken the fugitive but some of them would have run down the bank of the stream to prevent a landing  some such attempt was indeed made on the present occasion but the intense darkness was in favour of fergus and the searching canoes only ran into each other while the searchers on land were still more at a disadvantage  now fergus mckay was as much at home in water as an otter or a muskrat  indeed he had been known among his playmates in the old country as the waterrat  when therefore he plunged into the river as described he took care to hold his breath as if for a long dive and drifted with the current a considerable distance as motionless as a dead man  the indians listened intently of course for his coming to the surface for the breathing and it might be for the splashing that would be natural after such a leap but no breathing or splashing met their ears for when fergus put up his head far down the stream he only let out his nose and mouth for a gentle inspiration and sank again  it iss circumventin you at your own trade fightin you wi your own claymore that i will be doin he thought as he rose a second time and swam softly with the stream  fergus had the advantage of being well acquainted with the river in which he was swimming as well as with the lands in its neighbourhood and he knew that there was a certain bend in the stream which it would take the canoe of okematan a considerable time to traverse  by cutting across a narrow neck of land there was therefore a possibility of his intercepting the canoe  the saulteaux of course might have also taken advantage of this circumstance but they could have done so only on foot and they knew that without canoes they could not arrest the progress of the fugitives  reaching the spot where he wished to land by intuition almost the highlander soon found himself on the bank squeezed the water out of his garments and set off as quickly as he dared in such darkness  by good fortune he happened to cross a hunters track or pathlike a sheeprunwith which he was familiar and by following it was able to advance much more rapidly  in a short time he again came out on the left bank of the river  there he sat down on a boulder to listen profound was his attention to every soundas profound almost as his anxiety for he knew that if the canoe should have already passed he would be obliged to make his way back to the settlement on foot by a straight course which meant a slow toilsome march scrambling through pathless woods wading morasses and swimming across rivers  he had been seated thus for about halfanhour and in his impatience was giving way to despondency when the plash of water smote upon his ear  cocking the said ear attentively he was rewarded with another smite and in a few minutes distinctly heard the sound of paddles  he put his hands to his mouth forthwith and uttered a peculiar cry  instantly the sound of the paddles ceased as archie sinclair looking over his shoulder said  did you hear that oke  before oke could reply the cry was repeated  it is fergus said the indian answering to the cry and steering in the direction whence it came  are you sure oke  okematan never speaks till he is surewaugh  hm  im not so sure o that muttered the boy to himself  a few seconds put the matter at rest for the voice of the highlander was heard as they cautiously drew near saying  iss it you  i think it is replied archie why man where are you  i can see nothing  wow man but i am gled said fergus just follow your nose archie an youll be all right  another moment and the canoe was checked by fergus who had stepped into the water to prevent its being injured against the stones  you better gie me the paddle archie an sit beside little bill  it iss tired o paddlin you will be by now  but where is dan asked archie as he complied with this request  that iss more than i can tell you boy but hes safe enough i doubt not for i heard him gie a cheer as he jamp into the wuds an its beyont the power o a mortal redskin to chase an active man on a night like this  thereupon fergus gave a brief account of all that had happened after the canoes were partedas far as he knew itand then an earnest council of war was held as to what was the best course to pursue in the circumstances  being the youngest brave for little bill was ignored in this matter archie was invited to give his opinion first  this was well because being enthusiastic and irrepressible he would probably have given his opinion first at any rate  my opinion is he said promptly that we turn rightabout and go back to find dan even though we should have to fight the whole saulteaux nation  that iss well spoken said fergus with something of sarcasm in his tone but as we hev only two guns amang us a tomahawk an a knife or two without any claymores at all i would like to know what we are to fecht with  moreover what is to become o little bill when we are fechtin  it iss my opeenion that we put the command o our expeedition in the hands of okematan an leave him to do what he thinks best  archee is a true brave said the indian but he is young  when the wrinkles of age are on his brow he will be a great chief  okematans heart is with him to turn back and fight but wisdom says go to the settlement get men and return as fast as you can  then the sooner we set about it the better for when wans mind is made up talk iss only lost time  with that he shoved the canoe off into the stream and paddling was resumed with redoubled vigour  they proceeded in silence till the blush of rosy day in the east dispelled the intense darkness  then pulling ashore they kindled a small fire and while the chief regummed the seams of the canoe which leaked a little the others prepared and ate a hasty breakfast  they were still engaged with this meal and discussing not very hopefully the possibility of reaching red river settlement and returning in time to render relief to dansupposing that he should require reliefwhen the sound of fastdipping paddles was heard beyond the bend of the river just below them  another moment and four large canoes each manned by eight men swept into view their red sides glowing in the morning sun and their occupants driving the water behind them in foam by the vigour of their strokes  at first it was supposed that this was another band of indians proceeding possibly to join that from which they had just escaped but the fugitives were speedily undeceived by the appearance of the men as they drew nearer  i would be thinkin that the man in the bow o the first canoe is antoine dechamp said fergus as he stood peering over the bushes at the advancing brigade  im sure its dechamp  id know him a mile off said archie  ay an they hev got sight o the smoke of our fire too added fergus  it is dechamp said okematan decisively as he stepped into the open and held up his hand to the new arrivals  a cheer was raised by those in the canoes when the cree chief was recognised and the flotilla coming on at full speed soon reached the bank  explanations were speedily exchanged and our fugitives learned that news had been carried to the settlement of the approach of the very band of saulteaux whom they had encountered and a band of fiery young men led by dechamp had come out to meet them for the purpose of asking them whether they meant their visit to be friendly or whether they wished to measure their strength with the men of red river as if so a sample had come out for the express purpose of accommodating them  on hearing the news that okematan and fergus had to give the menmost of whom were halfbreeds connected with cree familiesgave a cheer and voted for an immediate advance against the saulteaux  this after very brief palaver was unanimously agreed to  youll not object to return with us i suppose asked dechamp of fergus  iss it objectin to a fecht you will mean  wellits not unlikely that there may be something of the sort going if we meet  did you ever hear of a mckay objectin to a fecht antoine  dechamp laughed  well he said i know okematan wont object to turn back and show us the way to the place where he met the reptiles  okematan was on his way to seek for help said the indian quietly  every one being agreed on this point the whole band reembarked and proceeded on their way up the river  they advanced rapidly for although the stream was against them it was so sluggish as to be scarcely appreciable and by keeping near to the banks they were not delayed by it at all  towards the afternoon the place where the struggle had taken place was reached but no saulteaux were to be seen  they had taken their departure and from the fact that several small things belonging to them had been left behind it seemed not unlikely that they had obtained information of the expedition sent out against them and had departed in haste  it iss of no use said fergus when this became evident for us to keep up a sternchase after them  they have got too much of a start so it seems to me boys we could not do better than follow up the tracks of daniel davidson an make sure that he has got clear away from them  to this proposal there was much objection at first for it involved some of the party quitting the canoes and journeying no one could tell how far through the woods on foot  besides said one dan is quite able to take care of himself and if he got off in the dark as you tell us he did theres not a man in the saulteaux nation could come up with him either in dark or light  that may be all fery true my frund returned fergus nevertheless im goin to follow up his track for it is sure that he took no proveesions wi him an it was too dark for me to see if he escaped wi his gun  dan is a strong man but the strongest man will be findin himself in diffeeculties without grub  it iss followin up his trail i will be doin wi some proveesions on my back if wan or two o you will go wuth me  i will go said archie sinclair promptly if some o you will promise to take care o little bill  a laugh greeted this offer and halfadozen of the men at once agreed to take good care of the invalid  moreover said dechamp whoever goes need not go further than the pine portage  the party on foot will have found out before the canoes reach that whether dan has got clear off and they can rejoin the canoes at the portage  so fergus ill join your party too  who else will go  okematan and jacques bourassin here stepped forward but none of the others seemed disposed to undertake the tramp  there iss enough of uswhatever remarked the highlander as he and the others put some provisions into their wallets and shouldered their guns  you will be our leader antoine dechamp  it iss yourself that knows the outs an ins o the land better than any of usexcept okematan may bebut i dar say hes not as weel acquaint wi the red river woods as wi the plains  the chief bowed a dignified assent to this proposition which however he hardly understood  dechamp being accustomed to lead accepted the position at once stepped off on the trail of dan which had been made distinctly visible when he went crashing through the underwood the day before  fergus followed and bourassin came third  now then said archie looking into the chiefs face come along oke  you and i will form the rearguard which is the position of danger and honour in warfare o this sortat least if it isnt it ought to be  take care o yourself little bill  well soon find dan goodbye  so saying the rearguard of the column vanished into the forest and the others returning to their canoes began to descend the river  archie was nearer the mark than he imagined when he said they would soon find dan  the distance which it had taken our hero so long to traverse in the dark was comparatively short and the light was only beginning to fade when they came to the edge of the wood where dan had spent the night  dechamp of course was first to come upon his encampment and the instant he entered it he observed the open space giving a view of the plain beyond  he also saw the wolf sitting on his haunches about two hundred yards off  quick as the lightning flash his gun flew to his shoulder  dechamp was a firstrate shot  he fired and as we have seen the wolf stretched himself in death upon the plain  thus was dan davidson rescued at almost the eleventh hour    chapter twenty six  homecoming and bargaining  the return of the hunting party to red river settlement was an illustration of the uncertainty of all human affairs  they went forth rejoicing in all the strength of youth and manhood they returned in sorrow with one at least of the strong men reduced to the last stage of weakness  we would not be understood to refer to this in a pessimistic spirit  on the contrary the optimistic view suggests the very same idea of uncertainty though in a pleasant aspect for does not many a day that dawns in cloud and rain progress to brilliant sunshine while equally true it is that many a life which begins in sorrow culminates in joy  okematan who was intensely philosophical and inquisitive had been carrying on a semispeculative conversation with billie on this very subject while descending the red river towards prairie cottagemuch to the perplexity of the invalid who scarce knew how to answer the chiefs queries and greatly to the interest of archie who wondered at little bills powers of reply  by the way said archie when you two have settled that knotty point will you tell me who is to take the news of dans accident to mrs davidson  well have to carry him up to the house you know on a blanket tween two poles an shell be sure to think that hes dead or has been killed an thatll halfkill her itll give her such a fright  somebody will have to go on ahead and tell her  i will if you like said billie if youll only carry me up to the garden gate and set me down i can easily walk up the path  this proposal had just been agreed to when the whole flotilla of canoes paddled up alongside of the bank close under prairie cottage  it was evening at the time  the davidson family was at supper and as the canoes had approached very quietly with dan in the leading one no person stood on the bank to welcome them  its as well they dont know said archie jumping on shore  now little bill come along and ill carry you to the gate while theyre arranging matters for dan  seated at the foot of the family table was peter davidson  he could see the garden path through the window  hallo mother he exclaimed dropping his knife and fork there is little bill or his ghost coming up the track  impossible peter said the good lady with however a look of anxiety which showed she believed that or something else to be quite possible  look for yourself mother cried peter springing up and running out  it is billie said jessie reflecting her mothers anxiety what can have brought them back so soon  peter reentered at the moment with little bill in his arms  he set the boy down and again ran out  taking the widows trembling hand in both of his billie addressed her as mother like the rest of the family  dan has been hurt he said in his soft way and hes come home to get well  they will bring him up directly  is he too ill to walk asked the widow  no not too illbut too weak answered the matteroffact billie indeed he is not ill at all but he has lost a heap of blood for they shot him  jessie waited to hear no more but immediately followed peter and the small servant louise followed suit leaving the widow in a halffainting condition with the boy  but she did not remain long thus for just then old duncan mckay entered by the backdoor  it will be bad news youve been hearin mrs davidson he said in some surprise pouring out a glass of water as he spoke and considerately handing it to the widow  yeso yes  ive just heard that dan has been shot  bless my soul exclaimed the horrified old man almost falling into a chair  ississ he tead  no thank godonly weak from loss of blood  hell be here directly  that iss goot newswhatever for as long as theres life theres hope  trying to comfort himself as well as his friend with this truism the old man staggered out of the house in search of those who had gone before  soon a sad procession was seen coming up the path led by archie  four men carried dan on a rudelyextemporised litter  his bloodless face and lips gave him the appearance of death but the glow in his eyes told of still unexhausted life  ill be all right mother he said feebly as they laid him on his bed  i only want food and rest  thank godhome at last  as he spoke a quiet step was heard and elspie with a face as pale as his own knelt by his bedside and took his hand  that touch was the first impulse the youth received towards decided recovery  old mckay perceived the change in his countenance  yes yes ay ay he exclaimed pacing violently up and down the room he wants nothin but victuals an reststeaks an shops and plenty o whusky an waterhot  dont be croodin about him an botherin him come away and leave him to his mother an send for the doctor  has no wan gone for him yet  yes peter has just started  i heard the clatter of his horses feet said jessie  it iss not the doctor that will put him right whatever muttered the old man as he left the room followed by most of the family  and the doctor himself held the same opinion for he said on returning to the reception hall after seeing his patient  it will be a considerable time before he recovers for the fountain of life had been wellnigh drained when he fortunately extemporised that tourniquet  but theres no fear of him all that he wants is food rest and peace of mind  an whusky doctor added old mckay  dont forget the best pheesic an i hev goot store of it too in my cellar at ben nevis  im not so sure about the whisky mr mckay returned the doctor with a laugh  i think we shall manage to pull him through without that  the other requisites for recovery were applied without stint at prairie cottage for despite the misfortune which had attended the cultivation of the soil the davidsons had a little money which enabled them to buy provisions and other necessaries obtainable from the hudson bay company and thus tide over the disastrous year in greater comfort than fell to the lot of many of the other settlers  thus dan was well looked after  his brother peter found the foodat least much of iton the prairie and in the woods his sister jessie cooked it louise helped looked on and learned home afforded rest elspie supplied the peace of mindat least as much of it as it was possible for a fellowmortal to supply and his mother superintended all  add to this that archie sinclair cheered him with miscellaneous gossip that little bill read to him or entertained him with serious talk and grave speculation that andre morel and his sister often entertained him with song that on such occasions jenkins the sailor frequently amused him with nautical tales that old peg sometimes came from ben nevis to gaze at him tenderly and that okematan came to glare at him more or less affectionatelyand we have said enough to warrant the conclusion that dan davidson had a pretty good time of it in spite of his weak condition  nevertheless dan was not quite happy  he could not get rid of the memory of henri perrins murder and the terrible thought that elspies brother duncan had some sort of guilty knowledge of it  these thoughts he buried deep however in his own breast and even tried to forget them  vain effort for does it not stand to reason that the thing we strive most earnestly to forget is the very thing which by that effort we are fixing with a deeper stamp on memory  francois la certe was somewhat exercised about the same question about the same time  that estimable member of the colony was seated one fine day on the banks of the river fishing for goldeyesa small fish about the size of a plump herring  his amiable spouse was helping or rather fishing with him  it was a fine healthy contemplative occupation one that admirably suited their tendency to repose and at the same time filled them with that virtuous sensation which awaits those who know that they are engaged in useful occupationfor were not goldeyes the best of eating  branches of trees were their primitive rods twine their simple lines grasshoppers their bait and a violent jerk their method  slowfoot said la certe  my husband or some such indian phrase answered the woman  i have been wondering for a long time now whyhino  i thought there was something at my baitbut it was deception  nothing is so unreal as the bite of the goldeyewhen it is not there  it brings to mind the lights in the sky of winter which dance and shootand yet they are not  hi hoi have him  i was mistaken  i thought the fish was notbut it was  while speaking la certe sent a small fish with bursting violence on the grass behind him  almost at the same moment slowfoot landed another with less violence and more coolness  what was i saying slowfoot asked the halfbreed when the hooks had been rebaited and their eyes were riveted on their respective floats  nothing that any one could remember answered his truthful spouse  now i rememberho was that another  no it was not answered his matteroffact helpmate  where is our child asked the father with that wayward wandering of mind which is a not uncommon characteristic of genius  smoking in the tent answered the mother  and with my pipe no doubt said the father laying down his rod and searching in the bag in which he was wont to carry among other things his pipe and tobacco  a cry of pain from the tent in questionwhich was close behind the pairapprised the parents that something was wrong  immediately their first and only one issued with a tobacco pipe in one hand and a burnt finger on the other  it came to the father for sympathy and got it that is to say la certe put the burnt finger in his mouth for a moment and uttered some guttural expressions of sympathy  having thus fulfilled duty and relieved conscience he exchanged the finger for the pipestem and began to smoke  the spoiled as well as despoiled child uttered a howl of indignation and staggered off to its mother but she received it with a smile of affectionate indifference whereupon the injured creature went back to the tent howling and apparently howled itself to sleep  again la certe broke the piscatorial spell that had settled down on them and taking up the thread of discourse where he had dropped it repeated his statement that he had been wondering for a long time why cloudbrow alias young duncan mckay was so sharp and fierce in denying that he knew anything about the murder of henri perrin  hee hee was slowfoots significant reply  can slowfoot not guess he asked after attending to a hopeful nibble which came to nothing  slowfoot need not guess she knows said the woman with an air of great mystery  what does slowfoot know  the womans answer to this was a look of exceeding slyness  but this did not content her lord who after repeated questions and a threat to resort to extreme measures in case of continued refusal drew from her a distinct answer  slowfoot knows that cloudbrow killed perrin  sh exclaimed la certe with a look of real concern i am not yet tired of you slowfoot and if old mckay hears you say that he will shoot you  slowfoot is not a fool retorted the woman the old man will never hear her say that  what has slowfoot got to do with it  she can hold her tongue  she can do that for certain returned her husband with goodnatured sarcasm  in that as in many things she excels other women  i would never have married her had it not been so  but how do you come to be so sure  i know the knife returned the woman becoming more literal as she went on and marie blanc knows it  her husband once got the loan of it from cloudbrow and she looked at it with care because she had never seen such a knife before  she knew all its marks  why does cloudbrow deny that it is his  because it was cloudbrow who killed perrin  if it had been anybody else he would have known it and he would have said sofor he was there  how know you that he was there  marie blanc knows  she netted the snowshoes that cloudbrow wore and she saw the footprints  but pairs of snowshoes are very like each other objected la certe  very like  yes but did ever two shoes have the same mends in the same places of the netting where it had been broken and the same marks on the frames  never  it will go hard with cloudbrow if this is true  it will go hard with him whether it is true or not returned the woman for some of the friends of perrin believe it to be true and swear  the disappearance of slowfoots float at this moment stopped her swearing and brought the conversation to an abrupt end  the landing of another goldeye prevented its resumption  having caught more than enough for a good supper this easygoing pair leaned their rods against a tree and ascended the bank towards their tent which was an ordinary conical indian wigwam composed partly of leather and partly of birchbark with a curtain for a door and a hole in the top for a window it also served for a chimney  on the way they encountered one of the poor swiss immigrants who having a wife and family and having been unsuccessful in buffalohunting and indeed in all other hunting was in a state which bordered on starvation  you have been lucky said the switzer eyeing la certes fish greedily  sometimes luck comes to usnot often answered the halfbreed  have you caught any  yes two small ones  here they are  but what are these among three children and a wife  i know not how to fish said the mountaineer disconsolately  the fact was not surprising for the poor man was a watchmaker by trade and had never handled rod or gun till he was as it were cast adrift in ruperts land  i will sell you some of my fish said la certe who on all occasions had a keen eye for a bargain  good  i am ready to buy said the poor fellow but i have not much to spend  only last week i gave my silver watch for eight gallons of wheat  i meant it for seed but my wife and children were starving so we were have no seed and only five shillings to spare  well my friend said la certe fish is very scarce just now but you may have five goldeyes for your five shillings  o that is too much remonstrated the switzer  no no interrupted the halfbreed amiably by no meansbut if you really think it too much fish for the money i will give you four goldeyes  come you know i dont mean that returned the other with a cynical smile  make it six and i will agree  and here is a pinch of snuff in to the bargain  he pulled out a box as he spoke and opened it  ha said la certe helping himself  i love snuff and so does my wife  do you not  slowfoot answered hee hee and helped herself to as much as a good broad finger and thumb could grasp after which she sneezed with violence  now behold my friendawheesht said la certe sneezing a bass accompaniment to slowfoots treble  i will give you a catfisha whole catfish forawheeshtfor that box and snuff  the switzer shook his head  nay he said  the snuff you may have but the box was the gift of a friend and i am loath to part with it  besides the box is of little real value  you may have the head of the catfish for the snuff and the whole catfish for the box said la certe with the firmness of a man who has irrevocably made up his mindfor there are none so firm of purpose as the weak and vacillating when they know they have got the whiphand of any one  and behold  i will be liberal he added  you shall have another goldeye into the bargainsix goldeyes for the five shillings and a whole catfish for the box and snuffvoila  the poor switzer still hesitated  it is a great deal to give for so little he said  that may be true said the other but i would not see my family starve for the satisfaction of carrying a snuffbox and five shillings in my pocket  this politic reference to the starving family decided the matter the poor switzer emptied his pockets with a sigh received the fish and went on his way leaving la certe and slowfoot to return to their wigwam highly pleased with their bargain  as must have been noted by the reader long ere now this likeminded couple did not possess a conscience between themat least if they did it must at that time have been a singularly shrunken and mummified one which they had managed to keep hidden away in some dark and exceedingly ungetatable chamber of the soul  commercially speaking however they had some ground for satisfaction for at that time the ordinary price of a catfish which is a little larger than a haddock was threepence  awakening the juvenile la certe to the blissful realisation that a good square meal was pending slowfoot ordered it to fill and light the pipe for the father while she set about preparing the fish for supper    chapter twenty seven  visit from sioux brought to a disastrous close  happening to hear of the bargain which we have just described and being under the impression that it might be good for la certes spirit to receive a mild reproof mr sutherland paid him a visit  the scotch elder was for a long time the only man fitted to perform the duties of a minister to his countrymen in that outoftheworld colony and being a true man of god he could not hear of gross injustice or heartless conduct without some slight attempt to open the others eyes to his sin  it may well be understood that in the nature of things and the state of the country the solitary elders duties were by no means light or agreeable  indeed he would have had no heart to cope with them and with the difficulties they entailed had he not remembered that the battle was not his but the lords and that he was only an instrument in the allpowerful hand of the spirit of god  his own weapons were the word prayer and the name of jesus  but it was not given to him to see much fruit of his visit to la certe at that time  the halfbreed besides asserting himself to be a catholic by which he meant a roman catholic and therefore in no way amenable to sutherlands jurisdiction received his remonstrances with philosophical arguments tending to prove that men were meant to make the best of circumstances as they found them without any regard to principleswhich after all were not very seriously held or practised by any one he thoughtespecially in red river  as for slowfoot she listened with evident interest and curiosity to the strange teaching and exhortations of the elder but when appealed to for some sort of opinion on the various points touched she replied with an imbecile hee hee which was not encouraging  however the good man had sown the seed faithfully and kindly  the watering thereof and the sprouting were he knew in the hands of the master  rising to take leave the elder put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a large claspknife  why thats my knife that i lost exclaimed la certe in surprise where did you find it  i found it on my table at home where you left it that time you came to ask for some tobacco  now observe if i did not seriously hold and practise the principle of honesty i would have made the best of circumstances as i found them and would have put the knife in my pocket instead of returning it to you  la certe laughed and slowfoot said hee hee while the juvenile la certe availed itself of the opportunity to draw the pipe gently from its fathers hand and have a whiff  i have a message to you from the governor continued the elder taking a piece of paper out of his pocket  for me exclaimed la certe in surprise  yes  he heard that you are hard up just now and that you are going up the river a considerable distance to huntis not that so  yes that is true  we start off tomorrow  well then he gave me this order for some supplies of powder and shot twine and hooks with some cloth beads and such like for slowfoot  that is very good of the governorvery considerate said la certe with a pleased look  very good said sutherland  now la certe suppose it true that men are meant to make the best of circumstances as they find them and that i was a man without any regard to principle i might have drawn these supplies from the store for you and used them myself and you would not have been a bit the wiser  again the halfbreed laughed and admitted the truth of the proposition while slowfoot expressed her belief whatever it was in a more than usually emphatic hee hee  returning home from his apparently useless errand sutherland met fred jenkins with a gun on his shoulder  the seaman was accompanied by archie sinclair  well jenkins he said heartily you must be like a fish out o water in these regions  dont you feel a longing sometimes for the roar of the gale and the smell o the salt sea  cant say as i does mr sutherland  ive bin used to accommodate myself to circumstances dee see ever since i was a small shaver so nothin comes exactly amiss to me  o fred how can you tell thumpers like that interrupted the forward archie  isnt elise morel a miss to you and elspie and jessie davidson  clap a stopper on your mug you young scape grace retorted the seaman who had some doubt as to whether the boys putting elise morels name first was intentional or an accident  as i was agoing to say sir i was always fond o changes an the rollin plains come to me as pleasant though not quite so familiar as the rollin sea  thats a satisfactory state o mind anyhow returned the elder  but where away nowto cater for the pot i dare say  well no not exactlythough ive no objection to do that too in the bygoin  but weve heard a report that a band o sioux are goin to visit the settlement and as theres a lot o their enemies the saulteaux knocking about ive bin sent to the fort by old mckay to see if theyve heard about the sioux comin an if theres likely to be a scrimmage so as we may clear for action dee see  i see and i hope there will be no need to clear for action  im glad to see archie with you too said sutherland but surprised for i dont remember when i saw him without little bill on his back or at his side  o as to that little bill has forsaken me said archie or i have forsaken himim not sure whichsince dan davidsons accident for he does little else but sit at dans bedside readin to him or talking with him  the dear little fellow could not be better employed remarked the elder  the dear little fellow could be much better employed retorted the boy with unexpected decision  he could be rambling about the plains or in the bush with me getting strength to his muscles and fresh air to his lungs an health to his bodyto say nothing of his soul  why you are becoming jealous lad said sutherland with a laugh  no im not becoming jealous im jealous already returned the boy with an air that was half jocular half serious  however ill exercise patience a little longer but im determined not to let little bill be sacrificed for the sake of sicknursing  with this announcement of his unalterable resolve to stand to his guns and a brayvo youngster from jenkins they parted and went on their several ways  it was found when fort garry was reached that the rumour of a visit from the sioux indians was correct and that some preparation was being made for their reception as well as precautions against any mischief that might be contemplated though there was not much to be apprehended on that score for the sioux were believed to be among the bravest as well as the most powerful of the nations east of the rocky mountains and less addicted to treachery or cruelty than most other tribes  two days later the sioux made their appearance  they formed only a small band of warriors but were a wildlooking though fine set of men erect muscular tall fellows with the free bearing of practised warriors and in all the paint charcoal feathers and leathercostume bearclaw collars etcetera peculiar to the western wilderness  their object they said was to smoke the pipe of peace with their enemies the saulteaux and to see with their own eyes the wonderful things that by report the palefaces were doing in red river  the sioux have heard said their principal chief at a palaver with the governor that the palefaces are building wooden wigwams in number like the stones on the shores of lake winnipeg that they are growing much grain that they have set up many strange things which they compel the wind to work for them and so grind their grain that they have great heaps of powder and ball and big wigwams that are bursting with things that the sioux love to exchange for the meat and skins of the buffalo and other beasts great and small  we have come to see all this with our own eyes for most of us are young men who have only heard of such things from our fathers  waugh  of course everything was said to encourage this laudable desire for knowledge  the visitors were shown over the fort  food was given to them and tobacco then the pipe of peace was smoked with a band of saulteaux which chanced to be on a friendly visit to the settlement at the time after which as was customary on such occasions both parties mixed together and strolled about to see the settlers  one party of them found their way to prairie cottage  at some of the houses nearer the fort they had learned the method of lifting the latch of a door so as to obtain entrance  finding no one outside at the cottage they entered the central hall with the soft quiet tread of the panther  as no one chanced to be there they continued their explorations with childlike simplicity and thus most unexpectedly found themselves in the bedroom of dan davidson where little bill had just read himself and his brotherinvalid into a sound sleep  both wakened up at once and the boy sat bolt upright in blazing astonishment but dan who had heard of their arrival in the settlement received them with a few words of welcome  fortunately for all parties okematan presented himself just then having while at work in the garden seen the party of sioux arrive  he did his best to act the host explaining to the visitors the cause of dans weakness and by dans directions offering them tobacco and pipes  while they were thus engaged old mckay entered  i saw you comin lads he said heartily  what cheer what cheer he added shaking hands with them all round  the sioux were obviously much pleased with their reception especially when mrs davidson jessie and elspie who had been out walking returned and joined the party  after showing the indians everything in the house old mckaywho constituted himself their guidetook them out to see the live stock and the farm  he led them first into the garden  it chanced at this time that there was a snake in the grass not far off  this was no other than the bad indian kateegoose  why some people are what we call naturally bad like kateegoose while others are what we call naturally good like okematan is a mystery the investigation of which we propose postponing to a more convenient season  of course no sane person will maintain that this mystery frees fallen man from responsibility  if it did we could no longer hang for murder  it would be the bounden duty of every judge in that case to acquit every murderer with poor fellow it was his fate he could not help it and send him away with a pat on the shoulder and an order for coffee and buns perhaps in his pocket  as none but sane persons however will read my book it is not necessary to enlarge further on this head  certain it is that kateegoose was badobdurately badhad been so from his very cradle if he ever had one which is doubtful and bade fair to continue so to his grave  sutherland had buttonholed him more than once but apparently in vain  it is only fair to the savage to say that he listened patiently to the elders remonstrances and attentively to his exhortations and assumed an aspect of mild contrition that might or might not have been sincereas far as appearance went  now it unfortunately happened that among the sioux braves there was a man who had done kateegoose a deadly injury of some sort which nothing short of blood could wipe out  kateegoose in familiar parlance spotted him at once and dogged his steps through the settlement watching his opportunity for revenge  in savage life this dogging process would not have been possible but in a comparatively crowded settlement and in the midst of all the surprising novelties that surrounded the palefaces it was all too easy for kateegoose took care to keep as much as possible in the background and well under cover of houses cottages carts stacks and wigwams besides which he had painted his face in such a manner and so modified his costume that his own acquaintances among the settlershe had no friendsfailed to recognise him  they in their comparative ignorance of savage life set him down as one of the visitors while the visitors if they noticed him at all esteemed him one of the crossbreeds of the settlement  the only man who saw through the disguise of kateegoose was okematan who could not understand why he had adopted it and who resolved to keep a sharp eye on him  the enemy of kateegoose was one of the younger sioux chiefs  he led the party which visited prairie cottage  the garden of the cottage at its lower end towards the river approached close to the confines of a thick coppice  it formed the extremity of a belt of woodland which at that time bordered the river there a small summerhouse had been erected by dan and peter davidson for the benefit of their mother and their sister jessie  kateegoose while dogging his foe recognised this as a spot very suitable for his fell purpose as the contiguous wood afforded a ready means of escape after the deed should be done  while old mckay was conducting the sioux slowly through the garden kateegoose glided swiftly through the thicket to the spot where the summerhouse stood and took up a position behind it so that the party in making the round of the garden would necessarily pass close to him  from the window of dans room little bill observed part of these mysterious movements and suspected mischief  without uttering a word he left the room opened the front door and gave a low whistle which had been set up as a private signal between him and okematan  in a few seconds the cree chief was by his side  oke theres mischief intended  youll have to be quick he said quickly explaining what he had seen  rejoin the party at once he added and look outsharp  the chief nodded and walked away  so swift yet so quiet had been his movements that none of the whites of the party had observed his departure from them  the sioux however had noticed it and their suspicions were aroused especially when they saw him rejoin the party and observed that he walked rather closer to them than before  but they were proud warriors and refused by word look or movement to indicate their suspicions  they carried bows in their hands arrows in their quivers tomahawks and scalpingknives in their belts but they scorned to make any visible demonstration of being on guard in the midst of paleface friends though they gave intense and undivided attention to the movements of okematan  this concentration of attention on the wrong man was of course rather favourable to the designs of kateegoose so that when the party passed the summerhouse he was enabled to spring upon his enemy unobserved for the first moment with knife upraised  but the stab from which the sioux chief could not have escaped was rendered harmless by the prompt action of okematan who threw up his left arm turned the blow aside and received a slight wound in doing so  there was no time to repeat the blow  with a yell of mingled defiance and disappointment the wouldbe assassin leaped the garden fence bounded into the thicket and disappeared  a flight of sioux arrows entered the bush almost the moment after  the young chief and his friends also leaped the fence and followed in pursuit  the sioux were swift and agile undoubtedly but so was kateegoose and he had the advantage of knowing the ground while the trailby which in ordinary circumstances the redman can track his enemy through the forestwas not available there in consequence of its being so mingled up with the crossing and recrossing of the innumerable tracks of settlers  the result was that kateegoose made his escape  the colonists were very indignant at the perpetration of this cowardly act for it compromised their character for hospitality and if they could have laid hands on the savage at the time it is not impossible that lynchlaw might have been applied to him  the governor also was greatly annoyed and in the afternoon of the following day made the visitors a number of presents besides providing for them a feast but all his good intentions were spoiled by kateegoose who had the audacity to come forward and deliberately shoot his foe while the sioux were at meat  the ball passed quite through the sioux chiefs body and wounded the man who was next to him  after this dastardly act the villain fled and again got safe away  the enraged sioux seizing their weapons would have wreaked their vengeance on the saulteaux if they could have discovered any but these wily savages had cleared away at the first note of alarm and not one was to be found  to have attacked the whites with so small a party would have been useless as well as unjust  they therefore left the colony in fierce anger  it chanced that la certe had pitched his tent the day before on a stream not fardistant from the colony  the sioux had to pass that way and espying the wigwam turned aside to wreak their vengeance on whomsoever it might contain  fortunately the owner of the mansion and his wife had gone out fishing in a canoe and taken the child with them  all that the sioux could do therefore was to appropriate the poor mans goods and chattels but as the halfbreed had taken his gun ammunition and fishingtackle with him there was not much left to appropriate  having despoiled the mansion they set fire to it and went their way  returning in the evening la certe found his house a heap of ashes and himself reduced to a state of destitution  this being his normal state however he was not profoundly affected  neither was his wife still less was his child  he said no word but carried the contents of the canoe on shore  his wife equally reticent helped him  his child lighting its fathers pipe sat down to smoke and look on  they turned the canoe bottom up to serve as a partial shelter they kindled a huge fire before it they set up three large fat ducks to roast in front of it and were soon busy with a simple but satisfying supper  after washing this down with an unstimulating draught of pure water they put the baby to bed under the bow of the canoe filled their pipes and sat down before the ruddy blaze to mingle their hopes joys prospects and sorrows in a halo of smokethe very personification of primitive contentment and felicity    chapter twenty eight  very perplexing interviews with little bill  things in the colony had at this time come to what may be styled a complicated pass for distress and starvation were rampant on the one hand while on the other hand the weather was superb giving prospect at last of a successful harvest  the spring buffalohunt had been but partially successful so that a number of the buffalo runners had to make arrangements to support themselves by fishing during the autumn in lakes winnipeg and manitoba  in these great freshwater seas there is an unlimited quantity of rich and finely flavoured whitefish or titameg besides other fish  but titameg are only to be caught in large quantities during autumn and of course much of the success of fishing depends on weatherone gale sometimes visiting the fishermen with ruinruin all the more complete that the nets which may be carried away have in many cases to be paid for out of the produce of the seasons fishing  in addition to the buffalohunters who were obliged to support themselves by fishing there was a large number of idle halfbreeds of a much lower type than these plain hunters who had to betake themselves to the same pursuit  these were the neerdoweels of the colony men who like la certe with more or lessusually lessof his goodnature seemed to hold that all the industrious people in the world were created to help or to support them and their families  of course when the industrious people were unsuccessful these idlers were obliged to work for their living which being unaccustomed to do anything energetic they found it hard and difficult to do and generally regarded themselves as the harshly used victims of a tyrannous fate  there was one thing however at which these idlers were very expert and diligentthey begged well and with persistency  no wonder for their lives often depended on their persistent and successful begging  the company and the private storekeepers were always more or less willing to risk their goods by advancing them on credit  before the summer was over most of these people had got their supplies and were off to the fishing grounds regardless of the future with large quantities of tea and tobacco and happy as kings are said to bebut never are if history be true  among these of course was la certe  that typical idler had made the most of his misfortunes  everybody had heard what the sioux had done to him and everybody had pitied him  pity opens the heart and that opens the hand and when the poor man entered a store with the polite manner of a french canadian and the humble aspect of a ruined man he scarcely required to beg  one man lent him a tent  another lent him a canoe from the companys store at fort garry he received a fair outfit of nearly all that he could require  further down the settlement there was a private storekeeper with a jovial countenance  o it was a sad sad sight he said to this man on entering the storeso very sad to see my tent in ashes and nothing leftnothing absolutely  the jovial man was moved  he gave la certe what he asked foreven pressed things on him and also bestowed on him a considerable gratuity  still further down the settlement the unfortunate man found the store or shop of another friend  this man was saturnine of countenance but moderately liberal of heart  la certe approached him with an air so pitiful that the saturnine man melted like snow in the sunshine or wax under heat  i have heard of your loss he said and i will give you credit this time la certe though you are so bad at paying your debts  but i wont give you much  i do not want much returned the afflicted man in tones of deep humilityonly a littlea very little  by asking much more than he required la certe obtained as much as he wanted from the saturnine man and thus he finally started for lake winnipeg with a canoe laden almost to sinking with the good things of this life  the fineness of that summer brought forth the fruits of the earth in great luxuriance and it really seemed as if at last the scotch settlers were going to reap some reward for all their prolonged perseverance and industry  the long rest the good feeding the sunshine of nature and the starlight of elspies eyes had a powerful effect on dan davidsons health so that by the time autumn arrived and the prospects of a splendid harvest became more certain every day he had recovered much of his usual strength of body and vigour of mind  little bill also felt the genial influences around him and to the intense joy of archie became visibly fatter and stronger while his large blue eyes lost some of that wistfully solemn appearance with which they had been wont to gaze inquiringly into peoples faces  one afternoon billie having walked to the summer house in the prairie cottage garden along with archie was left alone there at his own request for unlike other boys he was fond of occasional solitary meditation  now mind little billyou whistle if you want me said archie when about to leave him  ill hear you for im only going to the carpenters shed  i will archie if i want you but i dont think i shall for i can walk by myself now quite easily as far as the house  but little bill was not destined to be left to solitary meditations that day for his brother had not left him more than a few minutes when a footstep was heard on the path outside and next moment fred jenkins presented himself at the opening of the summerhouse  the face of the mariner betrayed him for he was too honest by nature to dissemble effectively  well fred how are you  you seem a little disappointed i think  not exactly disappointed little bill but sort o ways scumbusticated so to speakperplexed if i may say so  kind o ways puzzled dee see  there was something very amusing in the manner of the strapping seaman as he sat down beside the puny little boy with a bashful expression on his handsome face as if he were about to make a humiliating confession  what troubles you jenkins asked billie with the air of a man who is ready to give any amount of advice or if need be consolation  the seaman twisted his eyebrows into a complex form and seemed uncertain how to proceed  suddenly he made up his mind  was you ever in love little bill he asked abruptly and with a smile that seemed to indicate a feeling that the question was absurd  o yes answered the boy quite coolly  ive been in love with brother archie ever since i can remember  jenkins looked at his little friend with a still more complicated knot of puzzlement in his eyebrows for he felt that billie was scarcely fitted by years or experience to be a useful confidant  after resting his hands on his knees and his eyes on the ground for some time he again made up his mind and turned to billie who sat with his large eyes fixed earnestly on the countenance of his tall friend wondering what perplexed him so much and waiting for further communications  little bill said jenkins laying a large hand on his small knee in course you cant be expected to understand what i wants to talk about but theres nobody else id like to speak to and youre such a knowin little shaver that somehow i felt a kind ofof notion that id like to ask your advicedee see  i seeall right returned billie though i wonder at such a man as you wanting advice from the like of me  but ill do what i can for you jenkins and perhaps i know more about the thing that troubles you than you think  im afraid not returned the seaman with a humorous twinkle in his eye  you see billie you never wanted to get spliced did you  spliced  whats that  well i should have said married  o no  i dont think the thought of that ever did occur to me  im sorry jenkins but i really cannot give you advice on that subject  hm  im not so sure o that little bill  youre such a practical little chap that i do believe if you was put to it youd be able to see now  if you happened to want to marry a nice little gal what would you do  i would ask her said little bill promptly  jus so but that is what i have not got courage to do  jenkins laughed at the expression of blazing surprise with which the boy received this statement  have not got courage he repeated and then after a pausehave all the stories you have told me then been nothing but lies  what stories billie  why such as that one about the pirates in the java seas when ten of them attacked you and you were obliged to kill four and all the rest ran away  no billiethat was no lie it was quite true  but then these blackguards were cowards at bottom and they saw that id got a brace o doublebarrelled pistols in my belt and was pretty well up in the cutlass exercise  and that time when you led a storming party against the fort in south america and was the only one left o the party and fought your way all alone in through the breach till the troops came up and carried you on with a rush andandwas all about that untrue  not a bit of it billie though i wouldnt have you think i was boastin about it  i only gave you the bare facts which like bare poles is as much as a ship can stand sometimes  an that time you jumped overboard in port royal among the sharks to save the little girl  thats a fact if ever there was one said the seaman quickly for the dear child is alive this good day to swear to it if need be  yet you tell me continued little bill that you have not the courage to ask a nice little girl to marry you  thats exactly how the matter stands billie  it was now billies turn to look perplexed  who is this nice little girl he asked abruptly as if the answer to that question might help to explain the enigma  wellits elise morel an mind not a soul knows about that but you an me little bill  butbut elise is not a little girl  shes a big woman  jenkins laughed as he explained that seamen sometimes had a habit mistaken it might beof calling even big women nice little gals when they chanced to be fond of them  and are you really afraid to ask elise to marry you asked the boy earnestly  i suspect thats whats the matter wi me replied the sailor with a modest look  i always thought that nothing could frighten you said billie in a somewhat disappointed tone for it seemed to him as if one of his idols were shaking on its pedestal  i cant understand it for i would not be afraid to ask herif i wanted her  at this jenkins again laughed and said that he believed him and that billie would understand these things better when he was older  in the meantime little bill he continued i havent got the heart of a mother careys chicken  i could stand afore a broadside without winkin i believe i think i could blow up a magazine or fight the french as easy as i could eat my breakfast amost but to ask a pure beautiful angel like elise to marry me a common seamanwhy i hasnt got it in me  yet im so fond o that little gal that id strike my colours to her without firin a single shot  does elise want to marry you asked billie  oh thats the very pint said the seaman with decision  if i could only make sure o that pint id maybe manage to come up to the scratch now thats what i wants you to find out for me little bill an i know youre a good little shaver asll do a friend a good turn when you can  but you must on no account mention  he was going to have said you must on no account mention that i was blabbing to you about this or that i wanted to find out such a thing when the sudden appearance of elises lapdog announced the fact that its mistress was approaching  with a flushed face the bold seaman sprang up and darted out as if to attack one of those pirates of the java seas who had made so powerful an impression on little bills mind  but his object was escapenot attack  lightly vaulting the garden fence he disappeared into the same thicket which on another occasion had afforded opportune refuge to kateegoose  a few moments later elise turned into the walk and stood before the summerhouse  you here little bill she exclaimed on entering i am very glad to find you for i have been alone all the morning  everybody is awayin the fields i supposeand i dont like being alone  was you ever in love elise asked the boy with a solemn countenance  the girl laughed heartily and blushed a little  what a strange question billie she said why do you ask  well its not easy to explain all at once butbut i want to know if you want to be married  elise laughed again and then becoming suddenly grave asked seriously why billie put such foolish questions  because said little bill slowly and with an earnest look jenkins is very anxious to know if you are fond of him and he actually says that hes afraid to ask you to marry him  isnt that funny  i said that even i would not be afraid to ask you if i wanted youhow red you are elise  have you been running  o no replied the girl sheltering herself under another laugh and what did he say to that  he said a great many things  i will try to remember them  let me seehe said i havent got the heart of a mother careys chickenhe didnt tell me who mother carey is but thats no matter for it was only one of her chickens he was speaking ofi could stand afore a broadside without winkini give you his very words elise for i dont quite understand them myselfi could blow up a magazine he went on or fight the french as easy as i could eat my breakfast amost but to ask a pure an beautiful angel like elise yes indeed you neednt shake your head he said these very words exactlya pure an beautiful angel like elise to marry me a common seaman why i hasnt got it in me  yet im so fond o that little gal that id strike my colours to her without firin a single shot  now do you understand all that elise for i dont understand the half of it  o yes i understand a good deal of it though some of it is indeed puzzling as you say  but how did you come to recollect it all so well little bill  because he said he wanted me to help him and to find out if you wanted to marry him so i paid particular attention to what he said and  did he tell you to tell me all this asked elise abruptly and with sudden gravity  o dear no but as he wanted me to find it out for him and said that not a soul knew about the matter but me i thought the simplest way would be to tell you all he said and then ask you straight  he was going to tell me something more very particularly for he was just saying in a very solemn tone you must on no account mention when your little dog bounced in and jenkins bounced out leaving the rest of it unsaid  then he has just left you said elise  just a moment or two before you came up  i think he must have seen some sort of beast in the wood and gone in chase of it he bolted in such a hurry so i dont know yet what i was not to mention  now little bill said elise with great seriousness of tone and manner you must not tell mr jenkins one word of the conversation that you and i have had just now  what not a single word  not one  you understand  yes but if he asks me i must answer something you know and i must not tell lies  quite true billie  you must not tell lies on any account whatever now listen  if he asks you about our conversation this morning you must say that i told you you were never to open your lips about the subject again either to me or to him or to anybody  mr jenkins is an honourable man and will not ask you a single question after that  then im not to tell him whether you want to marry him  how can you tell him what you dont know  well but i mean that youre not going to tell me so that i might tell him  certainly not  not a word to him and not a word to younor to anybody  not even to archie  yes  that is exactly what you must promise me  this is a very unpleasant state of things said little bill with a sad and puzzled countenance but of course i promise for it is your affair you know  it was a notable fact which little bill did not fail to notebut did not dare to mentionthat after that date there was a distinct change of demeanour in elise morel towards the handsome sailorwhether in his favour or otherwise it was impossible to tell  meanwhile events were pending which were destined to exercise a very powerful influence over the fortunes of the red river colony and indeed over the condition of the whole of ruperts land    chapter twenty nine  the fishery disasters  one fine day when summer had merged into autumn and things in red river appeared to be advancing favourably and dan davidson had recovered his strength and little bill was fairly well it occurred to okematan that he would like to go to lake winnipeg and see how the settlers who had gone to the fishery there were getting on  you see the cree chief was an observant savage and before returning to his tribe had made up his mind to see all the phases in the life of the new palefaces who had thus come to take possession of the land  he was a remarkably independent fellow and as he served the davidsons for nothing except his foodwhich he did not count as he could easily have supplied himself with victuals by means of his line bow and gun he did not deem it necessary to ask leave of absence  he merely went to the house one morning and announced his intention of going to lake winnipeg to fish  i will go with you said dan to whom the announcement was made  an so will i said fred jenkins who chanced to be conversing with dan at the timethat is if they can spare me just now  the canoe of okematan said the chief holds no more than three  he wishes to take with him archee and leetil bill  very well returned dan theres no objection to that for there is not much doing on the farm at this moment and archie has worked hard all the summer so he deserves a holiday  we will just make up the same party that started last time only that fergus and i will take a somewhat bigger canoe so as to accommodate you jenkins  thankee  though i am bigunfortnitlyi can stow myself away in small compass an ive larned how when there aint overmuch grub to git along fairly well on short allowance  when dee trip your anchor i mean when do ye start  when tomorrows sun touches the treetops in the east said the indian chief  all right okematan im your manafter layin in a breakfastcargo  according to this arrangement the two canoes pushed off at daybreak the following morning from the wharf at the foot of the garden of prairie cottage and began the descent of the red river which after flowing between twenty and thirty miles northward enters the mighty bosom of lake winnipeg  okematan and archie occupied their old places in the stern and bow of the chiefs canoe with little bill in the middlethis time using a paddle for his strength had greatly increased  the other canoe was steered by dan fergus acted bowman and jenkins sat between them also wielding a paddle  that night they encamped on the banks of the river for their progress had been slow owing to sundry visits which had to be paid to settlers on the way down  well now observed the sailor as he stood by the campfire smoking his pipe contemplatively i find that as circumstances change about in this world mens minds are apt to go boutship along wi them  that sounds a terribly profound speech fred said archie who was busy at his very usual occupation of whittling an arrow for his brother did your father teach it you or did you crib it from a copybook  no i raither think retorted the seaman quietly that i got it from your grandmother by the fathers side  what may be the circumstance that has caused your mind to go aboutship just now asked dan stirring the fire under the robbibookettle  well its in regard to them there canoepaddles  although they do seem small compared with oars i find theyre quite big enough to do the work and although ive bin trained from a youngster to handle the oar an go like a crab with my back the way im pullin it do seem more sensiblelike to sit wi ones face to the front and drive ahead anyhow its more comfortable and satisfactory  look out jenkins exclaimed little bill else your duck wont be satisfactoryits burnin now  o never mind remarked fergus lighting his pipe  it iss havin it well done he would be fond of  ay but not overdone cried the seaman snatching the duck in question from before the blaze and turning its other sidefor they used no spits in the norwest in those days but cooked one side at a time nay even carved off and ate part of the cooked side while the other side was roasting  next day they came out on the oceanlike expanse of the great lake and steered along its western shores until they reached the fishery where numbers of rudelyconstructed wigwams and a few tents sheltered the fishing community  they had just returned from a successful visit to the nets when the visitors arrived and all was animation and rejoicing at the successful take  jacques bourassin was the first man they met on landing and he was enthusiastic about the prospects before them  slowfoot was the first woman and she was quite satisfiedin that amiable state of mental and physical felicity in which it is so easy to believe that all is for the best  her husband soon after appeared  he of course was also greatly pleased  he had joined the fishers because he believed that plenty of food tea and tobacco would be going amongst them  he was not mistaken  you will come to my tent he said in the wealth of his hospitality we have plenty of good fish a very little meat some tobacco and oceans of tea  the six visitors accepted the invitation and were soon made acquainted with all the gossip of the community  does it always smoke whispered little bill to his brother  the it referred to was baby la certe which had as usual possessed itself of its fathers pipe when the mother was not watching  im not sure little bill but i think that it does its best  it was observed especially by fred jenkins that the teadrinking which went on at this place was something marvellous  theres that squaw sittin there he said shes bin an swigged three pannikins o tea while ive bin looking at heran its as black as ink  whats that brown stuff they put into it does any one know  that  why it is maple sugar answered archie an capital stuff it is to eat too  ah i know that for ive ate it in lump but it cant be so good in tea i fancy as ornary brown or white sugar but its better than fat anyhow  fat exclaimed little bill surely you never heard of any one taking fat in tea did you  ay that i did  men that move about the world see strange things  far stranger things than people invent out o their own brains  why there was one tribe that i saw in the east who putt fat in the tea an another putt salt and after theyd swallowed this queer kind of teasoup they divided the leaves among themselves an chawed em up like baccy  the evident delight with which these halfbreeds and more than halfindians swallowed cup after cup of the blackest and bitterest tea proved beyond question their appreciation of the article and afforded presumptive evidence at least that tea is not in their case as poisonous as we are taught to believe  but it was not as jenkins remarked all fair weather fun and tea at the fishery  after the six visitors had been there for a week shooting and assisting in the canoes and at the nets there came a night when the forces of nature declared war against the halfbreeds and those settlers who had cast in their lot with them at that time  jenkins okematan and archie had been out with their guns that daythe last having been promoted to the use of the dangerous weaponand in their wanderings had about nightfall come upon a family of halfbreeds named dobelle a goodnatured set who lived like la certe on the laissez faire principle who dwelt in a little loghut of their own construction within the margin of the forest not far from the shore of the great lake  this family though claiming to be christian and civilised was little better than vagrant and savage  they were to some extent as independent as the brute creation around themthough of course they betrayed the inherent weakness of mankind in being unable to exist happily without tea sugar and tobacco  for the rest their wants were few and easily satisfied  snares provided willowgrouse and rabbits traps gave them furs and the means of purchasing guns and powder  their loghut was only an occasional residence  wherever night overtook them they were at home  they camped on the open plains in the woods among the rocks and on the margins of rivers and lakes  healthy happy and heedless the dobelle family cared for nothing apparently but the comfort of the passing hour regarded the past as a convenient magazine from which to draw subjects for gossip and amusement and left the future to look after itself  there were in the hut when the three visitors entered old dobelle his wife a daughter of eighteen another of four and two sons of twenty and twentytwo respectively  it looks like dirty weather said jenkins on entering will you let us come to an anchor here for a bit  give us shelter explained archie who doubted old dobelles ability to understand nautical language  you are welcome said the halfbreed making way politely and pointing to places on the floor where the visitors were expected to squat  for there was no furniture in that mansion the fire was kindled in the middle of its one room the family sat around it on deer and buffalo skins and the smoke alike of pipe and fire found egress at the crevices in the roof  with kind hospitality madame dobelle poured some black tea into cups of birchbark and on plates of the same material spread before them the remains of a feast of roasted fish  while eating this various questions were put as to the success of the fishery  yeswe have been very successful said old dobelle  no bad weather to speak of and plenty of fish  our good fortune is great  but it wont last long said the eldest son who seemed to be the only growler in the family  nimportewe will enjoy it while it lasts said the younger son  yes truly we will remarked madame dobelle  whereupon the daughter of eighteen smiled and the daughter of four giggled  what does okematan think asked the host  thus appealed to the chief gave it as his opinion that something was going to happen for the sky in the norwest looked uncommonly black having given utterance to this cautious remark he relapsed into silence  as if to justify his opinion a tremendous clap of thunder seemed to rend the heavens at that moment and a few minutes later a heavy shower of rain fell  well that we got inside before that came on said archie  i hope it wont come on to blow else we shall be stormstayed here  the weather seemed to be in a lively mood that night for as the thunder had promptly answered to okematans observation so now the wind replied to archies remark by rushing up the natural avenue which extended from the hut to the lake and almost bursting in the door  see to the ropes boys said old dobelle glancing uneasily at the roof  the young men arose went out regardless of weather and secured with additional care a couple of stout ropes with which the tendency of the roof to fly away was restrained  did it ever come off asked archie with some curiosity as the young men returned and resumed their pipes  yestwice and both times it was night answered madame dobelle and we were flooded out and had to camp under the trees  which was not comfortable added the old man  another clap of thunder seemed to corroborate what he said and a blast of wind followed which caused the whole fabric of the hut to shudder  jenkins looked inquiringly at the roof  no fear of it said old dobelle the ropes are strong  thus assured the visitors continued their meal with equanimity regardless of the storm that soon began to rage with great fury insomuch that the door required a prop to keep it up and rain began to trickle in through crevices in the roof and drop here and there upon the party  when one such drop chanced to fall on old dobelles nose his younger son arose and fastening a piece of birchbark to the rafters caught the drop and trained it with its followers to flow towards an unoccupied place in one corner which being accidentally lower than the rest of the floor formed a convenient receptacle for superfluous water  at the same time madame dobelle made a shakedown of pinebranches in another corner for her visitors for it was obvious that they would have to spend the night there even although their own tent was not fardistant  by that time the storm was raging with unwonted violence  nevertheless the dobelle family smoked on in placid contentment  when the time for repose arrived madame dobelle and her eldest girl retired to a boxbed in a corner of the hut which was screened offnot very effectuallyby a curtain of birchbark  the two brothers lay down in another corner the three visitors disposed themselves in the third and as the fourth was monopolised by the rainrivulet old dobelle lay down on one side of the fire in the centre of the room while the fouryearold girl reposed on the other  during the night the accumulation of tobaccosmoke with firesmoke produced a suffocating effect but no one was capable of suffocation apparently for they all smoked onexcept archie who as we have said had not acquired the habit  even the fouryearold girl like baby la certe had a pull now and then at its fathers pipe and from sundry white emanations from the crevices in the bark curtains it was evident that the ladies behind these were enjoying themselves in the same way during the intervals of repose  next morning was fine and the three sportsmen returned to the fishery to find that the storm had made an almost clean sweep of the nets  it had carried most of them away torn others to pieces and almost ruined the whole colony of fishermen the ruin being all the more complete that most of the nets had been received on credit and were to be paid for chiefly by the results of the autumn fishery  la certe was one of the chief sufferers nevertheless to judge from his looks la certe did not suffer much  he had brought a considerable amount of provision with him as we have said and finding that one of his nets had been washed ashore he proceeded very leisurely to mend it while he smoked and assisted slowfoot to consume pemmican and tea  about this time a mysterious message was sent to dan davidson from red river by an indian requiring his immediate return  the sender of the message was elspie mckay the summons was therefore obeyed at once  as nothing further could be done at the fishery that autumn the other members of the expedition and most of the fishers returned with dan to the colony    chapter thirty  the trial for murder  dan said elspie as seated in the summerhouse after the arrival of the sportsmen these two held a meeting i have called you back to tell you of a very terrible thing which has been said of my dear brother duncan and which you must contradict at once and then find out how it was that the false report arose and have the matter cleared up  dear elspie returned dan i think i know what you are going to tell me  have you heard the report then said elspie turning pale andand do you believe it  i have suspectedi havebut let me hear first what the report is and who it came from  i got it from annette pierre and i am sure she would not have told it me if she did not think it true but then poor annette is not very intelligent and she may bemust bemistaken  she says that it was duncan who killed poor henri perrin and that some of the halfbreeds are determined to avenge the death of their comrade  now it cannot be true and i want you at once to go and ferret out the truth so as to prove the report false  have you spoken to duncan on the subject asked dan  no i cannot bear to let him imagine even for a moment that i could believe him guilty of murderthat i even suspected him of it  but you say you have heard something danthat you suspect something  what is it  it is difficult to say elspie dear  i too have heard the rumour that has come to your ears and i have seenbut it is useless talking of our mere conjectures  i will go at once and ferret out all about it if possible  my first business will be to see annette and get from her all that she knows  where is duncan  in the wheatfield  they have begun to shear today and as the crop is heavy they will be glad of your help  dan went to the field after visiting annette pierre and lent good assistance to the shearers but like elspie he found that he had not courage to say anything to duncan that would indicate his suspicion  he longed to put the question straight to him but could not prevail on himself to do so  next morning however he and elspie were both saved the necessity of doing such violence to their feelings by the arrival of two men from fort garry  they were members of a sort of police force that the company had enrolled and had come to arrest duncan mckay junior on the charge of murder  there was not much of law in the colony at that time but it was felt that something had to be done in the way of governing a settlement which was rapidly increasing and in which lynch and mob law would certainly be applied if regularly constituted authority did not step in  as the murder of perrin had created great indignation among the halfbreeds and the feeling about it was increasing the company resolved to clear the matter up by having the supposed murderer tried  duncan was accordingly lodged in one of the bastions of fort garry where when visited by the governor he firmly denied his guilt  the arrest of his younger son on such a charge fell very heavily on poor duncan mckay seniormore heavily than those who knew him would have expected  it touched not only his feelings but his pride for was he not a lineal descendant of that fergus mckay who had been a chief in one of the western isles of scotlandhe could not tell which but no matterat that celebrated period of scottish history when the great norse king harold fairhair had made a descent on the scottish coast and received one of the few thorough thrashings that darkened his otherwise successful career  o  tuncan tuncan my boy cried the old man shoving his hands deeper into his breeches pockets and apostrophising his imprisoned son as he walked up and down in the privacy of his own bedroom  o that wan o the name should come to such disgrace  an its denyin it you will be whether you are guilty or innocent  o tuncan tuncan you wass ever notorious for tellin liesan a troublesome boy all roundwhatever  but when the old man went to fort garry and visited his son he stifled his pathetic feelings and appeared before him with all the offended dignity of an injured member of the great clan mckay  are you guilty tuncan he asked sternly  no im innocent answered the youthful highlander with a brow quite as stern and a manner as dignified as the old one  you will hev to prove thatwhatever  nothey will hev to prove me guilty retorted the son  i wish i could believe ye tuncan  it iss not of much consequence whether ye believe me or not father you are not to be my chudgewhatever  that is goot luck for you tuncan for if i wass your chudge i would be bound to condemn youyou wass always so fond o tellin lies  it iss true what you say father  it iss a chip o the old block that i ammores the peety  at this point the door of the prison opened and elspie was ushered in  you here father she exclaimed in evident surprise  i had hoped to see duncan alone  it iss alone with him youll soon be replied the highlander putting on his hat  goot tay tuncan my boy an see that youll be tellin the truth if ye can when ye come to be tried  to this the youth made no reply  o duncan said the girl when her father had retired how came they to invent such lies about you  the tender way in which this was said and the gentle touch on his arm almost overcame the stubborn man but he steeled himself against such influences  what can i say elspie he replied  how can i tell what iss the reason that people tell lies  but it is lies isnt it duncan asked the poor girl almost entreatingly  you say that it iss lieswhatever an i will not be contradictin you  but when the trial comes on you will see that it cannot be proved against me elspieso keep your mind easy  with this rather unsatisfactory assurance elspie was fain to rest content and she returned home a little though not much easier in her mind  to make the trial quite fair and regular a jury of twelve men chosen by lot from a large number was empanelled and as many witnesses as possible were examined  these last were not numerous and it is needless to say that annette pierre and marie blanc were the chief  but despite their evidence and the strong feeling that existed against the prisoner it was found impossible to convict him so that in the end he was acquitted and set free  but there were men in the colony who registered a vow that cloudbrow should not escape  they believed him to be guilty in spite of the trial and made up their minds patiently to bide their time  it now seemed as if at last a measure of prosperity were about to dawn upon the farmers in that distant land and as usual on such occasions of approaching prosperity dan davidson and duncan mckay senior began to talk of the wedding which had been so long delayed  i wass thinkin tan remarked the old man one morning while walking in the verandah with his afterbreakfast pipe that i will be getting in the crops pretty soon this year an theyre heavy crops too so that we may look forward to a comfortable winterwhatever  true and as our crops are also very good thank god i begin now to hope that elspie may see her way to  see her way exclaimed mckay with some asperity she will hev to see her way when i tell her to open her eyes an look  nay but there are two to this bargain said dan goodhumouredly  i would not consent to have her on such terms  she must fix and arrange everything without constraint from any onenot even from you duncan mckay  oh fery goot retorted the old man with a touch of sarcasm you know fery well what elspie will be sayin to that or you would not be so ready to let it rest with her  yes yes she is safe to see her way to go the way that you want her to go  it was a strange coincidence that at the very time these two were conversing on this subject in the verandah of ben nevis hall mrs davidson and elspie were discussing the very same subject in an upper room of prairie cottage  we refrain from giving the details however as it would be unpardonable to reveal such matters  we will merely state that the conclusions to which the ladies came were very similar to those arrived at by the gentlemen  but delay was still destined to be an element in the cup of this unfortunate couple  when the harvest had been gathered in that year there came what old mckay called a visitation which with its consequences recalls irresistibly the words of our great scottish poetthe bestlaid schemes o mice and men gang aft agley  this visitation was a plague of mice  the whole colony was infested with them  like the grasshoppers the mice devoured everything  the grain after being stacked was almost totally destroyed by them  the straw the very stubble itself was cut to atoms  the fields the woods the plains seemed literally alive with this new visitor and the result would have been that most of the settlers would again have been driven to spend another dreary winter in trapping and hunting with the indians at pembina if it had not been for the fortunate circumstance that the buffalo runners had been unusually successful that year  they returned from the plains rejoicingtheir carts heavily laden with buffalorobes and innumerable bags of pemmican    chapter thirty one  retribution  owing to the success of the buffalo runners the winter passed away in comparative comfort  but as we have said some of the settlers who had been ruined by the failure of the fisheries and the depredations of the mice and who did not share much in the profits of the autumn hunt were obliged once again to seek their old port of refuge at pembina  among these was the swiss family morel  andre went because he did not wish to remain comparatively idle in the colony during the long months of winter  elise went for the purpose of keeping houseperhaps we should say keeping hutfor andre  fred jenkins went because he wanted to learn more about indian ways and customs as well as to perfect himself in the art of hunting the buffalothat was all  there were some who did not believe what the bold seaman said  elise morel was one of theseperhaps the most unbelieving amongst them  indeed she laughed quite hilariously when his motive was reported to her by billie sinclair the day before they started  why do you laugh so inquired little bill who was always more or less in a state of surprise when he got upon this subject with elise  it is not easy to say billie answered the girl with another pleasant little laugh but it is so funny that a sailor should take such a fancy to come out here so far away from his native element and find so much interest in snowshoe walking and indian customs  yes isnt it responded the boy and him such a fine big man too who has gone through so much and seen so many lands and been in such a lot o fights with pirates and all that kind of thing  i cant understand him at all  i wish i understood him better for i like him very much  dont you  elise was so much taken up with what she was doing at the time that she could not answer the question and billie was in such a wandering state of mind that he neglected to press it  daniel davidson also went to pembina that winter because he could not bear to press the subject of his marriage just after the destruction of his and old mckays crops by micea disaster which told rather heavily on both families  when winter had passed away he along with many others returned to the colony and made preparations for going out to the plains for the spring hunt with the buffalo runners  you will better not be goin wi them said duncan mckay senior to his younger son some days before the hunters had arranged to set out  it will not be safe after your trial for the halfbreeds are mad at you tuncan  if the old man had been wise enough to have left his son alone duncan junior would probably have remained where he was but the mere offer of advice roused in him the spirit of opposition and that reference to the halfbreeds decided him  if all the halfbreeds in rud river wass to go as mad as buffalobulls wi their tails cut off i would go said duncan junior with quiet decision of tone and manner as he lighted his pipe  ay it iss that same you would do if you wass to be hanged tomorrow for doin it tuncan returned the old man testily as he fired cloudlets in rapid succession from his compressed lips  duncan junior was equally firm in replying to his sisters remonstrances later in the day  you know dear duncan she said that although i believe you to be quite innocent most of the halfbreeds are of the opposite opinion and some of them are very revengeful especially when they think they have been deceived or unjustly treated  i do not fear the halfbreeds replied the youth gruffly  of course you dont duncan but you know that though most of them are good trusty men some are mean fellows who would not hesitate to shoot you in the smoke and confusion of the hunt  do give up the idea for my sake dear  i would do much for your sake elspie but not this for it iss showin the white feather i am they will be sayin and as father often says that iss what must never be true of a mckay  accordingly duncan junior mounted his horse and accompanied dan peter fergus okematan morel jenkins and others to the plains where they found that the main body of the hunters under antoine dechamp had arrived just before them  kateegoose was also there and la certe who once more tried his fortune at the chase under all the advantages of a new cart and horse a new gun and a new outfitall received on creditto be paid for by the proceeds of the chase as the creditors hoping against hope tried to believe never to be paid for at all as the easygoing la certe more than half suspectedthough he was far too honest a man to admit that even to himself  of course slowfoot was with himamiable meek and silent as ever and so was baby la certe a fiveyearold by that time and obviously a girl with a stronger penchant than ever for tobacco  the buffalo have been found already said dechamp to dan davidson as the latter rode into camp at the head of his party  bourassin has just come in with the report that they are in great numbers away to the norwest so we will make a fair start first thing in the morning  as he spoke dechamp glanced with evident surprise at duncan mckay  why did you let him come he said in an undertone to dan as they were tying up the horses  how could i prevent him replied dan  next morning all was bustle eager expectation and lively conversation in the camp  archie was there again promoted to the condition of a fullfledged hunter by the possession of a gun  little bill was there also  he had improved so much in health and strength that he was permitted to ride with the runners on a pony but was to content himself with viewing the battle from afarthat is well in rear  now little bill said archie with the seriousness of a grandfather as they galloped with the hunters over the rolling plains across which were streaming the first beams of the rising sun you must promise me to keep well in rear and on no account to join in the chase  its of no use to go in without a gun you know and there is great risk when in the thick of it that you may come across a bullet or two  youll have all the fun without the danger little bill  all right old boy ill do my best  hallo archie cried jenkins galloping up alongside with the blunderbuss in his left hand ive bin lookin for you lad  its not easy to spy out a friend in such a shoal o queer craft  are ee goin to sail alongside o me this bout  of course i am fred  a man that can steer his way by compass over such a sea o grass is worth holding on to  well then heave ahead  well hunt in couples  i see theyre gettin into line o battle which means that the enemys in view  the sailor was right  buffalo were seen grazing in the far distance and the cavalcade was getting into line so as to advance in good order  as on a former occasion they approached at a slow pace until the animals began to lift their heads and throw inquiring glances in the direction from which the mounted host came  then the word was given to trot and finally to charge  the rush on this occasion was even more tremendous than on the former for there were considerably more men and a larger herd of buffalo  the lumbering heavy gait of the latter at the first start did not suggest the racing speed to which the clumsy creatures attained when they were hard pressed  soon the dropping shots of the fast riders swelled into the rattling musketry of the real fight and ere long the plain became strewed with dead and wounded animals while smoke and dust obscured the air  there was no order maintained after the first onset  every man seemed to fight for his own hand  crossing and recrossing and firing recklessly in all directions it seemed a very miracle that no fatal accidents occurred  minor ones there were  archie and his nautical comrade witnessed a few of these  i say look at bourassin exclaimed the former pointing to the left with his noseboth hands being fully engaged with gun and bridle  the seamans eye turned in the direction indicated and he beheld bourassins horse stopped by the hairy forehead of a buffalobull while bourassin himself was in the act of describing a magnificent parabolic curve over the buffalos back  he alighted on his back fortunately on a low bush a yard or two beyond the buffalos tail  killed exclaimed jenkins anxiously as he turned his horse in the direction of the fallen man  but the seaman was wrong  the hunter did indeed lie flat and motionless for a few secondswhich was just as well for it gave the bull time to toss off the horse turn and leap over the prostrate man in continuing its flight but in another moment bourassin was on his feet soon caught his trembling horse remounted and continued the chase  a little further on they saw peter davidsons horse put his foot in a badgerhole the result of which was that the horse rolled over in one direction while the expert peter tumbling cleverly to one side rolled away in another direction like a catherinewheel  both horse and man arose unhurt and like bourassin continued the chase  necks aint easy broke in this here country remarked the seaman as archie pushed past him in pursuit of a fat young cow  not often  necks are tough you see and ground is mostly soft cried archie as he fired and dropped the cow  whos that away to the right ridin like a madman after a calf asked jenkins overtaking archie who was recharging his gun at the gallop  whowhere cried the boy looking impatiently round  keep cool lad  whatever condition you chance to be in whether of danger or safety always keep cool  for whyit makes you comfortable or more fit for action as the case may be  see the fellow over there halfhidden by smoke  why thats duncan mckay  you might know him by his hat  i aint a good judge o hats remarked the seaman as he fired at a bull and missed it  ha that comes o firin at long range he said it was at least six yards off an i cant count on the old blunderbuss beyond five  better luck next time  hallo  jenkins did you hear that  what  that shriek  im sure some one has been hurt  very likely lad  theres many a cropper agoin on just now an we cant all expect to come off scotfree  the voice sounded like that of fergus said archie but i can see nothing for smoke now  is that a man on the ground over there  dont know archie  out o the way lad theres another chance  must get closer this time  the tide of the chase swept on with irresistible fury and not one of all the band saw that the man who had fallen did not rise  following close in rear and profoundly excited with this new and wild experience of life came little bill galloping along on his pony  the poor boy had either greatly benefited by his recent adventures or a change had taken place in his constitution for he rode with ease and found that he could walk considerable distances without the old weary feeling of exhaustion  as little bill passed over the prairie which resembled a field of battle where not men but buffaloes had been the combatants he came suddenly upon the dismounted hunter who lay prone upon his face  poor man thought little bill pulling up and dismounting he seems to have been badly stunned  stooping down he turned the fallen man over on his back with some difficulty and then discovered to his consternation that it was young duncan mckay and that blood was flowing from a wound in his side  the shock at first deprived billie of the power to do anything but in a very few minutes his strong common sense returned and his first act was to open duncans coat and stanch the wound  this he accomplished by means of a strip torn off the poor mans cotton shirt and the long red worsted belt with which the hunters capote was bound  then he took from his pocket a small bottle of water with which he had provided himself in case of need and poured a little into duncans mouth  the result of these operations was that the fallen man opened his eyes after a while raised himself on one elbow and looked round in a dazed manner  what iss it that has come over me he asked faintly  you have fallen off your horse i think answered the boy and iim afraid a bullet has wounded you in the side  bullet  side exclaimed duncan looking quickly down at the bandage and attempting to rise  little bill you must  he stopped seemed to grow faint and fell down but quickly raised himself again on one elbow and looked round  shotdying he muttered then turning to the boystay by me little bill  dont leave me here all alone  no i wont leave you unlessperhaps it would be better if i rode back to camp for help  true true  its my only chance said the poor man faintly  go billie and go quick  put something under my head  andstayleave your gun with me  im so sorry i havent got one but here is my bottle of water you may want that and  he stopped for duncan had evidently fainted again  the poor boy was terribly alarmed at this  he had wit enough to perceive that prompt action was needed for his friend was in very great danger while the buffalo runners were by that time out of sight in front and the camp was far behind  in this crisis billie acted with decision  first making the bandage over the wound more secure and pouring a little more water into the mouth of the wounded man he went to a clump of willows and cut a stout switch then remounting he turned on his track and made straight for the camp as fast as his willing pony could be made to lay hoof to the ground  arrived there to his great relief he found the cree chief okematan for that eccentric individual had owing to some unknown reason refrained from joining in the hunt that day  la certe was also there  in a few minutes mounted on a fresh horse little bill was galloping over the prairie acting as guide to okematan while la certe followed them driving a cart with a couple of buffalorobes in it  that night instead of rejoicing in the camp of the buffalo runners after their successful hunt there was uneasiness and gloom for duncan mckay lay in his tent dangerously wounded and it was generally believed that the shot which laid him low had been fired not by accident but with deliberate intent to kill    chapter thirty two  suffering and its results  when the news that young duncan had been shot was brought to ben nevis the effect on his father was much more severe than might have been expected considering their respective feelings towards each other  it was late in the evening when the news came and the old man was seated in what he styled his smokingroom taking his evening glass of whisky and water  elspie he said in a subdued voice on being told help me up to my bed  this was so very unusual a request that elspie was somewhat alarmed by it as well as surprisedall the more so that the old man left the room without finishing either his pipe or glass  still she did not suppose that anything serious would come of it  a nights rest she thought would do away with the evils of the shock  dear father she said as she kissed him at parting do believe that god is waiting to be gracious that he really means it when he says come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  and considerwe have no reason to suppose that dear duncans wound is very dangerous  gootnight elspie was all the reply  next morning mckay did not make his appearance at the usual breakfasthour and on going to his room they found him lying speechless in his bed suffering under a stroke of paralysis  he soon recovered the power of speech but not the use of his limbs and it became evident ere long that the poor man had received a shock which would probably cripple him for life  whatever may have been his secret thoughts however he carefully concealed them from every one and always referred to his complaint as this nasty stiff feeling about the legs which iss a long time of goin awaywhatever  in a few days fergus returned from the plains bringing his brother in a cart which had been made tolerably easy by means of a springy couch of pinebranches  they did not tell him at first of his fathers illness lest it should interfere with his own recovery from the very critical condition in which he lay  at first he took no notice of his fathers nonappearance attributing it to indifference but when he began slowly to mend he expressed some surprise  then they told him  whatever may have been his thoughts on the subject he gave no sign but received the informationas indeed he received nearly all information at that timein absolute silence  fortunately the bullet which struck him had passed right through his side so that he was spared the pain as well as the danger of its extraction  but from his total loss of appetite and continued weakness it was evident that he had received some very severe if not fatal internal injury  at last very slowly he began to grow a little stronger but he was a very shadow or wreck of his former self nevertheless the more sanguine members of the family began to entertain some faint hope of his recovery  of course during these first days of his weakness his sister elspie nursed him  she would if permitted have done so night and day but in this matter she had to contend with one who was more than a match for her  this was old peg the faithful domestic  no no dearie said that resolute old woman when elspie first promulgated to her the idea of sitting up all night with duncan you will do nothin of the sort  your sainted mother left your father an fergus an yourself to my care an i said i would never fail you so i cant break my promise by letting you break your health  i will sit up wi him as ive done many a time when he was a bairn  it thus came to pass that elspie nursed her brother by day and old peg sat up with him at night  of course the duties of the former were considerably lightened by the assistance rendered by various members of the family as well as friends who were ever ready to sit by the bedside of the wounded man and read to or chat with him  at such times he was moderately cheerful but when the night watches came and old peg took her place beside him and memory had time to commence with him undisturbed the deed of which he had had been guilty was forced upon him conscience was awakened and selfcondemnation was the result yet so inconsistent is poor humanity that selfexculpation warred with selfcondemnation in the same brain  the miserable man would have given all he possessed to have been able to persuade himself that his act was purely one of selfdefenceas no doubt to some extent it was for if he had not fired first perrins action showed that he would certainly have been the manslayer  but then young mckay could not shut his eyes to the fact that premeditation had in the first instance induced him to extend his hand towards his gun and this first act it was which had caused all the rest  often during the wakeful hours of the night would the invalid glance at his nurse with a longing desire to unburden his soul to her but whenever his eye rested on her calm wrinkled old visage and he thought of her deafness and the difficulty of making her understand he abandoned his halfformed intention with a sigh  he did not indeed doubt her sympathy for many a time during his life especially when a child had he experienced the strength and tenderness of that  after attending to his wants it was the habit of old peg to put on a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles and read  her only book was the bible  she read nothing elseto say truth at that time there was little else to read in red river  the first night of her watch she had asked the invalid if he would like her to read a few verses to him  you may if you like peg he had replied  you know it iss little i care for releegion for i dont believe in it but you may read if you likeit may amuse me an will help to make the time passwhatever  thus the custom was established  it was plain that the old woman counted much on the influence of the simple word of god without comment for every time she opened the bible she shut her eyes and her lips moved in silent prayer before she began to read  the invalid was greatly tickled with this little preliminary prayer and would have laughed aloud if he had not been too weak to do so  as time went on however he became interested in the gospel narratives in spite of himself and he began to experience some sort of relish for the evening readingchiefly because as he carefully explained to elspie the droning o the old wummans voice sent him to sleep  meanwhile the other invalidduncan seniorprogressed as slowly as did his son  the nursing of him was undertaken chiefly by jessie davidson the sympathetic jessiewho was established as an inmate of ben nevis pro tem for that very purpose  she was ably secondedduring part of each dayby billie sinclair between whom and the old highlander there grew up at that time a strong friendship  for many weeks poor old mckay was confined to his bed and then when allowed to rise he could only walk across his room with the aid of the strong arm of his stalwart son fergus  to sit at his open window and look out at his garden was his principal amusement and smoking a long clay pipe his chief solace like duncan junior old duncan was quite willing to hear the bible read to him now and then by jessie davidson and more especially by little bill but the idea of deriving any real comfort from that book never for a moment entered his head  one day elspie came to him and said  daddy dan wants to see you today if you feel well enough  surely my tear  it iss not the first time he will be seein me since i got the stroke  he has brought you a presentsomething that he has madewhich he hopes will be useful to you  what is it elspie  you shall see  may i tell him to come in and bring it with him  surely my tear  let him come in  it iss always goot for sore eyes to see himselfwhatever  elspie went out  a few minutes later there was heard in the passage a strange rumbling sound  what in all the world iss that said the old man to little bill who happened to be his companion at the time  it sounds like wheels i think said billie  the door opened as he spoke and dan davidson entered pushing before him an invalid chair of a kind that is familiar enough in the civilised world but which was utterly unknown at that time in those regions  gootmornin tan what hev you got there  iss it a surprise you will be givin me  it is a chair sir which will i hope add a good deal to your comfort said dan  i made it myself from the memorymodel of one which i once saw in the old country  see i will show you how it acts push me along jessie  dan sat down in the chair as he spoke and his sister jessie who entered at the moment pushed him all about the room with the greatest ease  well well said the amused invalid  ye are a clever man taniel it iss a goot contrivance an seems to me fery well made  could little bill push it think ye  go an try boy  little bill found that he could push dan in the chair as easily as jessie had done it  but that is not all said dan  seenow i will work the chair myself  so saying he laid his hands on the two large wheels at either side which with a little wheel behind supported the machineand moved it about the room turned it round and in short acted in a very independent manner as to selflocomotion  well now that iss goot exclaimed the pleased invalid  let me try it tan  in his eagerness the poor man forgetting for a moment his helpless condition made an effort to rise and would certainly have fallen off the chair on which he was seated if elspie had not sprung to his assistance  come theres life in you yet said dan as he assisted the old man into the wheelchair  put your handsso  and when you want to turn sharp round youve only to pull with one hand and push with  get along with you interrupted the old man facetiously giving the chair a swing that caused all who stood around him to leap out of his way will you hev the presumption to teach a man that knew how to scull a boat before you wass born  but taniel he added in a more serious tone we must hev one like this made for poor tuncan  as this was the first reference which mckay had made to his younger son since his illnesswith the exception of the daily inquiry as to his healthit was hailed as an evidence that a change for the better was taking place in the old mans mind  for up to that period no one had received any encouragement to speak of or enter into conversation about duncan junior  you are right returned dan  i have been thinking of that and have even laid in the wood to make a similar chair for him  but i fear he wont be able to use it for some time to come  elspie was thinking if you dont object to have your bedroom changed to one of the rooms on the ground floor so that you could be wheeled into the garden when so inclined  yes daddy said elspie taking up the discourse we can put you into the room that corresponds with duncans room at the other end of the house so that you and he will be able to meet after your long illness but there is another contrivance which dan has been making for usnot for you but for old peg  tell daddy about it dan  like the chair said dan it is no novelty except in this outotheway place  you see i have noticed that old peg is rather deaf  well tan interrupted old mckay with a benignant smile it iss not much observation that you will be requirin to see that  just so  well i also observed that it gives duncan some trouble to speak loud enough to her  so i have invented a sort of eartrumpeta tin pipe with an earpiece at one end and a mouthpiece at the other which i hope may make things easier  hev ye not tried it yet asked mckay  not yet  ive only just brought it  go down lad an try it at wanse an let me know what the upshot iss  down they all went accordingly leaving duncan senior alone  they found old peg in the act of administering beeftea refreshmentor something of that sortto the invalid  peter davidson and archie sinclair were there also paying him a visit  hallo little bill said archie as his brother entered  you here  i guessed as much  your passion for nursing since you attended dan is outrageous  you do more nursing in this house i do believe than elspie and jessie and old peg put together  what dee mean by it bill i get no good of you at all now  i like it archie and im training myself to nurse you when you get ill or old  thank ee for nothin little bill for i dont mean to become either ill or old for some time to come but i say are they goin to perform an operation on old pegs head  this was said in consequence of elspie shouting to the old woman to let her put something into her ear to cure deafness  cure deafness she exclaimed with a faint laugh nothin will ever cure my deafness  but i can trust you dearie so do what you please  shut your eyes then  and open your mouth said archie to little bill in a low voice  old peg did as she was bid  dan approaching behind her put the small end of the tube into her right earwhich was the best oneand elspie putting her mouth to the other end spoke to her in her soft natural voice  the effect was amusing  old peg dropped into her chair as if paralysed and gazed from one to another in mute amazement  eh dearie  did i ever think to hear the sweet low voice o elspie like as it was when she was a bairn  most amazin she said  let me heart again  the operation was repeated and it was finally found that by means of this extemporised eartrumpet the poor creature once more became a conversable member of society  she went about the house the remainder of that day in a quite excited state asking questions of everybody and putting the end of the instrument to their mouths for an answer  archie even declared that he had caught her alone in the backkitchen shoving the cats head into the mouthpiece of the instrument and pinching its tail to make it mew  it was two days after the occurrence of these incidents that the old woman was seated by duncans bedside gazing through her tortoiseshell glasses at the wellthumbed bible when her patient who had been very restless looked up and spoke  can i do anything for ye dearie said old peg putting the trumpetend into her ear and handing the mouthpiece to duncan  youyou hear much better now old peg said the sick man in his natural voice  ay much much better thanks to the lordand to mr daniel  if daniel had not thought of it said the invalid quite gravely do you think that the lord would hev sent the machine to you  he might or he might not returned the old woman promptly  its not for me to say nor yet to guess on that point  but this i do know for certainif the lord hadna thought upon mr daniel then mr daniel wouldna have been here to think upon me  duncan made no reply and for some time remained quite silent  then he spoke again  peg what wass it that you would be reading to me last nightsomething about a malefactor im thinking  ay it was about the robbers that was crucified on each side o the lord  one o them reviled the lord as he was hangin there the other found forgiveness for he was led to see what a lost sinner he was and repented and confessed his sins  that is fery strange said duncan after a few moments thought  do you think peg that the robber that was forgiven wass aa murderer  i have little doubt ot answered peg for ive heard say that they think very little o human life in them eastern countries  but whatever he was the blood of jesus christ was able to cleanse him  ay but if he was a murderer peg he did not deserve to be forgiven  my bairn said the old woman with something of motherly tenderness in her tone its not them that deserve to be forgiven that are forgiven but them that see that they dont deserve it  didna this robber say that he was sufferin for his sins justly  that surely meant that he deserved what he was getting an how is it possible to deserve both condemnation an forgiveness at the same time  but he believed that jesus was a kingable and willing to save him though he did not deserve it so he asked to be remembered and he was remembered  but lie down now bairn an rest ye are excitin yoursel an thats bad for ye  a week or so after the conversation above recorded dan brought a wheelchair for duncan similar to the one he had made for his father as duncan had been getting out of bed for several days before dan found him dressed and sitting up  he therefore lifted him into the chair at once and wheeled him out into the garden where a blaze of warm sunshine seemed to put new life into the poor invalid  it had been prearranged that old mckay should be brought down that same day to his new room and that he should also be wheeled into the garden so as to meet his son duncan without either of them being prepared for the meeting  i dont feel at all sure that we are right in this arrangement elspie had said but dan and fergus and mrs davidson and jessie had thought otherwise so she was overruled  archie was deputed to attend upon duncan junior and little bill obtained leave to push the chair of old mckay  the younger man was wheeled under the shade of a tree with his back to the house and left there  then the family retired out of the way leaving archie to attend the invalid  a few minutes after young duncan had been placed little bill pushed his charge under the same tree and wheeling the chair quickly round brought father and son suddenly face to face  the surprise was great on both sides for each recollecting only the man that had been could hardly believe in the reality of the ghost that sat before him  father exclaimed duncan at last  but the old man answered not  some strong feeling was evidently surging within him for his mouth was tightly pursed and his features worked strangely  suddenly he burst into tears but the weakness was momentary  with an effort that seemed to concentrate the accumulated energy of all the mckays from adam downwards he again pursed his mouth and looked at his younger son with a stern persistent frown worthy of the most rugged of highlanders in his fiercest mood  duncan was inexpressibly touched  father said he again ive been a baad baad son to you  tuncan retorted the old man in a husky but firm voice ive been a baad baad father to you  let us shake handswhatever said the son  the two silently grasped each others hands with all the little strength that remained to them  then old mckay turned suddenly to his henchman  little bill said he in a tone that was not for an instant to be disregarded shove me down to the futt of the gardenyou rascal  with a promptitude little short of miraculous the highlander was wheeled away and thus the momentous meeting was abruptly brought to a close    chapter thirty three  matrimonial plans and prospects  time passed by as time is rather apt to do and still the feud between the rival fur companies continued to the detriment of the indians and the furtrade the unsettling of red river settlement and the demoralisation more or less of all concerned  men who would gladly have devoted all their energies to the arts of peace became more or less belligerent in spirit if not in act and many were forced to take sides in the controversysome siding with the norwesters and others with the hudsons bay company  with the merits of their contentions we do not propose to meddle  we confine ourselves to facts  one important fact was that our hero daniel davidson took the side of the hudsons bay company  being a stout fellow with a good brain a strong will an independent spirit and a capable tongue he was highly appreciated by the one side and considerably hated by the other insomuch that some of the violent spirits made dark suggestions as to the propriety of putting him out of the way  it is not easy however or safe to attempt to put a strong resolute man out of the way and his enemies plotted for a considerable time in vain  the unsettled state of the colony and the frequent failure of the crops had as we have seen exerted an evil influence for a long time on poor dans matrimonial prospects and at last feeling that more settled times might yet be in the remote future and that as regarded defence and maintenance it would be on the whole better both for elspie and himself that they should get married without delay he resolved to take the important step and as old mckay remarked have it over  you see taniel said the old man when the subject was again broached it iss of no use hangin off an on in this fashion moreover this nasty stiff leg o mine is so long of getting well that it may walk me off the face o the earth altogether an i would not like to leave elspie till this matter iss settled  tuncan also iss a little better just now so what say you to have the weddin the month after next  mr sutherland will be back from the whitehorse plains by then an he can tie the knot tight enoughwhatever  anyway it iss clear that if we wait for a munister o the auld kirk we will hev to wait till doomsday  what say you taniel  it need hardly be said that dan had nothing whatever to say in objection to this scheme  it was therefore settledunder the proviso of course that elspie had no objection  dan went off at once to see elspie and found that she had no objection whereupon after some conversation etcetera with which we will not weary the reader he sought out his friend fred jenkins to whom he communicated the good news and treated him to a good many unanswerable reasons why young people should not delay marriage when there was any reasonable prospect of their getting on comfortably in life together  the sailor agreed with effusive heartiness to all that he said and dan thought while he was speakingoratingas one of the american settlers would have expressed itthat jenkins wore a peculiar expression on his manly countenance  attributing it to unusual interest in the event he continued  now fred i want you to be my bestman  unpossiblequite unpossible interrupted the seaman with a grave shake of the head  howimpossible  absolutely unpossible  but why  explain yourself fred  cause its only a bachelor as can be a bestman to a bacheloraint it  i believe so though im no authority in such matters but surely that is a matter of no importance for you are a bachelor you know  true thats what i am today but i wont be that long for i am goin to be married next month so i wont be available dee see the month after  youmarriedto whom exclaimed dan in amazement  well thats a point blank shot right between wind an water howsever i suppose i cant go wrong in tellin you dan for its all settled though not a soul knows about it except little bill an yourself an her brother  but i dont know about it yet returned dan  who is it  a angelpure an unmixedcome straight down from heaven apurpus to marry poor unedicated seafarin fred jenkins an her terrestrial name is elise morel  dan laughed while he congratulated the modest seaman and admitted the strength of his difficulty  dyou know fred ive had a suspicion for some time past that you had a leaning in that direction  so have i dan had an uncommon strong suspicion for a very long time past not only that i had a leanin that way but a regular list to port an now im fairly over on my beamends  but surely it must have come upon you very sudden at last said dan how was it  sudden  i should just think it didlike a white squall in the mediterranean or a hurricane in the china seas  this is how it was id bin cruisin about heroff an onfor a considerable time tryin to make up my mind to go into action an screwin my courage up to the stickin pint by recallin all the fine sentiments that has carried jacktars through fire an smoke shot and shell since the world beganengland expects every man to do his dootynever say diehookey bunkum an such like  but it warnt no manner o use for im an outrageous coward wi the gals dan  so in a sort o despair i sailed away this very mornin into the plantation at the futt o your garden intendin to cool myself an think over it when who should i see almost hull down on my lee bow but the enemyelise herself  well i changed my course at once bore straight down on her an soon overhauled her but the nearer i came the more did my courage run out so i gradooally begun to take in sail an drop astarn  at last i got savage youre a fool jenkins says i to myself  thats a fact says suthin inside o me  now if that suthin had kep quiet i do believe that id have gone aboutship an showed her my heels but that suthin whatever it was set up my dander  now then says i haul taut the main brace  up wi the tgallntsls an skyscrapers  england expects etceterer  afore you could say jack robinson i was along sidegrapplinirons hove into her riggin and a broadside fired  the way i gave it her astonished even myself  nelson himself could scarce ha done it better well she struck her colours at the first broadside an somehowi never could make out exactly howwe was sittin on the stump of a tree with her head on my rough unworthy buzzum  think o that  dan her headthe head of a angel  give us your flipper mate  i congratulate you jenkins with all my heart said dan grasping the seamans flipper and giving it a hearty shake  so now i must look out for another bestman  morel will do for me i think and you can have my brother peter no doubt  but could we not manage to have both weddings on the same day  impossible answered the seaman promptly  couldnt wait  but we might compromise the matter  i might have mine a little sooner and you could have yours a little later  still jenkins shook his head  not fairplay he said  all the advantage on your side  however we might consider it  hold a sort o drumhead courtmartial over it with elise and elspie as judges  when the said courtmaritalas dan called itwas held the compromise was agreed to and it was finally fixed that six weeks thereafter the two couples should be united in ben nevis hall  but the current of these parallel streams of true love was not yet destined to run smoothas the next chapter will show    chapter thirty four  a new disaster  i mean to go off tomorrow on a shooting trip to the lake said dan davidson to archie sinclair  ive had a long spell at farming operations of late and am tired of it  the double wedding you know comes off in six weeks  so i want to have one more run in the wilderness in all the freedom of bachelorhood  will you go with me  unpossible as jenkins would say answered archie  nothing would please me better but duty before pleasure  ive promised to spend a week along wi little bill at the whitehorse plains  billie has taken a great fancy to that chief o the halfbreeds cuthbert grant and we are goin to visit him  ive no doubt that little bill would let me off but i wont be let off  then i must ask okematan to go with me said dan  you neednt trouble yourself for i heard him say that he was goin off to see some o his relations on important businessa great palaver o some sortand elise told me this morning that she saw him start yesterday  morel is too busy with his new farm to go rejoined dan and jenkins is too busy helping morel  perhaps dechamp or bourassin may be more at leisure  i will go see  but on search being made neither dechamp nor bourassin was to be found and our hero was returning home with the intention of taking a small hunting canoe and going off by himself when he chanced to meet with la certe  that worthy seemed unusually depressed and returned dans greeting with very little of his habitual cheerfulness  whats wrong with you francois asked dan anxiously  domestic infelicity answered la certe with a sorrowful shake of the head  what surely slowfoot has not taken to being unkind to you  o no  slowfoot could not be unkind but she is unhappy she has lost her cheerful looks she does not take everything as she once did she does not now let everything go anyhow with that cheerful resignation which was once her delightful characteristic  she no longer hands the pipe of peace to our little oneindeed she refuses to let it have the pipe at all though the poor child cries for it and comes to me secretly when slowfoot is out of the way to beg for a draw  then she scolds meno she does not scold  slowfoot cannot scold  she is too amiablebut she remonstrates and that is worse than scolding for it enlists myself against myself  o  i am now miserable  my days of peace are gone  this is all very sad la certe said dan in a tone of sympathy what does she remonstrate about  about my laziness  she does it very kindly very gentlyso like her old selfbut she does it  she says husband we have gone on this way too long  we must change  you must change  you are lazy  well la certe said dan im afraid that slowfoot is right  i know she is right retorted the halfbreed with more of exasperation in his manner than his friend had ever before seen in him when that which is said of one is false one can afford to smile but when it is true what can one say  yet it is hardvery hard  you are full of energy you love to expend it and you search for work  it is naturaland what is natural must be right  so i am full of laziness  i love to indulge it and i search for repose  that is also natural and what is natural must be right  voila  then i suppose your love for repose returned dan will oblige you to decline an offer which i thought of making to you  what is that  to go with me on a shooting expedition to lake winnipeg for a week or two  o no  i will not decline that returned la certe brightening up shooting is not labour  it is amusement with labour sufficient to make afterrepose delightful  and i will be glad to leave my home for a time for it is no longer the abode of felicity  this having been satisfactorily arranged preparations made and slowfoot advised of her husbands intention dan went to ben nevis hall next morning to bid farewell to elspie for a brief period  he found only old mckay in the hall elspie having gone up the settlement or down the settlementthe man did not know whichto call on a friend  see that ye will not be long o comin back tan he said  there will be a good many arranchments to make you see  i hope to be back in three weeks at latest said dan if all goes well  ay if all goes well repeated the old man thoughtfully  as elspie says sometimes we never know what a day may bring furth  well well see that you will not be upsetting your canoe for canoes are cranky thingswhatever  in a short time our hero and la certe found themselves floating once more on the calm breast of the mighty inland sea  it was afternoon  the circumstances were eminently conducive to the felicity which is derivable from repose and thus admirably suited to the tastes of la certe  an unruffled sheet of glassy water lay spread out to the northwestern horizon which not only doubled the canoe and its occupants but reflected the golden glory of the sun and mirrored every fleecy cloudlet in the bright blue sky  a mere dip of the paddles now and then served to give impulse to the light and literal bark genial warmth pervaded the atmosphere and little white gulls floated almost motionless on outspread wings or sloped hither and thither with lazy flap while ever and anon the whistling wings of passing wildfowl gave promise of occupation to their guns to say nothing of their kettles  on their third day out towards evening they went ashore on the leeside of a rocky point where some bushes and trees seemed to offer firewood and shelter  this will do said dan as he stepped lightly out on a shelving rock and held the canoe while his companion took out the lading  plenty dry sticks and lots of moss for bedding  truly that is so returned la certe  it is a place in which slowfoot would rejoice to repose and the little one to smoke its pipe  you forget said dan  the little one is no longer allowed that luxury  no i forgot not  but i reflect that it is possible to give her many a draw on the sly  the fire was soon kindled ducks were roasting in front of it and the kettle boiling above it  the tea had been infused and la certe while filling his pipe was blinking goodwill at all around when the notes of a voyageursong were heard like an echo in the far distance  gradually the song grew louder and soon a canoe rounded the point and came in sight of the campfire  it was what used to be called a northcanoe of the largest size made of birchbark and contained a crew of ten men  the song and the paddling stopped simultaneously when the camp was observed and the men appeared to hold a consultation  their hesitation however was very brief  suddenly breaking again into song they ran the canoe to shore and landed  we are bound for red river said their chief to dan  just come from canada  we suppose you dont object to our camping beside you  it is a convenient spot  of course the two hunters had no objection whatever to fraternise with the strangers from canada and in a short time another large fire was sending its myriad sparks up into the darkening sky like a gigantic romancandle  during supper the strangers made themselves very agreeable  after supper two of the stoutest of them arose as if to go into the bush for more firewood  suddenly these threw themselves upon and seized dan and his comrade who were reclining quietly on the ground  before either could make even an attempt at selfdefence they were overpowered by the canadians and held forcibly down while their arms were securely bound to their sides with strips of deerskin  it is useless to struggle dan davidson said the chief when this was being accomplished  we know you as a bitter opponent of the norwesters and we intend to carry you where your power to do mischief will be ended  who are you and under whose authority do you act demanded dan angrily  who i am is a matter of no interest to you dan  i act under my own authority and i may just as well tell you at the beginning that if you and your comrade choose to submit peaceably we will treat you reasonably wellif not we will find means to quiet you even though we should be driven to do it wi that  the man pointed significantly to a gun which leant against a neighbouring tree  his meaning could not be misunderstood  that night dan and la certe were fastened to a tree by cords which allowed of their moving about freely within a small space but their arms were not unbound  here they were allowed to make themselves as comfortable as possible in the circumstances  their bed being mossy was well enough but the distracted state of their mindsespecially dansmay be imagined  la certe said dan when the campfire had burned low and the stars were shining on them through the leaves and all was still save an occasional snore from the norwesters  la certe groaned in reply  poor dan was not in a mood to comfort him or anybody else at that moment and did not follow up his remark  la certe he said again after a quarter of an hour  well  do you remember john bourke  yes yes  i remember him but i care not for him  my own sorrows are too great  do you recollect continued dan regardless of this despairing remark that a good while ago the norwesters took him prisoner when he was wounded after a skirmish with them and carried him to canadatreating him with great barbarity on the way  there he was put in jail but as nothing could be proved against him he was liberated and then tried to return to his family in red river but the norwesters caught him again imprisoned him sent him a second time to canada and had him tried at the court of the kings bench although his only crime was that of resisting the northwest company  he was acquitted and after terrible sufferings from which he never quite recovered and a three years absence he rejoined his family in red river  yes o yes  i know it all groaned la certe  well continued dan bitterly his fate is not unlikely to be ours  the poor halfbreed made no reply to this  for some time he lay quite still and his comrade had almost fallen into an uneasy slumber when he was awakened by la certe breaking out into a soliloquy in which he apostrophised his absent wife  o my slowfoot he murmured  shall we never meet again on earth yes you are right  i have been lazy  i am lazy  i suppose that this is punishment for my sin  but it is hard to bear and very heavy is it notfor only following ones nature in longing for repose  o why was i born  why was our little one born to enjoy for so brief a time the delights of smoke and then have it denied herexcept on the sly when with her miserable father who will never see her more perhaps  he paused for a few minutes and then broke out again  yes my slowfootyou are right  i must reform  i will cast off my sloth as a garmenteveneven though i should go naked all the rest of my days  i will workenergise  i will  hold your tongue la certe and listen said dan in a low stern voice  i am all attention returned the poor man in a similarly low tone  are you game to fight if you get the chance  game to fight echoed the otherto fight for my slowfoot my little one my smoke and my repoi mean mymynew  speak lower man and listen to a plan i have in my head  here dan spoke so low that he could not be heard at all save only by his companion but that is of little consequence for the plan whatever it might have been was never carried out  next day the norwest party with their two prisoners paddled away towards the mouth of the grand turbulent winnipeg river and began to traverse the weary wildernessroute of rivers and lakes which at that time formed the only direct means of communication between the frontiers of canada and ruperts land    chapter thirty five  the last  eagerly earnestly doggedly did daniel davidson and francois la certe watch for a favourable opportunity to escape from their captors but they waited and watched in vain for their captors were cruel suspected them of the intention to escape and were consequently careful to prevent even an attempt being made  they never freed their wrists from strong cords kept knives and axes out of their way tethered them to a tree each night and watched them continually  can it be wondered at that in the circumstances our unfortunate hero became almost insane  the weddingday had been fixed before he left red river preparations were being made for the great event and it was pretty well understood that dan had gone off hunting with the view chiefly to be out of peoples way till the day should arrive  they would scarcely begin to notice his prolonged absence till the day approached  then no doubt when too late and he should be far on the way to canada they would in some alarm send out parties to search for him  dan became desperate but he was gifted with an unusual power of selfcontrol so that beyond a very stern expression his countenance betrayed no sign of the terrible conflict that was raging withina conflict in which mortal hatred of mankind in general and an overwhelming desire to kill or be killed formed elements  ah reader poor human beings have many and many a time in the past been brought to this terrible condition  god grant that we and ours may never know what it is to tremble on the brink of madness because of the combined influence of gross injustice and horrible cruelty  to do the norwesters justice they were unaware of the intensity of the pain they were inflicting  they had only captured a powerful enemy and meant by keeping a tight hold of him to render him powerless in the futurethat was all  as for la certe they had no intention of taking him to canada  they only meant to carry him so far on the road that when set free it would be impossible for him to get back to the colony in time to give effective warning to dans friends  one afternoon the voyagers put ashore at one of the numerous portages which obstruct the navigation of that route to canada and after unloading the canoe and lifting her out of the water they proceeded to carry the lading across to the still water above the rapids which rendered this portage necessary  although bound the prisoners were by no means freed from labour  the cords had been so arranged that they could use the paddle while in the canoe while on the portages although unable to load themselves they were quite able to carry a load which others placed on their shoulders on this occasion dan was first sent off with a load and then la certe and some of the others followed  when he reached the upper end of the portage dan flung down his load and from his elevated position gazed wistfully down the valley through which the waters of the winnipeg river roared and seethed among jagged rocks as far as the eye could reach  it was a wild majestic scene but no thought of its grandeur touched the mind of the poor prisoner  he thought only of escape  his intimate knowledge however of the terrific power of rushing water told him that there could be no escape in that direction  oh if my arms were only free i would risk it he murmured as he raised his hands and looked at the powerful thongs of hide with which they were boundthongs which were always drawn tighter when he landed to render an attempt at escape more hopeless  then he glanced at the rushing river beside him  a sheer precipice of full thirty feet descended from the spot on which he stood to the edge of the flood just below there was a whirlpool and beyond that began the first of the series of falls and rapids which were avoided by means of the portage halfmad though he was he did not dream of attempting such a leap with bound hands  he would wait and continue to hope for a more favourable opportunity but the possibility of such an opportunity was now growing very faint indeed for even if he did escape and had a canoe to use it was by that time barely possible to accomplish the journey in time for the weddingday  but although his hope of being in time had pretty well died out his whole heart was still concentrated on the simple desire to escape  a rush of despair came upon the poor youth just then and the idea of ending his misery by taking his own life occurred to him for a fleeting moment as he gazed wistfully around on water wood and sky and observed the laden and toiling men who were slowly clambering up the steep towards himla certe being in front  just then an object among the grass at his feet attracted his attention stooping he picked it up and found it to be a scalpingknife dropped probably long before by some passing indians or voyageurs for it was very rusty  with a bounding heart and a wild rush of blood to his temples he sprang towards a tree stuck the point of the knife into it held the handle with his teeth sawed the thongs across its edge once or twiceand was free  his first impulse was to bound into the woods but the thought of his comrade arrested him  la certe was already close at hand  running towards him he said quickly drop your load  now or never and cut his bonds at once  then turning he sprang towards the woods  but from the very opening through which he meant to plunge into the tangled thicket there issued the leader of the norwesters and two of his men the chief was armed with a gun which he immediately presented  with the instinct of bushwarriors the two prisoners dodged behind rocks and made for the higher ground which dan had recently quitted  here a sheer precipice barred further progress  there was no way of escape but the river  they ran to the edge and looked down  la certe shrank back appalled  dan glanced quickly round to see if there was any other opening  then there came over his spirit that old old resolve which has in the moment of their extremity nerved so many men to face danger and death from the days of adam downward  now la certe he said grasping his comrades hand farewell  death or freedom  tell elspie my last thoughts were of her  almost before the halfbreed could realise what was said dan had leaped over the cliff and disappeared in the raging torrent  a few seconds later he was seen to rise in the whirlpool below the first cataract and to buffet the stream vigorously then he disappeared a second time before la certe could make out whether his friend rose again he was seized from behind and dragged from the brink of the precipice  swift as the hunted stag springs from his covert and bounds over every obstacle with speed and apparent ease so sprang the chief of the norwesters down the rugged path which led to the foot of the series of rapids and the lower end of the portage  there was good grit in the man morally and physically for he was bent on a rescue which involved considerable danger  throwing off his capote and tightening his belt he stood on a ledge just below the last fall intently watching the water  the fall was not high but it was deep and rushed into a large dark basin with terrible velocity causing the tormented foamspeckled water to circulate round its edges  in a few moments the form of dan was seen to shoot down the fall and disappear in the basin  the chief stooped but did not spring until not far from him the apparently inanimate form reappeared on the surface and began to circle slowly round among the flecks of foam  then he plunged swam out with powerful strokes and quickly returned to the shore with dan in his grasp  soon they were surrounded by the other voyageurs who had left la certe to look after himselfnot caring much in the excitement of the moment whether he escaped or not  he is dead said one he breathes not and see how his face is bruised and cut  and his chest too said another  i think his ribs have been broken poor fellow  it was a wild a reckless jump  keep back and let him have air said the chief who was doing his best according to his knowledge to resuscitate dan  presently la certe arrived panting  o he is gone  my comrade my friend is dead he exclaimed clenching his hands and gazing at the pale bruised face  you are wrong exclaimed the chief testily  out of the way man see his eyelids quiver  and so they did and so also quivered his lips and then a sigh came faint and feeblethen stronger and at last dan opened his eyes and thanked god that his life had been spared  but when he recovered sufficiently to realise his true position as being again a captive the feeling of despair returned  that night they encamped a mile above the upper end of the portage  at supper the two prisoners were allowed to sit by the campfire and eat with their hands free  monsieur said the guide to dan respectfully you see it is impossible to escape  why compel us to bind you  give me your word of honour that you will not try and your limbs may then remain as free as mine  i give you my word of honour answered dan with a sardonic smile that till after breakfast tomorrow i will not try for i need rest and food but after that i give you my word that i will never cease to try  with this promise the guide was fain to rest content and that night dan and his friend were allowed to sleep untethered which they did soundly  next morning they were roused in gentler tones than usual and not required to workas had been the case hithertobefore breakfast  in short there was an evident change in the feelings of their captors towards them founded largely no doubt on admiration of dans reckless courage but that did not induce them in the least degree to relax their vigilance for the moment the hour of truce had passed the chief advanced towards dan with the thongs to bind him  for one moment dan felt an impulse to knock the man down and then fight the whole party until death should end the matter but the goodhumoured look on his jailers face the fact that the man had saved his life the day before and the certainty of defeat with such odds against him induced him to quell the evil spirit and to hold out his hands  pardon monsieur said the chief with the politeness of a french halfbreed  i am sorry you refuse to give me your parole  i would rather see you like the rest of us but my orders are strict and i must obey  before dan could reply a sound struck on their ears which caused the whole party to listen immovable and in perfect silence  it was the wild plaintive beautiful song of the voyageur which had floated to them on the morning air softened by distance to a mere echo of sweet sound  after listening intently for a few moments the guide said gently voyageurs  again they listened to the familiar sound which increased in volume and strength as it approached proving that the voyageurs were descending the river towards them  as yet nothing could be seen for a thicklywooded point intervened  presently the song burst on them in full resonant chorus at the same moment two large northcanoesin all the brilliancy of orangecoloured bark painted bows and sterns redbladed paddles with crews of scarletcapped or bareheaded men swept round the point with quick stroke in time to the rapid measure  a cheer was the irrepressible impulse of the men on shore causing the newcomers to stop and listen  perhaps said dan they may be your foes of the hudsons bay company  that may be so returned the norwest chief gravely  the unfurling of an hbc hudsons bay company flag proved that it was so to a certainty and the depressed norwesters did not cheer again but the h b c men came on paddling with wild vigour and cheering hilariously  they seem in great spirits growled the norwest leader  we are almost as strong as they boys and have the advantage of woods and cliffs  shall we fight and keep our prisoners  what is that white thing in the bow of the first canoe said one of the men  it looks like a flag said another  if so it is a flag of truce observed dan  they have something to say and do not want to fight  that may be trite but we wont let you be at the conference returned the leader sternly  come four of you lead them out of earshot  take your guns and use them if need be  four powerful fellows at once obeyed the order and led the prisoners who had been once more bound into the woods  once again dan was tempted to offer fierce resistance but he knew that the hudsons bay men were yet too far off to be able to hear shoutsat least to understand the meaning of themand that it would be useless to resist such a guard  he therefore submitted to be led a mile or so into the woods and finally was permitted to sit down with la certe under a tree to await the result of the conference  they had not to wait long  in less than halfanhour one of the younger among the norwesters came bounding towards them waving his cap and shouting  you are free messieursfree he cried seizing both prisoners by the hands  we are no longer enemies  free  what do you mean demanded dan who fancied that the young man must have gone mad  the companies have joined he cried excitedly  they are one  we are all friends now but come and see and hear for yourself  filled with wonder and some small degree of hope dan and la certe followed the young man accompanied by their guards who were not less mystified than themselves  arrived at their campingplace they found that the canoes had brought a chief traderor officer of the hudsons bay companywho was conveying to red river and the interior of ruperts land generally the good news of a momentous historical event namely the union of the two companies  the important event here referred to namely the coalition between the two great rival companies which took place in 1821 was the deathblow to party strife over the whole of ruperts land and also inaugurated the dawn of lasting prosperity in the red river colony  cut their bonds said the chief trader as the prisoners approached  no touch of the surgeons knife ever effected a cure more speedily  i congratulate you young sir said the trader grasping dans hand you are now free for i understand that your loss of liberty had nothing to do with crime and the rival companies are no longer opponents they are friends  indeed we have been married so to speak and are now one  i am on my way to red river with the good news  when do you start asked dan abruptly  well if you mean from this spot answered the trader somewhat surprised as well as amused at the eagerness of the question i start at once  indeed i would not have landed here had i not seen your party  you appear to be anxious  why do you ask  because it is of the utmost importance to me that i should be in red river on a certain date and i fear that that is all but impossible now  dan then explained as briefly as possible his circumstances fortunately the trader was a sympathetic man  he ordered his crews to embark at once and bade the two captives take a brief if not an affectionate farewell of their late captors  i cannot promise you to push on he said at a rate which will satisfy youor even accomplish the end you have in viewbut i will do the best i can without overworking my men  i fear however that you will have to make up your mind to a delayed wedding  if you will only do your best for a day or two said dan until we reach the mouth of this river that will do for there my own hunting canoe was left and once in that la certe and i can go ahead and tell them you are coming  nay that would be requiting me illreturning evil for goodto take the wind out of my sails and make my news stale returned the trader with a goodnatured laugh  true i did not think of that said dan  then we will say not a word about it until you arrive  yes we will be dumb added la certe  even slowfoot shall fail to drag it out of me  and thus it was arranged  the late norwesters continued their voyage to canada and the hudsons bay men resumed their descent of the winnipeg river  arrived at the great lake the anxious pair did not wait even to rest but at once embarked in their little hunting canoe  im sorry you are such an unpresentable bridegroom said the trader when they were about to separate  he referred to the cuts and bruises with which poor dans countenance was temporarily disfigured  never mind returned our hero with a laugh wait till you see the bride she will more than make up for the shortcomings of the groom adieuau revoir  they pushed off and now began a race against time which in the matters at least of perseverance persistency hard labour and determination beat all the records of bicyclists and horsemen from the beginning of time  cyclists have frequent downhills to help and rest them dan and his friend had no such aids  it was all either dead level or upstream  dick turpin and the rider to ghent we forget his name only killed their horses  dan and francois nearly killed themselvesnot only with hard work and no rest but with profound anxiety for the wedding hour was rapidly approaching and they were still far from home  while these events were transpiring in the wilderness things were going smoothly enough in the colony  i will be thinkin said old duncan mckay one fine evening as he sat in his invalid chair beside duncan junior who was woefully reduced and careworn despite the attentions of the sympathetic jessie davidson who was seated near him on a rustic seat beside elspie  i will be thinkin that tan an la certe are stoppin longer away than iss altogither seemly  tan should have been here two or three days before the weddin  he will likely be time enough for his own weddinwhatever remarked duncan junior  dont you think so miss jessie  i think it likely answered the girl with a smile  he is sure to be in time said elspie with emphasis  we niver can be sure of anything in this world my tear remarked old duncan becoming oracular in tone  how do you know he iss so sure  because dan never breaks his word returned elspie with an air of decision that would have gratified dan immensely had he been there to see it  fery true my tear rejoined the highlander but there are many other things that interfere with ones word besides the will  he might tie you know or be trowned or his gun might burst and render him helpless for life if it did not kill him altogither  it iss an uncertain world at the bestwhatever  archie sinclair who joined themwith his brother little bill by his side not on his backwas of the same opinion as elspie but billie shook his head looked anxious and said nothingfor he felt that his friend was running things much too close  at a later hour that same evening the other members of the two familieswho dropped in to make inquiriesbegan to express anxiety and okematan who called just to see how things were getting on shook his head and looked owlish  old peg said nothing but she evidently thought much to judge from the deepening wrinkles on her forehead  as for fred jenkins he was too much taken up with elise morel to think much about anything but even he at last grew anxious and when the wedding morning finally dawned and no dan made his appearance something like consternation filled the hearts of all within the walls of ben nevis hall and prairie cottage  elspie appeared to feel less than the others but the truth was that she only controlled herself better  he only wants to take us by surprise she said and under the strength of that opinion she robed herself for the wedding  only her gravity and the pallor of her cheeks told of uneasiness in her mind  muster sutherland said he would come soon after breakfast observed old duncan uneasily  he should hev been here nowfor we need his advice sorely  here he iss exclaimed fergus starting up and hurrying forward to welcome the good old elder  mr sutherlands advice was decided and promptly given  both weddings should be deferred and all the young men must turn out in an organised search without a moments delay  it was amazing to find that every one had been of exactly the same opinion for some time past but no one had dared to suggest a course of action which implied a belief that dan might be in imminent danger if not worse  now that the ice had been broken however all the youth of the neighbourhood volunteered for service and a plan of search was being hastily formed under the direction of the elder when two men in a canoe were seen to paddle very slowly to the landingplace at the foot of the garden  after hauling the end of their canoe on shore they walked or rather staggered up towards the house  one of them tripped and fell and seemed from his motions as if he thought it was not worth while to rise again  the other paying no attention to his companion came on  pless my soul exclaimed old mckay it iss tanor his ghost whatever  and so it was  dirty bruised scratched battered and soaking wet daniel davidson appeared to claim his beautiful bride  and he did not come in vain for regardless of propriety and everything else elspie ran forward with a little shriek and flung herself into his arms  i have kept my promise elspie  i knew you would dan  i said you would  tan you rascal come here  the youth obeyed languidly for it was evident that he was thoroughly exhausted  my poy said the highlander touched by dans appearance you hev been in the watter  not exactly father but last nights thunderstorm caught us and we had no time to seek shelter  an it iss fightin you hev been  with water and rocks only said dan  well well go into the house now and change your cloes  dry yourself an get somethin to eat for you are used up altogither  elspie took his hand and led him away  meanwhile la certe having gathered himself up and staggered to the front was seized upon and questioned unmercifully  then he also was taken into the house and fed after which both men were made to lie down and rest  having slept for six hours dan awakened and rose up to be married fred jenkins and elise wereas the jovial tar expressed itturned off at the same time  it was customary in ruperts land at that time as it is customary in many remote lands no doubt at the present day to celebrate every wedding with a feast and a dance  feasts are very much alike in substance if not in detail everywhere  we refrain from describing that which took place in ben nevis hall at that time further than to say that it was superb  the dancing was simple it consisted chiefly of the highland fling danced by the performer according to taste or imagination  but that it was eminently satisfactory to all concerned was clearly evinced by the appearance of the whole partythe elegant ease with which fergus mckay did it the tremendous energy with which jacques bourassin tried it the persistent vigour with which andre morel studied it the facility with which elise acquired itunder elspies tuition the untiring perseverance with which archie and little bill did something like itfor the latter had quite recovered and was fit to hold his own almost with any one the charming confusion of mind with which fred jenkins intermingled the sailors hornpipe with it the inimitable languor with which la certe condescended to go through it the newborn energy with which slowfoot footed it the sidesplitting shrieks with which old peg regarded it the uproarious guffaws with which the delighted old duncan hailed it the sad smile with which that weak and worn invalid duncan junior beheld it and last but not least the earnest mental power and conspicuous physical ability with which dan davidson attempted something which charity personified might have supposed to bear a distant resemblance to it  the music was worthy of the dancing for the appointed performer had owing to some occult cause failed to turn up and a volunteer had taken his place with another fiddle which was homemade and which he did not quite understand  a small pig with feeble intellect and disordered nerves might have equalledeven surpassedthe tones of that violin but it could not hope to have beaten the volunteers time  that performed on a board by the volunteers foot automatically beat everything that we have ever heard of in the musical way from the days of eden till now  only four members of the two households failed to take a violently active part in that festive gathering  jessie davidson had conveniently sprained her ankle for the occasion and thus was set free to sit between the wheeled chairs of the two duncans and act as a sympathetic receptacle of their varied commentaries  her mother being too stout for active service sat beside them and smiled universal benignity  her little maid louise chanced to be ill  peter davidsons case however was the worst  he had gone off in company with okematan to visit a camp of cree indians intending to be back in time but his horse had gone lame while yet far from home and as it was impossible to procure another at the time he was fain to grin and bear it  meanwhile antoine dechamp had been pressed into the service and took his place as bestman to fred jenkinsa position which he filled to admiration chiefly owing to the fact that he had never served in such a capacity before  late on the following evening la certe sat by his own fireside somewhat exhausted by the festivities of the day before and glaring affectionately at slowfoot who was stirring something in a pot over the fire  the little onerapidly becoming a big one and unquestionably by that time a girlcrouched at her fathers side sound asleep with her head resting on his leg  she no longer cried for a pull at her fathers pipe  have you heard that kateegoose is dead asked slowfoot  nohow did he die  he was met on the plains by enemies killed and scalped  that is sadvery sad said la certe  the world is well rid of him observed slowfoot he was a bad man  yes responded her lord it is necessary to get rid of a bad man somehowbutbut it is sadvery sadto kill and scalp him  la certe passed his fingers softly among the locks of his sleeping child as if the fate of kateegoose were suggestive  then turning as from a painful subject he asked  does our little one never smoke now  nonever  does she never wish for it  slowfoot cannot tell what our little one wishes was the reply but she never gets it  la certe pondered for some time and then asked  does my slowfoot still like work  she likes it stilllikes it better  and she does itsometimes  yes oftenalways  why  because mr sutherland advises meand i like mr sutherland  does my slowfoot expect me to like work too and to do it asked la certe with a peculiar glance  we cannot like what we dont like though we may do it answered the wife drawing perilously near to the metaphysical but slowfoot expects nothing  she waits  my francois is not a child  he can judge of all things for himself  that is true my slowfoot and do you know he added earnestly i have had hard workawfully hard workkilling worksince i have been away yet it has not killed me  perhaps you will doubt me when i tell you that i too rather like it  that is strange said slowfoot with more of interest in her air than she had shown for many a day  why do you like it  i think returned the husband slowly it is because i like dan davidson  i like him very much and it was to please him that i began to work hard for you know he was very anxious to get home in time to be at his own wedding  so that made me work hard and now i find that hard work is not hard when we like people  is it not strange my slowfoot  yes  your words are very like the words of mr sutherland today  it is very strange  yet after all it was not so very strange for this worthy couple had only been led to the discovery of the old wellknown fact thatlove is the fulfilling of the law  there was yet another of those whose fortunes we have followed thus far who learned the same lesson  about the same time that the events just described took place in red river there assembled a large band of feathered and painted warriors in a secluded coppice far out on the prairie  they had met for a grave palaver  the subject they had been discussing was not war but peace several of the chiefs and braves had given their opinions and now all eyes were turned towards the spot where the great chief of all was seated with a whiteman beside him  that great chief was okematan the paleface was peter davidson  rising with the dignity that befitted his rank okematan in a low but telling voice delivered himself as follows  when okematan left his people and went to live for a time in the wigwams of the palefaces he wished to find out for himself what they wanted in our land and why they were not content to remain in their own land  the answer that was at first given to my questions seemed to me gooda reply that might have even come from the wise heads of the cree nation but after much palaver i found that there was contradiction in what the palefaces said so that i began to think they were fools and knew not how to talk wisely  a cree never reasons foolishlyas you all know wellor if he does we regard him as nobodyfit only to fight and to die without any one caring much  but as i lived longer with the palefaces i found that they were not all fools  some things they knew and did well  other things they did ill and foolishly  then i was puzzled for i found that they did not all think alike as we do and that some have good hearts as well as good heads  others have the heads without the hearts and some have the hearts without the headswaugh  waugh repeated the listening braves to fill up the pause here as it were with a note of approval  the palefaces told me continued okematan with great deliberation as if about to make some astounding revelations that their land was too small to hold them and so they came away  i told them that that was wise that cree indians would have done the same  but then came the puzzle for they told me that there were vast tracts of land where they lived with plenty of lakes rivers and mountains in which there was nobodyonly fish and birds and deer  then i said you told me that your land was too small to hold you why did you not go and live on these mountains and fish and shoot and be happy  to this they answered that those fine lands were claimed by a few great chiefs who kept them for their own shooting and fishing and drove out all the braves with their wives and families and little ones to crowd upon the shores of the great saltwater lake and live there on a few fish and shellsfor even there the great chiefs would not allow them to have all the fishing but kept the best of it for themselves  or if they did not like that the poor braves were told to go and live in what they called citieswhere there are thousands of wigwams crowded together and even piled on the top of each otherbut i think the palefaces were telling lies when they said thatwaugh  again there were many waughie responses mingled with numerous hos of astonishment and a few other sounds that seemed to indicate disbelief in okematans veracity  what continued okematan with considerable vehemence what would my braves do if okematan and a few of the cree chiefs were to take all the lands of red river and all the buffalo and all the birds and beasts to themselves and drive the braves with their families to the shores of lake winnipeg to live there on fish or die or leave the country if they did not like it  what would they do  okematans voice increased in fervour and he put the finishing question with an intensity that called forth a chorus of waughs and hos with a glittering of eyes and a significant grasping of scalpingknives and tomahawks that rendered further reply needless  would you not scorn us he continued scalp us tear out our eyes roast us alivebut nothe cree nation loves not cruelty  you would merely pat us on the head and tell us to go and make moccasins and boil the kettle with the squaws  then when i began to know them better i found that all the paleface chiefs over the great salt lake are not greedy and foolish  some are openhanded and wise  i also found that there is a tribe among them who lived chiefly in the mountain lands  these are very kind very brave very wise and very grave  they do not laugh so loud as the others but when they are amused their eyes twinkle and their sides shake more  this tribe is called scosmins  i love the scosmins  i lived in the wigwam of one  he is old and fierce but he is not bad and his heart is large  in his house were some other scosminsbraves and squaws  they were very kind to me  this is one of them  the flashing eyes of the entire party were turned upon peter davidson who however had presence of mind enough to gaze at the cloudless heavens with immovable solemnity and abstraction  there are two others whom i look upon as sons  one is named archee the other leetil beel  now continued okematan after a pause my advice is that we should teach the paleface chiefs over the great salt lake a lesson by receiving the poor braves who have been driven away from their own lands and treating them as brothers  our land is large there is room for alland our chiefs will never seize it  our hearts are large there is plenty of room there too  the great spirit who rules over all inclines my heart to go and dwell with the palefaces until i understand them better and teach them some of the wisdom of the redman  i shall return to red river tomorrow along with my paleface brother whose name is peeter and while i am away i counsel my braves and brothers to dwell and hunt and fish together in love and peace  how it fared with okematan on his selfimposed mission we cannot tell but we do know that from 1821the date of the auspicious coalition before mentionedthe sorely tried colony began steadily to prosper and with the exception of the mishaps incident to all new colonies and a disastrous flood or two has continued to prosper ever since civilisation has made rapid and giant strides especially during the later years of the century  the wave has rushed far and deep over the old boundaries and now the flourishing city of winnipeg with its thousands of inhabitants occupies the ground by the banks of the red river on which not many years ago the old fort garry stood a sort of sentineloutpost guarding the solitudes of what was at that time considered a remote part of the great wilderness of ruperts land  the end
