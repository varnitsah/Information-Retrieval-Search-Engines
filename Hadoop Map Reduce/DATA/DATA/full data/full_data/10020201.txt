rover boys on a hunt the putnam hall series etc  illustrated        new york grosset  dunlap publishers made in the united states of america     illustration theyve struck oil yelled andy excitedly     introduction   my dear boys this book is a complete story in itself but forms the fifth volume in a line issued under the general title the second rover boys series for young americans  as mentioned in some volumes of the first series this line was started years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle in which i introduced my readers to dick tom and sam rover and their relatives the volumes of the first series related the doings of these three rover boys while at putnam hall military academy brill college and while on numerous outings  having acquired a good education the three young men established themselves in business in new york and became married dick rover was blessed with a son and a daughter as was likewise his brother sam while tom rover became the proud father of twin boys as the four lads were all of a decidedly lively disposition it was thought best to send them to a boarding school and in the first volume of the second series entitled the rover boys at colby hall i related what happened to them while attending this institution  from colby hall the scene was shifted to snowshoe island where the lads went for a midwinter outing then they came back to colby hall and what happened to them at the annual encampment of the young cadets is related in the third volume entitled the rover boys under canvas  when winter was once more at hand the younger rovers thought they would like to go on another outing with their chums and in a volume entitled the rover boys on a hunt i related how they came upon a mysterious house in the forest and uncovered a most unusual mystery  in the present volume the scene is shifted from stirring doings at colby hall to still more stirring doings in the famous oil fields in the southern part of our country  once more i feel called upon to thank my numerous readers for the many nice things they have said about these rover boys books i earnestly hope that the reading of the volumes will do them all good      affectionately and sincerely yours         edward stratemeyer     contents          i out in the storm        ii who the rover boys were       iii to

  the rover boys in the land of luck     chapter i  out in the storm   jack it looks as if we were in for another storm  yes and its starting right now declared captain jack rover as he glanced through the trees to the overcast sky dont you hear it on the leaves  it does beat everything declared andy rover his usually bright face clouding a bit it has rained enough in the past two weeks to last a year  do you know i like these constant rains less than i liked being snowbound up at cedar lodge put in lieutenant fred rover  oh there was some fun in being snowbound declared randy rover a fellow could go out in it and have the best time ever but what can a chap do when the rain is coming down to beat the band  well you can go out and get a showerbath free of charge commented his twin gaily  ill take my showers in the gym was the quick reply gee listen to that will you  there was no need for any of the four rover boys to listen or to look either a blinding flash of lightning had swept the sky followed almost immediately by a crash of thunder in the woods behind them then followed another crash as of falling timber  it struck a tree ill bet a new cap exclaimed jack  yes and it was a little bit too close for comfort too answered his cousin fred  the thunder and lightning were followed by a sudden rush of wind which caused the trees of the forest to sway violently then the downfall of rain increased until it was little short of a deluge  weve got to get to some sort of shelter cried jack and the sooner we get there the better if we stay under the trees well be soaked to the skin  its all right enough to talk about shelter returned randy quickly but where are you going to find it i dont know of even a log shack in this vicinity  we might leg it down to the river suggested his brother we cant be very far from rocky bend  thats the talk burst out fred rover there is a cliff at the bend and i remember there is a hollow under it which the river washed out years ago  the trouble is you may find that hollow filled with water now fred answered jack remember the heavy rains of the last few weeks have caused something of a freshet even down at our boathouse the water is unusually high  another streak of lightning followed by more thunder interrupted the conversation then the wind seemed to veer around and the rain came swishing in under the tree where the four lads had been resting  the rover boys had left colby hall immediately after the days lessons for a tramp through the woods that bordered the rick rack river they had been kept indoors more or less for over two weeks it raining nearly every day but that morning the sun had come through the clouds and they had thought to enjoy a muchdesired outing  all were clad in their cadet uniforms and in addition wore their shoulder capes and also their rubbers they had found the roads and paths running through the woods very wet but did not mind this being glad to breathe some real air as randy had expressed it  i just hate to be boxed in all the time had been his words give me an outdoor life every time and then in the exuberance of his spirits he had turned what is commonly termed among athletes a cartwheel but when his feet came down again he found the ground so slippery he promptly landed flat on his back much to the amusement of the others  the four rovers had asked some of their chums to accompany them but two of the other cadets had errands to do in town and the others wished to write letters to their folks at home so the four had gone off by themselves all were good walkers and they had covered a distance of several miles before the sky became again overcast  if we werent so far from the school we might make a dash for it suggested jack  we cant run that far returned fred who was the smallest of the boys wed be all out of wind and simply get wet through and through lets try for the river were sure to find some sort of shelter under the rocks and bushes at the bend  all right here we go was jacks quick reply as the oldest of the boys and as a captain of the colby hall cadets he was naturally looked upon as the leader  he and fred started side by side and andy and randy followed closely their course was along a winding path leading over some rough rocks and through some small overhanging bushes  wow what are you trying to do give me a showerbath grumbled randy presently jack had pushed some long and wellsaturated brushwood to one side in passing now the bushes swung back into place catching poor randy over the face and breast and showering him with water  excuse me but i couldnt hold the bushes back said jack you had better not stick so close  oh well a little more water doesnt count jack we are getting pretty well soaked anyway  the wind was blowing so furiously the cadets had all they could do to hold their capes tight around their shoulders as they progressed more lightning lit up the sky and then they heard the fall of another tree some distance away  its going to be a humdinger of a storm remarked andy  yes and id give as much as two nickels to be safe back at the hall came from fred the constant thunder and lightning was beginning to get on the smallest youths nerves  presently the four rovers caught sight of the river through the trees the stream which at this point was nothing more than a mountain torrent boiled and foamed as it dashed over the rocks  it certainly is getting high said jack as all paused for a moment to catch their breath i cant remember having seen it like this before  just look at the stuff coming down will you remarked fred there is a whole lot of good firewood going to waste  i guess some one will pick it up by the time it reaches the lake fred said randy there are a lot of poor people down at haven point who get all their winter firewood from this river  yes but its not all driftwood broke in jack a good deal of the timber is cut up in the woods and then floated down that is quite an industry among some of the old settlers up there  the four cadets did not pause very long to survey the scene their one idea was to find some sort of shelter from the storm and with this in view they hurried on parallel to the watercourse until they came to the point of rocks commonly known as the bend here the side of the river on which they were located arose to a height of from twenty to thirty feet in one place there was a sheer rocky wall but at other places the rocks were much broken up and consequently irregular  there is the shelter i had in mind said fred pointing with his hand come on i think it will be just the place to get out of this storm  any kind of a shelter will be better than standing out here answered randy and he and fred set off on a wild scramble over the slippery rocks with the others following  be careful that you dont sprain an ankle or break a leg warned jack  gee a fellow would have to be a regular grasshopper to jump over these rocks grumbled randy and he had scarcely uttered the words when he slipped down landing with a thump on his chest  hurt queried jack quickly  nno spluttered his cousin bbut i knknknocked the wind out of mme  in a minute more the boys had reached the shelter of the rocks where they overhung the rick rack river here they found a shelter several feet above the madly rushing torrent the place was twelve or fifteen feet in length and several feet in depth above them was a shelving rock which while it did not shelter them completely did much to ward off the heavy downpour of rain  not as comfortable as a morris chair in the library at school remarked andy as he swished the water from his cap but its a good deal better than being in the open  provided we do not have to stay here too long returned his twin what time is it jack i didnt bring my watch with me  quarter to five announced the young captain after consulting his wristwatch  we ought to be on our way to the hall said fred i dont know what captain dale will say if we are late  oh hell excuse us when he learns the truth answered jack just the same id give a good deal if we were back safe and sound at the school we certainly cant stay here all night and it looks as if this storm was going to be a lasting one  maybe we are in for another couple of weeks of rain growled andy gee i wish the weather bureau would go out of existence they have been predicting clearing weather for over a week and it never came at all  crouching down in the shelter of the overhanging rocks the four cadets made themselves as comfortable as possible over them and out on the river swished the wind and the rain just below them the mountain torrent boiled and foamed with increasing violence showing that the heavy downpour was making matters steadily worse  i shouldnt want to have a cabin on the edge of this stream remarked fred presently  not much exclaimed andy youd be in danger every minute of having it floated away  look there will you cried randy a moment later as he pointed out in the stream if that isnt a chickencoop then i miss my guess  youre right and its got one or two chickens in it burst out jack  that shows that some of the farm lands up the river must be under water remarked andy  maybe well see a house or a barn coming down next cried fred gee this certainly is some storm he added as another flash of lightning lit up the sky then came the thunder rolling and rumbling along the river and the mountains beyond  a quarter of an hour passed and while the wind blew as violently as ever it seemed to the impatient cadets that the rain was slackening a little  maybe it will let up in the next halfhour or so remarked jack hopefully then if we strike out for the turnpike well be able to get down to the hall in no time  oh sure only three miles through the mud and of course thats nothing remarked andy airily  all of the boys were sitting in silence wondering what their next move would be when jack suddenly raised his hand as if to listen  what was it queried randy quickly  i thought i heard a yell for help was the reply listen  all did so and presently above the rushing of the wind heard a mans voice then came a shrill scream as if from a younger person  somebody is in trouble cried fred listen he is calling again  all strained their ears and once more heard the yells of the man borne along by the rushing wind then came that other shrill cry as if for assistance  they are in trouble all right  where are they  that cry came from up the river whoever they are they must be right around the bend  come on lets see what it means  with these and other exclamations the four rover boys left the shelter of the overhanging rocks and crawled along a stony pathway leading up the watercourse soon they passed around the bend and then came within sight of a scene which almost appalled them a mass of wreckage consisting of a small tree and a quantity of newly cut timber had come down the stream and become caught among the jagged rocks above the bend and in the midst of this wreckage with the water rushing and foaming all around them were a man and a boy struggling wildly to save themselves from drowning     chapter ii  who the rover boys were   look there will you  that man and boy will surely be drowned  why dont they swim ashore  most likely the stream is running too swiftly for them  help help came hoarsely from the man evidently his exertions were beginning to exhaust him  save me save me screamed the boy who seemed to be about jacks age save me dont let me drown  the two unfortunate victims had caught sight of the cadets who had by this time come as close to them as the rocks on the bank permitted the man waved his arm frantically toward them  cant you swim yelled jack to make himself heard above the wind and the rushing of the water  im caught fast the man gasped out and my son is caught fast too  both of my feet are fast screamed the boy oh please help us dont leave us here to be drowned  its a couple of logs of wood that are holding us went on the man in a hoarser tone than ever they are jammed in between us and some rocks and a floating tree if you can only start the tree maybe we can get out of here  both the man and the boy were in the rushing water up to their armpits and occasionally the dashing element would fly over them in a spray that hid them completely from view  oh boys this is awful groaned fred cant we do something for them  weve got to do something answered jack we cant leave them there to drown  but what are we going to do demanded andy soberly  he said something about loosening the tree that has drifted up alongside them came from randy do you think we can do it jack  i dont know but we can have a try at it anyway and if we cant push the tree maybe we can get at the logs that are holding them down  jack was looking up the river as he spoke and at a distance saw a series of rocks jutting out for a considerable distance into the stream  i am going out on those rocks and then trust to luck to get over to the other side he said we cant get at that fallen tree from this side  all right im with you jack said randy and together they made their way out on the rocks mentioned and the others slowly and cautiously followed  i know it will not be necessary to introduce the rover boys to my old readers but for the benefit of those who are now meeting them for the first time a few words of introduction will not come amiss  in my first volume entitled the rover boys at school i related how three brothers dick tom and sam rover were sent to putnam hall military academy where they made a great number of friends including a cadet named lawrence colby  after passing through putnam hall the boys attended brill college and then joined their father in business in new york city with offices on wall street they organized the rover company of which dick was now president tom secretary and general manager and sam treasurer the three youths were married and lived in three connecting houses on riverside drive overlooking the hudson river  about a year after their marriage dick and his wife became the parents of a son who was named john after mrs rovers uncle mr john laning this son was followed by a daughter named martha after her greataunt martha of valley brook farm the boy jack as he was commonly called was a sturdy youth with many of the qualities which had made his father so successful  it was around this time that tom rover and his wife nellie came to the front with a great surprise this was in the nature of a pair of lively twins one of whom was named anderson after his grandfather and the other randolph after his greatuncle randolph of valley brook farm andy and randy as they were always called were exceedingly active lads in that particular being a second edition of their father tom  about the time toms twins were born sam rover and his wife grace became the parents of a little girl whom they called mary after mrs laning then a year later the girl was followed by a boy who was christened fred after sam rovers old school chum fred garrison  residing so close together the younger generation of rover boys as well as the sisters were brought up very much as one family when they were old enough all were at first sent to private schools in the metropolis but soon the boys led by andy and randy showed such a propensity for cutting loose that their parents were compelled to hold a consultation  well have to send them to some strict boarding schoolsome military academy said dick rover  at that time lawrence colby the putnam hall chum of the older rovers was at the head of a military academy called colby hall to this institution jack fred and the twins were sent as related in detail in the first volume of my second series entitled the rover boys at colby hall this military school was located about half a mile from the town of haven point on clearwater lake at the head of the lake was the rick rack river running down from the mountains and woods beyond  the school consisted of a large stone building facing the river at a point not far from where the stream emptied into the lake close by was a smaller building occupied by colonel colby and his family and some of the professors and at a short distance were a gymnasium and a boathouse and likewise bathing pavilions  on arriving at colby hall the younger rovers found several of their friends awaiting them including dick powell and gifford garrison they also ran into nappy martell who had been far from friendly with them while in new york and likewise had trouble with an overgrown bully named slugger brown who was nappys crony  as mentioned colby hall was located about half a mile beyond haven point on the opposite side of the town was clearwater hall a boarding school for girls during a panic at a fire in a motion picture house the rover boys became acquainted with several girls from clearwater hall including ruth stevenson may powell alice strobell and annie larkins they discovered that may was dick powells cousin and the whole crowd of young people soon became friends later on mary and martha rover became pupils at the girls school  ruth stevenson had an old uncle barney the rover boys while out hunting one day did the old man a great service and for this he was so grateful that he invited them to spend their winter holidays with him which they did as related in the rover boys on snowshoe island  on this island the lads met their former enemies nappy martell and slugger brown as well as asa lemm a discharged teacher of colby hall the boys exposed a plot against old uncle barney and in the end caused the old hunters enemies to leave snowshoe island in disgust  i guess we havent seen the last of nappy and slugger said jack and he was right those two unworthies turned up once again as related in the volume entitled the rover boys under canvas in that book i told how the cadets went into their annual encampment and how after a spring election for officers jack was made captain of company c and fred made first lieutenant of the same command  among the cadets who wished to become a captain was one named gabe werner a great chum at that time of a lad named bill glutts having failed of election werner did all he could to make things uncomfortable for the rovers and in his actions he was aided by glutts but these two young rascals were discovered in some of their nefarious doings and becoming alarmed gabe werner left the school camp and did not return glutts was brought before captain dale the teacher in charge of the camp and received a stern lecture and was deprived of many liberties  while the rover boys were at colby hall the great war in europe opened and our country was overrun with german spies and sympathizers during their time under canvas the boys made several surprising discoveries and in the end helped the secret service men to capture a hidden german submarine they likewise helped to round up the fathers of nappy martell and slugger brown mr martell and mr brown were sent to prison on the charge of aiding the enemy while nappy and slugger were marched off to a detention camp in the south when being taken away nappy and slugger were very bitter against the rovers and vowed they would square accounts the first chance they got  and they will do it too youll see was freds comment they are as mad as hornets and they will do everything they can think of to make trouble for us  when the call for army volunteers came dick rover and his brother sam had lost no time in enlisting at first tom rover had been unable to get away but soon the business in new york city had been left in reliable hands and the three fathers of the boys had gone to the trenches in europe to do their bit for uncle sam they had been in several engagements and tom and sam had received shell wounds while dick rover had suffered somewhat from a gas attack  well we can be thankful that it is no worse had been jacks comment on receiving this news from abroad just the same i wish this awful war was at an end  during the winter gif garrison had received a letter from his uncle stating that he and his chums might use a bungalow up in the woods known as cedar lodge gif at once invited dick powell often called spouter because of his fondness for long speeches and the rover boys to become his guests on an outing to the lodge and how all of the lads went to that place has been related in detail in the volume previous to this entitled the rover boys on a hunt in that book they came upon a house in the forest and there uncovered a most unusual mystery they found that some germans were getting ready to establish a wireless telegraph station and aided in the roundup of these men by the united states authorities  mixed up with the german sympathizers were gabe werner and bill glutts and these badly scared youths had all they could do to convince the authorities that they were really patriotic glutts and werner considered that they had been brought into ill repute by the connivance of the rovers and their chums and they were exceedingly bitter against the cadets  we are certainly making some real enemies was the way jack expressed himself first nappy and slugger and now glutts and werner every one of those fellows will do all he can to injure us  well all we can do is to keep our eyes open for them was randys reply personally im not afraid of any of them  they are all sneaks and sneaks are always cowards added fred  having finished their outing at cedar lodge the four rovers and their two chums had returned to colby hall there to plunge once more into their studies and their other duties as cadets it was now early spring and talk of baseball filled the air but with so much rain outdoor practice was practically impossible  then had come a ray of sunshine and the four rovers had ventured forth that afternoon thinking to have a pleasant little outing but the sunshine had quickly passed and now they found themselves out in a furious storm and face to face with a situation that was as appalling as it was dangerous     chapter iii  to the rescue   dont leave us dont leave us shouted the man in the middle of the river as he saw jack and the others crawling over the rocky shore up the stream  were not going to leave you answered the young captain of the colby hall cadets we are going to try to get to that tree and move it keep up your courage  oh please hurry screamed the boy in the stream the water is getting higher every minute and its flying right into our faces  well do what we can shouted back randy and the others added similar words of encouragement  it was no easy task for the rovers to make their way over the wet rocks covered here and there with slippery grass and weeds more than once one or another went down and fred gave his left elbow a bump while his cousin andy received a scraping of the shins  fortunately the downpour of rain was abating so that they had a chance to dash the water from their caps and faces and see better what they were trying to do they soon reached the last of the rocks jutting out from the shore and here the four came again to a halt to view the situation  there is no help for itweve got to jump right in and trust to luck to reach the other side said jack  let us take hold of hands maybe we can brace ourselves better suggested randy  this plan was carried out and a moment later found the four cadets in water up to their knees so swift was the current they had all they could do to keep their feet and andy would have gone down had not his brother and fred held him up  it was lucky for the lads that they had chosen a spot where the stream was rather broad and shallow widening out on the side opposite to the rocky bluff nevertheless at one point they found themselves in water up to their waists and here they had to struggle with might and main to keep from being swept down to where the man and the boy were held prisoners  say this is awful gasped fred when he at last found himself on a safer footing  this river is running like a millrace was randys comment  when they had reached a spot where the water was less than a foot deep they stopped once more to regain their breath and then led by jack moved cautiously down the river to the point where was located the drifting tree the man had mentioned  just see if you cant pull it toward the shore directed the man but be careful that you dont get hit when it swings around  it was now that the young cadets lessons in bridge building while in camp came into good play jack gave orders as to just how the swinging around of the tree might be managed then all took hold and pulled with might and main  i dont see that it has budged any gasped fred after half a minute of the hardest kind of effort  try it again boys shouted jack encouragingly now thenall together onetwothree  again the four sturdy boys exerted all their strength on the tree and this time they felt the lower end which had been wedged in between some logs and rocks give way then as they hauled the tree still farther from the center of the river it suddenly swung around and caught by the current went dashing along on its course  hurrah there she goes shouted randy as the tree disappeared in a veil of foam and spray  how about it shouted jack to the man and boy can you get loose now  both of the prisoners were exerting their utmost to release themselves and did not answer but their efforts were in vain and soon they ceased to struggle  its no use one of the logs is holding our feet right against the rocks gasped out the man we dont seem to be able to budge it  im afraid it is going to break my leg screamed the boy i cant stand the pressure much longer  im going out there and see what i can do said jack  if you go so will i returned randy promptly  you can count me in too announced andy and fred simultaneously  look out that you dont get drowned went on jack quickly  well be as safe as youll be returned fred  all went up the river a short distance so that they might not be carried past the spot where the man and the boy were located then they struck out bravely for the place where the logs were jammed in a heap some of the sticks seemed to have been cut for railroad ties while others looked like fence rails and there were not less than two dozen of them in a jumble among the jagged rocks  in a few seconds the cadets found themselves in this jam with the furious current of the river trying to sweep them to one side or the other but they held fast and as rapidly as possible loosened one log or rail after another  look out there yelled andy presently and all heeded his warning then several of the logs bobbed up and went flying down the river  this released the log holding the man and the boy and the pair came up spluttering  do you think you can swim ashore questioned jack  i guess i can make it answered the man somewhat weakly look after my kid will you  we sure will answered jack  with fred and andy beside him the man struck out for the shore and all were soon carried down the stream and under the rocky bluff in the meanwhile jack and randy did what they could to aid the boy and then followed the others  the swiftly flowing current of the rick rack carried the entire party well past the overhanging rocks and then onward to a point where the river widened considerably here they managed to get a footing  thank fortune we are out of that exclaimed fred as he and the others made their way over the sand and rocks and through the bushes to where there was a grassy slope backed up by a number of trees  it was a mighty close shave for me and my kid returned the man i thought sure at one time we would be drowned  and we would have been if it hadnt been for these fellows coming to save us added the boy gratefully and he shot an admiring glance at the four dripping cadets  are you soldier boys questioned the man as the whole party gathered under the shelter of a tree by this time the rain was nothing more than a fine drizzle  not exactly answered jack we are cadets attending colby hall military academy  oh yes ive heard about that school said the man they tell me its a very fine place well all ive got to say is if all the boys there are as brave as you lads you certainly must have a bangup crowd and he smiled broadly then he clapped jack on his shoulder i thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you did for us it was a nervy thing to doto risk your lives in that river i shall never forget it if i were a rich man id want to reward you but i must admit im just about as poor as they make em  we dont want any reward answered jack im glad to be of service to you  i guess were all glad added randy and the others nodded  then the young cadets introduced themselves and the man and the boy did the same the man said his name was john franklin  this is my son phil he added we dont belong around herethat is not exactly you see i used to own a farm which was mostly in texas and partly in oklahoma a pretty big farm though it wasnt very productive some oil sharpers came along and made a sort of threecornered deal the particulars of which i need not give you but as a consequence almost before i knew it i was done out of my farm and had next to no money in my pocket then i came up here expecting to see some friends who might help me in fighting those rascals but the friends had moved away and nobody knew where to so i was almost stranded then phil and i got work up in the woods cutting timber and doing other odd jobs and we had steady employment until this rainy season set in  so you came all the way from texas did you said randy to phil franklin with a smile its a pretty long distance  oh we got sick of it down there after dad was done out of his farm by those oil sharpers answered phil franklin  did they find oil on your farm questioned fred  no that is they hadnt up to the time we left you know it takes a lot of time and money to sink an oil well but they did us out of our farm and thats bad enough  some day if i ever get on my feet again im going back to texas and have it out with those rascals announced john franklin they claimed that their dealings with me were perfectly legal but i dont look at it that way however boys that affair has nothing to do with you as i said before i wish i could reward you but all i can do is to give you my very best thanks  and you can bet im thankful too added phil franklin earnestly  isnt it rather strange that you should be up here in such a storm as this questioned the man from texas  we got tired of staying indoors on account of the rain answered jack so when it seemed to break away we thought we saw a chance to take a hike just for the fun of it  and now were glad we did take a hike put in randy  we were trying to cross the stream by the aid of a rope explained john franklin the rope broke and phil was swept down the stream and i went after him to make sure that he didnt get drowned then we got mixed up in the logs and the tree and you know the rest  you say you belong up the river questioned andy  yes weve been stopping at bossards camp i suppose we ought to be getting back there now or hell be wondering what has become of us besides that well want some dry clothing and you fellows will want some dry clothing too otherwise you might catch cold  yes well hike back to the school as fast as possible answered jack he held out his hand goodbye to you and good luck  you wont mind if i come down to see you some time will you questioned the man i want your teachers to know how brave you have been  come down by all means answered jack but dont pile on the bravery stuff please we did only what any healthy young fellows would do  i dont know about that i guess i know real heroes when i see em answered john franklin with a grin  id like to see you fellows drill it must be great put in his son phil  come down any time and ask for us answered fred he was rather taken by phil franklins open manner  a few words more passed and then the franklins hurried up the river in the direction of the lumber camp from which they had come then the rovers turned in the direction of colby hall  im glad we went to the rescue remarked andy when on the way they seem a pretty decent sort  all the way from texas mused his twin thats certainly some distance  as the rovers hurried to the hall they talked the matter of the rescue over in all of its details  it was certainly a queer meeting was freds comment but little did he or his cousins dream of the still queerer meeting with the franklins that was to come in the future     chapter iv  in the gymnasium   company attention carry arms present arms shoulder arms forward march  captain jack rover assisted by lieutenant fred rover and his other officers was drilling company c in a corner of the gymnasium of colby hall it was two days after the adventure on the rick rack river and it was still raining so that drilling in the open was almost out of the question  the four cadets who had taken part in the rescue of john franklin and his son phil had explained the situation to captain dale on their return to the school and had been warmly praised by that old west point military man for their bravery  it may be mentioned here that captain dale had been in charge of the school since colonel colby had volunteered for the war and gone to france to fight  many of the cadets hated the rain and hoped it would soon clear they loved drilling in the open far more than when held indoors and they also wished to get at baseball and other spring sports  its a shame it doesnt let up remarked gif garrison after the drilling had come to an end and the rifles had been put away in their cases along the wall gif was a big youth and the recognized head of many of the athletic sports  well we have to take such matters as they come returned spouter powell running his hand through his heavy brush of hair were it not for the gentle rains and the dews later on the fields and slopes of the hills would not be clothed in the verdant green which all true lovers of nature so much admire instead we might have a bleak barrenness a dissolution which would appall  gee spouter is at it again broke in will hendry usually called fatty by his chums because of his rotundity fatty was extremely goodnatured and as a consequence nearly every one admired him  nothing gentle about this rain exclaimed dan soppinger another cadet its coming down in bucketfuls say that puts me in mindive got an essay to write on moisture can any of you tell me why condensation takes place when  hurrah the human questionbox is once more with us broke in andy rover dan i think youd die if you couldnt ask questions  humph how is a fellow going to learn anything if he doesnt ask questions retorted dan  you might walk around with a set of encyclopedias in your pocket proposed randy  thats it dan get a regular thirtyvolume set while you are at it youve got about thirty pockets in your suit havent you you could put one in each pocket  i wish it would clear off tomorrow at least enough to go to haven point said fred they have a dandy moving picture at mr falsteins place  oh i know the piece you mean fred cried andy slyly its entitled meeting the girls or the great conspiracy  did the girls say they were going to see the pictures fred questioned jack quickly  mary telephoned that they might go answered fred that is she said she and martha might and if they go probably some of the others will go too  then we must get down to see the pictures by all means answered jack that is if the storm lets up if it keeps on raining i dont think any of them will show up  lets go in for a little gymnastic work cried randy and had soon shed his cap and his coat he leaped up to one of the turningbars and was soon busily going through various gymnastic evolutions his twin joined him and then they did a little team work much to the admiration of some of the others present  how about a swing from one bar to the next called out ned lowe ned was known as the chief singer of the school and was very handy with a mandolin  all right ned ill swing against you called andy quickly  not much was neds ready reply i know you can beat me see what you can do against walt baxter  walt baxter was a cleancut athletic youth who had made good in various contests in the gymnasium and on the baseball and football field he was the son of dan baxter who at one time had been a bitter enemy of the older rovers but the senior baxter had reformed and his son was well liked by the younger rovers  all right walt called out andy do you want to swing against me or against my brother randy  ill swing against both of you answered walt pleasantly  the details of the little contest were quickly arranged and it was decided that randy should make the first swing walt the second and andy should come last the swing was to consist of a flying leap from one bar to the next and then to a large pad spread beyond the second bar  one try only now remember cried dan soppinger do your best everybody  it did not take randy long to get into position and then he made a swing and a leap which were gracefulness itself he landed on the pad lightly but quite close to the second bar  im sure i can do better than that cried walt baxter and in less than a minute he too had made the swing landing half a foot beyond the mark set by randy  andy eyed the distance carefully and then prepared to make the swing  heres where i do the flyingfish act he cried merrily  whats going on here a contest let me see it came a voice from behind the crowd that had assembled to see the performance then henry stowell a small cadet who was a good deal of a sneak pushed his way to the front of the gathering  hi codfish what are you trying to do exclaimed ned lowe who had been elbowed rather rudely by the small cadet  i want to see whats going on cried stowell  all right codfish take it in for all youre worth called out fatty hendry and then put out his foot and pushed the sneak of the school forward  it was a vigorous shove and in order to keep himself from pitching headlong henry stowell took half a dozen quick steps forward andy was just in the act of launching himself from one bar to the next when stowells forward movement carried him to a point directly between the two bars as a consequence andys feet struck the smaller cadet in the shoulder and both went down in a heap on the floor  stop stop what are you trying to dokill me yelled stowell as andy came down on top of him in anything but a gentle fashion  id like to know what you are trying to do codfish demanded andy using a nickname for stowell which the latter abhorred  i didnt do a thing fatty hendry tried to trip me up  and you shoved your way in where you had no business to be retorted fatty just the same im sorry he got in your way andy he added  are either of you hurt questioned jack quickly  he spoiled my jump answered his cousin  and he kicked me in the shoulder and knocked me down whined stowell ive a good mind to report him  what after all we did for you in the woods last winter demanded fred they had found stowell with werner and glutts and had rescued the little cadet from the bullies and seen him safe on his way home  i dont care my shoulder hurts terribly whined stowell  never mind codfish well give you a mustard plaster to put on it cried ned lowe and then in some confusion the sneak of colby hall withdrew from the crowd  i dont suppose you feel like trying the swing now remarked walt baxter to andy if you want to call it off all right  not much was the quick reply i got pretty well shaken up by hitting codfish but just the same im going to make the swing and a moment later andy did so  and he wins declared dan soppinger after measurements were made hes a good six inches ahead of anybody  well some time well try it again and then maybe ill be able to do better remarked walt baxter goodnaturedly  im afraid youve made codfish sore on us once again remarked jack to andy after the little contest had come to an end and the cadets were breaking up into various groups  if he is going to get sore over that he can do it retorted andy  i supposed he would be real friendly after all we did for him up in the woods last winter remarked fred  well that shows whats in a fellow is bound to come out sooner or later answered randy codfish always was a poor stick and i suppose he always will be just the same i did hope he would turn over a new leaf  when the cadets awoke on saturday morning a pleasurable surprise awaited them the storms of the weeks previous had completely passed and the sun was shining over the hills most gloriously  oh but isnt this the best ever cried randy after glancing out of the window  its simply scrumptious retorted his twin and then to show how good he felt andy turned a flipflap over his bed then he caught up a pillow and threw it through an open doorway at fred who had just started to dress  hi you whats thisa bombardment by the huns yelled fred and promptly returning by sending a sneaker at his cousin but the footwear struck randy who promptly returned the missile and followed it up with a book and a waddedup towel  hi you fellows stop the roughhousing shouted jack do you want to be reported  whos going to report usyou questioned andy  no but some monitor will or some teacher and then a fat chance youll have of going to haven point this afternoon  oh thats so we dont want to have our offtime cut off put in randy quickly the wars over the armistice is signed and everybody can go home and get washed up he added with a grin  but while he was speaking andy had advanced upon fred and now the two started to wrestle jack tried to stop them and in the confusion the three upset a small stand sending a dozen or more books to the floor with a thump almost immediately came another thump on one of the doors leading to the corridor  now weve done it whispered fred in sudden alarm  pick up those books quick answered andy and got down on his knees to do so while jack righted the stand which had held the volumes at the same time randy leaped to pick up the pillows and otherwise straighten the connecting rooms which the rovers occupied  ho you fellows arent you up yet came from the corridor in the voice of gif garrison let me in ive got some important news to tell you  oh its only gif murmured the twins in relief  he said he had important news put in jack i wonder what it can be     chapter v  the rival school   one of the doors to the rooms occupied by the rovers was quickly swung open and gif garrison strode in followed by dick powell gif held a morning newspaper in his hand one which had been delivered to the school only a short while before  you said you had important news gif said jack what is it  there is an item here in the newspaper gif wants to show you put in spouter i am sure it will interest every one of us  its not much of an item so far as size goes said gif but it certainly is importantor at least it may be especially to you roversseeing that none of us has ever been particularly friendly with nappy martell and slugger brown  what have you news of those two rascals demanded randy  did they run away from that detention camp in the south broke in fred  theyd be fools to do that returned andy the military authorities would round them up in no time its no easy matter to keep out of the clutches of uncle sam if he wants you  no they havent run away they have simply been given their freedom answered gif hereyou can read the news for yourselves  the item he referred to was only twelve lines long and located at the bottom of a column on one of the inside pages of the newspaper it was dated from a wellknown detention camp in the south and gave a list of six prisoners who had had another hearing and been given their freedom two of the names were napoleon martell and slogwell brown jr  well theyre loose all right enough was andys comment after they had perused the item i wonder what theyll do  one thing is certain being detained that way by the government will certainly prove quite a stigma said jack i shouldnt like to have anything of that sort against me  i suppose theyll have it in for us said randy they always loved us a loti dont think  do you imagine they would dare show themselves around here questioned fred quickly  why not queried spouter  i dont think theyll come here answered jack its too slow for them around haven point you know how sick they got of it the last time they were here theyll probably head for some big city where they can have a good time on whatever money they can get hold of  gif and spouter passed on to carry the news to other cadets who might be interested in it and the rovers hurried to get ready for rollcall and breakfast while they were finishing their dressing they continued to discuss the news  i was hoping that we had seen and heard the last of nappy and slugger said fred just as i was hoping that we had seen the last of werner and glutts  they are like bad penniesready to turn up when you least expect it said andy just the same they had better keep out of my way if they dont want to get into trouble he continued his eyes flashing  during the morning the boys had to attend a drill and then prepare a number of their lessons for the following week but directly after lunch they had the time to themselves and the four rovers hurried off to town and gif and spouter went with them  as has been mentioned before haven point possessed a firstclass motion picture theater run by a man named felix falstein who on more than one occasion had shown his friendship for the cadets jack and fred had communicated with their sisters and martha and mary had agreed to meet them at a certain hour at the theater entrance  not here yet said jack when the crowd arrived  you cant expect girls to be on hand always said andy gaily youve got to give em a chance to get the hairbuns over their ears  and fourteen hooks hooked up on the shoulder where you cant reach em added his twin grinning  here they come now interrupted fred do you want me to tell them about the hooks and the hairbuns he added slyly  you say a word fred and youll be killed in cold blood retorted andy while randy shook a playful fist at his cousin  in the crowd of girls coming around the corner of the street were not only the two rovers and may powell the cousin of spouter but also ruth stevenson annie larkins and alice strobell  have we been keeping you long questioned martha rover as she came up to her brother  only a couple of minutes martha answered jack  we havent even had a chance to read the billboards put in andy  i was so glad to see it clear off remarked ruth stevenson as she quite naturally paired off with jack while may powell turned to talk to fred and then she added as she gazed admiringly at the young captain in his neatfitting uniform i understand you and your cousins have been doing the hero act again  who told you that questioned jack quickly  never mind who told me weve heard all about how you rescued a man and his son from the rick rack river oh jack it was a grand thing to do  but who told you ruth  it was mr franklin himself if you want to know it  where in the world did you meet mr franklin  why he works up at bossards lumber camp and bossard supplies our school with cordwood mr franklin and his son brought down a load of wood and he told someone how the rovers had come to their rescue then those folks pointed martha and mary out to them and as we happened to be with your sister and your cousin at the time we heard the whole story mr franklin said it was a very brave thing to do and he was awfully sorry that he couldnt offer you some rewardnot but what i am sure jack you wouldnt accept it the girl continued quickly  by this time all the boys and girls had paired off and soon the cadets had purchased tickets and all entered the showhouse they found seats together and sat down to enjoy themselves a comic picture was being thrown on the screen and at this the young folks laughed so heartily that it put all of them in the best of humor then came a slight intermission and they had a chance to talk over their personal matters  i heard something a few days ago that interested me quite a good deal jack said ruth it was from that new school at darryville the longley academy  the girl referred to a school which had been opened the fall previous it was supposed to be something of a physical culture academy where as much attention was paid to athletics as to mental studies the school had been inaugurated too late to do anything in football but had given out that they would be in the baseball field the following spring  what did you hear about longley ruth  why there is a boy there i used to know quite well tommy flanders he says they have organized a firstclass baseball club and that they are going to put it all over colby hallthose are his exact words  humph that remains to be seen ruth  have you received a challenge from them  not yet but gif garrison is expecting one every day we heard something of the talk do you know if this tommy flanders is much of a player  he used to be considered quite a pitcher in fact he was so good as a boy pitcher that some of the local fans wanted him to sign up in one of the minor leagues but of course they wouldnt let him do that because he was too young to leave school  that certainly sounds interesting especially if this flanders pitches for longley  tommy told me that they had not less than a dozen firstclass baseball players at their academy he boasted that they would wipe up the diamond with your schooli am now quoting his words  evidently tommy knows how to blow  oh but jack he really is a firstclass player and you must remember that they have advertised longley academy as given over especially to athletics and gymnastics probably theyll pay more attention to baseball and football than they will to their studies  well if we get beaten well get beaten ruth thats all well do our best  and i certainly hope you win jack said the girl giving him a warm glance i would like to see you take some of the conceit out of tommy flanders  after the performance was over the young folks adjourned to a nearby icecream parlor where they indulged in that dainty to their hearts content while eating their cream and munching the cake they had ordered with it jack mentioned what ruth had told him regarding the boys at the new rival school  yes they said they were going to send a challenge soon said gif and ive been warned by others that they intend to put a firstclass nine on the diamond to beat us  then it will be up to you gif to show them what colby hall can do said spouter he himself was not much of a ball player although he had been on the nine occasionally  the young people had almost finished their ice cream and cake when they saw two girls and two boys come in as they entered ruth clutched jack by the arm  there is tommy flanders now she whispered pointing to the larger of the two youths  tommy flanders showed that he was a good deal of a sport he was dressed in a loudlooking suit had pointed shoes and he wore a cap set well back on his head his face was rather red and his forehead was overshadowed by a heavy mop of reddishbrown hair  hello ruth how are you he called out pleasantly when still at a distance glad to see you and he smiled at all of the girls and bowed  after this there was nothing to do but to introduce the newcomer and he promptly introduced the two girls who proved to be residents of haven point and then introduced his friend pete stevens  pete is going to be my backstop on our nine explained tommy flanders you know i suppose that i am the pitcher he added in an offhand manner  and hes one wonder pitcher believe me piped in pete stevens he was a stocky youth with small ferretlike eyes  i understand youre going to have quite a nine remarked jack politely  say it will be the finest baseball aggregation this part of the country has ever seenthat is for a school nine boasted tommy flanders you know our school is long on athletics we intend to put it over everything within traveling distance  that is provided the other schools are not too scared to accept our challenges added pete stevens  you wont find colby hall afraid to accept any reasonable challenge retorted gif somewhat disgusted with the boasting manner of the newcomers  weve waxed a few schools around here and maybe we can take a round out of longley academy fred could not help but add  youll never take a round out of longley believe me sneered pete stevens well put it all over you fellows just as sure as youre born  well well see remarked jack and his face showed that he did not admire having this discussion before the girls  say ill tell you what ill do rover said tommy flanders advancing close to the young captain ill bet you ten dollars that we win the first game of ball we play with you  youll have to excuse me flanders but im not betting answered jack  afraid are you  i said i was not betting and now if youll excuse us well finish our ice cream and cake added the young captain coldly  oh well if youre afraid to bet well let it go at that responded tommy flanders carelessly then he and his companion and the girls with them moved off to a table in the rear of the icecream parlor  of all the conceited fools began andy when jack caught him by the arm  drop it andy and jack looked at his cousin and then at the girls all of whom had been much disturbed over the possibility of a quarrel  oh sure lets drop it was andys quick answer and then to change the subject he began a funny story and soon he had the girls shrieking with laughter then they finished their ice cream and cake and left the place  oh jack if you do play them i hope you beat them good said ruth when the girls and the cadets were ready to separate  well do our best was his reply  i hope when that match comes off well be able to see it said martha  of course youll all have to be on hand answered her brother quickly well want you girls to encourage us  i want to see you beat longley academy declared mary  so say we all of us came in a chorus from the others     chapter vi  playing hixley high   now for some real baseball practice boys  right you are jack im mighty glad it has cleared off at last  if we are going to have our annual game with hixley high two weeks from today we had better get busy put in gif garrison i had no idea they would ask for a match so early in the season  its on account of the game they expect to have this year with longley academy remarked walt baxter you see they are to play the new school too  yes and i heard that those longley fellows were boasting they were going to do up hixley just the same as they were going to do us up  gee but that tommy flanders makes me sick broke in fred i really think hes the most conceited fellow i ever met  just the same ive heard hes a pretty good player remarked gif he is not only a good pitcher but quite a good batsman and they say that his crony is also quite a good allaround player  the regular nine minus two players who had left the school the term previous were out on the diamond practicing a little later with two substitutes they were to play a match of five innings against a scrub team picked from the most available of the ball players left  jack rover was in the box and was putting some swift ones over the plate as yet he did not have perfect control of the horsehide and as a consequence it occasionally went over the catchers head  three games of baseball had been arranged for colby hall one with hixley high another with columbus academy and a third with longley they were to take place in the order named and at intervals of one week  the practice soon came to an end and then the fiveinnings game with the scrubs started this proved to be quite a contest and fred rover distinguished himself by knocking a threebagger while jack struck out six batsmen much to his satisfaction when the contest came to a close the regular nine had won by a score of 11 to 3  well that shows the old nine is still in the running remarked dan soppinger when the boys were rushing to the gymnasium to get under the showers  right you are dan answered jack just the same that scrub team isnt hixley high or columbus or longley either please dont forget that  oh i know that just as well as you do jack weve got to play much better than we did today if we expect any victories in the regular games  dont forget that well be up against dink wilsey again said gif  i dont believe that any of us are likely to forget it grinned dan all remembered dink wilsey very well he was the pitcher for hixley high and a fellow who was destined to become talked about in baseball circles he had a puzzling delivery and sometimes struck out even the best of the batsmen with ease  from that day forth jack and the other members of the ball team put in every spare moment at practice gradually the young pitcher obtained better control of the sphere and then he did what he could to increase his speed and make his curves more puzzling  the contest with hixley high was to take place on the latters grounds and almost all the pupils at colby hall made the journey to see the game many girls were also present from clearwater hall and from the town  oh jack i hope you win said ruth stevenson as he strode forward to greet her and the others who had arrived from the girls school  were going to do our best ruth answered the young pitcher and then as he noticed something of a cloud on her face he added jokingly you dont have to look so glum about it  im not glum over the game jack i was thinking of something else she answered soberly  why whats the matter ruthhas anything gone wrong  yes jack butbut maybe id better not tell you anything about it she faltered  has anybody been annoying you  i cant tell you nowill tell you after the game if i get a chance whispered ruth as several of the other boys and girls came closer  at that moment came a blare of tin horns and the noise of many rattles and then the hixley high boys let out a wild yelling  hixley high hixley high hixley high forever and this was repeated over and over again  wake up fellows came suddenly in a bellow from ned lowe everybody wake up for colby hall and then there boomed out this refrain      who are we      cant you see      colby hall      dum dum dum dum dum      here we come with fife and drum      colby colby colby hall  thats the stuff give it to em again yelled fatty hendry wiping the perspiration from his forehead and once more the school refrain boomed forth  oh isnt that grand remarked mary rover  the best ever answered her cousin martha  it makes me feel just as if i was being raised off my feet remarked may powell  the game began with hixley high at the bat there was a wild cheering for rigby the centerfielder when he came up stick in hand and also yells of encouragement for jack  put him out in onetwothree order jack  dont let him get a smell at first  knock the cover off it rigby make a homer  after two strikes one of them a foul rigby managed to get a safe hit to first but then jack tightened up and presently the side was retired without a run  thats the stuff hold em to goose eggs all the way through  now then colby go to it and make a couple  but alas for this hope one player got as far as third but there the inning ended  goose eggs also went up for both sides in the second third and fourth innings then two players of hixley high managed to make singles and on a fumble by one of the new men playing for colby one of these hits was turned into a run  hurrah hurrah thats the stuff score one for hixley  hold em down hold em down dont let em score again came from the colby hall supporters and the players from the military school did hold em down to the single tally which had been made  with the score 1 to 0 the game ran along to the eighth inning then dan soppinger managed to knock out a twobagger and he was followed at the plate by randy two men were already out so it was a crucial moment in more ways than one  dink wilsey was still in good form although the strain was evidently telling upon him he sent in two swift balls which were called strikes one being a foul then came two wide ones which were put down as balls by the umpire  hit it randy sang out gif paste it for all you know how  randy was on the alert and although the next ball pitched was a bit low he swung for it sending it down toward right field  run dan run  leg it randy  and both players did run for all they were worth dan had started as randy swung for the sphere and consequently touched third a few seconds later then as he saw the ball was still down in right field with the fielder chasing madly after it he came in to the home plate randy had meanwhile reached first and was halfway to second which he reached safely by sliding  hurrah one run for colby hall  and randy rover made it a twobagger  some playing ill say  the excitement was now intense as colby hall saw a chance to win but this chance went glimmering a few seconds later when a popfly was gathered in with ease by the hixley pitcher  never mind weve tied the score and thats something said gif now all we need do is to hold them down and make one more run  in the ninth inning hixley high fought desperately to score and colby hall did the same but neither side got further than first  a tie game a tie game was the cry  now then it takes only one run to win  the excitement was now at a fever heat and this continued through the tenth and eleventh innings by this time it was growing dark so that the fielders had difficulty in seeing the ball  i think we had better call it a tie and let it go at that said the hixley captain to gif what do you think about it  there was a brief consultation and several of the regular school coaches were called in in the meanwhile it grew darker rapidly and presently the contest was called off  its too bad we couldnt finish it remarked jack as he shook hands with dink wilsey  well have to finish it next year said the rival pitcher with a grin  there was a good deal of talk about the contest but gradually the crowd dispersed and many of the colby boys started for the hall the rovers and some of their chums rejoined the girls and walked with them to the automobiles which were to take martha and mary and the others back to clearwater hall  im so sorry you fellows didnt win that game pouted may powell on the way  well we did our best answered fred and believe me its something to hold down a school like hixley with such a pitcher as dink wilsey  you dont mean to say he can pitch any better than jack put in ruth quickly  oh im not saying anything against jack answered fred just the same dinks a great pitcher and jack will say so himself  he certainly is was the reply from the oldest rover boy hell be on one of the professional teams one of these days if longley academy has any such pitcher in tommy flanders weve got our work cut out for us  most of the boys and girls went on to where the automobiles were in waiting but jack kept to the rear until the whole crowd were out of hearing  now then ruth tell me what is troubling you he said in a low voice  oh jack i dont believe i ought to tell you i should have torn it up and forgotten all about it returned the girl  torn it up what do you mean was it a letter  yes a letter that came yesterday it is nothing but a scrawl and its unsigned it was sent from new york  what did the letter say did somebody threaten you ruth  no jack somebody threatened you if it hadnt been for that i wouldnt think of bothering you about it  humph this is interesting have you got the letter with you  yes here it is and the girl brought forth the letter from her handbag as she had said it was postmarked new york city and was addressed to her at the school the envelope was a plain one and inside was a single sheet of plain white paper on this evidently in a disguised hand had been scrawled the following       ruth stevenson if you know when you are well off you wont       have much to do with jack rover or his cousins they are a bum lot       and some day you will be ashamed of every one of them jack rover       never treated anybody square and some day you can take it from me       that i intend to pound his handsome face into a jelly better       listen to my warning or you will be very sorry you had anything       to do with that crowd       a friend     chapter vii  news from abroad   thats a fine letter i must say remarked jack after perusing the scrawl a second time evidently the writer loves me a whole lot  of course it must have come from one of those fellows who used to go to school with you said ruth perhaps that martell boy or that brown boy  i dont think nappy martell would dare send such a letter answered the young captain of the cadets it would be more like slugger brown to do it but you must remember that those fellows have just been released from that detention camp jack mused for a moment this looks more like the work of gabe werner to me  oh jack suppose he should attack you some time when you werent aware  thats a risk a fellow has to run of course i expect to keep on my guard not only against gabe werner but also against martell brown and glutts the whole four dont like any of our crowd  but just read the dreadful thing he says continued the girl as she caught jack tightly by the arm he says hell pound your face into a jelly oh jack dont you ever give him a chance to do that and ruths face showed her solicitude  there is one thing you have to remember ruth and that is the writer of an anonymous letter is generally a coward jack answered as lightly as he could more to ease her feelings than anything else so dont you worry about this letter have you mentioned it to any of the others  no i didnt want to worry them  im glad you didnt say anything to martha and mary i know it would upset them a good deal and maybe they would think theyd have to write to their mothers about it just keep it to yourself and please dont destroy that letter it might come in useful some time maybe we can trace the handwriting  but youll tell your cousins at the hall wont you  yes i think i had better so that they can be on their guard too we dont want to run any unnecessary chances when it comes to those rascals and there the talk on this subject came to an end  it was not until late that evening when the four rovers were retiring that jack got a chance to mention the anonymous letter to his cousins all were tremendously interested and speculated on who the writer could be  my opinion is it was either gabe werner or slugger brown said randy neither nappy martell nor bill glutts would have the nerve to do it  ill side with jack and say it was werner said fred  and ill side with my brother and say it was either slugger or werner added andy  two days later came word which filled the rover boys with joy it was announced that as the war in europe was at an end colonel colby might be expected home any day  hurrah that means that our folks will be coming home too before long cried fred throwing up his cap isnt this the best ever  maybe well get word from our fathers in a day or two returned andy anyway i hope so  my what a grand old time we ought to have when they do get home said randy his eyes glistening  well tear the woodpile down announced his twin and then turned a handspring just to ease his feelings  the talk among the cadets at the hall was now divided between the return of colonel colby and the baseball game with columbus academy in the meantime hixley high played a game with longley academy and lost by a score of 3 to 7  gee that doesnt look good to me announced gif soberly when the news came in all we could do this year was to hold them to that tie  that score would seem to prove that the longley nine is just about twice as good as the hixley nine remarked dan  i see by the score that tommy flanders struck out nine men he certainly must have been going some came from fred who was studying the score sheet with interest  yes and the longley fellows made two homeruns and three twobaggers put in spouter i must say they didnt do a thing to hixley high but punch holes into them  weve certainly got our work cut out for us announced jack and then went to practicing harder than ever  but if the score between longley and hixley had been a disappointment to the colby hall team there was quite a little comfort for them in the game with columbus academy the columbus boys did their level best to win and yet when the game came to an end colby hall was the victor by a score of 8 to 3  well that shows we are still in the running cried gif that evening those columbus fellows certainly put up a stiff game  they certainly did answered randy their pitcher wasnt such a wonder but their fielding was certainly great and they have some very good batsmen  yes and their shortstop is as good as you can find them added spouter  ive got one complaint to make about that game said ralph mason who was the major of the school battalion i dont know whether i ought to speak to you fellows about it or to captain dale  what is that major questioned gif quickly  it has to do with little henry stowell answered the young major seriously  oh i think i know what you mean cried ned lowe isnt it the way in which he was talking to some of those columbus players  it is was ralph masons reply then you heard it too did you  i heard a little i hoped to hear more but just then somebody came up and took me away  if it was about the ball game major i think i ought to know of it said gif  the trouble is gif i dont really know whether stowell meant anything by it or notor rather if he understood what he was doing he is so very innocent in some things i hate to accuse him of actual wrongdoing but one thing is certain those columbus academy fellows pumped him as much as they could about our players and especially about jack rovers style of pitching and they also asked a great number of questions about the two new players on the nine  codfish is a sneak and always was burst out dan soppinger oh i know you fellows feel inclined to stick up for him he added looking at the rovers and once in a while i feel sorry for him myself but just the same he isnt to be trusted  if youll excuse me for saying something major i dont think id take the matter to captain daleat least not just yet put in jack this conversation took place during the cadets off time and the young captain felt he could talk freely to his superior officer if we find that stowell really tried to injure us i guess we can take care of him and he smiled suggestively  all right well let it go at that answered ralph mason and then walked away satisfied in his own mind that he had said quite enough to the other boys  by careful inquiry it was ascertained that several other cadets had noticed stowell talking to some of the columbus students and had overheard some of the remarks all were of the opinion that the little cadet had told altogether too much although it was possible that he was innocent in the matter  we certainly ought to teach him some kind of a lesson remarked andy  i wonder where codfish is now questioned his twin quickly  i dont know but i think we can soon find out come onlet us look him up  hi what are you up to demanded jack feeling that something was in the air  oh let them go jack cried fred and then he added to the twins if its anything worth seeing let us know about it  we will called back andy gaily  the twins hunted around the school and at last found henry stowell in the gymnasium where he was sitting on a bench watching some other cadets going through their athletic exercises  if we can only manage to keep him here a while we might be able to fix up something in his room for him suggested randy  i guess that would be easy answered his twin there is walt baxter well get him to engage codfishs attention for a while  walt was called to one side and the situation explained to him he readily consented to see to it that stowell was kept from going up to his room for some time then the twins hurried off in the direction of the hall  we must teach him a lesson that he wont forget in a hurry remarked randy  right you are was his brothers reply  half an hour later the other rovers along with gif spouter and dan were coming up to their rooms when they were met at the head of the stairs by the twins  were all ready for codfish announced randy somewhat excitedly just wait until i go down to the gym and tip walt baxter off  walt and codfish are in the school library they just came over announced dan ned lowe is with them they were asking codfish a lot of fool questions in history as to when hannibal discovered the south pole and things like that  randy ran down and in a minute more was in the school library he caught walt baxters eye and nodded to let the other cadet know that everything was all right then walt did the same to ned  well im getting sleepy stowell said walt stretching himself i think ill go and hit the hay  ditto here came from ned  im real tired myself and id have gone to bed some time ago if you hadnt asked me so many questions answered henry stowell with a yawn  then you dont really know much about who discovered the south pole said ned seriously you see i want to put it in a composition im writing about cats  i dont see what cats have to do with the south pole said stowell innocently  oh thats easy codfish said walt cats like to climb poles and the south pole is the south pole isnt it and then he and ned walked off and joined randy and all hurried upstairs to the rovers rooms  as luck would have it henry stowell this term was occupying a room by himself it was a fairly large apartment and furnished with a single bed a chiffonier a table and several chairs in one corner was a closet in which he kept most of his clothing and also a handbag  well what have you done questioned fred as the twins appeared  we fixed it up so codfish is going to spend a real pleasant night answered andy with a grin  but what did you do came from jack  just you fellows wait and see walt will you go out and let us know when codfish comes up  i will answered walt baxter and hurried to a corner of the corridor where he might see without being seen  in less than five minutes he came back hurriedly with the information that stowell had just entered his room  all right then fellows come with me and maybe you will see or hear something worth while announced randy gleefully  how are we going to see anything when he shuts his door on us questioned dan  his window is right next to the platform of the new fireescape answered andy well go out on that and then maybe well see everything that goes on he always keeps a bright light in his room and always pulls down the shade but we fixed it so the shade will come down only so far leaving a crack that we can look through with ease  i hope you havent done anything to get us in bad with captain dale remarked jack  oh this isnt as bad as all that jack answered andy its just something to wake codfish up  led by the twins the other rovers and their chums hurried down the side corridor to where there was a red light and a sign fire escape then they threw open a window and in a moment more stood on the escape mentioned it was of steel fairly wide and ran along past several windows the second of which belonged to the room occupied by stowell  as they stepped out on the fire escape they saw a light flash up in the sneaks room and a few seconds later the window shade was pulled down  just as i told you andy exclaimed i knew the shade would come down and see there is the crack we mentioned now then line up under the window and well see what happens next     chapter viii  the joke on the sneak   the window of stowells room had been left open so the boys outside could hear as well as see what went on within they saw the sneak of the school yawn and stretch as if he was tired and then he lost no time in preparing to retire  in one of his pockets he carried a piece of cake and this he ate with satisfaction while undressing then when clad only in his pajamas he turned off the light and moved in the semidarkness toward the bed  now watch murmured andy somewhat excitedly  all outside did so ranging their heads close together at the open slit of the window they heard stowell throw back the covers of the bed and then sit down an instant later came a cry of surprise  whats this oh dear me something is in the bed  the sneak of the school bounced to his feet so hurriedly that he tipped over a chair standing alongside of the bed and pitched forward headlong to the floor  hi leave me alone get away from me scat they heard him ejaculate and then give a little squeal of terror as he scrambled once more to his feet then they heard him rush to the side of the room and once more make a light  as the rays filled the apartment those outside saw something of what had taken place not less than half a dozen mice were doing their best to hide themselves here and there under the bed and the chiffonier and in the corners of the room one or two scampered directly past stowell who set up another squeal of alarm and then leaped up on the nearest chair  hes enjoying it all right murmured randy  shut up came promptly from fred if he sees us well have to dust for it  but the eyes of the sneak were not turned toward the window he was looking only at the mice two of which were still scampering across the floor trying to find some hole of escape  somebodys been playing a trick on me murmured stowell to himself just wait till i find out who did it ill fix him  he remained standing on the chair not caring to venture on the floor in his bare feet and with the mice still at liberty he had placed his shoes under the head of the bed  ive got to clear them out somehow he muttered to himself but i guess id better put my shoes on first then ill get that baseball bat in the closet and do it  with extreme caution codfish descended from the chair and walked hurriedly across the floor to the head of his bed he drew forth the shoes and started quickly to put them on  his toes were just going down into one of the shoes when he let out a yell which would have done credit to a wild indian one of the mice had found refuge in the footwear and now it gave a bound and scrambled up inside the leg of stowells pajamas  hi get out of there help murder take that beast away oh my hell bite me sure ouch hes bit me already and then the sneak of the school began to dance around wildly in the meantime clutching savagely in the region of the knee where the mouse had found lodgement caught the little animal had nipped codfish in the finger  gee this is the richest yet chuckled walt baxter  better than a moving picture was gifs comment  hell wake the whole school if he makes much more noise remarked jack be prepared to skip out when the time comes  ill have somebody arrested for this howled codfish as he still struggled with the mouse that was up his leg this is beastly oh dear what in the world shall i do  he gave a savage tug at his pajamas and the next instant there was a tearing sound and the cloth parted at the knee out leaped the mouse to disappear quickly under the bed  panting from his excitement and muttering to himself the sneak of the school making sure that the shoes were now both empty slipped his feet into them and then hurried toward the clothing closet located in a corner he intended to get a baseball bat with which to either kill the mice or chase them out into the hallway  now watch whispered randy here is where he gets another surprise  stowell flung open the door of the closet in a hurry as he did this he found himself confronted by the figure of a colby hall cadet the intruder had a handkerchief tied over his face  hi what are you doing here cried stowell in sudden surprise youre the fellow whos playing the trick on me eh ill fix you you see if i dont and then struck by a sudden idea stowell slammed shut the door of the closet and locked it now ive got you and youll suffer for this nonsenseyou see if you dont he shouted  gee this is the best yet burst out andy in a low voice i didnt think hed lock that dummy in  we only put it there to scare him explained randy its one of his old suits stuffed out we thought it might fall out on him when he opened the door but i guess its better the way it is he chuckled  where did you get those mice gif questioned  oh that was easy answered andy i met pud hicks the janitors assistant this noon and he was telling me of a whole lot of mice he had caught down in the barn during the past week he had the bunch in a box and he said he was going to take them down to the river and drown them i knew where the box was and getting them was easy  by this time codfish had slipped into his trousers and now he put on his coat  hes going downstairs to tell captain dale or one of the professors exclaimed jack in a low voice we had better get out of here  the young captains advice was followed and all lost no time in leaving the fire escape and entering the school building they were just in time to see the door to stowells room flung open and the sneak hurry downstairs  i must see what he does cried randy who could never let any portion of a joke get away from him and he hurried down the stairs after stowell  captain mapes dale was in the office of the school writing a letter when stowell burst in upon him with scant ceremony  oh captain dale wont you please come quick cried the little sneak all out of breath with excitement somebody put about a million mice in my room and ive got the fellow locked up in my clothescloset  a million mice in your room stowell exclaimed the captain leaping to his feet surely you must be mistaken you dont mean quite that many and a faint smile crossed his features  well there are a whole lot of them anyway returned codfish when i opened my bed they leaped right out at me and they ran all over the floor and then one of them went up the leg of my pajamas and bit me see how i had to tear my pajamas to get him out and he showed the spot  and you say you have the culprit locked up in your closet demanded captain dale  yes sir wont you please come up and see who it is before he has a chance to break out of course hell try to get away if he can he wont want to be caught  yes ill go up immediately are the mice up there still  yes sir i shut the door on them so they couldnt get away  then i had better call the janitor and his assistant first so that we can round up the million mice more or less  fortunately pud hicks was not around the building so could not be summoned but job plunger the school janitor was at hand and so was bob nixon the school chauffeur  i guess i know where those mice came from said nixon with a grin hicks caught a lot of them down at the barn he was going to drown em down at the river tomorrow somebody must have got hold of em and put em in stowells room  nixon and plunger followed captain dale and stowell to the cadets room in the meanwhile randy had rejoined the other rovers and their chums and likewise rapped on half a dozen doors as he passed and as a consequence fully a score of cadets were made aware that something unusual was happening  whats the row  is it a fire  are they going to celebrate the victory over columbus academy  if anything good to eat is being passed around count me in  codfish is holding a celebration cried andy from around a corner and in a disguised voice everybody watch for something good from codfishs room  the appearance of captain dale with stowell only whetted the curiosity of the assembled students and from halfclosed doors they watched the head of the school and the little sneak approach the room the door was left open and a moment later out popped one mouse quickly followed by another  hello theres a mouse  hi catch those fellows yelled bob nixon who was on hand with a trap followed by job plunger with a box  the school janitor was quite deaf and so could hear nothing of what was going on  the escape of the two mice was a signal for the assembling students to begin a chase after the rodents then another mouse came out into the hallway and various things were thrown at the scurrying animal  here here stop that noise out there commanded captain dale there is no sense in making such a racket over a few little mice  as he spoke the head of the school strode to the closet door and unlocked it  now come out here and give an account of yourself he said as he threw the door open  now you are going to catch it for playing such a trick on me exulted codfish  the figure in the closet of course did not move and captain dale reached forth to pull the offending cadet into the room but then he stopped short and something of a smile crossed his face  what is the matter with you stowellare you blind he demanded  blind queried the sneak of the school bewildered what do you mean  cant you see that this is only a stuffed figure and it hasnt any head on either only a handkerchief tied around some underwear with a cap stuck on top  oh captain dale you dont mean it cried codfish and fell back against the wall too upset to say more  but i do mean it went on the military man and reached for the dummy which immediately toppled over on the floor the head and cap rolling in one direction and the legs and shoes in another its nothing but an old uniform stuffed out  wheres them mice cried job plunger in a shrill voice wheres them mice i say  youll have to find them plunger answered captain dale  behind em remarked the deaf janitor behind where  i did not say behind anything shouted the captain i said youd have to find them  oh well ill find em if theyre in the room said plunger  by this time the noise and excitement had increased so that nearly half of the school was out in the corridor in front of stowells room they saw the remains of the stuffed figure on the floor and many quickly surmised that a joke had been played  what is codfish doing with that dummy  has he been using it for an imitation hun to shoot at  maybe hes going to join the football team next fall and wants to practice up  has he been taming mice on the sly  gee i dont want to stay in a place where a fellow keeps mice in his room  in the midst of this talk the janitor and the chauffeur did what they could to round up the escaped mice they managed to capture two of the rodents and kill two others and that was all that could be found  if there were any more the rest must have gotten away remarked bob nixon  this is simply a practical joke announced captain dale after a few more words with stowell have you any idea who played it  i dont know exactly sir but i think maybe i can find out answered the sneak he felt much subdued especially as he saw the eyes of many of the other cadets on him  well you go to bed now and ill take this matter up tomorrow morning said captain dale boys i want you all to retire and at once he went on with a wave of his hand to those outside and then the cadets dispersed to their rooms     chapter ix  the game with longley   i guess that will hold codfish for a while remarked randy when the rovers were once more by themselves in their rooms and the excitement had died away  ill have to make it a point to see pud hicks the first thing in the morning returned his twin pud might tell somebody that he showed those mice to me  yes youd better do that by all means put in jack  and another thing you ought to do is to let codfish know why this trick was played on him came from fred otherwise it will be a good effort thrown away and he grinned  ill leave a note under his door said randy and a little later scribbled out the following on a card       this is what you get codfish for giving information to our      baseball rivals be careful in the future to keep your mouth shut       the avengers  i reckon that will hold him for a while said randy and before going to bed he slipped out into the corridor and placed the card under stowells door  early in the morning andy saw the assistant janitor and easily arranged for pud hicks to say nothing about the mice  why over a dozen of the cadets saw those mice said hicks so they cant blame any of this on you and it may be mentioned here that the investigation which followed came to nought  two days later andy burst in on the others like a whirlwind his face glowing with excitement  come on downstairs everybody he called out colonel colby has just arrived come on and ask him what he can tell us about our fathers  at this announcement there was a general stampede all of the others dropped the textbooks they had been studying and made a simultaneous rush for the corridor and the stairs down pellmell went the whole crowd to join a group of cadets in the lower hall everyone of whom was doing his best to shake colonel colbys hand first  the owner of the school was dressed in his uniform as a united states officer and looked taller and more bronzed than ever his face wore a broad smile and he gave each of his pupils a hearty handshake  oh colonel we are so glad to see you back cried jack with genuine pleasure as he wrung the officers hand and i hope you have good news of my father and my uncles  i am as glad to see you as you are to see me captain rover returned colonel colby and it is a genuine pleasure to get back to this school after having endured such arduous days in france  and what about our folks added fred as he too came in for a handshake  when our troopship left france your folks were expecting to follow in about ten days or two weeks most likely they are already on the way  and they were well asked randy anxiously  quite well of course you know that your father and your uncle sam were wounded by some flying shells and that your uncle dick suffered from a gas attack but they are all recovering rapidly and i dont doubt but what they will soon be as well as ever  somebody said that dad had won a medal of honor said jack his eyes lighting up with expectancy  it is true he did win such a medal and he deserved it probably he will give you all the particulars when he arrives  that was all colonel colby could say at the time because many others wanted to shake his hand from captain dale down through all the teachers and the cadets to the school janitor and even the women working in the kitchen and the men in the stables he had been on good terms with all his hired help and now they showed a real affection for him which touched his heart deeply  just think of it our fathers may be back in ten days exclaimed andy isnt it the best ever and he commenced to dance a jig just to let off steam  the boys lost no time in telephoning to the girls and it may be imagined that martha and mary were indeed glad to hear the news  the next day just as the session was closing the rovers were informed that a man and a boy were out on the campus waiting to see them they hurried out and found themselves confronted by john franklin and his son phil  ive been promising myself right along that id come and see you fellows said john franklin but somehow i couldnt get around to it but now that my son and i are going back to texas i felt id have at least to say goodbye and thank you once again for what you fellows did for us  and as my father wasnt able to reward you i thought maybe you wouldnt mind if i made each of you something out of wood with my jackknife put in phil franklin somewhat awkwardly you know handling a jackknife is one of my specialties he added with a grin so please accept these with our compliments you can divide them up to suit yourselves  he handed over a package done up in a newspaper and unfolding this the rovers found four articles carved out of hard wood one was an inkstand another a miniature canoe a third an elaborate napkin ring and the fourth a tray for holding pins and collar buttons  why those are real fine phil said jack as he looked the articles over  you dont mean to say you did all of this work with a knife questioned andy admiringly  every bit of it was the reply  they are beautiful was randys comment after an inspection  better than you could buy in the stores added fred  im pleased to know that you like my sons handiwork said john franklin  they are real good said jack but we dont feel like taking these things without giving you something in return he added hastily  oh thats all right cried phil franklin youve done enough for us already you keep the things and dont say anything more about it  and so youre really going back to texas questioned fred after the presents had been inspected again  yes were going to start tomorrow noon answered john franklin ive got a little money together now and im going back to see if i cant put a crimp in those oilwell sharpers who did me out of my farm  well i certainly hope you get the best of those fellows if they swindled you said randy heartily  the conversation lasted half an hour longer and during that time randy and jack excused themselves and slipped off to their rooms when they came back they had a small package containing two of their best story books  here are a couple of books which perhaps youll like to read on the trains said jack we want you to accept them with the compliments of all of us  oh story books and phil franklins eyes lit up with pleasure i love to read are you sure you can spare them and when they said they could he continued that suits me immensely  a little later father and son took their departure  pretty nice people was jacks comment i certainly hope they get their rights  this meeting took place on the day when longley academy played columbus academy the cadets remembering the score between hixley high and longley were very anxious to know how the columbus team would fare against the new school  well longley wins again exclaimed ned lowe who came in with the news  what was the score questioned gif with much interest  eleven to two  you dont mean it cried spouter why thats worse than the game they took from hixley high  one thing is certain the longley team knows how to play said jack decidedly we may not like tommy flanders and his bunch but just the same youve got to hand it to em for knowing how to put it across  it looks to me as if we might be in for a defeat remarked another cadet  defeat dont talk that way leeds stormed gif colby hall is going to win  well i hope so but im afraid youll be disappointed answered leeds he was a new pupil and was of a decidedly pessimistic turn of mind  the victories of longley over hixley and columbus served one good purpose it caused gif to call his team together and read them a stern lecture  we are evidently up against a bunch of real ball players said the captain weve got to buckle down in this contest and do our very best and then some i want every man to practice all he can from now on and when the time comes i want every man to play the game with all the brains and all the nerve that are in him  longley academy being devoted as mentioned before very largely to physical culture and athletics had an extra fine baseball grounds with a beautiful new grandstand and bleachers the new school was anxious to show off these grounds and so had insisted that the game be played there and this had been agreed to after it was announced that one half of the stands should be set aside for the cadets of colby hall and their friends  it had been noised about that this game was to be for blood so that when the time came for the contest the grounds were overflowing with people everybody from colby hall and longley was there and in addition quite a respectable crowd from hixley columbus and from clearwater hall there was also a scattering of people from the town and the surrounding districts  oh jack arent you nervous questioned martha when he met the girls from clearwater  if i am im not going to show it he replied to his sister  jack im going to root harder than i ever did in my life said ruth as she held up a banner marked colby hall and another marked clearwater hall  were all going to root declared may powell  the stands were speedily filled to overflowing and there was a large crowd assembled behind the foul line on either side of the diamond there was a loud cheering when the colby hall nine appeared and a like cheer when the longley players put in an appearance  hurrah for colby hall  three cheers for longley academy  here is where the cadets walk off with another one  not much here is where longley snows you under  and so the gibes and comments ran on while every once in a while wild cheering rang out mingled with the noise of horns and rattles  the tossup sent longley to the bat first and with a cheer from his friends jack took the ball and walked down to the box  now then fellows swat it good and plenty cried tommy flanders we want about half a dozen runs the first inning  he doesnt want much murmured fred  the first man up was a heavy hitter named durrick he had one strike and two balls called and then sent a low one to left field which gave him first base with ease  hurrah boys keep it agoing cried tommy flanders dancing around joyously  the second man up knocked two fouls and then a short fly to third but then came another safe hit to right field which took the batter to first while the other runner gained third  take it easy old man cautioned gif as he came up to speak to jack dont let them rattle you  they are not going to rattle me answered jack sturdily  he gritted his teeth and then sent in three swift balls so quickly that the next batsman was taken completely by surprise and was declared out almost before he knew it  thats the stuff colby two out hold em down  knock it out bring durrick in  the next player up was a tall lanky chap named wilks he swung savagely at the sphere as if intending to knock it over the back fence  if he ever connects with it it will be a homer with three runs in thought gif  two strikes were called and then three balls then jack took a sudden brace and sent in a swift high one wilks leaped for it and the crack of the bat could be heard all over the grounds  it looked like a safe hit to center field but as the crack of the bat sounded on the air jack rover was seen to leap high up with hand outstretched the next instant he came down with the sphere safe within his grasp  illustration jack rover leaped high up and caught the ball  fly ball batter out  longley academy had played its first inning without scoring     chapter x  a glorious victory   good for jack rover  that was some stop all right  maybe it didnt sting his hand  so the cries ran on and when the colby hall nine came in from the field the young pitcher was wildly applauded  in the meantime however gif ran to him anxiously  it was the best ever jack but did it hurt your handi mean enough to stop your pitching  its not going to stop my pitching gif answered the young pitcher his hand stung as if burnt by fire but he was not going to admit it  oh wasnt that a glorious play burst out ruth stevenson and her glowing face showed her pleasure  i hope jack wasnt hurt answered the young captains sister solicitously  there was another cheering when dan soppinger stepped to the plate with his bat in hand dan had two strikes called on him and then sent a fly to left field which was gathered in with ease  one out keep it up longley  dont let em see first  gif was the next player up and by hard work he managed to rap out a single between short and second which carried him to first in safety but the next two players failed to connect with the sphere and the goose egg went up on the board for the cadets  after that there was a good deal of seesawing for four innings and without any results so far as scoring was concerned longley made four hits and so did the colby boys but no runner got further than second base  of course the catching of the redhot liner had done jacks pitching hand no good it was a little swollen in the palm and this prevented the fingers from working quite as freely as would otherwise have been the case  now listen jack said gif taking him to one side after jack had pitched through the fifth inning if your hand hurts you say so and ill put another fellow in the box  never mind my hand gif as long as i can treat them to goose eggs answered the young pitcher  but i dont want you to ruin your hand  thats all right when i feel i cant do any more pitching ill let you know  in the sixth inning there came a break but this could not be called jacks fault the first longley player up a chap named mason managed to dribble the ball toward third and before either the baseman or the shortstop could send it over he had reached first then on a wild throw to second the runner not only covered that bag but went on and slid in to third  now weve got em agoing fellows was the longley yell  right you are  nobody out and a man on third this is the time we wipe up the diamond with them everybody on the job  the next player went out on a pop fly then came tommy flanders who did his best to line out a single this was stopped by the second baseman who however threw the ball to the home plate thus cutting off the possibility of a run  hurrah two men on base and only one out  here is where longley does some big scoring  jack are you sure you can hold em gif questioned anxiously as he came up to the pitcher  ill do it or die in the attempt was the answer and jack gritted his teeth  it was certainly a trying situation but the young pitcher refused to allow his nerves to get the better of him he gave a signal to the backstop and then sent in an outcurve which the batter swung at in vain then he sent in a straight ball following this by another outcurve and almost before he knew it the batter was struck out  hurrah came from spouter powell thats the way to do it two men out now for the third man  the longley player to come up was one of their best batsmen and jack realized that to give him anything like a good ball to hit would be fatal so he fed the man nothing but those which were high and wide as a consequence the fellow had two strikes called on him and four balls and took his base moving flanders to second  hurrah three men on base was the longley yell now then simmons bring em all in  simmons came forward with a doordie expression on his face he had one strike called on him and then knocked a low one toward centerfield at once he started for first while the fellow on third dashed forward for the home plate the ball was gathered in as quickly as possible and the runner from first to second was put out but the runner from third had come in just before  hurrah thats one run anyhow shouted the longley supporters  i told you we could do it said tommy flanders he was glad of the run yet tremendously chagrined to think that he had not been permitted to score  now weve got to tie that score or better said gif when the colby hall boys came to the bat  all of those who came up including fred and jack did their best but were unable to get further than first or second  hurrah thats the stuff cried pete stevens let us hold em down to a whitewash  sure ill hold em down boasted tommy flanders not a one of em are going to see the home plate off of me today  hell certainly win the game if conceit can do it murmured ned lowe in disgust  it must be admitted that so far tommy flanders had done wonderfully well but there were signs that he was overdoing it by pitching too hard  i think hell break before the game is over said dan  just my opinion returned walt baxter no young pitcher can stand up under such a strain as that  the break they had looked for came in the eighth inning by a supreme effort longley managed on a fumble by one of the new players for colby hall to bring in another run at which the cheering on their side was tremendous  thats the stuff two to nothing wallop em good and plenty longley  well wallop em all right enough exulted tommy flanders they are going to get the worst whitewashing they ever hadyou mark my words  alas for the conceited young pitcher his overconfidence made him a trifle wild and almost before he realized it the first colby hall batter had got a safe hit to first and the second man up went to first on balls advancing the other to second  tighten up there tommy tighten up called out one of the longley sympathizers  ill tighten up all right enough answered flanders with a scowl  the next player up got another single the ball being fumbled by the fielder and as a consequence the bases were filled  be careful tommy cautioned the longley captain as he came up to the pitcher be careful we dont want to spoil the score  they wont get in you just watch me and see answered flanders and scowled more than ever  he did tighten up a little and as a consequence the next batter up went out on strikes and the following player on a foul fly  hurrah two out hold em down dont let em score  the next batter up was fred so far the youngest rover had been unable to get further than first  oh fred line it out please line it out cried may powell and then she blushed furiously as a number sitting near her began to laugh  dont you care may consoled mary and then she called out loudly do your best fred do your best  go in and win cried martha  there had been a tremendous racket but now as fred gripped his ashen stick and tommy flanders prepared to deliver the ball a deathlike silence came over the field every one of the men on the bases was prepared to leg it at the slightest chance of being able to score  the first ball to come in was too high and the second too low so fred let them go by then however came a straight ball just where he wanted it and fred swung at it with every ounce of muscle in his body  crack the report could be heard all over the grounds and then the sphere could be seen sailing far off into left field  run boys run everybody run  leg it for all you are worth  its a threebagger sure  no it isnt its a homer run boys run run run  the crowd was now on its feet yelling and cheering at the top of its lungs and throwing caps and banners into the air and while the left fielder was chasing madly after the bounding ball the three men on bases came in one after another followed swiftly by the panting and blowing rover boy  hi hi hi what do you know about that four runs  thats the way to do it colby keep it up  youve got the longley pitcher going cried spouter at the top of his lungs give us a few more home runs theyll be easy  take flanders out said one of the academy boys in disgust hes beginning to weaken  while the din and excitement continued the academy captain went up to talk to the pitcher  dont you think we had better make a change tommy he questioned anxiously  no i dont roared flanders angrily that home run was a fluke thats all ill hold em down you wait and see  there were wild cries to change the pitcher on the part of the longley students while the military academy cadets yelled themselves hoarse telling their nine to bat flanders out of the box  walt baxter was now up and managed to get to second then came jack with a single that took him safely to first and advanced walt to third  say tommy youd better give it up whispered the longley captain as he came to the box  ill hold em just give me one chance more answered flanders desperately  and then came the real break the next player up got what would have been a twobase hit but the ball was fumbled and as a consequence the man got home chasing the other two runners in ahead of him  hurrah what do you know about that seven runs  thats the way to do it hurrah for colby hall  youve got em agoing boys give it to em good and plenty  the excitement was now greater than ever and all including the girls from clearwater hall were shouting themselves hoarse tooting tin horns shaking rattles and throwing caps and other things into the air  take him out take flanders out  out with flanders out with him  he should have been taken out before  all rightfinish the game without me roared tommy flanders in disgust and throwing down the ball he strode from the field and into one of the dressingrooms  gee but hes sore was randys comment  that ought to take some of the conceit out of him added andy  the new pitcher was a lefthander who had rather a puzzling delivery and he managed to retire the side without any more runs so that at the end of the eighth inning the score stood 7 to 2 in favor of colby hall  now then pull yourselves together ordered the longley captain when his side came up to the bat for the last time  all of those who came to the plate did their best but jack was on his mettle and though his swollen hand hurt him not a little he played with all the coolness strength and ingenuity which he possessed as a consequence although he allowed two single hits none of the longley boys got further than third  hurrah colby hall wins  and then what a celebration ensued among the cadets who had won the game and their many supporters     chapter xi  bonfire night   such a glorious baseball victory as this could not be passed off lightly by the cadets of colby hall they arranged for a grand celebration that night with bonfires along the river front and a generous collation served in the gymnasium they were allowed to invite a few of their boy friends and all made the most of it  its a pity we cant have you girls said jack when they were parting with ruth and the others  never mind jack im happy to think that you won the game answered the girl  yes and were extra happy to think that you got the best of that awfully conceited tommy flanders added may  late in the evening the boys cut loose to their hearts content neither colonel colby nor captain dale having a mind to stop them  there were only two boys in the school who did not appreciate the celebration one was stowell who was caught by some of his tormentors and dusted from head to foot with flour and leeds who had been so pessimistic regarding the school winning leeds had said altogether too much and as a consequence a big fools cap was placed on his head and he was marched around the campus riding on a rail and then dumped unceremoniously into the river  and dont you dare swim out until you promise after this to believe in colby hall and root for her first last and all the time shouted one of the cadets on the shore  all right ill promise ill promise anything spluttered leeds only let me get out of this and then he climbed up the river bank and dripping with water made a wild rush for the back entrance to the school  of course there was a good deal more of horseplay and it can be surmised that andy and randy went in for their full share of it even job plunger was caught by the crowd and hoisted on the top of a barrel which was waiting to be placed on one of the bonfires  speech shout speech cried andy gaily  tell us what you know about ball playing in the olden times suggested ned lowe  you let me down off of this barrel cried plunger in alarm you let me down before this barrel caves in and poor shout as he was so often called looked anything but comfortable as he balanced himself on the top of the barrel  weve got to have a speech shout come on you know you are a firstclass talker when you get at it  what is it you boys want demanded the janitor with his hand over his ear  give us a speech a speech  teach i never did teach what are you talking about  we didnt say teach screamed andy we said speechtalkwordssentencesspeech  oh you want me to make a speech and plunger looked rather vacantly at the crowd i cant do it i aint got nothing to say i want you to let me go ive got a lot of work to do with cleaning up that mess in the gym not to say anything about the mess you fellers made down to the barn getting that stuff out for them fires  if he wont give us a speech let us give him a ride cried dan soppinger  what shall we ride him in questioned walt baxter  ive got it burst out andy quickly just keep him here a few minutes longer fellows come on randy quick  sure that something was in the wind randy followed his brother out of the crowd and both made their way toward the back end of the gymnasium here there was a room in which si crews the gymnastic instructor kept a number of his personal belongings si had been the instructor since colby hall had been opened and his wife was the matron for the smaller boys  mrs crews has a baby carriage belonging to her sister stored away in that room explained andy as he and his brother hurried on i saw them put it there only a few days ago its a rather old affair but i think it is strong enough to give shout a ride in  the lads found the door to the storeroom unlocked and by lighting a match saw the baby carriage standing there just as left by mrs crews it contained a pillow and also a baby shawl and a cap  hurrah now well be able to dress shout up for the ride said randy gaily  it took but a few minutes to haul the baby carriage out and start it on its way down to where the crowd surrounded the school janitor a shout of satisfaction went up when the other cadets saw the little vehicle and another shout arose when andy picked up the shawl and randy followed with the baby cap  here you are shout came from walt baxter now well be able to dress you up fine for your ride and before the astonished and bewildered janitor could resist he was hoisted from the barrel and placed in the baby carriage where the lads proceeded not only to strap him in but also to tie him down with a bit of clothesline which was handy then they tied the baby cap on his head and pinned the shawl around his shoulders  music music for the procession called out fatty hendry somebody got a drum and fife and immediately several of the cadets ran off to do as bidden  in a few minutes more the procession started headed by two boys carrying torches and followed by a youth with a bass drum and another with a fife back of them came the baby carriage drawn by a full dozen of cadets and steered in the rear by andy and randy on each side of the carriage marched a cadet with a torch so that the curious turnout might be properly illuminated in the rear was a motley collection laughing and joking and cutting up generally  hi you you let me go i dont want no ride cried plunger wildly this aint no way to treat me at all  oh you need the air shout answered randy besides see the shoeleather you are going to save by getting a ride instead of walking  the poor janitor struggled to free himself but all in vain and to the noise of the drum and the fife and with many shouts of laughter the whole outfit moved around the school twice and then around the gymnasium  and now for a final celebration exclaimed randy when the crowd came to a halt near the river front everybody attention onetwothree listen to the stillness  wondering what was going to happen next all came to a standstill and listened  bang  a large firecracker set off directly under the baby carriage flew in all directions as it went off poor plunger gave a shriek of terror and then tried so hard to free himself that the carriage was overturned and he found himself snarled up in a bunch on the grass then the boys not wishing to see the man hurt rushed forward and released him and he lost no time in disappearing inside the gymnasium  hurrah that was a grand finale cried fred where did you get the firecracker andy  it was out of a bunch i bought for the fourth of july was the reply  after this celebration matters moved along swiftly toward the close of the term during that time the rover boys heard from their mothers in new york that their fathers were expected home in about ten days they immediately called up the girls at clearwater hall and learned that mary and martha had received the same news  and wont i be glad to go home and see dad said martha to her brother  no more glad than ill be he returned quickly  it was now early summer and many of the cadets were in the habit of spending a part of their off time either bathing or rowing before going to war colonel colby had promised to get two motorboats for the use of the cadets but as yet these had not been purchased but rowboats were numerous  ill have the motorboats here by fall however said colonel colby in speaking of this and then you can have a lot of fun with them  there was one more saturday to be spent at school before breaking up for the term and the rovers and their chums had decided to spend that afternoon with the girls in an outing on the lake  mary and some of the others want to go over to bluebell island said fred they say there are some very fine ferns to be had there and they thought maybe they would have a chance to take some of the ferns home  all right well take them wherever they want to go answered jack and so it was arranged  bluebell island was located a distance down the lake not far from foxtail island where the young folks had previously had an outing as related in the volume entitled the rover boys at colby hall  at that time a squall on the lake and an encounter with a log raft had placed all of the young people in great peril from which slugger brown and nappy martell had refused to rescue them  it had been decided that the boys should row from colby hall down the lake to the dock at clearwater hall and there take the girls on board they had three boats one containing jack and fred another the twins and a third gif and spouter  its certainly one grand day for this outing remarked fred as they set off all were good oarsmen so the rowboats made rapid progress in the direction of the girls school  i had the day made to order sang out andy and then he added with a grin it never rains when i go out unless the water happens to be coming down  the cadets had informed martha and the others when they would arrive and when they reached the dock they found six girls waiting for them each with a carefullytiedup shoebox under her arm  yum yum i smell something good to eat exclaimed andy on catching sight of the boxes  got any mustard pie added randy excuse me i mean custard pie  no weve got straw pie for you mr smarty called out alice strobell  jack noticed that martha and mary looked rather thoughtful when they got into the rowboat manned by spouter and gif  anything wrong he asked anxiously  not much jack answered his sister ill tell you just as soon as we get to the island and we have a chance  didnt you boys bring anything questioned mary of the other rovers  sure we did but thats a surprise answered fred they had brought fruit and candy  we brought two yeast cakes and a friedonion sandwich broke in andy gaily and at this all the girls giggled  ruth and may were made comfortable in the boat rowed by jack and fred and they at once set off in the direction of bluebell island the others shortly followed and all made good time across the placid bosom of clearwater lake  i hope we dont encounter such a squall as we did before remarked ruth presently  oh im sure it will stay clear jack hastened to reassure her  in less than half an hour the young folks found themselves safe on the island which was about thirty acres in extent with a grassy slope on one side and rocks trees and brushwood on the other they tied their boats securely and then proceeded to walk across the island to where they might take it easy under the trees or hunt for the ferns the girls desired to get  now then what is it that is troubling you asked jack of his sister as soon as he could speak to martha without the others noticing  oh jack i dont know whether it ought to trouble me or not answered martha it was such a surprise i didnt dream that those two fellows would show themselves around clearwater hall  who are you talking about martha  bill glutts and gabe werner  when did you see them  i saw them yesterday and mary saw them early this morning     chapter xii  on bluebell island   jack rover was much surprised over the statement made by his sister martha bill glutts had not returned to colby hall after his unfortunate experiences in the woods the winter previous nor had gabe werner shown himself in the vicinity of the military academy  have you any idea what they were doing around clearwater hall he questioned  i have not jack but i feel sure they were not up to anything good  did they say anything to either of you  oh no as soon as i saw them they sprang out of sight behind some trees and this morning when they caught sight of mary they hurried off in the direction of haven point  i think i had better tell the others about this then we can all be on our guard those fellows do not belong anywhere near haven point and in my opinion they cannot be here for any good purpose jack was thinking of the anonymous letter which had been received and which he now felt certain had been penned by werner  if you tell the others now it will spoil the whole outing pouted martha why dont you wait until tonight  all right ill do that and when you girls are by yourselves you and mary must tell the others and so it was agreed  those ahead had already reached the vicinity of the rocks and trees and now began a diligent hunt by all for the rare ferns said to be growing there  our idea was to empty the lunch from the shoeboxes and then fill the boxes with ferns said ruth  the girls had brought a tablecloth with them to spread on the ground and the entire lunch was placed in this and then wrapped in a newspaper and placed on a flat rock  i wonder if the squirrels will bother the lunch questioned fred they had noted several of the frisky little animals flitting from tree to tree as they walked along  the squirrels want nuts i dont think they care for mustard sandwiches and onion cake cried andy gee but it feels good to be out here he went on and leaping up he grasped the limb of a lowgrowing tree and went through the performance generally known as skinning the cat  oh andy do be careful called out his cousin mary first thing you know youll twist your arms off  oh i do this every morning before i wake up answered the funloving rover cheerfully  ill get him down cried randy and taking up a handful of dead leaves he threw them at his twin andy promptly gave a swing let go of the tree and landed on his brothers shoulders and both went down to the ground there to roll over and over kicking the dead leaves in all directions  hi you cried jack sternly what sort of a ladies exhibition is this get up there before i yank you up  youll have those beautiful suits ruined came from annie larkins  the search for the rare ferns then began in earnest and this led them through the woods and around a great number of sharp rocks and a considerable distance away from where the things to eat had been left  here is one called ruth presently and pointed it out  the girls had brought trowels with them and now jack lost no time in digging up the fern and placing it in the corner of one of the boxes several other plants were located nearby and all the boys and girls were soon busy some of the ferns were quite small but others were of good size and all showed up well when grouped together  we have a little fernery at home explained ruth last winter the plants did not do so well and these will therefore come in very nicely im sure my folks will be pleased to see them  i suppose uncle barney is now living with you ruth said jack  oh yes and he is very thankful for all you rovers did for him that winter answered the girl referring to the happenings which have been related in detail in the rover boys on snowshoe island  here is a different kind of fern announced martha a minute later  let me get it for you cried gif pressing forward to assist her  its right down there between those big rocks gif be careful that you dont push one of the stones over on your fingers  dont ruin the whole island getting up one fern gif exclaimed andy as the athletic student pushed away a couple of rocks which prevented his getting at the fern  there was another rock in the wayone that rested partly over the roots of the fern which looked like an unusually healthy plant gif tugged at this rock and fred bent forward to assist him then all of a sudden the rock came out from the split in which it lay and both cadets slipped and fell on their backs  oh do be careful youll have one of those rocks on your toes sure cried ruth  she had scarcely spoken when there came a scream from may powell and alice strobell  a snake a snake  hes coming for us  run run everybody before the snake bites you  such were some of the cries that rent the air as all of the young people fell back  a black snake at least three feet long had suddenly appeared from a hollow under the last rock to be dislodged and this was quickly followed by a second snake equally large  hit em boys hit em exclaimed jack as soon as he had recovered from his surprise and as he spoke he caught up a stone and flung it at the nearest snake  the action of the oldest rover boy was quickly seconded by the other cadets and a dozen or more stones were hurled at the two snakes one of the reptiles was quickly killed but the second received only a bruise on its tail and it switched around angrily and then made a dash toward the fleeing and screaming girls  gee if we only had a pistol or a gun exclaimed randy  the snake still left alive was but a few feet from martha and ruth when jack and spouter hurled two more stones each of these reached its mark and with its back crushed the reptile whipped around on the rocks for a moment more and then lay still  oh dear is it dead questioned martha and her voice trembled a little as she spoke  dead as a doormat announced her brother after a hasty examination then he took a stick and placing it under the reptile threw the remains from the rocks into the lake fred and andy speedily disposed of the other reptile in the same way  maybe there are more snakes around here cried alice strobell nervously  if there are im sure i dont want to stay here any longer added annie larkins  who would dream of digging up snakes on this island murmured martha oh it takes away all the fun of gathering ferns  nevertheless i am going to get that fern for you announced gif  but gif there may be more snakes around that hole  well ill take a chance i dont think they are very dangerous anyhow answered the athletic cadet  be on your guard gif warned jack and then armed himself with several stones and the other cadets did the same  gif approached the spot with caution and began to dig up the fern martha had wanted the other boys came quite close but the girls kept their distance no other snakes appeared and soon gif had the fern which he took pleasure in presenting to jacks sister  thank you gif she said politely it certainly is a beautiful fern and ill do my best to preserve it but i think every time i look at it ill remember those snakes  oh you mustnt mind anything like that martha why weve met dozens of little snakes on our tours i dont believe theyd hurt you  maybe not gif but theyre such awful crawly things  im afraid id die if a snake touched me added alice strobell with a shudder  for a while the snake episode put a damper on the outing but the boys did their best to make the girls forget it and after a while all were hunting as diligently as before for ferns they found a varied collection and took delight in filling the shoeboxes with the plants filling in the tops of the boxes with moss  oh my halfpast three already declared ruth presently as she consulted her pretty little wristwatch  as late as that returned martha  perhaps we had better go back and have our lunch suggested mary  all were willing for climbing around the rocks had made the young folks hungry mary and spouter led the way back with the others straggling behind  what are you going to do this summer jack questioned ruth on the way  we havent made any plans yet ruth i want to see my father first of all  i dont blame you for that you must be glad to think he is coming back safe and sound and just to think that he won a medal isnt it perfectly wonderful and her eyes beamed with pleasure  it sure is oh my dads a wonderful manthe best in the world answered the young captain enthusiastically and then he added have your folks decided to go down on the jersey shore  its about settled ill know for sure when i get home next week  you mustnt forget to write ruth  and how about yourself  oh youll hear from me dont worry about that answered jack quickly  if you go up to valley brook farm this summer began ruth when a sudden cry ahead made her pause what was that jack she asked quickly  i dont know but i guess something has gone wrong  maybe the squirrels or a fox or some other wild animal got at the lunch  phew that would be too bad come on and see what is wrong  the pair had fallen behind the others and now they ran forward through the woods and around the rocks as rapidly as they could as they did this there came a call from andy  hi there jack where are you look out for gabe werner and bill glutts dont let them get away  werner and glutts repeated the young captain what brought them to this island  catch them catch them came in a scream from martha they are making off with all our lunch  drop that stuff werner jack heard randy call out  come on after them everybody yelled gif they shant get away with those good thingsnot if i know it  there was a rush through the trees and the calls and cries increased the girls did not take part in the chase feeling that the two former bullies of colby hall might do them harm  oh dear jack do you really think that they made off with all that lunch sighed ruth  sounds like it he answered i wonder where they are he ran around some high rocks which cut off a view of what was beyond and then leaped over some low bushes not to be left alone in the woods ruth followed close at his heels  the next instant jack saw bill glutts running in one direction and gabe werner legging it in another bill glutts carried the tablecloth with a good portion of the things to eat still in it while gabe werner held the newspaper with the remaining things  stop ordered jack and then as he saw gif and randy chase glutts he made a wild dash after gabe werner     chapter xiii  werners attack   hold on bill glutts cried randy as he ran after the youth whom he had not seen since the winter before  you leave me alone returned glutts and then in order to run faster he dropped the bundle he was carrying  dont let him get away burst out fred and made a wild dash over some low bushes in gluttss direction in a moment more he had caught glutts by the arm  let go of me screamed the former cadet and in alarm he tried to push fred away but the youngest rover boy clung fast and then glutts aimed a blow with his fist at freds face  had the blow landed as intended it would have hurt severely but the youngest rover ducked and then hit glutts a stinging blow on the chin  by this time randy and gif were coming up and almost before he knew it bill glutts was surrounded gif caught the former bully of the hall by the shoulder  this is a nice way to act glutts he said sternly what business had you to touch our lunch  how did i know it belonged to you whined glutts much crestfallen over the sudden turn affairs had taken we found the stuff on the rocks  you cant play the innocent that way broke in randy you and gabe werner must have followed us to this island gee he added quickly where is werner  jack went after him answered fred and so did andy and spouter  we didnt follow you at all answered bill glutts we have as much right on this island as anybody we ran across that lunch by accident we didnt know that anybody was coming back to get it he added lamely  in the meanwhile jack was hurrying after gabe werner and strange as it may seem ruth followed close behind him at the same time calling to the others for help she remembered the anonymous note which had been delivered and she was afraid that gabe werner might try to do the young captain serious injury  gabe werner was legging it among the trees he was trying to reach the shore of bluebell island but became confused among the rocks and bushes and presently had to swing around in something of a semicircle and this soon brought him face to face with ruth  oh cried the girl in increased alarm dont you dare touch me gabe werner dont you dare  get out of my way roared the bully and then as he heard jack crashing through the brushwood directly behind him he brushed ruth rudely to one side  jack jack here he is the girl screamed  the young captain did not need to be told this for he saw gabe werner just ahead of him he made a flying leap forward and was barely able to catch werner by the tail of his coat  you cant get away you might as well give it up he said and as the bully kicked out savagely he caught werner by the foot and sent him headlong  oh jack jack do be careful cried ruth in increasing alarm and then she set up a call for assistance  im not afraid of gabe werner and he knows it answered the young captain  ill fix you for this roared werner i owe you a lot for the way youve been treating me and with these words he scrambled to his feet and aimed a blow at jacks face  the young captain moved to one side so that the blow struck him on the shoulder he came back quickly with one on werners right ear and followed this up with another on the bullys nose which made that organ bleed profusely  by this time there was more noise in the underbrush and andy and spouter could be heard calling  this way this way answered ruth  while she was calling and while andy and spouter were doing their best to brush aside some thorny bushes which held them back the struggle between jack and werner continued the bully landed on jacks shoulder again and then on his chest and in return received a crack on the chin which all but keeled him over  i said id get you jack rover and i will spluttered werner after this last attack and then as jack made a move as if to strike him again the bully stepped around to one side bringing himself once more close to ruth his right hand had gone down into his coat pocket and now he brought out something in a small paper bag  i said id fix you and this is how im going to do it look there if you dare called out werner and pointed to a tree limb just over their heads  fearing some trick jack gave only the faintest of glances upward but ruth more innocent gazed wideeyed at the limb pointed out as he spoke werner broke open the paper bag and hurled its contents forward  there take that jack rover he shouted triumphantly take that and see how you like it  it was a package of pepper which gabe werner had carried as it was thrown forward a small portion of it went in jacks face but the most of it was sent in a spray over the young captains shoulder and hit poor ruth  oh oh screamed the girl oh i am blinded he threw pepper in my eyes  you hound you exclaimed jack and even though his eyes smarted not a little from the few grains of pepper that had entered he managed to leap upon the bully and give him a swinging crack in the jaw but then werner threw the young captain backward over a rock and just as andy and spouter put in an appearance he dodged in among some heavy brushwood and quickly disappeared  what did he do demanded spouter  he threw something in our eyes ruth got the worst of it answered jack go on after him well have to attend to our eyes  jacks eyes were bad enough but ruths were much worse the girl could hardly keep from screaming with pain and jack was just then in no condition to assist her seeing this andy and spouter set up a yell for some of the others to go after werner and then did what they could to relieve the sufferers  come on down to the lake advised spouter i guess water will be about the best thing you can use anyhow you can wash out the pepper if there is any left  both cadets assisted ruth to the waters edge and jack stumbled after them here the eyes which had already begun to inflame were washed out carefully and then as ruth continued to complain of the pain they bound up her eyes with their handkerchiefs  i think mine will be all right after a while said jack they smart a little but thats all  dont you think ruth had better see a doctor suggested spouter  by all means well get back to town just as soon as we possibly can he can probably give her some sort of ointment that will relieve the pain and take away the inflammation  by this time the others were coming up the news that ruth had received a dose of pepper in her eyes excited everybody  gabe werner ought to be put in jail for this said martha  isnt it the most dreadful thing you ever heard of came from may  the excitement was so intense that for the time being the boys forgot all about bill glutts as a consequence when they turned to where they had left that unworthy glutts had disappeared  well he got a good beating anyhow said randy i think that will teach him to leave our stuff alone after this  at first some of the boys were inclined to make another hunt for werner and glutts they knew the bullies must have come to the island in some kind of a boat  if we can find their boat we can take it with us said spouter then they can either stay on the island or try to swim ashore  we cant waste any more time declared jack we must get ruth to a doctor and id like to see a doctor myself my eyes feel terribly scratchy  yes yes i want to see a doctor at once said ruth my eyes hurt dreadfully  some of the boys gathered up what was left of the lunch and all made their way to the waters edge where the rowboats had been left as they did this they heard the sudden putput of a motorboat and a few seconds later they saw the craft shoot out of a tiny cove at the upper end of the island and head for the eastern shore of clearwater lake  there they go there are glutts and werner exclaimed gif  and in a motorboat too added randy too bad if they were in a rowboat we might be able to catch them  oh let them go said mary hastily i am more worried about ruths eyes than anything else  were all worried about that answered her brother come on well get over to haven point just as fast as we can i only hope we find one of the doctors at home  they tumbled into the boats the girls leading ruth who still had her eyes bandaged  do you think you can row jack questioned fred  of course i can replied the young captain he was not going to admit that the injury to his eyes was making him feel sick all over  may sat beside ruth and did what she could for the sufferer all of the boys bent to their oars and a straight course was taken for the town  wouldnt it be dreadful if ruth was blinded for life remarked alice strobell on the way  oh alice dont suggest such a thing as that came from annie larkins in horror  well people have been blinded in that way more than once remarked randy it all depends on how bad a dose she got  jack said the pepper must have been intended for him came from andy i cant imagine that werner would be wicked enough to try to injure ruth that way  maybe he didnt intend to do it when he started returned his brother but when werner gets mad hes liable to do almost anything you know that as well as i do  thats true when he gets into a rage he goes almost insane  what an ending to our outing sighed alice  and we didnt eat a mouthful of the lunch added annie she had spent over an hour in fixing some fancy sandwiches  was that pepper from some you brought along questioned randy quickly  as far as i know we didnt bring any pepper along we had a saltcellar and thats all answered alice  then it must have been a deliberate attempt on werners part to blind jack cried andy oh what a pity we didnt catch him then we could have handed him over to the authorities  when the boys and girls reached one of the docks at haven point andy and randy ran on ahead and speedily procured a taxicab into this ruth and jack were hustled and then randy sitting beside the driver directed him to take the sufferers to the nearest doctor  at the first physicians house they learned that the doctor was away for the afternoon then they hurried to another part of the town and there found doctor borden an older man who had occasionally come to both the girls school and the military academy  pepper in your eyes is it possible said the old physician come into my office at once sometimes that sort of thing is very serious  you wait on the lady first doctor said jack she is by far the worse off  very well said the doctor come this way and he led ruth into his private office     chapter xiv  bound for home   while the doctor was attending ruth the others of the party arrived at the physicians residence they found jack walking up and down in the anteroom while randy sat in a chair doing what he could to comfort his cousin  what does the doctor say about ruth questioned may quickly  he hasnt come out yet they are in there and randy pointed with his hand to the inner office  oh jack how do your eyes feel questioned martha coming up and gazing earnestly at her brother  to tell the truth they dont feel very good martha he answered but i wont mind that so much if only ruth gets out of it  the boys and girls sat down some in the outer office and some on the piazza of the doctors residence they had to wait nearly a quarter of an hour before the door of the inner office opened  i think the young lady will feel much better by tomorrow said doctor borden as he led ruth forth he had placed a new and heavier bandage over her eyes ill call at the school to see her the first thing tomorrow morning you need do nothing to the eyes until that time he looked at the other girls i presume you young ladies are with miss stevenson  we are several of them answered  then there ought not to be any trouble about getting her back to the school in safety and the physician smiled faintly  ill get a taxicab said randy and lost no time in doing so  i dont want to go back to the school until jack has been taken care of declared ruth i want to know just how bad off he is the doctor tells me he doesnt think my eyes will be permanently injured she was trying to bear up bravely even though her eyes hurt her a good deal but what the doctor had put on them was gradually allaying the pain  jack entered the inner office and the doctor made a thorough examination of each eye  you were lucky to get off so well rover he announced at the conclusion of the examination ill give you a lotion to put on tonight before retiring and ill give you a treatment of it now then bathe the eyes again in the morning and i think in a day or two you will be as well as ever  and what about miss stevensons eyes questioned the young captain anxiously  i cant say very much about them as yet of course i didnt want to worry her so i did not tell her how bad it might be still ill know more about it tomorrow morning  this was as much as doctor borden would say jack received the treatment and was given a small bottle filled with the lotion and then after settling with the physician he was ready to leave  do you want any of us to go to the school with you he asked of ruth and the other girls  no jack it wont do any good answered the blindfolded girl and as he took her hand and pressed it warmly she added please dont worry about me  but im going to ruth he answered in a low tone somehow i feel that your injury is my fault  nonsense it was gabe werners fault entirely that boy ought really to be in jail but jack you are quite sure that your eyes are all right she went on anxiously  yes ruth the doctor says that ill be as well as ever in a day or two you are the only one to be worried over ill tell martha to telephone to me tomorrow just as soon as the doctor has seen you and so it was arranged  randy had obtained a large taxicab and into this all the girls crowded taking care however to make ruth as comfortable as possible on the rear seat then the girls of clearwater hall started for the school  ill bet miss garwood will be surprised when she sees ruth was andys comment as he watched the girls riding away miss garwood was the head of the girls school  poor ruth murmured fred what a miserable outing this has been  fortunately for the cadets they found the colby hall stage in town and all piled in and were speedily taken to the school here jack and randy went up to their rooms while the others reported to colonel colby  threw pepper into jacks eyes did he said the colonel wrathfully what a dastardly thing to do i am glad that werner is no longer a pupil at the school if he were i should feel it my duty to hand him over to the authorities you say he did not come back to haven point  no sir answered gif they motored over to the other sideover to where the hasley ammunition factory used to be located  i see then probably both he and glutts will take good care not to show themselves in the vicinity of haven point said colonel colby  and in this surmise the head of the school was correct long afterwards it was learned that werner had put the motorboat into the hands of a man to bring it back to the party of whom it had been hired and then he and glutts had tramped three miles across the country to a railroad station where they took a train for parts unknown  the colonel came up to see jack and have a look at his injured eyes and then sent mrs crews up to the young captain to bathe his eyes with the lotion the doctor had given him and bind them up  its too bad too bad entirely said mrs crews who was quite a motherly woman i hope your eyes are as well as ever in a day or two and then she added with a twinkle in her own optics i suppose that is what you get for running off with that baby carriage  if it is its a terrible price to pay mrs crews answered jack and then told her about ruth  now thats too bad entirely said the matron of the school oh who would want to harm a dear young lady like miss stevenson its awful how wicked some young men are and she shook her head dolefully  jack took it easy for the rest of the day and one after another his chums came in to sympathize with him  i cant understand a fellow like werner remarked ned lowe if he isnt careful hell land in prison  what gets me is that a fellow like glutts keeps on tagging after him put in dan soppinger sooner or later werner is bound to lead glutts into something pretty bad  jack passed a restless night not only because his eyes hurt him but because he could not get ruth out of his mind what if the girls eyes should be permanently injured the mere thought of such a catastrophe horrified him  in the morning he bathed his eyes again as doctor borden had directed he had been excused from his classroom and so sat around where he could readily be called to the telephone if any message came in for him it was not until about eleven oclock that his sister rang him up  the doctor left a few minutes ago said martha over the wire he was with ruth about half an hour and gave her quite a treatment he was very much encouraged and said he thought she would come around again all right in a few days but that she must be careful for several weeks about how she strained her eyes or went out in the wind  but he really thinks she will come around all right questioned jack anxiously  yes jack he was almost sure of it and oh i am so glad and so are all the other girls  well its a great relief to me martha he returned and his voice showed what a weight had been lifted from his mind  after that the days to the end of the term passed quickly there were the usual examinations and all of the rovers were glad to learn that they had passed successfully in the meanwhile jacks eyes continued to mend so that on the final day at the hall they felt practically as good as ever  the young captain and fred had gone over to clearwater hall ostensibly to call on their sisters but in reality to find out about ruth she came down to greet them and they were surprised and delighted to find that she no longer wore the bandage over her eyes  i cant go out in the strong sunlight yet nor in the wind said the girl nor can i do much reading or studying but the eyes no longer pain me and for that i am very thankful  doctor borden says it will take a week or two before her eyes are normal again explained martha but that isnt so bad when you consider what might have occurred and she gave a little shiver  colby hall was to close several days before the girls school but the two rover girls had received permission to go home with their brothers this was the last chance jack had of seeing ruth and the last chance that fred would have to see may and both made the most of it  ill write to you sure ruth said the young captain and i hope your eyes will allow you to reply  oh ill send you something jack even if its only a postal was the quick answer please dont worry about me i am sure my eyes will come around all right sooner or later  if they dont ill never forgive myself for taking you on that outing said the young captain feelingly  with the examinations at an end the colby hall cadets were allowed to do very much as they pleased and on the last night at school there was the usual horseplay and cutting up generally some boys tried to catch stowell but the sneak of the school outwitted them by receiving permission to leave the hall twelve hours early  well good riddance to bad rubbish announced fatty hendry when he heard of this i think colby hall could get along very well if stowell stayed away for good  im sure i wouldnt worry if he did stay away returned walt baxter  and now hurrah for little old new york cried andy on the following morning  little old new york and our dads added his twin  i wonder if they have arrived yet put in fred quickly i dont think so or they would have sent us a telegram  either that or they want to surprise us when we get there said jack  their trunks had been sent on ahead and directly after breakfast they set to work to finish packing their suitcases then they went around saying goodbye to the professors and colonel colby and did not forget shout plunger and bob nixon giving the latter some tips to remember them by  off at last cried fred as the autostage rumbled up to take the first crowd of boys to the railroad station in they piled and were soon whirled away in the direction of haven point  at the railroad station they were met by martha and mary the other girls could not come as all had examinations that morning soon the train rolled in and the rovers and a number of the other cadets piled in jack and fred being accompanied by their sisters  ill be glad to get home again and see mother and aunt grace and aunt nellie remarked martha as she settled herself in a seat beside her brother  and how about dad martha questioned jack  you dont have to ask that question she returned quickly you know i am just as crazy to see him as you are and im crazy to see uncle tom and uncle sam too  ill bet theyll have some stories to tell about their doings in france  yes indeed jack oh how they all must have suffered and how thankful i am that they are coming back to us whole and hearty just think if they had come back minus an arm or a leg or frightfully injured in some other way  i have thought of that martha more than once i can tell you when i think of the thousands of good strong healthy young fellows who went over there and gave up their lives or came back crippled i feel that our folks have much to be thankful for     chapter xv  back from france   the journey to new york city was uneventful they had to change cars at the junction and here a number of the other cadets left the rovers these included gif and spouter  sorry youre not going down to the city with us said jack but i suppose you are as anxious to see your folks as we are to see ours  right you are answered spouter and gif nodded his head to show that he agreed with his chum  when the train rolled into the grand central terminal at fortysecond street the rovers found two automobiles awaiting them and in the turnouts were the three mothers of the boys and girls  whats the news about dad ma burst out jack as he kissed his parent  have the soldiers come back yet was freds question  they havent got in yet but we are expecting them almost any time now answered mrs dick rover  we are just as anxious as you are to see them came from mrs tom rover as both of her sons gave her a warm hug there there dont smother me she added affectionately  oh its so good to be home again exclaimed mary boarding school is all well enough but id rather be with you folks any time mary had always been a good deal of a home girl  the young folks piled into the cars which were run by the rovers chauffeurs and in a moment more they were picking their way through the crowded traffic in the direction of fifth avenue they speeded up this noted thoroughfare and then across town to riverside drive  what is the matter with your eyes jack questioned his mother presently they look rather inflamed  oh i had a little runin with one of our old enemies returned the young captain ill tell you about it later  its poor ruth stevenson that got the worst of it broke in martha we may as well tell mother she added she ought to know it  i wish you boys would stop making enemies sighed mrs rover sooner or later they may cause you a lot of trouble  well i dont consider that it is our fault returned jack it is no more our fault than it was dads fault to make an enemy of dan baxter and his father arnold baxter  well if only your enemies reform as dan baxter reformed that will be something worth while said his mother  all of the mothers had made great preparations for the return of the young people their rooms had been placed in order and there were a number of pretty and useful gifts for all of them then came a grand reunion in the tom rover home where an elaborate dinner was served that evening  gee if only our dads were here to enjoy this with us murmured andy as he gazed upon the many good things spread before him  ill bet they wont find any fault with home cooking after they get back from the trenches in france commented randy with a grin ill bet theyve had to put up with all kinds of cooking  yes and sometimes they had to put up with cooking that wasnt added andy  cooking that wasnt repeated mary puzzled oh i know what you meanwhen they couldnt get anything  a number of their friends came in during the evening to see them and the young folks had an enjoyable time dancing and in singing in a group around the piano which the girls took turns in playing  well have to have another and a larger gathering when our fathers get home declared mary  oh wont we have the bully good time then cried her brother  maybe they wont have some stories to tell piped in andy  i want to hear all about how uncle dick won that medal came from randy  it was not until after eleven oclock that the little gathering broke up and then mrs dick rover called her children to her  now you must tell me about your eyes jack and you martha must tell me about ruth stevensons she said  thereupon the young captain and his sister related the particulars of what had occurred during the outing on bluebell island and what had been done by doctor borden to relieve the sufferers  it was a vile thing to do exclaimed mrs rover her eyes showing her displeasure why that gabe werner is nothing but a criminal you can be thankful jack that you escaped as you did but are you sure poor ruths eyes are not permanently injured  her eyes looked a great deal better when we came away than they had answered martha just the same im greatly worried and i know jack is too  ruth is to write to us and let us know how she is getting along went on the oldest rover boy  ruth is such a splendid girl and so fine looking it would be a shame if her eyes were hurt continued mrs rover and this remark about ruth caused jack to think more of his mother than ever  two days passed quickly the boys and girls spending their time in getting settled and renewing old acquaintances the girls went shopping with their mothers while the lads visited the offices of the rover company in wall street to see with their own eyes how matters were going  everything seems to be moving along swimmingly remarked jack when he and his cousins came away  ill bet it will seem strange to our dads to settle down to the grind once more after seeing so much fighting remarked fred  it will be hard for all of the soldiers and sailors to settle down im thinking added randy a fellow cant knock around here there and everywhere for months and then come down to a regular routine all in a minute  that night the young folks retired rather early andy and randy were indulging in some horseplay in their bedroom when they heard the doorbell ring  ill bet its a telegram from dad burst out andy  maybe its dad himself answered his twin come on down and see  as they hurried down the stairs they heard their mothers room door open and heard one of the servants going to the front door the next instant there was a cry from below  mr rover is it really you  its dad its dad yelled the twins simultaneously and fairly leaped to the bottom of the stairs and ran to greet their father  hello boys so you got home ahead of me did you came from tom rover as he hugged and kissed each in turn my how big you are getting  tom tom cried his wife nellie and then she rushed down the stairs as he rushed up to meet her he caught her up in his strong arms as he had been wont to do so many times in the past and fairly swung her above him then he kissed her on each cheek and on the mouth and set her down with his hands on her shoulders  this is what ive been waiting for nellie he declared just waiting to see you again  and ive been waiting too tomwaiting every day she murmured with tears in her beautiful eyes  in the meantime similar scenes were taking place in the adjoining houses dick rover having a key had let himself in unobserved and gave his wife quite a shock when he met her at the door to her room but she was overjoyed to see him as were also jack and martha and all clustered around to listen to what he might have to say  why dad you are as brown as a berry declared the young captain  and look how tall and strong he seems to be put in martha  it was mrs sam rover herself who answered her husbands ring and her shout of joy quickly brought fred downstairs mary had already retired but leaping up she threw a kimona around her and came flying down in bare feet  and then what a reunion there was among the members of all three families the doors which connected the three residences were thrown wide open and all gathered in the middle house all seemed to be talking at once and boys fathers and uncles shook hands over and over again while the girls and their mothers came in for innumerable hugs and kisses  we are not yet mustered out said dick rover but we expect to be before a great while  you ought to be very proud of having done your bit for uncle sam said mary to her father and her uncles  well i think our boys did their bit too if i am any judge was sam rovers fond comment first they helped to catch those chaps who blew up the hasley ammunition factory then they aided in rounding up the crowd who had the hidden german submarine and lastly they prevented those huns from establishing that wireless station in the woods i certainly think they did remarkably well  but theyve made some terrible enemies broke in mrs dick rover just look at jacks eyes one fellow tried to throw pepper into them  oh lets not talk about that now ma cried the young captain i want to hear all about what dad and uncle tom and uncle sam have been doing in france  if we started to give you all the details we wouldnt get to bed tonight said his uncle tom with a grin they had already been talking for quite a while and the clock hands pointed to nearly one in the morning  oh well this is a redletter night dad broke out randy  such a coming together may not happen again in a lifetime added his twin  then the older rovers told of many of their adventures both while in camp in france and during the time they had been on the firing line  we were in some pretty hot fights admitted tom rover one in particularwhen we forced the huns out of a stretch of woods they were holdingnone of us is liable to forget thats the fight in which sam and i were wounded  yes and the day after they were wounded i was caught in a gas attack said dick rover my but that was something pretty nasty i felt as if somebody had me by the throat and at the same time was trying to twist my stomach inside out i never felt such a sensation in my life and he shook his head and sighed deeply over the recollection of what he had passed through  was that where you won your medal dad questioned jack eagerly  no my boy the medal was won some time later while your two uncles were in the hospital trying to recover from their wounds we made two advances and then were told to hold our new line there was a fierce bombardment early in the morning and then because of a mixup of orders part of our command fell back while another tried to go forward one of our men a fellow named lorimer spell a queer sort of chap who hailed from texas was hit by a piece of shell and knocked partly unconscious he was unable to save himself and as i didnt want to see him killed i ran out from behind our shelter and brought him in     chapter xvi  dick rovers heroism   it can readily be believed that the rovers did not sleep much that night the boys and girls were downstairs by seven oclock and waited anxiously for the appearance of their parents in the diningroom of dick rovers residence where the fathers were to have breakfast before returning to the troopship which was docked across the river at hoboken  weve got to get back by noon announced tom rover and sam and i want to pay a visit to wall street before we go so we wont be able to spend much more time here  you were going to tell us how you won that medal dad said jack after breakfast was over and his two uncles had said goodbye to everybody and left what about it  well if you must have the story sit down and ill give it to you answered dick rover with a smile as it happens the death of lorimer spell may make quite a difference in my plans for this summer  oh then the poor man died in spite of your efforts to rescue him said martha in crestfallen tones  he didnt die from that shell wound answered her father but i had better tell the story from the beginning since you seem to be so anxious to hear it  you must remember dick that jack is something of a soldier himself he is a captain of the cadets you know remarked the mother of the lad  oh but that isnt like being a real soldier and fighting for uncle sam protested the youth  this lorimer spell the fellow i saved was a tall lanky texan who joined our command after we arrived in france just how he got in i cant say he was rather a quiet sort of man and some of the soldiers thought he was decidedly queer he took a great interest in botany and geology and i take it he was something of a student in those lines although he was by no means well educated  the day that he was knocked out by a fragment of a shell was a misty onethe kind of a mist that makes it very uncertain to see any great distance we did not know how close some of the huns might be and as a matter of fact they were closer than we expected and some time later two of our men were shot down while moving from one trench to another close by  when spell went down i was over a hundred feet away from him before he became unconscious he tried to crawl back to the trench from which he had come but evidently he was confused and went down in plain sight of the huns  i didnt care very much for the man as i told you before but i could not see him remain there exposed to the fire of the enemy and so without thinking twice i jumped up out of the trench and ran across the ground to where he was lying the shells had torn the soil dreadfully so that i had considerable difficulty in reaching him  i placed him on my shoulder and just then several huns began firing at us one bullet grazed my side giving me a deep scratch and another went through the cloth of spells coat i stumbled down into a shell crater with the man and had all i could do to drag him and myself out then i plunged forward again and just as the huns let out several more shots both of us stumbled down into the trench and the rescue if you might call it such was over  well i think that was a grand thing to do dad burst out jack his face beaming simply grand  you couldnt beat it for pluck said fred  and thats how you won the medal broke in andy fine  you certainly deserved it added his twin gee but suppose those huns had plugged you when you were carrying the fellow  and thats how i got him back to the trenches went on dick rover he was taken to the field hospital and there his injuries were found to be slight and in a few days he was back on the firing line again  he ought to have been mighty thankful declared martha who sat close by holding her fathers hand  he was thankful and for that reason he did something which may have an important bearing on my future business dealings answered dick rover he said he had no relatives of any kind and he then and there made a will whereby if anything happened to him all that he possessed in this world should go to me  and then he was killed questioned mrs rover  yes just two days after his return to duty we were making another advance spell was in one part of the field while i was in another suddenly i saw him running off to a place just in front of where our squad was located then he made a turn as if to come toward us and just at that instant he threw up his hands and fell forward on his face  here dick rover paused and dropped his eyes no one cared to speak and for an instant there was utter silence  when the skirmish was over we had gained our position and a few hours later the body of lorimer spell was picked up and carried to the rear went on jacks father a bullet had struck him in the back of the head and death must have been instantaneous  i confess that i felt pretty bad a number of the company knew of the will spell had made and two of them were witnesses to the crude document he had drawn up as a consequence spells personal effects were turned over to me they included a small amount of money a ring a wrist watch and a number of papers including an order for a box in a safe deposit vault in a bank in wichita falls texas  poor fellow its too bad he couldnt have lived to enjoy himself now the war is at an end remarked mrs sam rover  were any of his papers of value questioned jack curiously  that remains to be found out jack his papers spoke of a valuable tract of oil land in texas close to the boundary line between that state and oklahoma  oil lands exclaimed randy why they may be worth a fortune uncle dick they are making immense strikes in oil down in that territory  i know that randy some of the wells are worth a fortune but on the other hand you must remember that many of the tracts that are supposed to have oil on them have so far proved to be utterly dry men spend ten to forty thousand dollars in sinking a well only to find in the end that they have had their labor for their pains  did lorimer spell say that his land had oil on it questioned fred  from the way his papers and letters read one would think so fred but as i said before spell was a very queer kind of man in fact some of the fellows in our company thought he was a little bit out of his mind at times it is just possible that he only imagined that he possessed valuable oil land  but you are going to investigate arent you and make sure questioned jack  certainly son i intend to go to texas and make an investigation just as soon as i am mustered out of the service  oh dad do you mean that you might go to texas this summer  i will if they muster me out  if you go wont you take me along  ill think about it and dick rover smiled at his son whose face showed his eagerness  gee id like to go to texas myself burst out fred  such a trip would suit me down to the ground announced andy  ive always wanted to see a big oil well in operation added his twin  id like to see them shoot an oil well went on jack they say it is a wonderful sight especially if the well happens to be a real gusher  the queerest part of it is this went on dick rover before the war came on i was more or less interested in the oil fields in texas and oklahoma as well as in kansas a good oil well or series of wells is a splendid paying proposition in these days and id like first rate to get possession of such a holding and then start a firstclass oil company  oh there are millions in oil i know that burst out martha why i was reading in a magazine only the other day of some folks in texas who were quite poor they had a farm of less than a hundred acres and could make barely a living on it then the oil prospectors came along and located a well or two and now those poor farm people have so much money they dont know what to do with it  wouldnt it be great if we could go down there and locate a few of those firstclass wells said fred with a sigh id just like to know how it feels to be a real millionaire  can i go dad if you go questioned jack again  ill see about that later i dont wish to make any promises now  if jack goes i want to go with him put in fred sturdily  of course well want to go with him added andy and randy in a breath  whats the matter with us girls going along demanded martha  what would girls be doing in the oil fields asked fred a well might go off and shoot all your beautiful dresses full of oil  huh what about it if some oil got on that flaming red necktie you are wearing fred questioned his sister quickly in his haste to get dressed that morning her brother had donned a necktie which she detested  never mind my necktie mary if jack goes to texas im going to see if i cant go along  the matter was talked over a few minutes longer and then dick rover went off with his wife to arrange some private affairs before he should take his departure for hoboken then he said goodbye all around and was off  the next time you see us i think well be in a big parade said jacks father on leaving  a parade queried several of the others  yes they are talking of having a big parade of the soldiers on fifth avenue if they do of course well be in it  hurrah thats the stuff cried andy ive been aching to see one of those big parades ever since war was declared  if you do parade dad well all be there to see you declared martha  well want front seats in the grandstand added mary  i dont think youll get any front seats mary answered her mother more than likely those seats will be reserved for the goldstar mothersthose who have lost their sons in battle  well those mothers deserve the front seats every time said jack  indeed they do came from the girls  how soon will this parade come off questioned randy  i dont know that the date has been settled exactly answered dick rover but it will undoubtedly be in the near future you will probably see all the details in the newspapers i presume the whole of new york will have a holiday  yes and fifth avenue will be decorated in great shape from end to end declared mary just see how they have been working on that arch of victory and the tower of jewels and all the other things  it will certainly be a parade well worth seeing said dicks wife  yes and ill wager folks will come miles and miles to see it added fred and then he continued quickly whats the matter with having grandfather rover down here from valley brook farm  yes and greataunt martha and uncle randolph too broke in mary  oh we must have all of them by all means cried jack     chapter xvii  the great victory parade   my what a jam of people  did you ever see such a crowd before in all your life  and look at the flags and other decorations arent they beautiful  this time new york has outdone herself  it was the day for the great parade of the returned soldiers and new york city especially in the vicinity of fifth avenue was packed with dense crowds that filled miles of grandstands windows and other points of vantage and also jammed the sidewalks and the side streets it was a holiday for all and everybody was going to make the most of it  the rovers had left their homes early to make their way to the seats they had obtained on one of the stands with those who resided in the city were grandfather rover and also aunt martha and uncle randolph who had come down the day previous from valley brook farm  this is the greatest day of my life said grandfather rover his eyes glistening with pleasure to think that my boys have all fought for our country and come back from the war safely  yes and to think one of them has won a medalnot but what the others have been equally brave responded old uncle randolph  i hope they never have to go to another warthey or their sons either murmured old aunt martha  the girls had invited may and ruth to come to new york to witness the parade may had accepted the invitation but ruth had sent word the doctor did not think a trip advisable at this time her eyes being still in bad condition  its too bad ruth couldnt come sighed jack  well she had better take care of her eyes answered his sister oh dear why did that horrid werner have to do such a mean thing  the rovers had all they could do to get to the seats reserved for them each carried a small flag to be waved as the soldiers passed there was quite a wait and the crowd seemed to grow denser every minute then from a distance came the fanfare of trumpets and the booming of many drums  here they come here they come was the glad shout and soon a platoon of police on horseback swept by then followed a brass band of a hundred pieces or more and the great parade was fairly started  to go into the particulars of this tremendous spectacle would be impossible in the limits of these pages regiment after regiment swept by representing every state in the union there were brass bands galore with old glory everywhere in evidence the crowd clapped and cheered and sometimes shouted itself hoarse as some favorite command swept by with soldierly precision here and there a hero was recognized and then the din would increase  some parade i say exclaimed fred enthusiastically  isnt it wonderful how many soldiers there are marveled may who sat next to him  when are our boys coming questioned grandfather rover anxiously  theyll be coming along pretty soon now answered jack who had been studying the program closely they are in the second regiment after the one now passing  the new york state troops were now approaching and the din became terrific the more so as one company after another was recognized  here they come here they come exclaimed martha who was gazing down the line  i see them they are just at the corner added mary  theres dad i see dad screamed andy to make himself heard above the noise there he is in the front row on this side  yes and there is my father yelled fred see him two men away from uncle tom  i see dad announced jack hes in the middle see him with that medal on his breast  hurrah boys hurrah for you yelled grandfather rover and arose excitedly shaking his cane in one hand and a small flag in the other  illustration hurrah for you boys yelled grandfather rover  by this time all were on their feet cheering and waving their flags wildly dick tom and sam rover saw them and although they did not dare to turn their heads they smiled broadly in recognition for them the moment was just as thrilling as it was for those on the stand  hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted the boys and girls and their parents and other relatives joined in as strenuously as any one  old aunt martha was crying openly and the other women had also to wipe the tears from their eyes  somehow it chokes me all up declared old uncle randolph and blew his nose vigorously  the company containing the rovers passed on and the great parade continued hour after hour until it seemed as if there would be no end to that grand procession  gracious i didnt know there were so many soldiers in the whole world declared aunt martha at length  if you are getting tired aunt martha ill have somebody take you back to the house remarked mrs dick rover after they had been watching the parade for four hours  no no i am going to see it to the end declared the old lady it will be something to talk about as long as i live  just think of a lot of soldiers like these fighting all over our farm at valley brook was uncle randolphs comment thats what they did over in france it must have been terrible the way things were cut up  my dad says you wouldnt believe it if you didnt see it answered randy he said some of the shell craters were big enough to dump a small barn in think of holes like that in your pasture lot  but even the greatest of parades must come to an end and at last the final body of soldiers marched by and then came more police followed by a great crowd of people that surged into fifth avenue like great flocks of sheep hurrying bustling and jostling in an effort to get every way at once  wasnt it perfectly grand cried mary  it couldnt have been more wonderful answered may  now well get you back to the house and give you something to eat said mrs dick rover to the old folks you certainly must be hungry as well as tired  well a little bit of something to eat wouldnt go bad dora answered grandfather rover placing an affectionate hand on her shoulder and then he added softly were mighty proud of our dick arent we  proud i should say we are answered mrs rover her whole face glowing with keen satisfaction  it was decided that all of the older folks as well as the three girls should return to riverside drive the boys however wanted to remain out and see what might take place further  we can pick up a little lunch somewheresome sandwiches and pie and maybe a glass of milk said randy  anything will do for me announced fred im almost too excited to eat  if you boys stay out you take good care of yourselves in this awful jam warned mrs tom rover and dont you get into any mischief she added to her twins  the four lads saw the others safely to the automobiles which were standing down one of the side streets and then came back to fifth avenue  lets walk down and look at the decorations and at the arch of victory suggested jack and so it was decided  in many places the sidewalks were littered with boxes which had been used to sit or stand upon as a consequence the best place to walk was in the street and down this the boys pushed their way through the crowds which were gradually beginning to thin out  i never imagined buildings could be so handsomely decorated declared jack those flags and banners and all that mass of bunting must have cost a fortune  yes and think of the money spent in decorating some of these windows put in fred  they were gazing at a large showwindow filled with a representation of american soldiers and sailors from colonial times to the present day there were at least twentyfive figures in full uniform and the display was as valuable to study from an historical standpoint as it was interesting to view as a picture  some work to get all those uniforms together and to have everything exactly right remarked randy  i like the plain khaki of today as well as any of them announced jack the others are more gaudy but when it comes to actual serviceouch  jacks remark broke off abruptly as a small but heavy box thrown from the gutter landed directly on his head then another box came flying through the air to strike between the three other rovers it was followed by a ball of soakingwet and muddy newspapers which struck the showwindow with a thud sending some dirty drops of water into the rover boys faces  fred was the first to whirl around in an endeavor to see where the two boxes and the waddedup newspapers had come from he was just in time to see two young fellows try to lose themselves in the rapidly moving crowd  gabe werner he ejaculated there he goes  yes and there is bill glutts with him added andy  whats that questioned jack he had received a small cut on one ear from the flying box and his cap had been knocked over his eyes  werner and glutts did it answered fred there they go down the street  if thats the case weve got to catch them returned the oldest rover boy come on quick  all started in pursuit of the two former bullies of colby hall but to follow them through the rapidly moving crowd was not easy and several times they were afraid the rascals would get away from them  here here take your time said a policeman to fred as the latter brushed by him take your time  im after a fellow who ought to be arrested answered fred quickly  where is he demanded the bluecoat with interest  there he goesdown around the corner and then as the policeman showed no disposition to leave his post the youngest rover boy hurried away after the others  werner and glutts had looked back and seeing that the rovers were in pursuit they had tried to throw them off the trail by passing around the nearest corner now they headed in the direction of the east side  i told you not to bother with them panted glutts who was somewhat out of breath now for all you know theyll have us arrested  oh shut up your whining bill growled werner in disgust i wish i had knocked that jack rovers head off with the box  you came very near busting the window  i wouldnt care if i did bust it answered the other recklessly  it dont look as if that dose of pepper hurt jack rover much  never mind ill fix him some day you see if i dont  the two glanced back once more and to their chagrin saw that the rovers had come around the corner and were chasing after them faster than ever this caused bill glutts to become more frightened than before  oh what shall we do theyll catch us sure he wailed  no they wont come on yelled werner and caught his crony by the arm  he was too excited to notice carefully where he was running and the next instant he followed by glutts brought up against a stand on the sidewalk in front of a small shop this stand was filled with various articles of bricabrac and it went down with a crash carrying dozens of small articles with it     chapter xviii  bound for texas   hi hi phatphat you mean py knocking mine stand ofer cried out a voice from the doorway of the building and a small stockily built foreigner came running forward  get off of me spluttered bill glutts who was under gabe werner youre pressing some of this broken stuff into my face  werner could not answer being too surprised by the sudden turn affairs had taken but then as he realized that the four rovers were close at hand he rolled over on the sidewalk upsetting a small boy as he did so and then managed to scramble to his feet  come on bill he panted and set off down the street at the best gait he could command  what bill glutts had said about being pushed into the broken bricabrac was true his face had come down into the midst of several broken vases and one hand rested on a broken bit of glassware when he arose to his feet he found himself held fast by the storekeeper  you dont vas git avay from me already bawled the owner of the place you vas pay for de damages you make  you let me go it wasnt my fault stormed glutts  by this time the rovers had come up bill glutts looked the picture of despair with blood flowing from several cuts on his face and on one hand  where is werner questioned jack quickly  there he goes exclaimed randy come on after him before he gets away  some one had better stay here and see that glutts doesnt get away suggested fred  all right fred you and andy stay here until we get back answered randy and then he sped off after jack who was already running at his best rate of speed in the direction gabe werner had taken  by this time werner was thoroughly scared he knew that he was liable to arrest for smashing the bricabrac stand and he had no desire to fall into the clutches of the rovers feeling instinctively that they might pummel him thoroughly before handing him over to the authorities besides that he remembered that they might hold him to account for the pepper incident  he had turned down a side street where there were a number of tenements he dove through an open doorway and ran the length of the hall coming out of the building at the rear here there was a small yard surrounded by a board fence he leaped the fence with ease and then dove into the back end of another tenement and out at the front and soon lost himself in a crowd on the other street  jack and randy hunted around for fully a quarter of an hour and were then compelled to give up the chase  its too bad declared the oldest rover boy but it cant be helped let us go back and see what they have done with glutts  they soon found their way back to where the bricabrac stand had been smashed a woman was now in charge and she was just finishing the cleaning away of the wreckage fred and andy stood nearby watching her both wore a broad grin  whats the matter couldnt you catch werner questioned fred  no he slipped us answered jack and gave the particulars  the police just carted bill glutts off in a patrol wagon announced andy the keeper of the store a bohemian with an unpronounceable name went along he declared glutts would have to pay the bill in full and even then he wanted him put in prison for life or beheaded or something like that  phew in that case glutts will get all that is coming to him exclaimed randy  he sure will if that bohemian has anything to do with it  the four boys took another look around for werner and then walked back to fifth avenue and a little later went home here a fine dinner awaited them  its certainly been a banner day remarked fred ill never forget it as long as i live  after that two weeks passed rapidly the boys went on a visit to valley brook farm and also met spouter gif and several of their other school chums they had a glorious fourth of july and then came back to new york city  during that time jack wrote two letters to ruth and received one in return the girl stated that she felt quite well but that her eyes were still bothering her a good deal  its too bad jack said martha when her brother spoke about this ruth is not the one to complain her eyes are probably in worse shape than she is willing to admit  im worried greatly martha he answered i wish i could do something for her  in a roundabout way the rovers heard of what had happened to bill glutts he had been locked up over night and in the morning some relatives had come to his assistance and through paying a fine had had him released then glutts and his relatives had paid for the damage done to the bricabrac stand a damage amounting to nearly a hundred dollars in the meanwhile so far as they could ascertain nothing further had been heard of gabe werner  werner is evidently going to keep shady remarked fred perhaps well never see him again but in this surmise the youngest rover boy was mistaken as later events proved  at last came another redletter day when the command to which the older rovers belonged was mustered out of the united states service tom and sam came in one day and dick the next evening  now for civilian clothes once more announced tom rover and then i guess it will be high time for me to get back to the offices in wall street  and im with you tom said sam id rather be at my desk than on a battlefield any day  when dick rover came back he was more filled than ever with a desire to get down to texas to look over the land which had been left to him by lorimer spell  ive found out that it is right in a territory where a number of wellpaying oil wells have been located said he but im not altogether certain that his claim is a sure one and it might be just possible that some prospectors might try to jump it now that word has gone forth that he was killed in battle they may think he died without leaving any heir  well dad you know what i said cried jack quickly if you went to texas id like first rate to go along maybe i could help you with your claim  oh uncle dick wont you take us all with you pleaded fred it would be a grand outing for this summer weve been working very hard at school you know  a trip to texas would put us in a number one condition for colby hall this fall added andy with a grin  we wouldnt interfere with your business in the least commented his twin  at first dick rover was rather doubtful about taking four lively boys with him on the trip but then he felt that they deserved something for applying themselves so diligently to their studies during the winter and also for helping matters to run smoothly while he and his brothers had been in france  you can go he announced the next day after a consultation with his brothers and their wives but i am going very quicklyby tomorrow night at the latest can you boys get ready so soon  can we get ready exclaimed andy say uncle dick just let me run upstairs and get an extra pair of socks and a toothbrush and ill be ready to go to the north pole if you say so and at this sally there was a general laugh  after that matters moved with incredible swiftness it was decided that the boys should take no baggage but what would go in their suitcases for the trip and these were speedily packed in the meanwhile dick rover obtained the necessary railroad tickets and sleepingcar accommodations  hurrah were off for texas and the oil fields cried fred  off for the land of luck exclaimed dick rover with a smile  the land of luck questioned jack is that what they call it dad  yes son and its truly the land of luck for some for others it is the land of bitter disappointment  then i would call it the land of luckgood or bad announced andy  they were to leave from the pennsylvania terminal late in the evening the whole family had dinner together and those to be left behind did not hesitate to give the boys a great deal of advice  i hope you dont fall in with any rough characters down there said mrs dick rover they tell me there are some men in the oil fields who are anything but nice  you may find you will have to rough it said tom rover i understand some of the oil fields are ten or fifteen miles away from the nearest town  well weve roughed it before answered jack  the mothers of the boys might have been more upset but they felt relieved to think that dick would be with the lads  soon the time came for parting and all drove quickly to the railroad terminal then finally goodbyes were said and those bound for texas hurried downstairs to the big underground train station porters with their bags took them to the proper car and they soon found themselves settled a few minutes later they were off  the trip during the night was uneventful and strange as it may seem all of the boys slept soundly but they were up early and ready for their breakfast just as soon as that meal was announced from the diner  im afraid were going to have a rainy day of it said dick rover as the four boys sat down to a large table while he took his place at a smaller one opposite but as well be on board all day it wont matter  during the meal jack noticed that his father was reading a letter very attentively and when the party walked back to their pullman he mentioned this fact  this is a letter from an oil well promoter said dick rover i dont exactly know what to make of it he makes a proposition which on the face of it looks rather good but somehow or other i have got it in my head that he is a crook  in that case dad im sure you wont want to have anything to do with him  is he a new york man or one from down in texas questioned fred who overheard this conversation  he operates mostly in texas although he has some connection in new york he is very anxious to form a new company and of course sell the stock well i am willing to go into a new thing and take stock for myself and try to dispose of some to others provided the company is really a good one but i dont want to get mixed up in any shady transaction  i should say not cried jack the rover name has always been a clean one  what is the name of this promoter questioned fred  carson davenport  whats that exclaimed jack somewhat startled  carson davenport did you ever hear that name before  i certainly did dad this carson davenport has a son perry and this perry davenport and nappy martell were great chums and unless i am mistaken mr martell and carson davenport were once partners in some mining scheme i heard perry and nappy talking about it several times  humph if this carson davenport was a partner of nelson martell i dont know as i want anything to do with him that whole bunch is tarred with the same stick not one of them is honest declared dick rover bluntly     chapter xix  in the land of luck   well here we are in texas at last  and what immense stretches of country there seem to be jack miles and miles without a house or any other building  you must remember boys that texas is the largest state in the union came from dick rover some of the farms or ranches down here cover thousands of acres  how much farther have we to ride questioned randy  ten miles thats all replied his uncle  they had made two changes since leaving new york city but each stop had been less than an hour in duration so to these boys so used to outdoor activities it felt as if the whole journey had been continuous they were bound for a small town which in years gone by had been known as steerville but the name of which since the oil boom had been changed to columbina this so far as dick rover could ascertain was the nearest point to where the lorimer spell tract was located  well take a look around columbina first jacks father had said i want to see how that claim looks then ill take a run over to wichita falls and get those documents belonging to spell from the safe deposit box in the bank  i see an oil well shouted fred presently and he pointed out of the car window to where the huge derrick could be seen over a distant rise of ground  there is another and another added andy a few minutes later  now we must be coming into the oil fields announced dick rover and his face showed that he was just as eager as the boys just think of how some of these wells have made a great many comparatively poor people almost millionaires over night  it sounds like a fairy tale doesnt it dad exclaimed jack no wonder they call this the land of luck  but dont forget the disappointments son many a man has put his all into sinking a well only to find it absolutely dry  and wells cost so much to sink too put in fred ten to forty thousand dollars each its an awful amount to gamble away  not all of the wells cost that much fred in some places they strike oil at a distance of a few hundred feet but here they have to go down much deeper many good wells are down three thousand feet or more  the train had stopped at one or two towns and now the porter announced that the next stop would be columbina and he took their suitcases to the platform for them presently they rolled up to a small wooden station and the travelers alighted then the heavy train rolled westward  welcome to columbina cried andy jestingly some big city i must declare i wonder where the waldorfvanderbilt hotel is located  whats the matter with going to the ritzcopley square added his twin with a grin  perhaps well be thankful to get any kind of a shakedown boys announced dick rover this certainly is worse than i anticipated although i knew that we couldnt expect much in one of these boom towns  to a newcomer columbina certainly offered no special attractions only a few years before it had been nothing but a point where the ranchmen had shipped their steers on the railroad with a tiny stockyard and a small ranchmens hotel and saloon combined now the boom city if such it might be called consisted of a long straggling main street with a much dilapidated boardwalk on one side only in the middle of the street the mud was all of a foot deep and through this wagons and automobiles plowed along as best they could all of the buildings were of wood and none of them more than three stories in height there were half a dozen general stores the same number of eating and drinking places and two buildings which were designated as hotels obrians being one and smedleys the other there was also a long shedlike moving picture theater advertised to be open twice a week in the evening  i was advised by a man on the train to try the smedley hotel first said dick rover he thought id find a better class of people there than at the obrian place wait till i ask the station master where the hotel is located  you cant miss it said the station man when applied to its down at the end of that boardwalk if you go any further youll sink into mud up to your knees and he smiled feebly  any chance of our getting in there  just as good a chance as getting in anywhere they tell me obrians place is so full theyre falling out of the windows and the station master chuckled over his little joke  anything in the way of a taxicab around here to take us and our baggage up there  taxicab the last man to run a taxicab was jim lumpkins and now jims struck oil and hes so rich he wont do nothing if you want to get up to smedleys i reckon youll have to hoof it  come on dad lets walk up there said jack  but your suitcases are pretty heavy answered his father with a smile  oh we wont mind those declared fred weve hiked around with just as much to carry many times  i shant mind it myself declared his uncle campaigning in france was a splendid thing to harden ones muscles  they set off down the one business street of which columbina boasted they had to pick their way carefully along the dilapidated boardwalk at one point they came opposite obrians hotel downstairs was a saloon and in this a noisy bunch were talking and singing  i dont know as i would care to stop there remarked randy it looks like rather a tough hole to me  you are right responded jack id rather go to some private house if i could find one or else buy a tent and hire a place where we could pitch it  gee thats an idea cried andy id much rather go camping out and do my own cooking than put up with just any old thing  at length they came to smedleys hotel it was a new building three stories in height with a restaurant occupying onehalf of the lower floor half a dozen men were occupying chairs on the front piazza and they eyed the newcomers curiously  looks fairly clean anyway whispered fred to his cousins i wouldnt want to get into some old ranch that was full of bugs  the office of the hotel was about twelve feet square with a sanded floor on one side was a plain wooden settee and on the other an equally plain counter on which rested a register and a bell behind the counter was a tall frecklefaced man with a shock of red hair  good afternoon gentlemen he said hospitably what can i do for you  we want to know if we can be accommodated here answered dick rover there are five of us  how long do you want to stay  i dont know exactly several days at least and maybe a week or two  i see the hotel proprietor scratched his head thoughtfully ive got one big room left and one small room directly opposite the small room has only a single bed in it but the other room has a double bed and i could easily put two cots in there besides that  would you mind showing us the quarters questioned jacks father experience had taught him when in outoftheway places not to accept hotel accommodations until he had inspected them  sure thing brother just follow me  the boys waited below while dick rover and the hotel man went upstairs a minute later they came down and then jacks father registered for the entire crowd  you pay for your meals in the restaurant when you get em announced the hotel man the rooms are separate three dollars each per day  the rooms to which they had been assigned were on the third floor of the hotel one was amply large for all of the boys and the other while much smaller had good ventilation and dick rover said it would suit him very well  the whole outfit is better than i was afraid it might be he announced some of these boom towns have wretched quarters for newcomers in fact ive read in the newspapers that in many places the newcomers had to roll themselves in blankets and sleep out in the fields  i was reading about one place where they set up cots on the floor of a general store at night and sold the right to sleep on a cot until seven oclock in the morning for one dollar said randy  there was no running water but each room was supplied with a bowl and pitcher and after the extra cots were placed in the larger apartment an extra bucket of water was also brought up by a maid  although they did not know it the rovers had no sooner disappeared upstairs than two of the men sitting on the veranda of the hotel came into the office and looked over the register  five rovers and all from new york city muttered one of the men and gazed knowingly at his companion  four of them were nothing but kids returned the other its only the man who counts and his name seems to be richard rover  do you think he is the same rover  i shouldnt wonder tate that name isnt a common one however we had better make sure before we make another move  andy and fred were the first to get through washing up and then they came downstairs to take a look around before going into the diningroom with the others for supper they came out on the hotel porch and were surveying the scene before them when the two men who had inspected the hotel register lounged up to them  well what do you think of our town questioned one of them pleasantly  i havent seen enough of it to form an opinion answered fred  it will take us a week or two i suppose to take in all the sights came from andy with a grin  it might take you a week or two if you went on foot through the mud answered the second man and then he continued i suppose you came from a distance eh  we came from new york  going to invest in some oil wells i suppose remarked the first man who had spoken and he smiled broadly  that depends on how we find things here answered fred you see my uncle is interested in a tract of land they say has oil on it of course hell want to make an investigation before he goes ahead  is that man who is with you your uncle  yes  is the tract of land he is interested in near here questioned the second man  i dont know how close it is to this town  whats the tract called if you dont know exactly where it is perhaps we can help you locate it  its the lorimer spell tract answered fred innocently he thought the men were just asking out of idle curiosity  oh i see the man frowned and looked at his companion  do you know anything about that tract  oh ive heard of it its up on the north side of the town i understand spell was shot during the war the man continued looking at the boys  he was answered andy and he left all his property to my uncle dick who once saved his life  oh thats it is it cried one of the men seems to me i heard something about that your uncle played the regular hero act  as i said before he saved lorimer spells life and did it at the risk of his own it was in the midst of one of the fiercest fights  at this moment jack and randy came rushing down the stairs and out on the porch of the hotel in great excitement  we just saw somebody up the street exclaimed jack and who do you think it was gabe werner     chapter xx  plotting against dick rover   gabe werner  where is he  up the street answered randy come on after him  whos the man you are after questioned one of the men who had been interviewing andy and fred  hes a young fellow who once went to a military academy with us hes a regular bully and did something for which he ought to be locked up was freds reply and then he rushed down into the street following his three cousins  how can gabe werner be down here questioned andy why we left him in new york city  i cant help that andy it was werner just as sure as i am standing here i just happened to glance out of the window and saw him crossing the roadway he turned his face straight toward me and i couldnt help but recognize him  where did he go  ill point out the place when we get there  by this time the four rovers had left the boardwalk and were plowing along on the side of the road through mud that varied from an inch to six inches in depth they had started to run but were soon compelled to slow up  gee this is something fierce panted andy  oh you cinder path chanted his twin wouldnt you like to do a hundredyard dash on this road  its not much farther announced jack i saw him heading for that shack yonder  the place he mentioned was a small building erected of rough boards with a galvanized roof they neared the shack to find two men sitting before it on a log smoking their pipes they appeared somewhat startled  did a young fellow just pass this way questioned jack quickly  the two men looked at the rovers curiously and then one shook his head  dont think he did stranger i didnt see anybody did you tom  no was the positive answer  by the look on their faces jack felt that the men were not telling the truth yet what he was to do he did not know  maybe he went back to that garage he suggested pointing to a smaller building in the rear  look around if you think anybody is there said the first man who had spoken and the boys hurried down to the garage which stood open as they did this one of the men sauntered into the shack  say whats the meaning of this he demanded of gabe werner who stood hiding behind a door  ill tell you as soon as they go away was the answer of the former bully of colby hall dont let them come in here and see me  all right they shant come in was the mans laconic reply and then he went outside again to resume his smoking  having walked around the garage and peered inside the four rovers walked again to the shack the man who had just come out of the building leered at them  didnt find the fellow you were after did you he queried  no answered jack shortly he did not like the appearance of the man in the least  want to see him particularly  i want to give him a good thrashingthats what i want to do exclaimed jack and after that i might turn him over to the police if there is any such thing in this town  we havent any police here we run things to suit ourselves  what do you want to lick him for questioned the other man  he threw pepper in my eyes once and hes done a lot of other things he oughtnt to have done returned jack and then turned back to the hotel and his cousins followed  those two men were on the hotel veranda when we first went there said randy i noticed them and i did not like their looks at all  do you know what i think returned jack i believe gabe werner was in that shack all the time i think he must have seen us coming and given those fellows the tip they both tried to appear cool but they were both flustered  but what can gabe werner be doing in this outoftheway place demanded fred  he probably came here fred just for the excitement hundreds of young fellows have drifted to the oil fields just as years ago they drifted to the gold fields they gamble in oil stocks and do what they can trying to strike it rich its a great temptation to any fellow who hasnt a wellpaying job at home  but gabe werner ought to be going to school put in andy  true andy but gabe himself thinks he is old enough to do as he pleases evidently from the way he acts his folks can no longer control him  when the boys got back to the hotel they found dick rover looking for them he listened in surprise to what they had to say  it certainly is odd if that gabe werner is here he said and more than likely you are rightotherwise that fellow wouldnt have taken such pains to hide himself well if he is here you must watch that he doesnt play any more tricks on you  a fair supper was had at the hotel during the meal both fred and andy noticed that the two men who had questioned them in the hotel office concerning the lorimer spell claim were watching their uncle dick closely  they seem to want to know all about our business said fred when mentioning this to his uncle  oh thats the case in every oil town or mining camp answered dick rover men are always anxious to get a lead as they call it on what is going to happen next if they think a fellow may strike it rich in some particular location they rush after him like a flock of sheep and try to get claims as close to him as possible  after the meal was finished the boys took a walk around the town to see how the place looked at night and thinking they might possibly run across gabe werner  the narrow street with the single boardwalk was crowded with people some well dressed and others in the roughest of costumes there was loud talking and jesting and most of the pedestrians seemed to be in good humor although occasionally they would pass a group evidently out of luck and willing to let everybody know it  no more oil fields for me they heard one man exclaim as he lunged past evidently partly under the influence of liquor ive sunk fortyfive thousand dollars in wells already and not a sniff of gas to show for it im through  thats the other side of the picture remarked randy evidently hes got rid of every cent he had and now hes so downhearted he is taking to drink  i dont see where he can get it in these days said fred  oh they manage to get it somehow  the moving picture theater was open and a crowd was swarming inside the pictures were old and of a wild western nature and none of the lads had any desire to see them they passed on and looked into the windows of a couple of the general stores where everything from matches to bedding seemed to be for sale then they came to a corner where there was a side street which was little more than an alleyway along this were a dozen or more shanties set in anything but a regular row  on the corner was a flaring banner announcing that here was located the famous california chop suey restaurant behind the small dirty windows ten or fifteen men were eating at half a dozen tables covered with oilcloth  look exclaimed fred pointing in through the open door of the restaurant there are those same men who were at our hotel evidently they cant be stopping thereor at least they dont eat there  isnt it queer that they should hang around our hotel and then come down here for a meal remarked randy  theyre talking to another mansomebody who wasnt at our hotel said fred just see how excited they seem to be he added quickly after one of the men drew a paper from his pocket and all of them bent over it with interest  then the stranger of the crowd began to talk to the others very earnestly  let us walk down the alleyway and perhaps we can find out something about those men suggested jack you say they asked about lorimer spell and his claim they may know something that my dad would like to find out  all right said fred  the four rovers turned the corner of the restaurant and walked slowly down the alleyway along a narrow cinder path this path ran close to the side of the building and here were located several small windows one of them close to where stood the table at which the men inside were seated  its a mighty good thing that we ran across those rovers the very day they came in one of the men was saying if it hadnt been for that they might have gone up to the lorimer spell claim and done something that would queer the whole thing  oh i dont think they could do that tate returned the man whom the lads had not seen before you know at the best spells claim on the land was not perfectly clear  well thats how you look at it davenport said another of the men you must remember lorimer spell had a good many friends in this neighborhood of course he was a queer dick and all that sort of thing but in spite of that folks here would want to have spells wishes in this matter upheld  oh i know we run some risk returned the man called davenport but i think the stake is worth it  to be sure it is came from one of the others  the question is came from the man named tate how are we going to get at it do you think youll be able to see the documents this man rover must carry  of course ill see them ill get at them some way returned carson davenport firmly he was a largebuilt man with coalblack eyes and black hair and his face had a rather cruel expression  somebody said that lorimer spell placed his valuables in some safe deposit vault went on one of the men in that case this richard rover wouldnt have them  i dont see why not said another if he became spells heir he would have a right to do anything and the bank would have to give the documents up  more talk of a like nature followed and the rover boys listened with keen interest to every word that was said they recognized in carson davenport the man who had written to jacks father hoping to get the latter interested in some fake oil companies trusting that the rover company in new york city would be able to dispose of the worthless stocks to their customerspeople who trusted them implicitly in all their financial transactions while these negotiations were going on jake tate davenports righthand man had learned that lorimer spell was dead and that he had made dick rover his sole heir this was at a time when tate and davenport as well as the other men were trying to get possession of the spell land feeling sure that there was oil on it they had been on the point of communicating with dick rover thinking they might get the claim away from him when he had surprised the whole crowd by his unexpected appearance in columbina  weve got to have quick action in this declared jake tate the longer we delay the worse off well be  yes but youve got to find out about those papers first said one of the other men lighting a cigar  you leave me to do that said carson davenport im sure i know exactly how to handle this man rover  he must be a pretty shrewd fellow davenport otherwise he wouldnt be holding such an important position in that wall street company remarked tate  ive handled men like that before you leave it to me  but you dont want him to suspect anything is off color said one of the other men  im not so green jackson i wasnt born yesterday  didnt you say you thought this rover had a lot of money  yes the whole family has money but at the same time that has nothing to do with it ill tell you what i propose to do continued carson davenport earnestly ill wait until i am sure that he  this was as much as the rover boys heard for the time being around the corner of the building from the main street had come three figures they had been abreast but now they approached on the cinder path in single file as they came closer the lights from the restaurant fell on their faces and to their intense surprise the four rovers recognized gabe werner nappy martell and slugger brown     chapter xxi  words and blows   the surprise on both sides was equal and for a moment neither the rovers nor those in the other crowd uttered a word  what are you doing here jack rover demanded nappy martell at length as he scowled at the youth and his cousins  i might ask the same question of you nappy was jacks return  did you come here from that detention camp questioned fred  thats none of your business retorted slugger brown  you got away from us this afternoon gabe werner but youre not going to do it this time continued jack and caught the rascal by the arm  hi you let go of me howled the bully roughly and shoved jack back against the building  at this randy leaped forward and also caught hold of werner nappy martell and slugger brown were about to jump in to the assistance of their friend when fred and andy interfered  you leave them alone ordered fred with flashing eyes hes one of the meanest fellows in the world he threw pepper in jacks eyes and in the eyes of ruth stevenson  the loud talking so close to a window of the restaurant attracted the attention of the men inside and the fellow named jake tate thrust his head out to see what was going on  say what do you know about this he exclaimed turning to his companions those four young rovers are out here right by the window  you dont say so burst out carson davenport  if they are by this window maybe they were spying on us put in the man named jackson  in the meanwhile there was something of a fight going on outside gabe werner had tried to break away and then launched a blow at jack who returned by hitting him a crack in the jaw  see here you leave werner alone blustered slugger brown  you keep out of this slugger cried jack and then as werner hit out a second time jack dodged and the bullys fist struck the side of the building skinning several of his knuckles then jack landed a blow with all the force he could command on werners left ear and the rascal went down on the cinder path and rolled over into the roadway  by this time the men in the restaurant had run outside and were coming up  whats the rumpus here demanded jake tate pushing his way through the crowd of boys he was a burly individual and could at times put on a most aggressive manner  we caught these four fellows right by this window declared nappy martell with a sharp look first at tate and then at davenport  it looked to us as though they might be spying on you added slugger brown and he too gave davenport a peculiar look  spying on us eh muttered the oil company promoter in anything but a pleasant manner fine piece of business to be in  by this time gabe werner had rolled over and gotten to his feet but instead of coming at jack again he kept at a safe distance in the meanwhile sucking his bruised knuckles and nursing his left ear  we have a right to walk on this street if we want to remarked randy  they were standing right by this window and appeared to be listening to something declared slugger brown  then they must have been listening to what we were saying grumbled jackson  how long were you at this window young fellow demanded jake tate  i guess thats our own business and randys eyes flashed defiance  you want to keep your eyes on those rovers cautioned nappy martell theyre as sly as foxes i know em  and theyll do you harm if they can added slugger brown  he is saying that because we wouldnt stand for any of his underhanded work explained fred  we never did stand for anything that wasnt on the level added andy and looked at carson davenport suggestively  see here young fellow dont you get fresh cried the oil company promoter and then he added with a sneer i reckon youve been listening to more than was good for you  well if you want to know it we heard a few things that surprised us answered jack boldly  what did you hear questioned jake tate quickly  we heard what you had to say about the lorimer spell claim if you must know it retorted fred  yes and we are going to report it to my uncle dick at once said andy  at this the men were evidently much disturbed and tate pulled davenport back and whispered something into his ear then both conferred with jackson in the meantime nappy and slugger came forward again with werner close behind them  you tried to run things to suit yourselves up at colby hall sneered slugger but youll find it a different story down here  dont you dare to tell any stories about us warned nappy if you do youll get in bad mark my words ive stood all im going to stand from your crowd  if you are behaving yourself and trying to earn an honest living well have nothing to say to anybody about your past answered jack the war is over and the question of how you aided those german sympathizers is a thing of the past  dont you trust em growled werner theyll do their level best to get you in bad i know em  you just let me get at you werner and ill show you what ill do retorted jack and made a move in the direction of the fellow and at this the bully lost no time in retreating he was evidently afraid that the rovers would hand him over to the authorities  by this time the men were coming forward again  see here boys we dont want any trouble said carson davenport oilily we were only talking about that lorimer spell claim in a general way ill explain everything to mr rovers satisfaction in the morning i only want to work with him in this matter we could get along so much better than if we worked separately  all right then answered jack you know where my father can be found  you may have got a wrong impression from our talk added jake tate we handle things in a rougher way down in this oil country than you do up in new york davenport will straighten out everything with your father  after this the men continued to talk to the boys for several minutes doing their best to allay the rovers suspicions nappy and slugger listened with interest as did also werner who however kept out of reach of jack and his cousins  we might as well be going nappy said slugger presently and turned and hurried up the narrow street and gabe werner went after them then a moment later the men returned to the restaurant to finish the meal they had begun  i suppose we might as well return to the hotel said jack  right you are declared randy the best thing we can do is to let uncle dick know about this  they found dick rover sitting in a corner of the hotel porch talking to an old oil man to whom he had brought a letter of introduction  this is mr nick ogilvie said jacks father after introducing the boys he will take charge of any operations we may commence in this territory he is an old oil man and knows this district thoroughly  the boys sat down to listen to what the old oil man might have to say mr ogilvie remained the best part of an hour and then went off stating that he would be around again the next day as soon as he had departed the boys making sure that no one else was within hearing told jacks father of all they had learned concerning carson davenport and the men associated with him dick rover listened with intense interest his face clouding as they proceeded  this is certainly news and ill have to investigate it thoroughly he declared when they had finished evidently this carson davenport is a worse sharper than i thought  he says he can explain everything to your satisfaction said jack but i dont see how it can be done  nor i either declared randy my opinion is that they are a bunch of crooks and nothing else  evidently they think they have some sort of claim on the spell land answered dick rover and it is possible that such is a fact because as i said before the title to spells land seemed to be clouded of course i dont know what is in the documents in the safedeposit vault at wichita falls those documents may clear the matter up  then i should think the best thing would be to get those papers said jack  thats what i intend to do  will you see davenport in the morning questioned fred curiously  certainly fred i am not afraid of that crowd and the more they talk the better ill like it for then i can get some sort of line on what they are aiming at  it was some time after breakfast the next morning when carson davenport put in an appearance dick rover was busy writing some letters when he came in and the boys were addressing postcards to their folks and friends davenport was alone  i want to clear up any misunderstanding that may have arisen said the oil well promoter smoothly as he dropped into a chair beside jacks father  there followed a conversation lasting over an hour at first davenport did his best to smooth matters over but gradually as dick rover managed to draw out one fact after another the oil well promoter showed more or less irritation dicks shrewdness bothered him and finally he hardly knew how to proceed  you take it from me rover the only way for us to do is to work this thing together he remarked one claim is just as good as the other and what is the use of our getting into a dispute over it when we are not real certain that there is oil on the land  then you mean to say that you think your claim on the land is just as good as mine asked jacks father  my claim is just as good and maybe better but i dont want to have any trouble i figure that it will cost about thirty thousand dollars to sink a well on that land now why not go in together weve got ten thousand dollars and if youll put up the other twenty thousand we can try our luck and see what comes of it  im not admitting that your claim is a good one answered dick rover ill know more about it in a few days  why what are you going to do  when lorimer spell died he left me everything he possessed and that included some things left in a safe deposit box at a bank in wichita falls i am going to get that box and see if there are any documents in it relating to this claim then ill know exactly how i stand in this matter until that time i shant make any sort of a deal  this was dick rovers final decision so far as it concerned davenport and the latter went off looking anything but pleased  hell get the best of you if he can dad remarked jack after the interview was over  i dont doubt it in the least son  whats the next move if i may ask questioned fred the oil well proposition was beginning to interest him tremendously  i am going to take the first train for wichita falls today answered his uncle i guess you boys can get along here until i get back  how far is that lorimer spell tract of land from here asked randy  about three miles or so  then whats the matter with our walking out there and taking a look around suggested fred weve got the whole day before us  you can do that and welcome said jacks father but take my advice and take a good lunch along because you may not be able to get anything up there i dont know whether there are any farmhouses around or not  an hour later dick rover was off for wichita falls by train then the lads asked the restaurant man to put up a substantial lunch for them and a little later they set off in the direction where the lorimer spell tract was located  around columbina the walking was anything but good but presently they found themselves on a country road which had not been cut up by a steady stream of wagons and automobiles and here they found going better  they had covered about two miles when they came to a bend in the road and there andy called a halt  ive got something in my shoe wait till i take it off he said and sat down on a rock  they were all resting when they saw an automobile truck rumble past them there were three men on the front seat and the lads were very much surprised to see that two of them were jake tate and the man called jackson     chapter xxii  among the oil wells   did you see those fellows exclaimed randy after the automobile truck had rumbled out of sight  i did answered jack they were tate and jackson  can they be going up to the lorimer spell claim exclaimed fred  its possible  i dont think they saw us put in andy lacing up his shoe again  no they didnt seem to look this way at all and anyhow they were too busy talking to notice answered jack  the four rovers continued on their way following the automobile occasionally they met other automobiles as well as wagons some piled high with oildrilling machinery then they came to a place where a pipe line was being constructed  we are certainly in the oil fields announced jack see all the derricks in the distance  beinggood walkers it did not take the boys long to reach the spell tract of land to make sure that they had found the right spot they asked an old teamster who was at the roadside mending a harness  yes thats lorimer spells groundor at least it was his ground before he was killed there is the old shack just as he left it  the boys walked over to the house which stood among some low bushes it was a dilapidated structure and had evidently been out of repair for several years most of the windows were gone and the front door stood wide open as was to be expected the four rooms the house contained were empty save for some straw on the floor and a pile of halfburnt sticks on the open hearth  some thieves must have come along and taken whatever there was of furniture observed jack  yes and somebody has been using it for a place to bunk in added fred but i dont believe they have been here within the last few days he added with a look at the ashes on the hearth  from the house the boys proceeded to look around the farm or ranch if such it might be called it was irregular in shape one corner running over a hill and down towards a small brook here to their surprise they saw a pile of oildrilling machinery and a number of posts had been set up on one of the posts was a placard reading      the carson davenport claim keep off  what do you know about this cried jack his eyes blazing  lets knock the sign down suggested fred quickly  no we wont do thatat least not yet fred well wait until my father comes with those papers from wichita falls  in the soft soil they could see numerous tracks of automobiles and wagons which had passed that way one of these tracks was fresh  ill bet that auto with tate and jackson was here just before we came cried randy those fellows are certainly on the job they probably believe that possession is nine points of the law  and it may be down here said jack his face clouding the authorities havent things under their control in a wild country like this as they have in and around the big cities  there were no oil wells near the spell tract and to get to the nearest the lads had to tramp over another hill a distance of more than a quarter of a mile here they found several wells in operation the combined flow of which they were told amounted to about four hundred barrels per day  not so bad when you consider this oil is worth about two dollars and a half a barrel remarked jack  that makes a thousand dollars a day returned fred gee just think of taking in that much every twentyfour hours  the boys were told that another well was to be shot off that afternoon this was located about half a mile away and they resolved to visit the place first however stopping by the roadside for lunch they were told where they could get a drink of water  phew how it smells of oil remarked randy turning up his nose at the dose  i guess well get our fill of oil before we get through randy laughed jack some of these neighborhoods are saturated with oil from end to end the houses and barns are full of it and so are the roads and they tell me even the things in the diningrooms and bedrooms smell of oil  and just see how black the stuff is declared fred it doesnt look one bit like the oil we are used to using it certainly needs a lot of refining  and just think of the hundred and one things that come from it said jack kerosene and gasoline and benzine and naphtha and paraffin and i dont know what all  the middle of the afternoon found them at the place where the new well was to be brought inthat is provided everything went well the the head workman told them with a grin he was a goodnatured irishman with body and clothing saturated with oil from head to foot  tis not a noice way av makin a livin he announced but tis clane money one gits in his pocket  yes and you havent got to stay here forever answered jack with a smile after youve made your pile you can go to some place more agreeable  sure an thats true son so tis said the foreman  he explained to them how the well had been drilled and how the charges had been lowered they had tested out the well at eighteen hundred feet but without success now they were down twentysix hundred feet and the indications for oil were decidedly good  at length came the moment for shooting off the well some of the woodwork surrounding the derrick had been removed and all the electric connections were pronounced in good working order then the boys and the others who had assembled were ordered back to a safe distance  it was a thrilling moment and no one felt it more than the four rovers they waited a few minutes and then came a dull rumble shaking the ground as if by an earthquake then they saw something shoot skyward and then came a sudden rain of black oil flying and spattering in all directions  theyve struck it theyve struck it yelled andy excitedly theyve struck oil  gee but ill bet that makes them feel good announced fred that well must have cost a lot of money  forty thousand dollars the foreman said came from jack come on let us get back unless we want our clothing ruined for the wind was shifting and sending a fine spray of oil in their direction  it was hard work to control the flow of oil and the men around the new well had to work like trojans the black mass was flowing off in a depression of the ground which had been dammed around to receive it  it certainly is a great proceeding was freds comment when they finally turned away and started on their return to columbina i dont wonder that those men get interested it certainly is the greatest gamble of the age one minute you have nothing and the next if you are lucky the oil is pouring thousands of dollars into your pocket every week  its the land of luck all right enough answered fred  and you mustnt forget one thing added jack there are just as many failures as there are successes there have been millions and millions of dollars sunk in texas oklahoma and kansas and some promoters havent got even a smell of oil for their money  when the lads returned to the hotel they found that several letters had come in for them one was from jacks sister and this he read with interest and then passed it around to his cousins to peruse  in her letter martha wrote that she had heard from ruth stevensons mother who stated that ruths eyes were not in as good shape as the local doctor had hoped for and he had advised that a specialist be consulted  gee thats the worst yet said jack and his face showed his concern poor ruth i do hope she comes out of it all right and that very soon  both jack and the others would have been more concerned had they known the truth which was that ruth had already been placed in the care of an eye specialist and been removed to that physicians private sanitarium pressed to tell the exact truth by mr stevenson the specialist had admitted that ruths eyes had suffered exceedingly and that she was in danger of losing the sight of one of them and that that might possibly affect the other as mrs stevenson was very nervous already the doctor had advised her husband to keep the truth to himself for the present and hope for the best  among the other letters received was one forwarded by mary to her brother fred this was from gif garrison and in the communication gif told how he had heard in a roundabout way of nappy and slugger                                       it seems that there was once a man named davenport in business with mr martell wrote gif this davenport is now down in the oil fields of texas and he has agreed so i understand to give nappy and slugger a chance to work for a company he has formed so they are likely down there and maybe you will meet them they also say that glutts and werner used to correspond with nappy and slugger so that it is just possible they will go down there too  well glutts isnt here said fred with a grin i guess that mixup in new york was too much for him  if those fellows want to work for carson davenport they can do so said jack but theyve got to keep their distancewerner especially  late that evening there came a telegram for jack it was from his father announcing the fact that he would have to remain in wichita falls for a day or two  perhaps hes got to fix up some legal matters in connection with this spell claim suggested fred  there was not much to interest the boys around columbina and the next day hung rather heavily on their hands they visited the general stores and also walked over to the depot and watched two of the trains come in they saw carson davenport alight from one and hurry away as rapidly as possible carrying a gladstone bag with him  hello i wonder if he has been to wichita falls too cried jack  he certainly came from that direction answered fred but you must remember there are lots of other towns along the line  the following afternoon found the four boys on a highway leading from columbina to derrickville they had fallen in with an old oil prospector who knew nick ogilvie well and this prospector had offered to take them over to derrickville in his fivepassenger touringcar  its a great sight around derrickville said the man there are hundreds of oil wells in that vicinity its about the busiest place for miles around  warned by their previous experience the boys had purchased some overalls and plain caps and these they donned to protect their other clothing they found the road to derrickville deep in mud and more than once it looked as if the car in which they were riding would get stuck but mr bradley was a good driver and always managed somehow to get through  it aint like driving on broadway he grinned but weve got to make the best of it  two hours later found the rovers in derrickville they were left to shift for themselves mr bradley stating he would take them back to columbina at five oclock they visited a dozen wells or more and also the pumping station connected with a large pipe line and then walked over to where the drilling of some new wells was in progress  look shouted fred suddenly look am i mistaken or is that phil franklin over there  he pointed to a distance and then he and the others hurried to the spot there looking at the work which was going on around a new well were the man and the boy they had once rescued from the freshet on the rick rack river     chapter xxiii  a queer summons   am i seeing straight and is it really the rovers exclaimed john franklin when confronted by the boys  you are seeing straight enough mr franklin answered fred as he shook hands first with the father and then the son is your claim around here  no our claim is some miles from here answered john franklin its at a place called pottown  ive heard of that place said jack as he too shook hands as did the others they say there are quite a few oil wells in that neighborhood  what have you done about your claim if i may ask questioned randy  oh ive got myself all straightened out said mr franklin with a broad smile you see when i got down here i played in luck right from the start those swindlers had got tired of trying to do something on my farm and then i ran into an old friend of mine who was a lawyer he took the matter up for me and the swindlers got scared and all of them quit the claim over night so i am now in sole possession  and have you struck oil asked jack  no i havent got that far yet but i have great hopes of going ahead you see im handicapped for money i could get some capitalists interested but they generally want the lions share of the proceeds and that i dont want to give them  i dont blame you said fred you ought to get the most of the money if the oil is found on your land  im telling dad to take his time put in phil franklin the land wont run away and the more oil wells that are producing around us the more valuable our place will become  but what brought you young fellows down here questioned the man are you on a sightseeing tour  not altogether answered jack my father is interested in a claim down here and he allowed us to come along with him and thereupon he gave some of the particulars  john franklin listened attentively to the story and his eyes flashed angrily when the names of tate and jackson were mentioned  those are the swindlers who were trying to do me out of my property he ejaculated and im of the opinion this carson davenport was in with them they are a bunch of crooks and nothing else they ought all to be in prison  well theyll land there sooner or later if they dont look out returned fred  if i was your father i would have nothing to do with this davenport or the men acting with him went on mr franklin to jack  do you know anything at all about the lorimer spell claim  i dont know anything about what has happened lately so far as that claim is concerned was john franklins reply but i do know when oil was first discovered in this region some of the experts went over the whole territory carefully and they did not consider the spell claim as being of any value thats the reason no wells were located there they claimed that the geological formation was not good for oil  oh then you mean to say there is no oil on that claim questioned fred disappointedly  i dont know anything about it lad i am only telling you what the experts said those fellows miss it once in a while just the same as other people at the same time if an expert doesnt think ground is worth drilling for oil you can make up your mind that the chances of striking it rich there are very slim  but are you sure the experts went over it very carefully questioned andy  i am  and who were they  they were from wichita fallsa firm by the name of fitch and lunberry  then probably if my father wanted it he could get a report from fitch and lunberry said jack  i think he couldprovided of course he was willing to pay for it these experts dont work for nothing and john franklin grinned  if you stay down here any length of time i wish youd come over to our place and see us said phil franklin  well be sure to do that answered randy  maybe i can get your uncle interested in my land suggested mr franklin i wish hed look it over it wouldnt cost him anything  ill speak to dad about it answered jack quickly there was something about the franklins which had pleased him ever since he had first known them they appeared to be perfectly honest and reliable  accompanied by the franklins the rovers tramped around the various oil wells located in and near derrickville mr franklin understood a great deal about the wells and the machinery and explained these things in an interesting way so the afternoon passed quickly almost before they knew it the rovers had to say goodbye and start on the return trip with mr bradley  gee i wonder if what mr franklin said about the spell claim can be true remarked jack on the way to columbina  he ought to know what he is talking about jack answered fred and certainly he had no axe to grind in the matter he doesnt want to see uncle dick throw his money away  two more days passed and still dick rover did not return from wichita falls the boys went out sightseeing and amused themselves as best they could but this was not saying much the most fun they had was in a shootinggallery where they astonished the proprietor by the bullseyes they made  you young fellows are some shots said he you must be used to guns  we are answered fred  the four rovers had gone into the target gallery directly after supper and while it was still light now when they came out jack suggested that they return to the hotel  we might send out a letter or two he suggested and id like to look over a newspaper if i can find one  the rovers were heading in the direction of the hotel when glancing across the street they saw nappy martell and slugger brown  they seem to be watching us declared jack  probably theyd like to know what we intend to do answered randy i think we might as well ignore them he went on as he saw nappy and slugger crossing the muddy roadway  hello called slugger coolly weve been looking for you fellows  looking for us exclaimed fred  yes we found out you were not at the hotel and so we thought you must be somewhere around town  what do you want of us demanded jack suspiciously  we came to see you on gabe werners account answered nappy as he spoke he showed that he was nervous  on gabe werners account what do you mean  i guess you had better ask gabe about that answered slugger hes very anxious to see all of youwants to see you this evening too  where is he  we left him at a house up on the derrickville road its about half a mile or so out of town answered slugger  is he sick questioned fred  hes worse than thathes down and out answered nappy but he said to tell all of you that he wanted to see you this evening surethat tomorrow morning wouldnt do  see here nappy is this some sort of trick demanded jack bluntly if it is i want to tell you right now it wont work  its no trick how could it be we are all alone and were not armed we are doing this solely because gabe werner asked us to do it he couldnt come himself not with a broken leg  oh then he has broken his leg has he said andy with something of sympathy in his voice that of course is another matter he turned to the others im willing to go and see him if you are  all right lets go put in fred  well go said jack after a few whispered words to randy but you remember what i said both of you if this is a trick well see to it that you get the worst of it  youll find out that its no trick as soon as you get to the house declared slugger brown  he and nappy martell led the way and soon the whole crowd had left columbina behind and were trudging along the muddy road leading to derrickville the way was dark and anything but inviting and all of them made slow progress  the house is over there in the field said slugger presently as he came to a halt you neednt be afraid because there are only a very old man and a woman living there gabe werner has been boarding with them since he came down here  are you fellows working for carson davenport questioned randy  we expect to work for him yes but nothing has been settled as yet answered nappy he has offered us thirty dollars a week but we think we can get more than that elsewhere he added loftily  and what of werner is he going to work with you  that was the idea answered slugger but i dont know what hell do now hes certainly in bad shape  how did he get his leg broken  he didnt tell us a word about it answered nappy there is something queer about the whole transaction but he said he must see all of you rovers and do it tonight what hes got on his mind i dont know  the rovers hardly knew what to do they were unarmed and the place certainly looked like a lonely one they wondered if it would be possible for carson davenport and his crowd to be at the house waiting for them  you and slugger go ahead jack said well follow behind and mark you no tricks  there is nothing to be afraid of slugger assured him and then he and nappy stalked off in the fastgathering darkness they walked up to the lonely house and disappeared around a corner of the building  say jack this doesnt look right to me at all announced fred i wish i had a pistol  im going to arm myself with a club said randy and looked around for such a weapon  the others did the same two of them picking up sticks and the others arming themselves with stones then they advanced with caution keeping their eyes wide open for the appearance of anything that might look dangerous  i dont see any light around the place announced jack as they drew closer  i wonder what became of nappy and slugger broke in fred i dont see them anywhere  suppose we call them suggested andy  let us walk around the house first returned his twin they may have gone in by the back way most of the folks living around here use the back door for everything  with added caution the rover boys walked slowly around one side of the building in the rear they found everything as dark and deserted as in the front  this is certainly strange announced jack he advanced and knocked sharply on the closed door  there was no reply and he knocked a second time then randy beat upon the door with his stick  it looks to me as if there wasnt a soul in the place announced andy i wonder what has become of nappy and slugger  see here will you cried fred suddenly it looks to me as if nobody lived here every one of the windows is boarded up on the inside i believe this house is being used for nothing but a storehouse i dont believe a soul lives here  hello nappy hello slugger called out jack loudly where are you  to this call there was no reply     chapter xxiv  dick rovers revelation   weve been tricked exclaimed randy  just what i think burst out fred they didnt bring us here to see gabe werner at all  there isnt a soul around the building thats certain remarked andy what do you suppose has become of nappy and slugger  the rovers looked around in the fastgathering darkness but could see no one then they walked around the building several times peering in all directions for a sight of the fellows who had brought them on this strange mission  its a storehouse right enough announced jack and my opinion is that everything is nailed up except the front door and that as you can see has a padlock on it  it was certainly a mystery and for the time being the rover boys were unable to solve it looking down on the ground they saw a number of footprints but it was now too dark to follow any of these  wish we had brought a pocket flashlight along remarked fred  its getting as dark as a stack of black cats said andy  yes and we had better be getting back to town before it gets so dark we lose our way returned jack  as it was they had some difficulty in finding the path down to the road then they stumbled along in the darkness occasionally heading into some mud hole up to their ankles  nappy and slugger certainly have the laugh on us for this said fred as they plowed along maybe they thought we would lose our way completely in this darkness  it was a good halfhour before the rovers reached the outskirts of columbina at a great distance they could see many twinkling electric lights one of which hung on the top of every oil derrick but these were so far off they did nothing towards illuminating the way  almost ten oclock announced jack consulting his watch about all we can do is to clean the mud from our shoes and go to bed  there was a sleepy young clerk behind the counter of the hotel and he showed them where they could clean up  no bootblacks in columbina said randy with a grin and then all set to work with a whisk broom and brushes to clean up  i wonder if uncle dick will get in tonight remarked fred the last train to stop at columbina was due in fifteen minutes  i think ill stay up and find out said jack  you waiting for mr rover demanded the boy behind the counter as he yawned and stretched himself if you are he came in a couple of hours ago  is that so cried jack in surprise where is he now  i think hes up in his room although im not sure you see i was out to a dance last night and im pretty tired and i fell asleep a couple of times sitting here doing nothing somehow or other it seems to be an off night around this hotel nothing doing at all and the sleepy clerk yawned again  maybe hes up in his room looking over those papers he brought suggested randy come on up and see  all mounted the stairs to the third floor of the hotel when they reached the room occupied by dick rover they found the door locked and a rap upon it brought no response  he isnt here thats sure said jack maybe he went out on an errand  unless hes in our room said fred in the larger apartment which the four boys occupied there was a small table and jacks father had several times come in to use this for writing purposes  jack had one of the keys to the room and stepping across the hallway he attempted to insert this in the lock much to his surprise the key would not go into the keyhole  that is strange he began and then tried the door to find it unlocked another key was on the inside  the room was pitch dark only a dim lamp being lighted in the rear of the long hallway jack stepped forward to get a match from a bureau and as he did so he stumbled over something on the floor and pitched headlong  oh he gasped and then gave a sudden shudder for he had felt the body of someone beside him be careful he went on make a light quick here is someone on the floor im afraid its dad  the others piled into the room and randy who happened to have some matches in his pocket struck a light and lit the lamp  there on the floor of the bedroom lay dick rover there was a small cut on his left temple from which the blood was flowing he was breathing heavily and evidently trying to speak  dad dad what happened to you cried jack hoarsely as he bent over and raised his parent up  hes been hurt exclaimed fred see the cut on his forehead waitill get some water  he made a dash for the pitcher and also for a towel and while jack supported his father on his arm the others bathed dick rovers face and washed away the trickling blood  hes been hit declared randy see the lump on the back of his head and he pointed it out  presently dick rover opened his eyes and stared vacantly at the anxious lads  whatwhatwhat happened to me he stammered and gave a gasp whowho knocked me down  that we dont know dad answered jack and he was glad to realize that his parent was coming to his senses gee i was afraid you had been killed  the four boys raised dick rover up and laid him on one of the cots they had a little firstaid kit with them and from this they got some plaster with which they bound up the small cut  it was some time before dick rover felt able to tell his story in the meanwhile fred dashed downstairs for some hot water which was applied to the lump on the sufferers head  i guess ill get over it said jacks father with a wan smile but they certainly did give it to me then he gave a sudden start what about my papers are they safe  the boys looked around but saw no papers of any kind in the room  i had them in my bag i brought them in here to look them over and to do some writing at the table  well theres no bag here now or papers either announced randy  then those rascals must have taken them that was probably why they knocked me down they wanted to rob me  but who attacked you dad questioned jack  that i dont know son i was seated at the table with the open bag beside me and was looking over some of the documents i had brought from the safe deposit vault in wichita falls when i heard a noise behind me near the door i was just about to get up to see what it meant when all of a sudden i received a terrible crack on the back of the head i turned around and then somebody aimed another blow at me that caught me on the left temple then everything seemed to dance before my eyes and i guess i must have gone down in a heap on the floor and thats all i knew until i found you supporting me and bathing my forehead  it must have been those oilwell fellows ejaculated fred  i think i see a light almost shouted jack nappy and slugger were in this plot they made us go away out of town just so we wouldnt be here with my dad when the other fellows attacked him  i guess youre right answered randy  whats this you are saying questioned dick rover rather feebly  in a few words the boys explained the trick nappy martell and slugger brown had played on them  yes i guess you are right it must have been a part of the game said jacks father and are you sure my bag and everything that was in it are gone  yes there isnt a single paper in this room answered jack and when we came up we found the door to your room locked so it isnt likely they are there  they must have dug out the minute they knocked me over and got the papers answered dick rover probably they were afraid you or somebody else might come up and catch them at their dastardly work as it is it is queer somebody didnt see them  there happens to be no one down in the office but the young clerk and hes half asleep answered randy besides that those fellows may have come in by the back way did you catch sight of them at all  i cant say that i did randy the first blow dazed me and while i remember something of two or three forms it is all so vague that it amounts to nothing i rather think however that there were at least three men  and if there were ill bet a new hat those men were davenport tate and jackson returned jack firmly  you may be right son but you know what they say in court it is one thing to know the truth and quite another to be able to prove it  but who would want to steal those papers if not davenport and his crowd questioned randy and then he added hurriedly did they rob you of anything else uncle dick  i dont think so dick rover felt in his pockets no my money and watch and my diamond ring are all safe if they had been ordinary thieves they would certainly have taken everything of value  our baggage doesnt seem to be disturbed said andy who was looking around i guess you are rightthey were after those documents and nothing else  there was a pause and suddenly the boys saw a queer smile pass over dick rovers face and then he uttered a peculiar whistle  what is it dad said jack wonderingly he knew that his father had a habit of whistling in that fashion when something struck him as funny  i was just thinking that perhaps those fellows who robbed me had taken a white elephant off my hands returned dick rover  why what do you mean by white elephant questioned andy  i mean that maybe they are fighting tooth and nail to get possession of something which i might be only too glad to give them for nothing  oh dad are you talking about the lorimer spell claim questioned jack  yes  but i dont understand  of course you dont but maybe you will after ive told my story as you know i went to wichita falls mainly to get the documents which lorimer spell had stored away in the safe deposit vault of a bank there well i got the documents and in looking them over found that while lorimer spells claim to the land seemed to be fairly well established still there was something of a cloud to the titlethe cloud of which carson davenport and his crowd are taking advantage but more than that i found that a firm of oil experts named fitch and lunberry had gone over the property both for spell and for an oil promoter who had thought to put some money into operations there so then i called on the firm and had a long talk with mr fitch  and what did mr fitch have to say about the land asked jack quickly  he was very frank to say that in his opinion there was no oil of any kind on the claim he told me that he knew lorimer spell very well and that while spell was all right in the main he had been daffy on the subject of oil so much so that it had just about turned the poor fellows brain until he imagined that there was fabulous wealth in oil on every acre he possessed mr fitch got down to facts and figures and showed me all of his deductions and he said that it was his honest opinion that any money spent on the lorimer spell claim would be utterly wasted     chapter xxv  davenports accusation   then the lorimer spell claim is positively no good exclaimed jack  i wouldnt say that exactly jack no claim down here can be said to be worthless until it has actually been bored for oil it is just possible that those oil experts may be mistaken at the same time from what mr fitch said i would be very slow about putting money in that land  its too bad uncle dick if that claims no good when we all supposed it would be so wonderful came from fred and his face showed his disappointment  well i havent lost anything answered his uncle dick i feel a great deal better than if i had sunk thirty or forty thousand dollars in a dry hole  andy began to snicker  gee its rich uncle dick to pass davenport and that crowd the white elephant he chuckled i only hope they get bit bad especially if they were the rascals who came here and knocked you out  they must have been the crowd because no one else would be interested in those documents they knew i was going to wichita falls to get them and they probably hung around waiting for my return and they probably got martell and brown to get you boys out of the way the story about gabe werner having a broken leg was probably faked up  nappy admitted that he and slugger expected to work for the davenport crowd said jack they are all tarred with the same stick and i hope they get stuck bad  uncle dick why dont you pretend to be terribly put out over the fact that you have lost your interest in the claim cried andy that will throw them completely off the track let them imagine that you think there is a lot of oil to be found there  ill think it over and at the same time ill think over what other investments i might make while im down here but just at present i think ill try to get a good nights sleep and reduce this swelling on my head added jacks father as he felt of the bump tenderly  i know one person who would like you to interest yourself in his claim exclaimed jack that is mr john franklin the man we saved from drowning in the rick rack river freshet  thereupon the boys told of their meeting with mr franklin and phil and also related what particulars they knew concerning the mans land and how he had gotten it out of the clutches of the oil sharpers  that might be worth looking into said dick rover ill take it up a little later after i feel better and after i have had it out with davenport and his crowd  the boys assisted jacks father to his room and jack aided him in retiring meanwhile randy went down to interview the sleepy hotel clerk  that fellow doesnt know a thing about what happened announced randy on his return those men must have come in and gone out while he was taking a snooze and as luck would have it for those rascals no one else seems to have been around  with nothing of special importance to do the whole crowd slept late on the following morning which was sunday dick rover was glad to take it easy but declined to have a physician when that was suggested  it was only an ordinary blow and did nothing more than knock me out for a little while said he the swelling on my head is gradually going down and that little cut on the temple doesnt amount to much  those men ought all to be put in prison burst out fred  possibly you are right fred but you must remember that you are now in a section of the country where living is rather rough a new oil town and a new mining camp are pretty much on the same level you often have to take the law into your own hands and fight your way through the best you can later there will be regular law and order and then matters will run more smoothly  dick rover did not mention the matter to the boys but from that day on he went armed resolved to take no more chances should any of the oil land swindlers attack him again  two more days passed and during that time the boys visited a number of localities in that vicinity trying to catch sight of nappy and slugger and also werner but those three unworthies did not show themselves  they know weve got it in for them declared jack theyll keep in hiding until they think this affair has blown over  on the third day dick rover felt quite like himself and he hired an automobile to take him and the boys as well as nick ogilvie to the lorimer spell claim somewhat to his surprise he found carson davenport on the land along with tate and jackson and half a dozen other men more oilwell machinery had been brought up and dumped in a spot near the brook  whats the meaning of this davenport questioned jacks father shortly  it means that im going to work on my own hook rover answered davenport and there was a sneer in his voice ive got tired of trying to make a deal with you and ive come to the conclusion that your claim is no good  i think i understand you perfectly answered dick rover and looked at the man so sharply that davenport had to drop his eyes you think you have everything your own way eh  never mind what i think if youve got any real claim on this property you show the evidences that little paper that lorimer spell wrote out on the battlefield of france doesnt hold water with me youve got to show me the deeds and all that sort of thing  a man cant show papers when he has been robbed of them went on jacks father pointedly  humph so thats your latest story is it rover first when i asked you for the papers you said they were in a safe deposit vault in wichita falls  so they were but now i have been robbed of them and you know it  i know it say rover are you going crazy i dont know any such thing and now davenport put on an assumption of anger  i say you do know ityou and your whole crowd retorted dick rover this land is a tract said to be full of oil and you want to do me out of my rights and now jacks father appeared to warm up  rover ive had enough of your bluffing and i wont stand for any more of it cried carson davenport you may be able to put up a big front with some folks but it wont go with me i claim that this land is mine and i wont pay any more attention to what you say until you produce those precious papers that you have said so much about and even then i may not listen to you my private opinion is that the army authorities ought to take up your case and make an example of you went on the oil promoter with more of a sneer than before  the army authorities questioned dick rover puzzled  thats what i said ive heard a thing or two about you it was all well enough for you to pull spell in and get a medal for doing it but when that poor fool wrote out a socalled will leaving you everything he possessed i reckon he rather put his foot into it finished davenport significantly  jacks father and the boys were of course astonished and even davenports companions showed that this was something they had not been expecting the men crowded around to find out what was coming next  davenport ill have to ask you to explain yourself exclaimed dick rover and strode forward his eyes flashing  want me to explain myself do you cried the oil promoter savagely all right then i will according to reports lorimer spell ran out ahead of you in that fight and then he was shot in the back do you understand thatshot in the back well who did it certainly not the germans they were in front of him  do you mean to insinuate that i or one of our other men shot spell demanded dick rover and now his face was almost white  he had made a will in your favoryou were the only one to profit by his death  you cur you cried dick rover and beside himself with righteous anger he sprang forward and planted a blow on carson davenports chin that made the oil well promoter stagger back and fall flat  hi hi none of that around here bellowed jake tate and caught dick rover by the arm  you get back there was the quick reply this is none of your affair this man has accused me of something and he is going to take it back  you let my father alone broke in jack and rushed toward tate followed by randy and nick ogilvie then the fellow fell back jackson viewed the contest in silence  by this time carson davenport was struggling to his feet he was in a terrible rage and came at dick rover blusteringly  what do you mean by hitting me that way rover he howled  you take back what you said davenport if you dont ill give you another one exclaimed jacks father  ill take back nothing  all right thenhere goes and once more dick rovers fist shot out and again the oil well promoter measured his length on the ground  this time as he arose he put his hand behind him in his hip pocket but before he could draw any weapon if such was his intention dick rover was on him and had his arms pinioned  therell be no shooting here davenport you try it and youll get the worst of it now then you take back what you said and dick rover shoved his clenched fist under the others nose  carson davenport could bluster but at heart he was more or less of a coward he tried to retreat and as jacks father followed him up he mumbled some words about there being a mistake and that he had not meant to say just what jacks father had imagined  poor lorimer spell was shot by the huns said dick rover for the benefit of the other men standing around he had gone on ahead of our party and then finding out his mistake he was in the act of turning around to get back in line when the shot struck him that killed him to say that he was shot down by any of his own crowd is a wicked falsehood half a dozen men of our command can prove every word of what i have said  youll rue the day you pitched into me rover grumbled davenport but took good care to keep out of reach  you brought it on yourself retorted jacks father and now as for this claim he added after a slight pause as all of my papers have been stolen i presume i can do nothing even though this land may be the most valuable in oil in this vicinity but i will watch the turn of affairs and if i get a chance to prove anything ill do it  you show me your papers and if they are all right ill see that you get what is coming to you mumbled davenport but just the same let me repeati dont believe there are any papers the whole thing was a fakedup story to get me to give up my claim davenport was nursing his bruised chin and dont forget that you knocked me down when you had no right to do it he added uglily  are you going to sink a well here  thats our business  whats the use of trying to hide it anyhow put in jake tate yes were going to sink a well here just as soon as we can get our machinery in working order  and were going to do it with our own money were not asking any assistance from you added jackson  all right then go ahead said dick rover i have no more to sayat least for the present and then motioning to the four boys and nick ogilvie to follow him he withdrew     chapter xxvi  news of ruth   i guess they are pretty sure there is oil on that land chuckled andy as the whole party got aboard the automobile and started back for town  i hope they sink about a hundred thousand dollars in that ground and get nothing for their trouble added his twin  gee dad you certainly did soak davenport a couple cried jack admiringly  i did it on the spur of the moment son i couldnt help it declared dick rover it was too great an insult to pass unnoticed  and to think he didnt have the nerve to fight back added fred i didnt imagine he was such a coward  well i was surprised at that myself answered his uncle with something of a smile but now listen to me boys he added seriously dont think because i flew into davenport that that is the right thing to do under all circumstances he simply got me going before i knew it ordinarily fighting doesnt pay and i want you to know it  but uncle dick that wasnt a fightthat was only a good spanking said andy and at this all the others had to snicker  i reckon davenport knew he was in the wrong when he made that dirty remark came from nick ogilvie why in these parts many a man would have shot him down for those words i dont wonder your father flew into him he should have been licked until he was a fit subject for the hospital  do you think i am doing right to let them work the claim questioned jacks father  i certainly do mr rover i want to get busy and earn the salary you have promised me but i wouldnt want to start operations anywhere on that spell claim i know it has been thoroughly gone over by both fitch and lunberry and both of those men are as good experts as you can find anywhere  well that forces me out of business for the time being ogilvie ill have to look around a little and see if it is worth while for me to take hold elsewhere i presume all the really good claims around here have been covered  i dont know as to that mr rover you see lots of the ranches havent been investigated very thoroughly a fellow hits oil in one place and the whole gang follow him like a lot of sheep and in doing that they may be passing by something a good deal better  dad why not look into this claim the franklins own came from jack  are you talking of john franklin questioned nick ogilvie  yes  i thought that claim was in the hands of some other fellowstate jackson and that crowd  they did make a claim on it so mr franklin says but he managed in some way or other to get them out of it i guess they left it mostly because they thought they could do better on the spell place  well i dont know anything about john franklins place but i do know hes a decent sort of fellow and id like to see him do well  if you are satisfied that mr fitch is all right dad why not have him make a survey of the franklin place suggested jack  perhaps ill do thatafter ive had a talk with franklin answered his father  dick rover was not a person to waste time and he sought out john franklin and his son phil the very next day and had a long talk with the pair then on the monday following he visited the franklin farm taking nick ogilvie and two other oil men with him the boys wished to go along but to this jacks father demurred  i dont want too much of a crowd along he said if anything comes of it you can visit the place later at present you had better try to amuse yourselves around the town and do try to keep out of trouble he added with a smile  left to themselves the four young rovers visited the railroad station and then drifted into the shooting gallery here they got up a little contest among themselves shooting at the longest range target the gallery afforded in this contest which lasted the best part of an hour jack came out ahead making seventeen bullseyes out of a possible twentyfive next to him came randy with a score of fifteen  say what kind of a prize do i get questioned andy who had hit the bullseye but nine times two less than fred  you get a decorated cabbage head andy replied his twin a cabbage head and two lemons  i dont care i saved the target for the man anyway grinned the funloving rover the one jack shot at is all mussed up and at this sally the others had to laugh  after lunch the boys sat down to write some letters and to read some newspapers which had just come in in the news was word of some big oil well strikes at a place about forty miles distant  gosh look at this will you cried fred pointing to the article two wells just came in and each of them good for twelve hundred barrels of oil a day now thats what i call something like  wouldnt it be glorious if my dad could strike something like that  i wish we could hit half a dozen wells then our dads could start the rover oil company wed make money hand over fist wouldnt that be grand  you keep on and youll be dreaming of oil laughed jack  it certainly is the land of luck returned randy  it doesnt look like the land of luck for this fellow remarked fred pointing to a ragged and unkempt individual who had just entered the reading room of the hotel the man was about middle age and had a most decidedly dejected appearance  i was wondering if you young gents couldnt aid me a little he whined coming up to jack and randy ive been playing in mighty hard luck lately i havent had a square meal in two days  whats the mattercant you get a job asked jack  job what do you mean questioned the unkempt individual in wonder  if youre out of luck why dont you go to work  say maybe you dont know who i am exclaimed the man indignantly  youre right there who are you  i am wellington jonkers the man who opened the little kitty and the fat herring you must have heard about those properties we sold eighty thousand shares of one and sixty thousand shares of the other  what at questioned randy two cents a share  no sir those shares went for twenty and twentyfive cents said the man and then lowering his voice to a confidential tone he continued if you young gents can stake me to a hundred or two i can put you wise to the biggest proposition in oil down herea proposition that is bound to bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars three months after its started ive got everything fixed to go right ahead you just put up the two hundred and ill show you some facts and figures that will open your eyes ive got the real dope and  you poor fish you exclaimed jack what do you take us for anyhow  he and the others had seen this type of oil well community parasite before in the restaurant attached to the hotel and also at the railroad station and at the shooting gallery they had met more than one slick individual who had wanted to put them wise to the biggest oil proposition imaginable all for the small sum of from two cents to fifty cents per share in oil wells with such fanciful names as sure winner daylight luck and sunshine sally  then you dont want to go into a real good thing said the man his face falling  not with you  the man turned away but then turned back  say you couldnt lend me five dollars until tonight could you im a little short my pard will be back on the sevenfifteen train and then ill be all fixed again  i havent anything for you answered jack shortly  and neither have i added randy and then lighting a cigarette the man shuffled away to see if he could not find some victims elsewhere  theres your land of luck from another angle remarked jack what pests those fellows are  well i suppose they start in with all sorts of hopes jack and then they sink lower and lower as nothing proves lucky answered his cousin  the boys were waiting for the mail and presently it came in there were letters for all of them some from home and others from their chums who were now enjoying themselves in various places dan soppinger had gone to atlantic city while ned lowe and walt baxter were on an island in casco bay on the maine coast gif was visiting spouter and his folks in a camp at lake george  ill bet theyre having a lot of fun at lake george remarked fred swimming and motorboating and all that  fred is thinking of may returned andy with a grin  aw you cut that out andy retorted his cousin growing slightly red in the face you know youd like to be up there yourself  one of jacks letters was from gif and in that his chum mentioned the fact that ruth was still in the care of the eye specialist and that her case was a very serious one he told jack much more than martha had let out and this news made the oldest rover boy worry greatly  its a terrible thing he confided to randy just suppose poor ruth should go blind and he shuddered  oh jack i dont believe its as bad as all that cried his cousin why ruth was almost over it when we came away from school  no she wasnt thats just the trouble the doctor up there evidently didnt give her enough careor at least just the right kind of care of course he did the best he knew how but he wasnt an expert in that line after ruth got home her eyes must have developed some new trouble all of course on account of that pepper werner threw  it was a rotten thing for werner to do declared randy his eyes flashing really do you know jack i think we should have had him arrested for it  hell certainly have to account to the stevensons if ruth goes blindhe and his father i believe the stevensons could sue mr werner for big damages  of course they could  that certainly is a terrible affair remarked fred who had been perusing gifs letter i think we ought to round werner up and give it to him good and plenty he deserves the licking of his life  the question iswhere is werner put in andy  if he is still around columbina he must be with nappy and slugger said randy but its just possible that he has cleared out thinking that we might hand him over to the authorities  i cant understand what would possess a fellow to do such a dirty thing as that was freds comment why he might have blinded jack as well as ruth and by the way jack how do your eyes feel  they feel just about as usual at first they felt rather scratchy and watery but now i havent noticed anything unusual for some timein fact never since we came down to texas but you see i got very little of the pepper the most of it went over my shoulder and right into poor ruths eyes  the boys discussed the matter for some time and then turned to finish the letters they had started to write soon the twins and fred were deep in their writing but jack could not settle himself to put down a word his mind was with ruth what if the girl he thought so much of should go blind it was a thought that chilled him to the heart     chapter xxvii  caught by the enemy   dick rover did not return to the hotel until late that evening the boys were waiting for him and jack noted that his fathers face wore a smile of satisfaction  i think i have struck something worth while said he i have been over the franklin claim very carefully with nick ogilvie and the two men he recommended and as a result i have already telegraphed for mr fitch to come here  then ogilvie and the others think there is oil on that claim questioned randy quickly  they say the indications are very good in fact one of the men was very enthusiastic and he was willing to put up five thousand dollars toward boring a well in one spot that he picked out  that certainly shows he must have faith in it remarked fred  when do you expect mr fitch asked andy  i asked him to come over as soon as possibletomorrow if he could  do you think you can make some kind of a reasonable arrangement with mr franklin in case the oil experts report is good asked jack  yes i found mr franklin a very fair man of course he would like to get as much as possible out of any deal that is made but he is reasonable and has agreed to give me entire charge of the matter and take his pay at the rate of oneeighth of all the oil that may be produced  after that dick rover went into many of the details concerning the land and what the different oil men had said regarding it of course the boys were tremendously interested not only on their own account but also because of phil franklin  i liked that fellow first rate said fred and i do hope his father is able to get some money out of this  on the following day mr fitch came in and he and jacks father went over the matter very carefully then the oil expert said he would begin an inspection of the property as soon as he could send for his outfit  after that there was little for the boys to do but wait dick rover took another trip to wichita falls and then to several other places in the oil fields including two towns in oklahoma he was getting figures of oilwell machinery and also trying to become better acquainted with the whole oil proposition  you see its a new thing to me he explained to jack its altogether different from those mining interests your uncles and i hold in the west and in alaska ive never had anything to do with oil before and so i am going a bit slow so as to avoid mistakes if possible  as mentioned before the franklin farm was located near a place called pottown the rovers visited this community and found there a small but wellkept hotel at which they took dinner one day  i think i like this just as well as the hotel in columbina remarked fred  in some respects i think i like it better answered randy  what would you say to transferring to pottown questioned their uncle then you could be quite close to the franklins while you stay here  this suited the boys and as a result the transfer was made early the next week the rovers had a suite of three rooms jacks father occupying one the twins another and fred and jack the third  in the meantime mr fitch had gone to work on the franklin farm he had with him two of his best men and all of them went over the entire place with care they also visited all of the wells in that vicinity as well as the unfinished borings  when do you think you can make a report mr fitch questioned dick rover one day  im almost ready now mr rover you shall have the report by next monday  the weather had been rather dry and now the roads throughout that section were much better than they had been in pottown the boys had little trouble in hiring an automobile and they often took trips to various places where the oil wells were in operation they saw another well set off and managed to get themselves covered with not a little of the black fluid  suppose we take a run over to the spell farm suggested jack one day ive been wondering whether they really went ahead or whether it was only a bluff  i dont think it was any bluff returned randy they were getting in their machinery just as fast as they could  if dick rover had been present he might have advised against visiting the lorimer spell claim in a roundabout way he had heard from carson davenport the oil well promoter had not forgotten how he had been knocked down and he had told a number of people that he intended sooner or later to square accounts with that fellow from new york  but jacks father was not on hand to see them ride away and so without giving the matter much more consideration the boys had the driver of the automobile head towards the place where the encounter between davenport and dick rover had taken place  my gracious just see how the oil wells are coming in will you cried fred while they were riding along he pointed to a hillside where two new wells were at work those werent here when we went through before  it looks to me as if some of these folks were fairly crazy about oil remarked randy  well its a terrible temptation to get busy when you think that under your very feet there may be thousands and thousands of dollars worth of that stuff returned jack  what a different place this is from around colby hall commented fred  yes and quite different from valley brook farm too added randy  whats the matter with comparing it with riverside drive questioned andy with a grin dont you see the hudson river over there with the stately warships and as he spoke he pointed to a pond of water the surface of which was black with oil and on which floated several logs  in one way i think the old fellow i was talking with last night was right declared jack he said that the oil had spoiled the whole country just look around will you everything is black and greasy with oil  well they say dirty work makes clean money cried randy and i guess a lot of these men dont care how much they muss up the scenery and muss up themselves so long as they get good fat bank accounts out of it  at length they came in sight of the lorimer spell tract and they were both surprised and interested at the activity being displayed there a gang of at least thirty men were at work some around a well which was being sunk and others in erecting several buildings  they certainly mean business remarked jack as they came to a halt near the bank of the little brook which flowed through one of the corners of the property youve got to give them creditthey didnt let the grass grow under their feet  i wonder if they are using their own money or whether they got some outsiders to invest mused fred  not wishing to get into any altercation with the workers the rovers kept at a distance they saw tate and jackson among the men each was giving orders and both seemed to be in charge of the operations carson davenport was not visible  one small building was already complete and this was being used as an office the door stood open and presently a young fellow came out lighting a cigarette as he did so  hello there is nappy martell exclaimed andy  martell stood leaning against the corner of the building smoking his cigarette and gazing idly at the workmen then he chanced to glance around and caught sight of the rovers he at once poked his head back into the building and said something to someone inside  hes coming this way announced fred  yes and there is slugger brown behind him added randy  theyve got their nerve with them after the way they treated us growled jack  what do you fellows want around here demanded nappy coolly as he came closer  ill bet they want to see how we are getting along put in slugger brown he was puffing away at a briarroot pipe trying his best to look mannish  see here you fellows what did you mean by your actions the night you got us to walk out to that storehouse demanded jack  that wasnt our fault broke out nappy hastily we werent responsible for what gabe werner did  i dont believe gabe was in it at all cried fred  he was too he got us to go after you exactly as i told you protested nappy  but he wasnt there said fred and it wasnt a boarding house either  i dont care he was there when we left him to find you and he wanted to see all of you the worst way nappy turned to slugger isnt that right slug  it certainly is he said he would wait there until we got back in fact he said his leg hurt him so he couldnt go a step further and he said he knew the old folks who lived there very well we didnt know anything more than what he told us  i dont believe a word of your story nappy i believe its made up from end to end answered jack you simply had your orders to keep us from going into the hotel and you carried those orders out to the best of your ability my opinion is you were in league with those men who robbed my father of his papers  i was not i dont know what youre talking about roared nappy but his face grew pale as he spoke i didnt even know your father had been robbed gabe werner had been hurt we thought his leg had been broken although we found out afterwards it was only hurt he wanted to see all of youwhy i dont know we simply tried to do him a favor and this is what we get for it  nappy is telling things just as they were declared slugger  its a fairy tale declared andy if it was true why did you and nappy hide when we came up  because we knew you would be mad when you got there and found that gabe was missing answered slugger  where is werner now  i dont know i think he has gone homeanyway he said something about going was the glib reply  what are you fellows doing here  we own an interest in this claim answered nappy loftily and as he spoke he lit a fresh cigarette  own an interest here demanded jack in pardonable astonishment  thats it i got my folks to buy an eighth interest in the whole outfit and sluggers folks bought an equal amount  must have cost you something said fred  it cost our folks ten thousand dollars each answered slugger in a bragging tone but well get that back and a good deal more too he added  did gabe werners folks put up anything questioned randy  yes they have an eighth interest too answered nappy oh this is going to be some big concern believe me  what about it if my father gets back those papers of which he was robbed questioned jack pointedly  oh say jack rover you neednt come to me with that old yarn growled slugger we know there isnt a word of truth in it your father never had any such papers  he certainly did have them and some day he may be able to prove it answered jack warmly on the very night that you fellows got us to go out to that storehouse he was knocked down in one of our rooms by two or three men and the papers were taken from him and what is more i am pretty sure in my mind that the fellows who took them were davenport and his partners  then you mean to say that mr davenport is a thief cried slugger looking jack full in the face  thats what i firmly believe  jack had scarcely uttered the words when he felt a heavy hand placed upon his shoulder he was whirled around to find himself face to face with the oil promoter  illustration jack was whirled around and faced the oil promoter  so that is the way you are talking about me is it cried carson davenport in a rage calling me a thief and all that sort of thing i reckon i have an account to settle with you and ill settle it right now you come with me  and thus speaking he grasped jack by the arm and dragged him across the field to where his gang of men were at work     chapter xxviii  at the franklin place   carson davenports action came so unexpectedly that for the instant jack did not know what to do then however he tried to wrench himself free from the oil well promoters grasp  you let go of me he cried let go i say and then as davenport continued to hold him he struck the man on the chest  ha youre the same kind of a spitfire as your father are you bellowed davenport and in a greater rage than ever he let go of jack and hit him a stinging blow on the side of the face  hi stop that how dare you yelled randy and sprang forward to jacks assistance but before he could reach his cousin jack had hauled off and hit davenport a blow in the cheek  by this time all of the rovers were advancing upon davenport and the oil well promoter thought it the best policy to fall back  come on nappy lets get into this cried slugger and rushing forward he caught randy by the shoulder you let them have it out alone he ordered  this isnt your fight slugger and you had better keep out of it retorted randy and then as slugger still tried to hold him back randy put out his foot gave the bully a shove and slugger measured his length on his back  in the meanwhile nappy had also sprung forward he tried to get at jack but andy and fred got in the way and though nappy struck out several times hitting both of the rovers on the arm they retaliated with a stinging crack in the ear and another on the nose which caused the blood to flow freely and made nappy retire to a safe distance  by this time the allaround fight had attracted the attention of a number of the workmen and they came rushing up to find out what it was all about the driver of the automobile who had remained in the car also came forward  ill fix you you young whelp roared davenport as he came again toward jack  you leave me alone returned jack dont you dare put your hands on me again  here whats the rumpus demanded the driver of the automobile a fellow named george rogers  the boys started to explain not only for the benefit of rogers but also for the benefit of the workmen who were coming up  that whole bunch ought to be arrested blustered slugger  thats what i say added nappy with his handkerchief to his bleeding nose  that man started it declared jack pointing to davenport he caught hold of me and i told him to let me go he had no right to put his hands on me  after this there was a war of words in which tate and jackson who had come up joined the oil well promoters were all anxious to do something to the rover boys and in this they were seconded by nappy and slugger but strange as it may seem hardly any of the workmen took kindly to this  oh theyre only a bunch of kids said one of the men whats the use of bothering with them  that man is mad at me because my father knocked him down twice the other day declared jack turning to the workmen and he knows why he was knocked down he added significantly  was it your dad who did that questioned one of the men in the rear of the crowd  it was this farm was left to my father by lorimer spell because my father saved spells life on a battlefield in france my father had a lot of papers to prove his claim but the papers were stolen from him  i heard something about that said another of the workmen  see here if you fellows are going to believe such a story as these kids are giving you you cant work for me roared carson davenport with a scowl  i dont have to work for you if i dont want to answered one of the workmen quickly and with a scowl  see here carson davenport you let me have a word or two to say broke in george rogers i know you just about as well as anybody here you are the fellow who sold stock in the yellow pansy extension something that i and a whole lot of others got bit on badly maybe youd like me to rake up that little deal in the courts for you  rats you dont have to dig up ancient history rogers growled davenport but it was easy to see that the others words disturbed him not a little  ill dig it up good and plenty if you dont leave these boys alone i dont know much about em but they seem to be perfectly straightforward and their father is as nice a man as i ever met  more words followed davenport as well as tate and jackson doing a lot of grumbling once or twice slugger and nappy tried to take part but some of the workmen cut them short and in the end one crowd moved toward the automobile while the other headed in the opposite direction  well thats the time matters got pretty hot was andys comment  gee one time i thought wed all be at it tooth and nail declared fred  in my opinion that fellow davenport is nothing but a skunk declared george rogers ive known him for years he has been in half a dozen oilwell propositions selling stocks and leases one time he caught three young fellows from chicago and sold them a lease for several thousand dollars that wasnt worth a pinch of snuff then he started what he called the yellow pansy extension the regular yellow pansy was doing very wellhitting it up for about eight hundred barrels a dayand of course lots of people including myself thought that the extension belonged to the same crowd but it didnt and the lease was absolutely worthless so that all of the buyers of stock got stung i myself was hung up for fifteen hundred dollars almost all the cash i had at that time  why didnt they put davenport and his partners in prison asked fred  because he is one of those slick fellows who can worm out of almost anything one or two fellows did make some sort of charges against him but they all fell through there are hundreds of swindlers in the oil business and not one out of a dozen is ever caught  if uncle dick makes up his mind to go ahead on the franklin farm i think i know a way of helping him said andy with a grin  what are you going to do andy take off your coat roll up your sleeves and grab a pick and shovel questioned his twin  not exactly although i might want to do that later on but i was thinking that a good many of those workmen didnt seem to be satisfied with their job maybe they would be only too glad to shift  although they hated to do so the boys felt it was their duty to tell the particulars of what had occurred to jacks father as soon as they saw him  its too bad you got into another mixup with that rascal as well as with martell and brown said dick rover after this i think you had better stay away from that locality well let them go ahead and sink all the money they care to  jacks father had been making some inquiries and he learned that it was true that the martells the browns and mr werner had contributed thirty thousand dollars towards driving two wells on the spell claim to this amount of money davenport tate and jackson had contributed another twenty thousand dollars  fifty thousand dollars exclaimed jack when he heard of this that certainly is quite a sum of money  it costs money to bore for oil in these parts answered his father  as he had promised mr fitch came to dick rover on the following monday with his report concerning the franklin farm  i think you have found something well worth trying mr rover said he there are indications of oil in half a dozen places and two of the spots to me look particularly inviting  then he went into many details and brought in one of his assistants to verify some of the statements dick rover listened carefully to all that was said and then leaned back in his chair and looked at the oil expert sharply  then on the strength of this report mr fitch you would advise my sinking at least two wells  i certainly would mr rover that is of course if you can afford to take the gamble im almost certain that the oil is there but you must remember that even the best of us are sometimes deceived however i will say thisi am not a particularly rich man but if you sink these two wells in the spots that i have picked out and you form a company at say one hundred thousand dollars for that purpose i am willing to put up five thousand dollars in cash for some of the stock  that certainly sounds as if you had faith in it answered dick rover with a smile are you willing to put that in writing  i am sir and mr fitchs face showed that he meant what he said  very well then you do so and ill start operations tomorrow  as soon as it was definitely settled that mr rover would go ahead and sink the two wells the boys hurried over to see phil franklin they found the lad all smiles  its the best news i ever heard said phil his eyes gleaming with pleasure now dad and i will have a chance of making some real money for it had now been settled that john franklin was to have an eighth interest in the new company to be formed  im awfully glad my dad is going ahead on your farm answered jack and i hope for your sake as well as our own that the wells prove regular gushers  that mr fitch was very hopeful answered phil and my father says hes one of the best oil experts to be found anywhere hes an old hand at the game  that week and the week following proved to be tremendously busy ones for dick rover in conference with nick ogilvie and several others all the work preliminary to the sinking of the two wells was gotten under way and deals were closed for nearly all the necessary machinery and also for a quantity of lumber to be used in the construction of several buildings  were going to stay right in our house said phil to the other boys we shant get out until the flow of oil compels us to  well i hope the oil comes so fast it floats the old shack away grinned andy  it soon became noised around that the rover oil company had been formed to exploit the franklin farm in the meanwhile nick ogilvie and his assistants were hustling as much as possible to obtain the needed workmen they managed to get together a gang of fifteen but then there came a halt  they are hitting it up for oil over the line in oklahoma declared ogilvie and that has taken away a good many of our workmen  better go to wichita falls and see what you can do suggested dick rover  the next day jack and andy while riding in george rogers automobile ran across three of the men employed by davenport these men had had a quarrel with tate and were on the point of leaving their job they listened with interest to what the boys had to say about the franklin place  if they want men i think ill go over and see about it said one of the workmen  so will i came from another and the third nodded to show that he agreed  as a result of this interview the three men called on nick ogilvie and were speedily engaged they told some of their friends and before the week was up six of carson davenports best workers had left the spell claim and had signed up to work on the franklin farm     chapter xxix  days of anxiety   i wonder what davenport will say when he finds those men are working here remarked fred  i dont care what he says answered jack  do you think hell dare come over here and have it out with uncle dick questioned andy  i dont think so answered his brother i believe behind it all he is afraid well have him arrested for the theft of those documents  if he really took them what do you think he did with them came from fred  more than likely he destroyed them answered jack he wouldnt want evidence like that lying around loose you know  when carson davenport learned that six of his men had deserted and gone over to the rovers he was more angry than ever  theyre going to do their best to undermine us he said to tate i wish i knew just how to get square with them  well get square enough if we strike oil here said tate those rovers will feel sick enough if they learn we are making a barrel of money  its easy enough to talk about making a barrel of money came from jackson who was present but i dont see the money flowing in very fast he had been talking to a number of his friends and many of them had said they thought the chances of getting oil from the spell claim were very slim  oh you just hold your horses jackson said carson davenport smoothly take my word for it this well we are putting down is going to be one of the biggest in this territory  but though he spoke thus davenport did not believe what he said he too was becoming suspicious that they might be drilling a well which would prove dry however he had the traits of a gambler and was willing to go ahead so long as there was the least possibility of success  as the days slipped by the work on both claims progressed rapidly nick ogilvie managed to hire a few men in and around wichita falls and davenport also picked up some workers to take the places of those who had deserted him  in those days the rover boys became almost as enthusiastic as jacks father and their enthusiasm increased when tom rover and sam rover took a run down from new york to see how matters were progressing  it certainly is a gamblethis boring for oil remarked sam rover  but it looks like a good gamble to me answered his brother tom and i like the way that man fitch talks he had had an interview with the oil expert which had pleased him greatly  on one occasion the rover boys rode over from pottown to columbina there at the shootinggallery they had visited before they ran most unexpectedly not only into nappy and slugger but also gabe werner at the sight of them werner tried to get out of the gallery by the back way but was stopped by the proprietor  you havent settled with me yet said the shootinggallery man  oh thats all right take it out of this growled werner and threw down a dollar bill then he tried to pass out again but before he could do so randy and fred caught and held the rascal  cornered gabe werner tried to put up a fight and in this he got by far the worst of it he managed to get in one or two blows but then randy knocked him down and when he arose to his feet fred landed on his ear so that the bully spun around and lurched heavily against the counter on which rested a number of guns  you let me alone roared werner and then he suddenly caught up one of the guns and made a move as though to aim it at the rovers but the keeper of the shooting gallery was too quick for him and wrested the weapon from the big youths grasp  and then gabe werner did catch it not only did randy and fred pounce upon him but also jack and andy and as a consequence bruised and bleeding the big bully staggered from the shooting gallery and set off down the muddy street at the best speed he could command  there i guess weve settled him for a while panted randy when the encounter was over hello where are nappy and slugger  they slid out while we were taking care of gabe answered andy i guess they thought things were getting too warm and in that surmise the funloving rover was correct dismayed by the beating werner was receiving nappy and slugger had lost no time in departing for parts unknown it was a long time before the rovers saw them again  a few days later came word from the spell claim that filled the rovers with astonishment mingled somewhat with dismay oil had been reported and every one connected with the davenport outfit was of the opinion that the well when shot off would open up big  gee suppose they do strike it rich cried fred  i dont think they willnot after what the experts said answered jack  but even mr fitch said they sometimes made mistakes put in randy  a few days later the well on the spell claim was shot off and this was followed by a flow of oil amounting to forty or fifty barrels a day then it was announced that the davenport crowd was going to sink the well several hundred feet deeper and they were also going to put down another well farther up the brook  i reckon that flow of oil has got em agoing remarked nick ogilvie and there was just a trace of envy in his tones well thats the luck of it you cant tell anything about it and he shook his head wonderingly as he went about his duties  so far there had been no indications of oil at the first well which the rovers were boring but mr fitch had told jacks father not to expect too much until a depth of at least twentyfive hundred feet was reached  it made the boys feel a little blue to think that the davenport crowd had been the first to strike oil  wont nappy and slugger crow over thisespecially as their folks have an interest in the well remarked jack  but the next day something happened which made jack forget all his troubles for the time being a telegram came in from his sister martha reading as follows       ruths eyes operated on yesterday very successful expert says      she will see perfectly  isnt this grand cried jack his whole face beaming with pleasure i declare this is the best news yet  i dont blame you for being pleased jack answered randy ill wager the stevensons feel relieved  the telegram was followed by a letter which gave many details but the main feature was that the operation had been entirely successful and that the surgeon in charge had said positively that ruths eyes would soon be as well and as strong as they had ever been  i am going to send her a telegram of congratulation declared jack even if she cant read it herself they can read it to her and he hurried off to the telegraph station for that purpose  after that the boys waited anxiously for some sort of development at the franklin farm tom rover and his brother sam had returned to new york and they had wanted the boys to go with them but all had pleaded that they be allowed to remain in texas  we want to see the wells shot off and want to see the oil flowthat is provided it does flow said randy  we might as well put in our vacation here as anywhere put in fred and so the four lads were allowed to remain  of course the franklins were as anxious as any one to see how matters would turn out father and son were working for the company and doing their best to hurry matters along dick rover was also on hand daily consulting with ogilvie and his assistants to make sure that everything was going right  these two wells are going to cost us about seventy thousand dollars jacks father confided to him its a mint of money isnt it and he smiled slightly  it certainly is dad especially if the wells dont pan out  well weve got to take what comes you must remember this is the land of luckgood or bad  at last ogilvie announced that they were getting to the point where the first well would soon be shot off there were some indications of oil although not as strong as mr fitch had hoped the oil expert had put up his five thousand dollars in the company which had been formed so he was almost as anxious as those who had larger sums invested  heres news for you shouted andy bursting in on the others the next noon what do you know about this say i guess those fellows are going to catch it all right enough and he began to dance around the floor  what are you talking about andy demanded his brother  they say the well on the lorimer spell claim has run dry  run dry came from the others  yes run dryor next door to it they got only fifteen barrels the day before yesterday and yesterday they got not more than three  you dont mean it exclaimed jack who told you this  one of the men who worked there carson davenport was so mad that when the man said something to him about it he fired him the man said he was coming over here to look for a jobthat he was sure the whole thing was petering out  the news soon circulated and dick rover was so interested that he went off the next day to columbina to ascertain the truth  its so all right enough he said on returning they didnt get more than a barrel or so today it has certainly gone back on them of course they can bore the well deeper but i guess mr fitch was right he said that there was more or less surface oilthat they hadnt tapped any real vein or pocket  the day before the first of the wells on the franklin farm was to be shot off the rover boys went to columbina on an errand to one of the stores just as they were coming out of this establishment they saw an automobile dash through the mud on the way to the railroad station behind it came another automobile filled with a number of men all yelling wildly for those in the first automobile to stop  hello something is going on exclaimed jack  lets go after them and see whats doing suggested fred  the others were willing and all set off on a run down the main thoroughfare of the town as they ran they heard the distant whistle of a locomotive  i guess the crowd in the first auto want to catch that threeoclock express remarked fred  yes and evidently the second crowd want to stop them returned andy  the excitement had attracted the attention of a number of people and a crowd of a dozen or more followed the boys to the railroad station all wondering what was the matter  as soon as the first automobile reached the railroad platform a man sprang from the car holding a gladstone bag in one hand and a suitcase in the other he looked back and then made a wild dash for the train which was just rolling into the station  look its carson davenport exclaimed jack  and see who are after himtate jackson and three or four other men  stop davenport yelled one of the men stop or ill shoot and he flourished a revolver and another man in the crowd did the same then the bunch jumped from the second automobile and dashed pellmell toward the train     chapter xxx  the new wellconclusion   carson davenport was halfway up the steps of the car when jake tate and another man hauled him backward to the station platform  theyve got him exclaimed jack as he and his cousins along with the rest of the gathering crowd came closer  hi hi let me alone yelled davenport dont shoot what is the meaning of this anyway  you know well enough what it means bellowed tate still clutching him by the arm you come back here you are not going to take that train or any other just yet  and youre not going to carry off that bag either put in jackson as he wrenched the gladstone away  by this time the crowd completely surrounded carson davenport and the pistols which had been drawn were speedily thrust out of sight the oil well promoter was pushed in the direction of the little railroad station and in the midst of this excitement the train pulled out  whats the rumpus about anyway exclaimed one man in the crowd  never mind what its about broke in tate hastily this is our affair  thats rightmaybe we had better keep it to ourselves muttered jackson  i dont believe in shielding him cried one man who had chased davenport and who wore several soldiers medals on his vest hes a swindler and its best everybody knew it he was on the point of lighting out for parts unknown with all the money that was put into his oil wells up on the spell ranch  is that right burst out another man  it is and tate and jackson know it as well as i do i guess davenport came to the conclusion that those wells he was putting down were no good and rather than sink any more money into them he was going to run off with it  i wasnt running off with anything declared carson davenport i was going to put the money into the bank at wichita falls i had a perfect right to do that and as he spoke he glared at tate and jackson  say if youre going to talk that way i wont stand in with you any longer cried jackson in a rage that money is going to stay right here where i and all the rest of us can keep our eyes on it  thats rightdont let him get away with a dollar of it burst out another man in the crowd  wed better examine this bag first and make sure that weve got what we came after declared the man who wore the medals on his vest  davenport tried to demur but none of the crowd would listen to him although the gladstone bag was locked the oil well promoter was compelled to give up the key and then the others looked over the contents of the bag  twentysix thousand dollars here announced tate as he counted the money in the presence of the others  whats this package demanded the man who wore the medals hello look here he exclaimed an instant later after he had glanced at one of several documents held together by a rubber band  what have you got questioned tate curiously  you let those alone bellowed davenport his face turning pale give them to me they are my private property and he endeavored to snatch the documents from the other mans hand  not much answered the man with the medals corporal john dunning who had served over a year in france these papers belong to mr richard rover and he is the one who is going to get them  richard rover burst out jack who was close enough to catch the words why thats my father  i tell you i want those papers they are mine screamed carson davenport and now he made another struggle to get them  in the mêlée which followed corporal dunning was hit by the oil well promoter who in return received a blow full in the mouth which loosened several of his teeth  if those are my fathers papers they must be the same that were stolen from him while we were stopping at a hotel here said jack several men entered one of our rooms and my father was knocked down from behind and while he was unconscious the men took the papers and ran away they were papers relating to the lorimer spell claim  then tell your father that corporal john dunning who is stopping at obrians hotel has them and will give them up to him just as soon as he can prove his property said the exsoldier as he placed the documents in an inside pocket  by this time two undersheriffs had arrived on the scene and they were wanting to know if their services were required tate jackson and one or two others for purely personal reasons were in favor of hushing the matter up but not so corporal dunning or the rover boys  if he is the man who knocked my father down and robbed him i want him arrested declared jack  he ought to be arrested if he did anything like that acquiesced dunning im through with him no more work for me at his place  if you want another job i guess my fathers foreman nick ogilvie will be glad to take you on answered jack quickly you know my dad is an exservice man too and so are my cousins fathers he added motioning to the other boys  carson davenport blustered and tried to protest and so did tate and jackson but it was all of no avail and in the end the oil well promoter was marched off by the undersheriffs to the local lockup then tate and jackson hurried away looking anything but pleased  if hes exposed hell expose us too said tate sourly  right you are jake answered jackson maybe wed better clear out  and they did the next day they tried to get hold of some of the funds of the oil company but dunning and others were on guard so this little plan was frustrated  of course dick rover was astonished when the boys burst in on him with their story he quickly sought out dunning and proved to the satisfaction of that individual that the documents taken from davenport were his property then davenport was put through the third degree as it is called by the authorities and finally broke down and admitted that he tate and jackson had committed the assault and theft and that he had likewise tried to abscond with the remaining funds of his new oil company as a result of all this he was later sentenced to a term of years in prison about three months later still tate and jackson were caught and also made to do time at hard labor  with davenport tate and jackson out of it the management of the new oil company fell upon gabe werners father mr werner went ahead with the two wells as planned by the others and in them sunk not only a large amount of his own funds but also funds belonging to the martells and browns but in the end these wells proved to be little better than dry holes so all of the money was lost  its a terrible blow for all three families said dick rover when this occurred it will make mr werner quite a poor man  well i dont particularly wish them any hard luck remarked andy just the same i guess nappy slugger and gabe got what was coming to them  on the day following the arrest of davenport the first of the wells on the franklin farm was shot off it proved to be an immense success the flood of oil carrying away almost everything before it  jumping toothpicks exclaimed randy when the excitement was over nick ogilvie says she will go six thousand barrels a day  just to think of it cried jack his eyes gleaming with pleasure six thousand barrels isnt it wonderful six thousand barrels at two dollars and a half a barrel amounts to fifteen thousand dollars why its a fortune and more  well all be rich well all be rich sang out andy and grabbing his brother both set up a wild dance knocking over the chairs as they did so  it was certainly a gala event and the rovers lost no time in telegraphing the news to the folks in new york and also to a number of their friends then preparations were made to bring in the second well and this proved almost as good as the first running between four and five thousand barrels per day at first and then settling down to fifteen hundred while the first well for a long while never ran below twentyfive hundred  they sure are a pair of peaches declared dunning who had come to work for the rover oil company a pair of peaches as good as any in this district  do you know i can scarcely believe its true said phil franklin to the rover boys why my father will have more money than he ever dreamed of  were as glad as you are phil declared jack glad on your account as well as our own now maybe you can go to colby hall with us  say that would be immense exclaimed phil with pleasure  and how phil franklin went that fall with the rovers to colby hall will be related in a new volume to be entitled the rover boys at big horn ranch or the cowboys double roundup in that book we shall learn more concerning the doings of jack and his cousins and also learn the particulars of a most remarkable trip to the far west  two weeks after the coming in of the first well the four rover boys returned to their homes in new york city there an agreeable surprise awaited them gif and spouter had come down from lake george to pay them a visit  say this is just all right cried jack as the lads shook hands all around  there is another surprise coming this evening said mary but were not going to tell you what it is  that surprise proved to be the coming of ruth and may as yet ruth had to wear dark glasses but she said that the eye specialist had told her that these could be discarded in a week or two  you dont know how thankful i am that your eyes are coming around all right said jack as he caught both her hands its the best news in the world ruthfar better than that big oil well coming in on our place in texas  i am thankful too jack she answered and doubly thankful that you havent had to go through what i did with your eyes  i guess gabe werner has got his deserts put in randy his father is sinking all his money in those goodfornothing wells on the spell claim  that night the young folks had something of a party and it is perhaps needless to say that every one of them enjoyed it thoroughly ruth of course had to be careful of herself and could not dance but jack gave her a good deal of his company and with this she seemed quite content  then followed a week or more in which the young folks went out on numerous outings both in the city and elsewhere then all motored up to valley brook farm there to spend some time with grandfather rover and aunt martha and uncle randolph before returning to school  well its certainly been a great summer after all remarked fred  it sure has returned andy  and we got quite a lot of fun out of it added his twin  fun and a good deal of information said jack it certainly paid us to visit the land of luck
