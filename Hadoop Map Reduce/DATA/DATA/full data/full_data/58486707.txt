material interest on a bridge wide enough for but one  down you base thing thundered the moral principle and let me pass over you  the material interest merely looked in the others eyes without saying anything  ah said the moral principle hesitatingly let us draw lots to see which shall retire till the other has crossed  the material interest maintained an unbroken silence and an unwavering stare  in order to avoid a conflict the moral principle resumed somewhat uneasily i shall myself lie down and let you walk over me  then the material interest found a tongue and by a strange coincidence it was its own tongue  i dont think you are very good walking it said  i am a little particular about what i have underfoot  suppose you get off into the water  it occurred that way     the crimson candle   a man lying at the point of death called his wife to his bedside and said  i am about to leave you forever give me therefore one last proof of your affection and fidelity for according to our holy religion a married man seeking admittance at the gate of heaven is required to swear that he has never defiled himself with an unworthy woman  in my desk you will find a crimson candle which has been blessed by the high priest and has a peculiar mystical significance  swear to me that while it is in existence you will not remarry  the woman swore and the man died  at the funeral the woman stood at the head of the bier holding a lighted crimson candle till it was wasted entirely away     the blotted escutcheon and the soiled ermine   a blotted escutcheon rising to a question of privilege said  mr speaker i wish to hurl back an allegation and explain that the spots upon me are the natural markings of one who is a direct descendant of the sun and a spotted fawn  they come of no accident of character but inhere in the divine order and constitution of things  when the blotted escutcheon had resumed his seat a soiled ermine rose and said  mr speaker i have heard with profound attention and entire approval the explanation of the honourable member and wish to offer a few remarks on my own behalf  i too have been foully calumniated by our ancient enemy the infamous falsehood and i wish to point out that i am made of the fur of the mustela maculata which is dirty from birth     the ingenious patriot   having obtained an audience of the king an ingenious patriot pulled a paper from his pocket saying  may it please your majesty i have here a formula for constructing armourplating which no gun can pierce  if these plates are adopted in the royal navy our warships will be invulnerable and therefore invincible  here also are reports of your majestys ministers attesting the value of the invention  i will part with my right in it for a million tumtums  after examining the papers the king put them away and promised him an order on the lord high treasurer of the extortion department for a million tumtums  and here said the ingenious patriot pulling another paper from another pocket are the working plans of a gun that i have invented which will pierce that armour  your majestys royal brother the emperor of bang is anxious to purchase it but loyalty to your majestys throne and person constrains me to offer it first to your majesty  the price is one million tumtums  having received the promise of another check he thrust his hand into still another pocket remarking  the price of the irresistible gun would have been much greater your majesty but for the fact that its missiles can be so effectively averted by my peculiar method of treating the armour plates with a new  the king signed to the great head factotum to approach  search this man he said and report how many pockets he has  fortythree sire said the great head factotum completing the scrutiny  may it please your majesty cried the ingenious patriot in terror one of them contains tobacco  hold him up by the ankles and shake him said the king then give him a check for fortytwo million tumtums and put him to death  let a decree issue declaring ingenuity a capital offence     two kings   the king of madagao being engaged in a dispute with the king of bornegascar wrote him as follows  before proceeding further in this matter i demand the recall of your minister from my capital  greatly enraged by this impossible demand the king of bornegascar replied  i shall not recall my minister  moreover if you do not immediately retract your demand i shall withdraw him  this threat so terrified the king of madagao that in hastening to comply he fell over his own feet breaking the third commandment     an officer and a thug   a chief of police who had seen an officer beating a thug was very indignant and said he must not do so any more on pain of dismissal  dont be too hard on me said the officer smiling i was beating him with a stuffed club  nevertheless persisted the chief of police it was a liberty that must have been very disagreeable though it may not have hurt  please do not repeat it  but said the officer still smiling it was a stuffed thug  in attempting to express his gratification the chief of police thrust out his right hand with such violence that his skin was ruptured at the armpit and a stream of sawdust poured from the wound  he was a stuffed chief of police     the conscientious official   while a division superintendent of a railway was attending closely to his business of placing obstructions on the track and tampering with the switches he received word that the president of the road was about to discharge him for incompetency  good heavens he cried there are more accidents on my division than on all the rest of the line  the president is very particular said the man who brought him the news he thinks the same loss of life might be effected with less damage to the companys property  does he expect me to shoot passengers through the car windows exclaimed the indignant official spiking a loose tie across the rails does he take me for an assassin     how leisure came   a man to whom time was money and who was bolting his breakfast in order to catch a train had leaned his newspaper against the sugarbowl and was reading as he ate  in his haste and abstraction he stuck a picklefork into his right eye and on removing the fork the eye came with it  in buying spectacles the needless outlay for the right lens soon reduced him to poverty and the man to whom time was money had to sustain life by fishing from the end of a wharf     the moral sentiment   a pugilist met the moral sentiment of the community who was carrying a hatbox  what have you in the hatbox my friend inquired the pugilist  a new frown was the answer  i am bringing it from the frownerythe one over there with the gilded steeple  and what are you going to do with the nice new frown the pugilist asked  put down pugilismif i have to wear it night and day said the moral sentiment of the community sternly  thats right said the pugilist that is right my good friend if pugilism had been put down yesterday i wouldnt have this kind of nose today  i had a rattling hot fight last evening with  is that so cried the moral sentiment of the community with sudden animation  which licked  sit down here on the hatbox and tell me all about it     the politicians   an old politician and a young politician were travelling through a beautiful country by the dusty highway which leads to the city of prosperous obscurity  lured by the flowers and the shade and charmed by the songs of birds which invited to woodland paths and green fields his imagination fired by glimpses of golden domes and glittering palaces in the distance on either hand the young politician said  let us i beseech thee turn aside from this comfortless road leading thou knowest whither but not i  let us turn our backs upon duty and abandon ourselves to the delights and advantages which beckon from every grove and call to us from every shining hill  let us if so thou wilt follow this beautiful path which as thou seest hath a guideboard saying turn in here all ye who seek the palace of political distinction  it is a beautiful path my son said the old politician without either slackening his pace or turning his head and it leadeth among pleasant scenes  but the search for the palace of political distinction is beset with one mighty peril  what is that said the young politician  the peril of finding it the old politician replied pushing on     the thoughtful warden   the warden of a penitentiary was one day putting locks on the doors of all the cells when a mechanic said to him  those locks can all be opened from the insideyou are very imprudent  the warden did not look up from his work but said  if that is called imprudence i wonder what would be called a thoughtful provision against the vicissitudes of fortune     the treasury and the arms   a public treasury feeling two arms lifting out its contents exclaimed  mr shareman i move for a division  you seem to know something about parliamentary forms of speech said the two arms  yes replied the public treasury i am familiar with the hauls of legislation     the christian serpent   a rattlesnake came home to his brood and said my children gather about and receive your fathers last blessing and see how a christian dies  what ails you father asked the small snakes  i have been bitten by the editor of a partisan journal was the reply accompanied by the ominous deathrattle     the broom of the temple   the city of gakwak being about to lose its character of capital of the province of ukwuk the wampog issued a proclamation convening all the male residents in council in the temple of ul to devise means of defence the first speaker thought the best policy would be to offer a fried jackass to the gods  the second suggested a public procession headed by the wampog himself bearing the holy poker on a cushion of clothofbrass  another thought that a scarlet mole should be buried alive in the public park and a suitable incantation chanted over the remains  the advice of the fourth was that the columns of the capitol be rubbed with oil of dog by a person having a moustache on the calf of his leg  when all the others had spoken an aged man rose and said  high and mighty wampog and fellowcitizens i have listened attentively to all the plans proposed  all seem wise and i do not suffer myself to doubt that any one of them would be efficacious  nevertheless i cannot help thinking that if we would put an improved breed of polliwogs in our drinking water construct shallower roadways groom the street cows offer the stranger within our gates a free choice between the poniard and the potion and relinquish our private system of morals the other measures of public safety would be needless  the aged man was about to speak further but the meeting informally adjourned in order to sweep the floor of the templefor the men of gakwak are the tidiest housewives in all that province  the last speaker was the broom     the critics   while bathing antinous was seen by minerva who was so enamoured of his beauty that all armed as she happened to be she descended from olympus to woo him but unluckily displaying her shield with the head of medusa on it she had the unhappiness to see the beautiful mortal turn to stone from catching a glimpse of it  she straightway ascended to ask jove to restore him but before this could be done a sculptor and a critic passed that way and espied him  this is a very bad apollo said the sculptor the chest is too narrow and one arm is at least a halfinch shorter than the other  the attitude is unnatural and i may say impossible  ah my friend you should see my statue of antinous  in my judgment the figure said the critic is tolerably good though rather etrurian but the expression of the face is decidedly tuscan and therefore false to nature  by the way have you read my work on the fallaciousness of the aspectual in art     the foolish woman   a married woman whose lover was about to reform by running away procured a pistol and shot him dead  why did you do that madam inquired a policeman sauntering by  because replied the married woman he was a wicked man and had purchased a ticket to chicago  my sister said an adjacent man of god solemnly you cannot stop the wicked from going to chicago by killing them     father and son   my boy said an aged father to his fiery and disobedient son a hot temper is the soil of remorse  promise me that when next you are angry you will count one hundred before you move or speak  no sooner had the son promised than he received a stinging blow from the paternal walkingstick and by the time he had counted to seventyfive had the unhappiness to see the old man jump into a waiting cab and whirl away     the discontented malefactor   a judge having sentenced a malefactor to the penitentiary was proceeding to point out to him the disadvantages of crime and the profit of reformation  your honour said the malefactor interrupting would you be kind enough to alter my punishment to ten years in the penitentiary and nothing else  why said the judge surprised i have given you only three years  yes i know assented the malefactorthree years imprisonment and the preaching  if you please i should like to commute the preaching     a call to quit   seeing that his audiences were becoming smaller every sunday a minister of the gospel broke off in the midst of a sermon descended the pulpit stairs and walked on his hands down the central aisle of the church  he then remounted his feet ascended to the pulpit and resumed his discourse making no allusion to the incident  now said he to himself as he went home i shall have henceforth a large attendance and no snoring  but on the following friday he was waited upon by the pillars of the church who informed him that in order to be in harmony with the new theology and get full advantage of modern methods of gospel interpretation they had deemed it advisable to make a change  they had therefore sent a call to brother jowjeetumfallal the worldrenowned hindoo human pinwheel then holding forth in hoopitups circus  they were happy to say that the reverend gentleman had been moved by the spirit to accept the call and on the ensuing sabbath would break the bread of life for the brethren or break his neck in the attempt     the man and the lightning   a man running for office was overtaken by lightning  you see said the lightning as it crept past him inch by inch i can travel considerably faster than you  yes the man running for office replied but think how much longer i keep going     the lassoed bear   a hunter who had lassoed a bear was trying to disengage himself from the rope but the slipknot about his wrist would not yield for the bear was all the time pulling in the slack with his paws  in the midst of his trouble the hunter saw a showman passing by and managed to attract his attention  what will you give me he said for my bear  it will be some five or ten minutes said the showman before i shall want a fresh bear and it looks to me as if prices would fall during that time  i think ill wait and watch the market  the price of this animal the hunter replied is down to bedrock you can have him for nothing a pound spot cash and ill throw in the next one that i lasso  but the purchaser must remove the goods from the premises forthwith to make room for three maneating tigers a catheaded gorilla and an armful of rattlesnakes  but the showman passed on in maiden meditation fancy free and being joined soon afterward by the bear who was absently picking his teeth it was inferred that they were not unacquainted     the ineffective rooter   a drunken man was lying in the road with a bleeding nose upon which he had fallen when a pig passed that way  you wallow fairly well said the pig but my fine fellow you have much to learn about rooting     a protagonist of silver   some financiers who were whetting their tongues on their teeth because the government had struck down silver and were about to inaugurate a season of sweatshed were addressed as follows by a member of their honourable and warlike body  comrades of the thunder and companions of death i cannot but regard it as singularly fortunate that we who by conviction and sympathy are designated by nature as the champions of that fairest of her products the white metal should also by a happy chance be engaged mostly in the business of mining it  nothing could be more appropriate than that those who from unselfish motives and elevated sentiments are doing battle for the peoples rights and interests should themselves be the chief beneficiaries of success  therefore o children of the earthquake and the storm let us stand shoulder to shoulder heart to heart and pocket to pocket  this speech so pleased the other members of the convention that actuated by a magnanimous impulse they sprang to their feet and left the hall  it was the first time they had ever been known to leave anything having value     the holy deacon   an itinerant preacher who had wrought hard in the moral vineyard for several hours whispered to a holy deacon of the local church  brother these people know you and your active support will bear fruit abundantly  please pass the plate for me and you shall have one fourth  the holy deacon did so and putting the money into his pocket waited till the congregation was dismissed and said goodnight  but the money brother the money that you collected said the itinerant preacher  nothing is coming to you was the reply the adversary has hardened their hearts and one fourth is all they gave     a hasty settlement   your honour said an attorney rising what is the present status of this caseas far as it has gone  i have given a judgment for the residuary legatee under the will said the court put the costs upon the contestants decided all questions relating to fees and other charges and in short the estate in litigation has been settled with all controversies disputes misunderstandings and differences of opinion thereunto appertaining  ah yes i see said the attorney thoughtfully we are making progresswe are getting on famously  progress echoed the judgeprogress  why sir the matter is concluded  exactly exactly it had to be concluded in order to give relevancy to the motion that i am about to make  your honour i move that the judgment of the court be set aside and the case reopened  upon what ground sir the judge asked in surprise  upon the ground said the attorney that after paying all fees and expenses of litigation and all charges against the estate there will still be something left  there may have been an error said his honour thoughtfullythe court may have underestimated the value of the estate  the motion is taken under advisement     the wooden guns   an artillery regiment of a state militia applied to the governor for wooden guns to practise with  those they explained will be cheaper than real ones  it shall not be said that i sacrificed efficiency to economy said the governor  you shall have real guns  thank you thank you cried the warriors effusively  we will take good care of them and in the event of war return them to the arsenal     the reform school board   the members of the school board in doosnoswair being suspected of appointing female teachers for an improper consideration the people elected a board composed wholly of women  in a few years the scandal was at an end there were no female teachers in the department     the poets doom   an object was walking along the kings highway wrapped in meditation and with little else on when he suddenly found himself at the gates of a strange city  on applying for admittance he was arrested as a necessitator of ordinances and taken before the king  who are you said the king and what is your business in life  snouter the sneak replied the object with ready invention pickpocket  the king was about to command him to be released when the prime minister suggested that the prisoners fingers be examined  they were found greatly flattened and calloused at the ends  ha cried the king i told you sohe is addicted to counting syllables  this is a poet  turn him over to the lord high dissuader from the head habit  my liege said the inventorinordinary of ingenious penalties i venture to suggest a keener affliction  name it the king said  let him retain that head  it was so ordered     the noser and the note   the head rifler of an insolvent bank learning that it was about to be visited by the official noser into things placed his own personal note for a large amount among its resources and gaily touching his guitar awaited the inspection  when the noser came to the note he asked whats this  that said the assistant pocketer of deposits is one of our liabilities  a liability exclaimed the noser  nay nay an asset  that is what you mean doubtless  therein you err the pocketer explained that note was written in the bank with our own pen ink and paper and we have not paid a stationery bill for six months  ah i see the noser said thoughtfully it is a liability  may i ask how you expect to meet it  with fortitude please god answered the assistant pocketer his eyes to heaven raisingwith fortitude and a firm reliance on the laxity of the law  enough enough exclaimed the faithful servant of the state choking with emotion here is a certificate of solvency  and here is a bottle of ink the grateful financier said slipping it into the others pocket it is all that we have     the cat and the king   a cat was looking at a king as permitted by the proverb  well said the monarch observing her inspection of the royal person how do you like me  i can imagine a king said the cat whom i should like better  for example  the king of the mice  the sovereign was so pleased with the wit of the reply that he gave her permission to scratch his prime ministers eyes out     the literary astronomer   the director of an observatory who with a thirtysixinch refractor had discovered the moon hastened to an editor with a fourcolumn account of the event  how much said the editor sententiously without looking up from his essay on the circularity of the political horizon  one hundred and sixty dollars replied the man who had discovered the moon  not half enough was the editors comment  generous man cried the astronomer glowing with warm and elevated sentiments pay me then what you will  great and good friend said the editor blandly looking up from his work we are far asunder it seems  the paying is to be done by you  the director of the observatory gathered up the manuscript and went away explaining that it needed correction he had neglected to dot an m     the lion and the rattlesnake   a man having found a lion in his path undertook to subdue him by the power of the human eye and near by was a rattlesnake engaged in fascinating a small bird  how are you getting on brother the man called out to the other reptile without removing his eyes from those of the lion  admirably replied the serpent  my success is assured my victim draws nearer and nearer in spite of her efforts  and mine said the man draws nearer and nearer in spite of mine  are you sure it is all right  if you dont think so the reptile replied as well as he then could with his mouth full of bird you better give it up  a halfhour later the lion thoughtfully picking his teeth with his claws told the rattlesnake that he had never in all his varied experience in being subdued seen a subduer try so earnestly to give it up  but he added with a wide significant smile i looked him into countenance     the man with no enemies   an inoffensive person walking in a public place was assaulted by a stranger with a club and severely beaten  when the stranger with a club was brought to trial the complainant said to the judge  i do not know why i was assaulted i have not an enemy in the world  that said the defendant is why i struck him  let the prisoner be discharged said the judge a man who has no enemies has no friends  the courts are not for such     the alderman and the raccoon   i see quite a number of rings on your tail said an alderman to a raccoon that he met in a zoological garden  yes replied the raccoon and i hear quite a number of tales on your ring  the alderman being of a sensitive retiring disposition shrank from further comparison and strolling to another part of the garden stole the camel     the flyingmachine   an ingenious man who had built a flyingmachine invited a great concourse of people to see it go up  at the appointed moment everything being ready he boarded the car and turned on the power  the machine immediately broke through the massive substructure upon which it was builded and sank out of sight into the earth the aeronaut springing out barely in time to save himself  well said he i have done enough to demonstrate the correctness of my details  the defects he added with a look at the ruined brickwork are merely basic and fundamental  upon this assurance the people came forward with subscriptions to build a second machine     the angels tear   an unworthy man who had laughed at the woes of a woman whom he loved was bewailing his indiscretion in sackclothofgold and ashesofroses when the angel of compassion looked down upon him saying  poor mortalhow unblest not to know the wickedness of laughing at anothers misfortune  so saying he let fall a great tear which encountering in its descent a current of cold air was congealed into a hailstone  this struck the unworthy man on the head and set him rubbing that bruised organ vigorously with one hand while vainly attempting to expand an umbrella with the other  thereat the angel of compassion did most shamelessly and wickedly laugh     the city of political distinction   jamrach the rich being anxious to reach the city of political distinction before nightfall arrived at a fork of the road and was undecided which branch to follow so he consulted a wiselooking person who sat by the wayside  take that road said the wiselooking person pointing it out it is known as the political highway  thank you said jamrach and was about to proceed  about how much do you thank me was the reply  do you suppose i am here for my health  as jamrach had not become rich by stupidity he handed something to his guide and hastened on and soon came to a tollgate kept by a benevolent gentleman to whom he gave something and was suffered to pass  a little farther along he came to a bridge across an imaginary stream where a civil engineer who had built the bridge demanded something for interest on his investment and it was forthcoming  it was growing late when jamrach came to the margin of what appeared to be a lake of black ink and there the road terminated  seeing a ferryman in his boat he paid something for his passage and was about to embark  no said the ferryman  put your neck in this noose and i will tow you over  it is the only way he added seeing that the passenger was about to complain of the accommodations  in due time he was dragged across half strangled and dreadfully beslubbered by the feculent waters  there said the ferryman hauling him ashore and disengaging him you are now in the city of political distinction  it has fifty millions of inhabitants and as the colour of the filthy pool does not wash off they all look exactly alike  alas exclaimed jamrach weeping and bewailing the loss of all his possessions paid out in tips and tolls i will go back with you  i dont think you will said the ferryman pushing off this city is situated on the island of the unreturning     the party over there   a man in a hurry whose watch was at his lawyers asked a grave person the time of day  i heard you ask that party over there the same question said the grave person  what answer did he give you  he said it was about three oclock replied the man in a hurry but he did not look at his watch and as the sun is nearly down i think it is later  the fact that the sun is nearly down the grave person said is immaterial but the fact that he did not consult his timepiece and make answer after due deliberation and consideration is fatal  the answer given continued the grave person consulting his own timepiece is of no effect invalid and absurd  what then said the man in a hurry eagerly is the time of day  the question is remanded to the party over there for a new answer replied the grave person returning his watch to his pocket and moving away with great dignity  he was a judge of an appellate court     the poetess of reform   one pleasant day in the latter part of eternity as the shades of all the great writers were reposing upon beds of asphodel and moly in the elysian fields each happy in hearing from the lips of the others nothing but copious quotation from his own works for so jove had kindly bedeviled their ears there came in among them with triumphant mien a shade whom none knew  she for the newcomer showed such evidences of sex as cropped hair and a manly stride took a seat in their midst and smiling a superior smile explained  after centuries of oppression i have wrested my rights from the grasp of the jealous gods  on earth i was the poetess of reform and sang to inattentive ears  now for an eternity of honour and glory  but it was not to be so and soon she was the unhappiest of mortals vainly desirous to wander again in gloom by the infernal lakes  for jove had not bedeviled her ears and she heard from the lips of each blessed shade an incessant flow of quotation from his own works  moreover she was denied the happiness of repeating her poems  she could not recall a line of them for jove had decreed that the memory of them abide in plutos painful domain as a part of the apparatus     the unchanged diplomatist   the republic of madagonia had been long and well represented at the court of the king of patagascar by an officer called a dazie but one day the madagonian parliament conferred upon him the superior rank of dandee  the next day after being apprised of his new dignity he hastened to inform the king of patagascar  ah yes i understand said the king you have been promoted and given increased pay and allowances  there was an appropriation  yes your majesty  and you have now two heads have you not  oh no your majestyonly one i assure you  indeed  and how many legs and arms  two of each sireonly two of each  and only one body  just a single body as you perceive  thoughtfully removing his crown and scratching the royal head the monarch was silent a moment and then he said  i fancy that appropriation has been misapplied  you seem to be about the same kind of idiot that you were before     an invitation   a pious person who had overcharged his paunch with dead bird by way of attesting his gratitude for escaping the many calamities which heaven had sent upon others fell asleep at table and dreamed  he thought he lived in a country where turkeys were the ruling class and every year they held a feast to manifest their sense of heavens goodness in sparing their lives to kill them later  one day about a week before one of these feasts he met the supreme gobbler who said  you will please get yourself into good condition for the thanksgiving dinner  yes your excellency replied the pious person delighted i shall come hungry i assure you  it is no small privilege to dine with your excellency  the supreme gobbler eyed him for a moment in silence then he said  as one of the lower domestic animals you cannot be expected to know much but you might know something  since you do not you will permit me to point out that being asked to dinner is one thing being asked to dine is another and a different thing  with this significant remark the supreme gobbler left him and thenceforward the pious person dreamed of himself as white meat and dark until rudely awakened by decapitation     the ashes of madame blavatsky   the two brightest lights of theosophy being in the same place at once in company with the ashes of madame blavatsky an inquiring soul thought the time propitious to learn something worth while  so he sat at the feet of one awhile and then he sat awhile at the feet of the other and at last he applied his ear to the keyhole of the casket containing the ashes of madame blavatsky  when the inquiring soul had completed his course of instruction he declared himself the ahkoond of swat fell into the baleful habit of standing on his head and swore that the mother who bore him was a pragmatic paralogism  wherefore he was held in high reverence and when the two other gentlemen were hanged for lying the theosophists elected him to the leadership of their disastral body and after a quiet life and an honourable death by the kick of a jackass he was reincarnated as a yellow dog  as such he ate the ashes of madame blavatsky and theosophy was no more     the opossum of the future   one day an opossum who had gone to sleep hanging from the highest branch of a tree by the tail awoke and saw a large snake wound about the limb between him and the trunk of the tree  if i hold on he said to himself i shall be swallowed if i let go i shall break my neck  but suddenly he bethought himself to dissemble  my perfected friend he said my parental instinct recognises in you a noble evidence and illustration of the theory of development  you are the opossum of the future the ultimate fittest survivor of our species the ripe result of progressive prehensilityall tail  but the snake proud of his ancient eminence in scriptural history was strictly orthodox and did not accept the scientific view     the lifesavers   seventyfive men presented themselves before the president of the humane society and demanded the great gold medal for lifesaving  why yes said the president by diligent effort so many men must have saved a considerable number of lives  how many did you save  seventyfive sir replied their spokesman  ah yes that is one eachvery good workvery good work indeed the president said  you shall not only have the societys great gold medal but its recommendation for employment at the various lifeboat stations along the coast  but how did you save so many lives  the spokesman of the men replied  we are officers of the law and have just returned from the pursuit of two murderous outlaws     the australian grasshopper   a distinguished naturalist was travelling in australia when he saw a kangaroo in session and flung a stone at it  the kangaroo immediately adjourned tracing against the sunset sky a parabolic curve spanning seven provinces and evanished below the horizon  the distinguished naturalist looked interested but said nothing for an hour then he said to his native guide  you have pretty wide meadows here i suppose  no not very wide the guide answered about the same as in england and america  after another long silence the distinguished naturalist said  the hay which we shall purchase for our horses this eveningi shall expect to find the stalks about fifty feet long  am i right  why no said the guide a foot or two is about the usual length of our hay  what can you be thinking of  the distinguished naturalist made no immediate reply but later as in the shades of night they journeyed through the desolate vastness of the great lone land he broke the silence  i was thinking he said of the uncommon magnitude of that grasshopper     the pavior   an author saw a labourer hammering stones into the pavement of a street and approaching him said  my friend you seem weary  ambition is a hard taskmaster  im working for mr jones sir the labourer replied  well cheer up the author resumed fame comes at the most unexpected times  today you are poor obscure and disheartened and tomorrow the world may be ringing with your name  what are you giving me the labourer said  cannot an honest pavior perform his work in peace and get his money for it and his living by it without others talking rot about ambition and hopes of fame  cannot an honest writer said the author     the tried assassin   an assassin being put upon trial in a new england court his counsel rose and said your honour i move for a discharge on the ground of once in jeopardy my client has been already tried for that murder and acquitted  in what court asked the judge  in the superior court of san francisco the counsel replied  let the trial proceedyour motion is denied said the judge  an assassin is not in jeopardy when tried in california     the bumbo of jiam   the pahdour of patagascar and the gookul of madagonia were disputing about an island which both claimed  finally at the suggestion of the international league of cannon founders which had important branches in both countries they decided to refer their claims to the bumbo of jiam and abide by his judgment  in settling the preliminaries of the arbitration they had however the misfortune to disagree and appealed to arms  at the end of a long and disastrous war when both sides were exhausted and bankrupt the bumbo of jiam intervened in the interest of peace  my great and good friends he said to his brother sovereigns it will be advantageous to you to learn that some questions are more complex and perilous than others presenting a greater number of points upon which it is possible to differ  for four generations your royal predecessors disputed about possession of that island without falling out  beware oh beware the perils of international arbitrationagainst which i feel it my duty to protect you henceforth  so saying he annexed both countries and after a long peaceful and happy reign was poisoned by his prime minister     the two poets   two poets were quarrelling for the apple of discord and the bone of contention for they were very hungry  my sons said apollo i will part the prizes between you  you he said to the first poet excel in arttake the apple  and you he said to the second poet in imaginationtake the bone  to art the best prize said the first poet triumphantly and endeavouring to devour his award broke all his teeth  the apple was a work of art  that shows our masters contempt for mere art said the second poet grinning  thereupon he attempted to gnaw his bone but his teeth passed through it without resistance  it was an imaginary bone     the thistles upon the grave   a mind reader made a wager that he would be buried alive and remain so for six months then be dug up alive  in order to secure the grave against secret disturbance it was sown with thistles  at the end of three months the mind reader lost his money  he had come up to eat the thistles     the shadow of the leader   a political leader was walking out one sunny day when he observed his shadow leaving him and walking rapidly away  come back here you scoundrel he cried  if i had been a scoundrel answered the shadow increasing its speed i should not have left you     the sagacious rat   a rat that was about to emerge from his hole caught a glimpse of a cat waiting for him and descending to the colony at the bottom of the hole invited a friend to join him in a visit to a neighbouring cornbin  i would have gone alone he said but could not deny myself the pleasure of such distinguished company  very well said the friend i will go with you  lead on  lead exclaimed the other  what  i precede so great and illustrious a rat as you no indeedafter you sir after you  pleased with this great show of deference the friend went ahead and leaving the hole first was caught by the cat who immediately trotted away with him  the other then went out unmolested     the member and the soap   a member of the kansas legislature meeting a cake of soap was passing it by without recognition but the cake of soap insisted on stopping and shaking hands  thinking it might possibly be in the enjoyment of the elective franchise he gave it a cordial and earnest grasp  on letting it go he observed that a portion of it adhered to his fingers and running to a brook in great alarm he proceeded to wash it off  in doing so he necessarily got some on the other hand and when he had finished washing both were so white that he went to bed and sent for a physician     alarm and pride   goodmorning my friend said alarm to pride how are you this morning  very tired replied pride seating himself on a stone by the wayside and mopping his steaming brow  the politicians are wearing me out by pointing to their dirty records with me when they could as well use a stick  alarm sighed sympathetically and said  it is pretty much the same way here  instead of using an operaglass they view the acts of their opponents with me  as these patient drudges were mingling their tears they were notified that they must go on duty again for one of the political parties had nominated a thief and was about to hold a gratification meeting     a causeway   a rich woman having returned from abroad disembarked at the foot of knee deep street and was about to walk to her hotel through the mud  madam said a policeman i cannot permit you to do that you would soil your shoes and stockings  oh that is of no importance really replied the rich woman with a cheerful smile  but madam it is needless from the wharf to the hotel as you observe extends an unbroken line of prostrate newspaper men who crave the honour of having you walk upon them  in that case she said seating herself in a doorway and unlocking her satchel i shall have to put on my rubber boots     two in trouble   meeting a fat and patriotic statesman on his way to washington to beseech the president for an office an idle tramp accosted him and begged twenty five cents with which to buy a suit of clothes  melancholy wreck said the statesman what brought you to this state of degradation  liquor i suppose  i am temperate to the verge of absurdity replied the tramp  my foible was patriotism i was ruined by the baneful habit of trying to serve my country  what ruined you  indolence     the witchs steed   a broomstick which had long served a witch as a steed complained of the nature of its employment which it thought degrading  very well said the witch i will give you work in which you will be associated with intellectyou will come in contact with brains  i shall present you to a housewife  what said the broomstick do you consider the hands of a housewife intellectual  i referred said the witch to the head of her good man     the all dog   a lion seeing a poodle fell into laughter at the ridiculous spectacle  who ever saw so small a beast he said  it is very true said the poodle with austere dignity that i am small but sir i beg to observe that i am all dog     the farmers friend   a great philanthropist who had thought of himself in connection with the presidency and had introduced a bill into congress requiring the government to loan every voter all the money that he needed on his personal security was explaining to a sundayschool at a railway station how much he had done for the country when an angel looked down from heaven and wept  for example said the great philanthropist watching the teardrops pattering in the dust these early rains are of incalculable advantage to the farmer     physicians two   a wicked old man finding himself ill sent for a physician who prescribed for him and went away  then the wicked old man sent for another physician saying nothing of the first and an entirely different treatment was ordered  this continued for some weeks the physicians visiting him on alternate days and treating him for two different disorders with constantly enlarging doses of medicine and more and more rigorous nursing  but one day they accidently met at his bedside while he slept and the truth coming out a violent quarrel ensued  my good friends said the patient awakened by the noise of the dispute and apprehending the cause of it pray be more reasonable  if i could for weeks endure you both can you not for a little while endure each other  i have been well for ten days but have remained in bed in the hope of gaining by repose the strength that would justify me in taking your medicines  so far i have touched none of it     the overlooked factor   a man that owned a fine dog and by a careful selection of its mate had bred a number of animals but a little lower than the angels fell in love with his washerwoman married her and reared a family of dolts  alas he exclaimed contemplating the melancholy result had i but chosen a mate for myself with half the care that i did for my dog i should now be a proud and happy father  im not so sure of that said the dog overhearing the lament  theres a difference certainly between your whelps and mine but i venture to flatter myself that it is not due altogether to the mothers  you and i are not entirely alike ourselves     a racial parallel   some white christians engaged in driving chinese heathens out of an american town found a newspaper published in peking in the chinese tongue and compelled one of their victims to translate an editorial  it turned out to be an appeal to the people of the province of pang ki to drive the foreign devils out of the country and burn their dwellings and churches  at this evidence of mongolian barbarity the white christians were so greatly incensed that they carried out their original design     the honest cadi   a robber who had plundered a merchant of one thousand pieces of gold was taken before the cadi who asked him if he had anything to say why he should not be decapitated  your honour said the robber i could do no otherwise than take the money for allah made me that way  your defence is ingenious and sound said the cadi and i must acquit you of criminality  unfortunately allah has made me so that i must also take off your headunless he added thoughtfully you offer me half of the gold for he made me weak under temptation  thereupon the robber put five hundred pieces of gold into the cadis hand  good said the cadi  i shall now remove but one half your head  to show my trust in your discretion i shall leave intact the half you talk with     the kangaroo and the zebra   a kangaroo hopping awkwardly along with some bulky object concealed in her pouch met a zebra and desirous of keeping his attention upon himself said  your costume looks as if you might have come out of the penitentiary  appearances are deceitful replied the zebra smiling in the consciousness of a more insupportable wit or i should have to think that you had come out of the legislature     a matter of method   a philosopher seeing a fool beating his donkey said  abstain my son abstain i implore  those who resort to violence shall suffer from violence  that said the fool diligently belabouring the animal is what im trying to teach this beastwhich has kicked me  doubtless said the philosopher to himself as he walked away the wisdom of fools is no deeper nor truer than ours but they really do seem to have a more impressive way of imparting it     the man of principle   during a shower of rain the keeper of a zoological garden observed a man of principle crouching beneath the belly of the ostrich which had drawn itself up to its full height to sleep  why my dear sir said the keeper if you fear to get wet youd better creep into the pouch of yonder female kangaroothe saltarix mackintoshafor if that ostrich wakes he will kick you to death in a minute  i cant help that the man of principle replied with that lofty scorn of practical considerations distinguishing his species  he may kick me to death if he wish but until he does he shall give me shelter from the storm  he has swallowed my umbrella     the returned californian   a man was hanged by the neck until he was dead  whence do you come saint peter asked when the man presented himself at the gate of heaven  from california replied the applicant  enter my son enter you bring joyous tidings  when the man had vanished inside saint peter took his memorandumtablet and made the following entry  february 16 1893  california occupied by the christians     the compassionate physician   a kindhearted physician sitting at the bedside of a patient afflicted with an incurable and painful disease heard a noise behind him and turning saw a cat laughing at the feeble efforts of a wounded mouse to drag itself out of the room  you cruel beast cried he  why dont you kill it at once like a lady  rising he kicked the cat out of the door and picking up the mouse compassionately put it out of its misery by pulling off its head recalled to the bedside by the moans of his patient the kindhearted physician administered a stimulant a tonic and a nutrient and went away     two of the damned   two blighted beings haggard lachrymose and detested met on a blasted heath in the light of a struggling moon  i wish you a merry christmas said the first blighted being in a voice like that of a singing tomb  and i you a happy new year responded the second blighted being with the accent of a penitent accordeon  they then fell upon each others neck and wept scalding rills down each others spine in token of their banishment to the realm of ineffable bosh  for one of these accursed creatures was the first of january and the other the twentyfifth of december     the austere governor   a governor visiting a state prison was implored by a convict to pardon him  what are you in for asked the governor  i held a high office the convict humbly replied and sold subordinate appointments  then i decline to interfere said the governor with asperity a man who abuses his office by making it serve a private end and purvey a personal advantage is unfit to be free  by the way mr warden he added to that official as the convict slunk away in appointing you to this position i was given to understand that your friends could make the shikane county delegation to the next state convention solid forfor the present administration  was i rightly informed  you were sir  very well then i will bid you goodday  please be so good as to appoint my nephew night chaplain and reminder of mothers and sisters     religions of error   hearing a sound of strife a christian in the orient asked his dragoman the cause of it  the buddhists are cutting mohammedan throats the dragoman replied with oriental composure  i did not know remarked the christian with scientific interest that that would make so much noise  the mohammedans are cutting buddhist throats too added the dragoman  it is astonishing mused the christian how violent and how general are religious animosities  everywhere in the world the devotees of each local faith abhor the devotees of every other and abstain from murder only so long as they dare not commit it  and the strangest thing about it is that all religions are erroneous and mischievous excepting mine mine thank god is true and benign  so saying he visibly smugged and went off to telegraph for a brigade of cutthroats to protect christian interests     the penitent elector   a person belonging to the society for passing resolutions of respect for the memory of deceased members having died received the customary attention  good heavens exclaimed a sovereign elector on hearing the resolutions read what a loss to the nation  and to think that i once voted against that angel for inspector of gatelatches in public squares  in remorse the sovereign elector deprived himself of political influence by learning to read     the tail of the sphinx   a dog of a taciturn disposition said to his tail  whenever i am angry you rise and bristle when i am pleased you wag when i am alarmed you tuck yourself in out of danger  you are too mercurialyou disclose all my emotions  my notion is that tails are given to conceal thought  it is my dearest ambition to be as impassive as the sphinx  my friend you must recognise the laws and limitations of your being replied the tail with flexions appropriate to the sentiments uttered and try to be great some other way  the sphinx has one hundred and fifty qualifications for impassiveness which you lack  what are they the dog asked  one hundred and fortynine tons of sand on her tail  and  a stone tail     a prophet of evil   an undertaker who was a member of a trust saw a man leaning on a spade and asked him why he was not at work  because said the man leaning on a spade i belong to the gravediggers national extortion society and we have decided to limit the production of graves and get more money for the reduced output  we have a corner in graves and propose to work it to the best advantage  my friend said the undertaker who was a member of a trust this is a most hateful and injurious scheme  if people cannot be assured of graves i fear they will no longer die and the best interests of civilisation will wither like a frosted leaf  and blowing his eyes upon his handkerchief he walked away lamenting     the crew of the lifeboat   the gallant crew at a lifesaving station were about to launch their life boat for a spin along the coast when they discovered but a little distance away a capsized vessel with a dozen men clinging to her keel  we are fortunate said the gallant crew to have seen that in time our fate might have been the same as theirs  so they hauled the lifeboat back into its house and were spared to the service of their country     a treaty of peace   through massacres of each others citizens china and the united states had been four times plunged into devastating wars when in the year 1994 arose a philosopher in madagascar who laid before the governments of the two distracted countries the following modus vivendi  massacres are to be sternly forbidden as heretofore but any citizen or subject of either country disobeying the injunction is to detach the scalps of all persons massacred and deposit them with a local officer designated to receive and preserve them and sworn to keep and render a true account thereof  at the conclusion of each massacre in either country or as soon thereafter as practicable or at stated regular periods as may be provided by treaty there shall be an exchange of scalps between the two governments scalp for scalp without regard to sex or age the government having the greatest number is to be taxed on the excess at the rate of 1000 a scalp and the other government credited with the amount  once in every decade there shall be a general settlement when the balance due shall be paid to the creditor nation in mexican dollars  the plan was adopted the necessary treaty made with legislation to carry out its provisions the madagascarene philosopher took his seat in the temple of immortality and peace spread her white wings over the two nations to the unspeakable defiling of her plumage     the nightside of character   a gifted and honourable editor who by practice of his profession had acquired wealth and distinction applied to an old friend for the hand of his daughter in marriage  with all my heart and god bless you said the old friend grasping him by both hands  it is a greater honour than i had dared to hope for  i knew what your answer would be replied the gifted and honourable editor  and yet he added with a sly smile i feel that i ought to give you as much knowledge of my character as i possess  in this scrap book is such testimony relating to my shady side as i have within the past ten years been able to cut from the columns of my competitors in the business of elevating humanity to a higher plane of mind and moralsmy loathsome contemporaries  laying the book on a table he withdrew in high spirits to make arrangements for the wedding  three days later he received the scrap book from a messenger with a note warning him never again to darken his old friends door  see the gifted and honourable editor exclaimed pointing to that injunctioni am a painter and grainer  and he was led away to the asylum for the indiscreet     the faithful cashier   the cashier of a bank having defaulted was asked by the directors what he had done with the money taken  i am greatly surprised by such a question said the cashier it sounds as if you suspected me of selfishness  gentlemen i applied that money to the purpose for which i took it i paid it as an initiation fee and one years dues in advance to the treasurer of the cashiers mutual defence association  what is the object of that organisation the directors inquired  when any one of its members is under suspicion replied the cashier the association undertakes to clear his character by submitting evidence that he was never a prominent member of any church nor foremost in sundayschool work  recognising the value to the bank of a spotless reputation for its officers the president drew his check for the amount of the shortage and the cashier was restored to favour     the circular clew   a detective searching for the murderer of a dead man was accosted by a clew  follow me said the clew and theres no knowing what you may discover  so the detective followed the clew a whole year through a thousand sinuosities and at last found himself in the office of the morgue  there said the clew pointing to the open register  the detective eagerly scanned the page and found an official statement that the deceased was dead  thereupon he hastened to police headquarters to report progress  the clew meanwhile sauntered among the busy haunts of men arm in arm with an ingenious theory     the devoted widow   a widow weeping on her husbands grave was approached by an engaging gentleman who in a respectful manner assured her that he had long entertained for her the most tender feelings  wretch cried the widow  leave me this instant  is this a time to talk to me of love  i assure you madam that i had not intended to disclose my affection the engaging gentleman humbly explained but the power of your beauty has overcome my discretion  you should see me when i have not been crying said the widow     the hardy patriots   a dispenserelect of patronage gave notice through the newspapers that applicants for places would be given none until he should assume the duties of his office  you are exposing yourself to a grave danger said a lawyer  how so the dispenserelect inquired  it will be nearly two months the lawyer answered before the day that you mention  few patriots can live so long without eating and some of the applicants will be compelled to go to work in the meantime  if that kills them you will be liable to prosecution for murder  you underrate their powers of endurance the official replied  what said the lawyer you think they can stand work  no said the otherhunger     the humble peasant   an office seeker whom the president had ordered out of washington was watering the homeward highway with his tears  ah he said how disastrous is ambition how unsatisfying its rewards how terrible its disappointments  behold yonder peasant tilling his field in peace and contentment  he rises with the lark passes the day in wholesome toil and lies down at night to pleasant dreams  in the mad struggle for place and power he has no part the roar of the strife reaches his ear like the distant murmur of the ocean  happy thrice happy man  i will approach him and bask in the sunshine of his humble felicity  peasant all hail  leaning upon his rake the peasant returned the salutation with a nod but said nothing  my friend said the office seeker you see before you the wreck of an ambitious manruined by the pursuit of place and power  this morning when i set out from the national capital  stranger the peasant interrupted if youre going back there soon maybe you wouldnt mind using your influence to make me postmaster at smiths corners  the traveller passed on     the various delegation   the king of wideout having been offered the sovereignty of wayoff sent for the three persons who had made the offer and said to them  i am extremely obliged to you but before accepting so great a responsibility i must ascertain the sentiments of the people of wayoff  sire said the spokesman of the three persons they stand before you  indeed said the king are you then the people of wayoff  yes your majesty  there are not many of you the king said attentively regarding them with the royal eye and you are not so very large i hardly think you are a quorum  moreover i never heard of you until you came here whereas wayoff is noted for the quality of its pork and contains hogs of distinction  i shall send a commissioner to ascertain the sentiments of the hogs  the three persons bowing profoundly backed out of the presence but soon afterward they desired another audience and on being readmitted said through their spokesman  may it please your majesty we are the hogs     the no case   a statesman who had been indicted by an unfeeling grand jury was arrested by a sheriff and thrown into jail  as this was abhorrent to his fine spiritual nature he sent for the district attorney and asked that the case against him be dismissed  upon what grounds asked the district attorney  lack of evidence to convict replied the accused  do you happen to have the lack with you the official asked  i should like to see it  with pleasure said the other here it is  so saying he handed the other a check which the district attorney carefully examined and then pronounced it the most complete absence of both proof and presumption that he had ever seen  he said it would acquit the oldest man in the world     a harmless visitor   at a meeting of the golden league of mystery a woman was discovered writing in a notebook  a member directed the attention of the superb high chairman to her and she was asked to explain her presence there and what she was doing  i came in for my own pleasure and instruction she said and was so struck by the wisdom of the speakers that i could not help making a few notes  madam said the superb high chairman we have no objection to visitors if they will pledge themselves not to publish anything they hear  are youon your honour as a lady now madamare you not connected with some newspaper  good gracious no cried the woman earnestly  why sir i am an officer of the womens press association  she was permitted to remain and presented with resolutions of apology     the judge and the rash act   a judge who had for years looked in vain for an opportunity for infamous distinction but whom no litigant thought worth bribing sat one day upon the bench lamenting his hard lot and threatening to put an end to his life if business did not improve  suddenly he found himself confronted by a dreadful figure clad in a shroud whose pallor and stony eyes smote him with a horrible apprehension  who are you he faltered and why do you come here  i am the rash act was the sepulchral reply you may commit me  no the judge said thoughtfully no that would be quite irregular  i do not sit today as a committing magistrate     the prerogative of might   a slander travelling rapidly through the land upon its joyous mission was accosted by a retraction and commanded to halt and be killed  your career of mischief is at an end said the retraction drawing his club rolling up his sleeves and spitting on his hands  why should you slay me protested the slander  whatever my intentions were i have been innocuous for you have dogged my strides and counteracted my influence  dogged your grandmother said the retraction with contemptuous vulgarity of speech  in the order of nature it is appointed that we two shall never travel the same road  how then the slander asked triumphantly have you overtaken me  i have not replied the retraction we have accidentally met  i came round the world the other way  but when he tried to execute his fell purpose he found that in the order of nature it was appointed that he himself perish miserably in the encounter     an inflated ambition   the president of a great corporation went into a drygoods shop and saw a placard which read  if you dont see what you want ask for it  approaching the shopkeeper who had been narrowly observing him as he read the placard he was about to speak when the shopkeeper called to a salesman  john show this gentleman the world     rejected services   a heavy operator overtaken by a reverse of fortune was bewailing his sudden fall from affluence to indigence  do not weep said the reverse of fortune  you need not suffer alone name any one of the men who have opposed your schemes and i will overtake him  it is hardly worth while said the victim earnestly  not a soul of them has a cent     the power of the scalawag   a forestry commissioner had just felled a giant tree when seeing an honest man approaching he dropped his axe and fled  the next day when he cautiously returned to get his axe he found the following lines pencilled on the stump     what nature reared by centuries of toil    a scalawag in half a day can spoil    an equal fate for him may heaven provide    damned in the moment of his tallest pride     at largeone temper   a turbulent person was brought before a judge to be tried for an assault with intent to commit murder and it was proved that he had been variously obstreperous without apparent provocation had affected the peripheries of several luckless fellowcitizens with the trunk of a small tree and subsequently cleaned out the town  while trying to palliate these misdeeds the defendants attorney turned suddenly to the judge saying  did your honour ever lose your temper  i fine you twentyfive dollars for contempt of court roared the judge in wrath  how dare you mention the loss of my temper in connection with this case  after a moments silence the attorney said meekly  i thought my client might perhaps have found it     the seeker and the sought   a politician seeing a fat turkey which he wanted for dinner baited a hook with a grain of corn and dragged it before the fowl at the end of a long and almost invisible line  when the turkey had swallowed the hook the politician ran drawing the creature after him  fellowcitizens he cried addressing some turkeybreeders whom he met you observe that the man does not seek the bird but the bird seeks the man  for this unsolicited and unexpected dinner i thank you with all my heart     his flyspeck majesty   a distinguished advocate of republican institutions was seen pickling his shins in the ocean  why dont you come out on dry land said the spectator  what are you in there for  sir replied the distinguished advocate of republican institutions a ship is expected bearing his majesty the king of the flyspeck islands and i wish to be the first to grasp the crowned hand  but said the spectator you said in your famous speech before the society for the prevention of the protrusion of nail heads from plank sidewalks that kings were bloodsmeared oppressors and hellbound loafers  my dear sir said the distinguished advocate of republican institutions without removing his eyes from the horizon you wander away into the strangest irrelevancies  i spoke of kings in the abstract     the pugilists diet   the trainer of a pugilist consulted a physician regarding the champions diet  beefsteaks are too tender said the physician have his meat cut from the neck of a bull  i thought the steaks more digestible the trainer explained  that is very true said the physician but they do not sufficiently exercise the chin     the old man and the pupil   a beautiful old man meeting a sundayschool pupil laid his hand tenderly upon the lads head saying listen my son to the words of the wise and heed the advice of the righteous  all right said the sundayschool pupil go ahead  oh i havent anything to do with it myself said the beautiful old man  i am only observing one of the customs of the age  i am a pirate  and when he had taken his hand from the lads head the latter observed that his hair was full of clotted blood  then the beautiful old man went his way instructing other youth     the deceased and his heirs   a man died leaving a large estate and many sorrowful relations who claimed it  after some years when all but one had had judgment given against them that one was awarded the estate which he asked his attorney to have appraised  there is nothing to appraise said the attorney pocketing his last fee  then said the successful claimant what good has all this litigation done me  you have been a good client to me the attorney replied gathering up his books and papers but i must say you betray a surprising ignorance of the purpose of litigation     the politicians and the plunder   several political entities were dividing the spoils  i will take the management of the prisons said a decent respect for public opinion and make a radical change  and i said the blotted escutcheon will retain my present general connection with affairs while my friend here the soiled ermine will remain in the judiciary  the political pot said it would not boil any more unless replenished from the filthy pool  the cohesive power of public plunder quietly remarked that the two bosses would he supposed naturally be his share  no said the depth of degradation they have already fallen to me     the man and the wart   a person with a wart on his nose met a person similarly afflicted and said  let me propose your name for membership in the imperial order of abnormal proboscidians of which i am the high noble toby and surreptitious treasurer  two months ago i was the only member  one month ago there were two  today we number four emperors of the abnormal proboscis in good standingdoubles every four weeks see  thats geometrical progressionyou know how that piles up  in a year and a half every man in california will have a wart on his nose  powerful order  initiation five dollars  my friend said the person similarly afflicted here are five dollars keep my name off your books  thank you kindly the man with a wart on his nose replied pocketing the money it is just the same to us as if you joined  goodby  he went away but in a little while he was back  i quite forgot to mention the monthly dues he said     the divided delegation   a delegation at washington went to a new president and said  your excellency we are unable to agree upon a favourite son to represent us in your cabinet  then said the new president i shall have to lock you up until you do agree  so the delegation was cast into the deepest dungeon beneath the moat where it maintained a divided mind for many weeks but finally reconciled its differences and asked to be taken before the new president  my child said he nothing is so beautiful as harmony  my cabinet selections were all made before our former interview but you have supplied a noble instance of patriotism in subordinating your personal preferences to the general good  go now to your beautiful homes and be happy  it is not recorded that the delegation was happy     a forfeited right   the chief of the weather bureau having predicted a fine day a thrifty person hastened to lay in a large stock of umbrellas which he exposed for sale on the sidewalk but the weather remained clear and nobody would buy  thereupon the thrifty person brought an action against the chief of the weather bureau for the cost of the umbrellas  your honour said the defendants attorney when the case was called i move that this astonishing action be dismissed  not only is my client in no way responsible for the loss but he distinctly foreshadowed the very thing that caused it  that is just it your honour replied the counsel for the plaintiff the defendant by making a correct forecast fooled my client in the only way that he could do so  he has lied so much and so notoriously that he has neither the legal nor moral right to tell the truth  judgment for the plaintiff     revenge   an insurance agent was trying to induce a hard man to deal with to take out a policy on his house  after listening to him for an hour while he painted in vivid colours the extreme danger of fire consuming the house the hard man to deal with said  do you really think it likely that my house will burn down inside the time that policy will run  certainly replied the insurance agent have i not been trying all this time to convince you that i do  then said the hard man to deal with why are you so anxious to have your company bet me money that it will not  the agent was silent and thoughtful for a moment then he drew the other apart into an unfrequented place and whispered in his ear  my friend i will impart to you a dark secret  years ago the company betrayed my sweetheart by promise of marriage  under an assumed name i have wormed myself into its service for revenge and as there is a heaven above us i will have its hearts blood     an optimist   two frogs in the belly of a snake were considering their altered circumstances  this is pretty hard luck said one  dont jump to conclusions the other said we are out of the wet and provided with board and lodging  with lodging certainly said the first frog but i dont see the board  you are a croaker the other explained  we are ourselves the board     a valuable suggestion   a big nation having a quarrel with a little nation resolved to terrify its antagonist by a grand naval demonstration in the latters principal port  so the big nation assembled all its ships of war from all over the world and was about to send them three hundred and fifty thousand miles to the place of rendezvous when the president of the big nation received the following note from the president of the little nation  my great and good friend i hear that you are going to show us your navy in order to impress us with a sense of your power  how needless the expense  to prove to you that we already know all about it i inclose herewith a list and description of all the ships you have  the great and good friend was so struck by the hard sense of the letter that he kept his navy at home and saved one thousand million dollars this economy enabled him to buy a satisfactory decision when the cause of the quarrel was submitted to arbitration     two footpads   two footpads sat at their grog in a roadside resort comparing the evenings adventures  i stood up the chief of police said the first footpad and i got away with what he had  and i said the second footpad stood up the united states district attorney and got away with  good lord interrupted the other in astonishment and admirationyou got away with what that fellow had  no the unfortunate narrator explainedwith a small part of what i had     equipped for service   during the civil war a patriot was passing through the state of maryland with a pass from the president to join grants army and see the fighting stopping a day at annapolis he visited the shop of a wellknown optician and ordered seven powerful telescopes one for every day in the week  in recognition of this munificent patronage of the states languishing industries the governor commissioned him a colonel     the basking cyclone   a negro in a boat gathering driftwood saw a sleeping alligator and thinking it was a log fell to estimating the number of shingles it would make for his new cabin  having satisfied his mind on that point he stuck his boathook into the beasts back to harvest his good fortune thereupon the saurian emerged from his dream and took to the water greatly to the surprise of the manandbrother  i never befo seen such a cyclone as dat he exclaimed as soon as he had recovered his breath  it done carry away de ruf of my house     at the pole   after a great expenditure of life and treasure a daring explorer had succeeded in reaching the north pole when he was approached by a native galeut who lived there  good morning said the native galeut  im very glad to see you but why did you come here  glory said the daring explorer curtly  yes yes i know the other persisted but of what benefit to man is your discovery  to what truths does it give access which were inaccessible beforefacts i mean having a scientific value  ill be tom scatted if i know the great man replied frankly you will have to ask the scientist of the expedition  but the scientist of the expedition explained that he had been so engrossed with the care of his instruments and the study of his tables that he had found no time to think of it     the optimist and the cynic   a man who had experienced the favours of fortune and was an optimist met a man who had experienced an optimist and was a cynic  so the cynic turned out of the road to let the optimist roll by in his gold carriage  my son said the optimist stopping the gold carriage you look as if you had not a friend in the world  i dont know if i have or not replied the cynic for you have the world     the poet and the editor   my dear sir said the editor to the man who had called to see about his poem i regret to say that owing to an unfortunate altercation in this office the greater part of your manuscript is illegible a bottle of ink was upset upon it blotting out all but the first linethat is to say  the autumn leaves were falling falling  unluckily not having read the poem i was unable to supply the incidents that followed otherwise we could have given them in our own words  if the news is not stale and has not already appeared in the other papers perhaps you will kindly relate what occurred while i make notes of it  the autumn leaves were falling falling  go on  what said the poet do you expect me to reproduce the entire poem from memory  only the substance of itjust the leading facts  we will add whatever is necessary in the way of amplification and embellishment  it will detain you but a moment  the autumn leaves were falling falling  now then  there was a sound of a slow getting up and going away  the chronicler of passing events sat through it motionless with suspended pen and when the movement was complete poesy was represented in that place by nothing but a warm spot on the wooden chair     the taken hand   a successful man of business having occasion to write to a thief expressed a wish to see him and shake hands  no replied the thief there are some things which i will not takeamong them your hand  you must use a little strategy said a philosopher to whom the successful man of business had reported the thiefs haughty reply  leave your hand out some night and he will take it  so one night the successful man of business left his hand out of his neighbours pocket and the thief took it with avidity     an unspeakable imbecile   a judge said to a convicted assassin  prisoner at the bar have you anything to say why the deathsentence should not be passed upon you  will what i say make any difference asked the convicted assassin  i do not see how it can the judge answered reflectively  no it will not  then said the doomed one i should just like to remark that you are the most unspeakable old imbecile in seven states and the district of columbia     a needful war   the people of madagonia had an antipathy to the people of novakatka and set upon some sailors of a novakatkan vessel killing two and wounding twelve  the king of madagonia having refused either to apologise or pay the king of novakatka made war upon him saying that it was necessary to show that novakatkans must not be slaughtered  in the battles which ensued the people of madagonia slaughtered two thousand novakatkans and wounded twelve thousand  but the madagonians were unsuccessful which so chagrined them that never thereafter in all their land was a novakatkan secure in property or life     the mine owner and the jackass   while the owner of a silver mine was on his way to attend a convention of his species he was accosted by a jackass who said  by an unjust discrimination against quadrupeds i am made ineligible to a seat in your convention so i am compelled to seek representation through you  it will give me great pleasure sir said the owner of a silver mine to serve one so closely allied to me ininwell you know he added with a significant gesture of his two hands upward from the sides of his head  what do you want  oh nothingnothing at all for myself individually replied the donkey but his countrys welfare should be a patriots supreme care  if americans are to retain the sacred liberties for which their fathers strove congress must declare our independence of european dictation by maintaining the price of mules     the dog and the physician   a dog that had seen a physician attending the burial of a wealthy patient said when do you expect to dig it up  why should i dig it up the physician asked  when i bury a bone said the dog it is with an intention to uncover it later and pick it  the bones that i bury said the physician are those that i can no longer pick     the party manager and the gentleman   a party manager said to a gentleman whom he saw minding his own business  how much will you pay for a nomination to office  nothing the gentleman replied  but you will contribute something to the campaign fund to assist in your election will you not asked the party manager winking  oh no said the gentleman gravely  if the people wish me to work for them they must hire me without solicitation  i am very comfortable without office  but urged the party manager an election is a thing to be desired  it is a high honour to be a servant of the people  if servitude is a high honour the gentleman said it would be indecent for me to seek it and if obtained by my own exertion it would be no honour  well persisted the party manager you will at least i hope indorse the party platform  the gentleman replied it is improbable that its authors have accurately expressed my views without consulting me and if i indorsed their work without approving it i should be a liar  you are a detestable hypocrite and an idiot shouted the party manager  even your good opinion of my fitness replied the gentleman shall not persuade me     the legislator and the citizen   an exlegislator asked a most respectable citizen for a letter to the governor recommending him for appointment as commissioner of shrimps and crabs  sir said the most respectable citizen austerely were you not once in the state senate  not so bad as that sir i assure you was the reply  i was a member of the slower house  i was expelled for selling my influence for money  and you dare to ask for mine shouted the most respectable citizen you have the impudence  a man who will accept bribes will probably offer them   do you mean to  i should not think of making a corrupt proposal to you sir but if i were commissioner of shrimps and crabs i might have some influence with the waterfront population and be able to help you make your fight for coroner  in that case i do not feel justified in denying you the letter  so he took his pen and some demon guiding his hand he wrote greatly to his astonishment     who sells his influence should stop it    an honest man will only swap it     the rainmaker   an officer of the government with a great outfit of mulewaggons loaded with balloons kites dynamite bombs and electrical apparatus halted in the midst of a desert where there had been no rain for ten years and set up a camp  after several months of preparation and an expenditure of a million dollars all was in readiness and a series of tremendous explosions occurred on the earth and in the sky  this was followed by a great downpour of rain which washed the unfortunate officer of the government and the outfit off the face of creation and affected the agricultural heart with joy too deep for utterance  a newspaper reporter who had just arrived escaped by climbing a hill near by and there he found the sole survivor of the expeditiona muledriverdown on his knees behind a mesquite bush praying with extreme fervour  oh you cant stop it that way said the reporter  my fellowtraveller to the bar of god replied the sole survivor looking up over his shoulder your understanding is in darkness  i am not stopping this great blessing under providence i am bringing it  that is a pretty good joke said the reporter laughing as well as he could in the strangling raina mule drivers prayer answered  child of levity and scoffing replied the other you err again misled by these humble habiliments  i am the rev ezekiel thrifft a minister of the gospel now in the service of the great manufacturing firm of skinn  sheer  they make balloons kites dynamite bombs and electrical apparatus     the citizen and the snakes   a publicspirited citizen who had failed miserably in trying to secure a national political convention for his city suffered acutely from dejection  while in that frame of mind he leaned thoughtlessly against a druggists showwindow wherein were one hundred and fifty kinds of assorted snakes  the glass breaking the reptiles all escaped into the street  when you cant do what you wish said the publicspirited citizen it is worth while to do what you can     fortune and the fabulist   a writer of fables was passing through a lonely forest when he met a fortune  greatly alarmed he tried to climb a tree but the fortune pulled him down and bestowed itself upon him with cruel persistence  why did you try to run away said the fortune when his struggles had ceased and his screams were stilled  why do you glare at me so inhospitably  i dont know what you are replied the writer of fables deeply disturbed  i am wealth i am respectability the fortune explained i am elegant houses a yacht and a clean shirt every day  i am leisure i am travel wine a shiny hat and an unshiny coat  i am enough to eat  all right said the writer of fables in a whisper but for goodness sake speak lower  why so the fortune asked in surprise  so as not to wake me replied the writer of fables a holy calm brooding upon his beautiful face     a smiling idol   an idol said to a missionary my friend why do you seek to bring me into contempt  if it had not been for me what would you have been remember thy creator that thy days be long in the land  i confess replied the missionary fingering a number of tencent pieces which a sundayschool in his own country had forwarded to him that i am a product of you but i protest that you cannot quote scripture with accuracy and point  therefore will i continue to go up against you with the sword of the spirit  shortly afterwards the idols worshippers held a great religious ceremony at the base of his pedestal and as a part of the rites the missionary was roasted whole  as the tongue was removed for the high priests table ah said the idol to himself that is the sword of the spiritthe only sword that is less dangerous when unsheathed  and he smiled so pleasantly at his own wit that the provinces of ghargaroo mgwana and scowow were affected with a blight     philosophers three   a bear a fox and an opossum were attacked by an inundation  death loves a coward said the bear and went forward to fight the flood  what a fool said the fox  i know a trick worth two of that  and he slipped into a hollow stump  there are malevolent forces said the opossum which the wise will neither confront nor avoid  the thing is to know the nature of your antagonist  so saying the opossum lay down and pretended to be dead     the boneless king   some apes who had deposed their king fell at once into dissension and anarchy  in this strait they sent a deputation to a neighbouring tribe to consult the oldest and wisest ape in all the world  my children said the oldest and wisest ape in all the world when he had heard the deputation you did right in ridding yourselves of tyranny but your tribe is not sufficiently advanced to dispense with the forms of monarchy  entice the tyrant back with fair promises kill him and enthrone  the skeleton of even the most lawless despot makes a good constitutional sovereign  at this the deputation was greatly abashed  it is impossible they said moving away our king has no skeleton he was stuffed     uncalculating zeal   a maneating tiger was ravaging the kingdom of damnasia and the king greatly concerned for the lives and limbs of his royal subjects promised his daughter zodroulra to any man who would kill the animal  after some days camaraladdin appeared before the king and claimed the reward  but where is the tiger the king asked  may jackasses sing above my uncles grave replied camaraladdin if i dared go within a league of him  wretch cried the king unsheathing his consolerunderdisappointment how dare you claim my daughter when you have done nothing to earn her  thou art wiser o king than solyman the great and thy servant is as dust in the tomb of thy dog yet thou errest  i did not it is true kill the tiger but behold  i have brought thee the scalp of the man who had accumulated five million pieces of gold and was after more  the king drew his consolerunderdisappointment and flicking off camaraladdins head said  learn caitiff the expediency of uncalculating zeal  if the millionaire had been let alone he would have devoured the tiger     a transposition   travelling through the sagebrush country a jackass met a rabbit who exclaimed in great astonishment  good heavens how did you grow so big  you are doubtless the largest rabbit living  no said the jackass you are the smallest donkey  after a good deal of fruitless argument the question was referred for decision to a passing coyote who was a bit of a demagogue and desirous to stand well with both  gentlemen said he you are both right as was to have been expected by persons so gifted with appliances for receiving instruction from the wise  you sirturning to the superior animalare as he has accurately observed a rabbit  and youto the otherare correctly described as a jackass  in transposing your names man has acted with incredible folly  they were so pleased with the decision that they declared the coyote their candidate for the grizzly bearship but whether he ever obtained the office history does not relate     the honest citizen   a political preferment labelled with its price was canvassing the state to find a purchaser  one day it offered itself to a truly good man who after examining the label and finding the price was exactly twice as great as he was willing to pay spurned the political preferment from his door  then the people said behold this is an honest citizen  and the truly good man humbly confessed that it was so     a creaking tail   an american statesman who had twisted the tail of the british lion until his arms ached was at last rewarded by a sharp rasping sound  i knew your fortitude would give out after a while said the american statesman delighted your agony attests my political power  agony i know not said the british lion yawning the swivel in my tail needs a few drops of oil that is all     wasted sweets   a candidate canvassing his district met a nurse wheeling a baby in a carriage and stooping imprinted a kiss upon the babys clammy muzzle rising he saw a man who laughed  why do you laugh asked the candidate  because replied the man the baby belongs to the orphan asylum  but the nurse said the candidatethe nurse will surely relate the touching incident wherever she goes and perhaps write to her former master  the nurse said the man who had laughed is an inmate of the institution for the illiteratedeafanddumb     six and one   the committee on gerrymander worked late drawing intricate lines on a map of the state and being weary sought repose in a game of poker  at the close of the game the six republican members were bankrupt and the single democrat had all the money  on the next day when the committee was called to order for business one of the luckless six mounted his legs and said  mr chairman before we bend to our noble task of purifying politics in the interest of good government i wish to say a word of the untoward events of last evening  if my memory serves me the disasters which overtook the majority of this honourable body always befell when it was the minoritys deal  it is my solemn conviction mr chairman and to its affirmation i pledge my life my fortune and my sacred honour that that wicked and unscrupulous minority redistricted the cards     the sportsman and the squirrel   a sportsman who had wounded a squirrel which was making desperate efforts to drag itself away ran after it with a stick exclaiming  poor thing  i will put it out of its misery  at that moment the squirrels stopped from exhaustion and looking up at its enemy said  i dont venture to doubt the sincerity of your compassion though it comes rather late but you seem to lack the faculty of observation  do you not perceive by my actions that the dearest wish of my heart is to continue in my misery  at this exposure of his hypocrisy the sportsman was so overcome with shame and remorse that he would not strike the squirrel but pointing it out to his dog walked thoughtfully away     the fogy and the sheik   a fogy who lived in a cave near a great caravan route returned to his home one day and saw near by a great concourse of men and animals and in their midst a tower at the foot of which something with wheels smoked and panted like an exhausted horse  he sought the sheik of the outfit  what sin art thou committing now o son of a christian dog said the fogy with a truly oriental politeness  boring for water you blackandtan galoot replied the sheik of the outfit with that ready repartee which distinguishes the unbeliever  knowest thou not thou whelp of darkness and father of disordered livers cried the fogy that water will cause grass to spring up here and trees and possibly even flowers  knowest thou not that thou art in truth producing an oasis  and dont you know said the sheik of the outfit that caravans will then stop here for rest and refreshments giving you a chance to steal the camels the horses and the goods  may the wild hog defile my grave but thou speakest wisdom the fogy replied with the dignity of his race extending his hand  sheik  they shook     at heavens gate   having arisen from the tomb a woman presented herself at the gate of heaven and knocked with a trembling hand  madam said saint peter rising and approaching the wicket whence do you come  from san francisco replied the woman with embarrassment as great beads of perspiration spangled her spiritual brow  never mind my good girl the saint said compassionately  eternity is a long time you can live that down  but that if you please is not all  the woman was growing more and more confused  i poisoned my husband  i chopped up my babies  i  ah said the saint with sudden austerity your confession suggests a very grave possibility  were you a member of the womens press association  the lady drew herself up and replied with warmth  i was not  the gates of pearl and jasper swung back upon their golden hinges making the most ravishing music and the saint stepping aside bowed low saying  enter then into thine eternal rest  but the woman hesitated  the poisoningthe choppingthethe she stammered  of no consequence i assure you  we are not going to be hard on a lady who did not belong to the womens press association  take a harp  but i applied for membershipi was blackballed  take two harps     the catted anarchist   an anarchist orator who had been struck in the face with a dead cat by some respector of law to him unknown had the dead cat arrested and taken before a magistrate  why do you appeal to the law said the magistrateyou who go in for the abolition of law  that replied the anarchist who was not without a certain hardness of head that is none of your business i am not bound to be consistent you sit here to do justice between me and this dead cat  very well said the magistrate putting on the black cap and a solemn look as the accused makes no defence and is undoubtedly guilty i sentence her to be eaten by the public executioner and as that position happens to be vacant i appoint you to it without bonds  one of the most delighted spectators at the execution was the anonymous respector of law who had flung the condemned     the honourable member   a member of a legislature who had pledged himself to his constituents not to steal brought home at the end of the session a large part of the dome of the capitol  thereupon the constituents held an indignation meeting and passed a resolution of tar and feathers  you are most unjust said the member of the legislature  it is true i promised you i would not steal but had i ever promised you that i would not lie  the constituents said he was an honourable man and elected him to the united states congress unpledged and unfledged     the expatriated boss   a boss who had gone to canada was taunted by a citizen of montreal with having fled to avoid prosecution  you do me a grave injustice said the boss parting with a pair of tears  i came to canada solely because of its political attractions its government is the most corrupt in the world  pray forgive me said the citizen of montreal  they fell upon each others neck and at the conclusion of that touching rite the boss had two watches     an inadequate fee   an ox unable to extricate himself from the mire into which he sank was advised to make use of a political pull  when the political pull had arrived the ox said my good friend please make fast to me and let nature take her course  so the political pull made fast to the oxs head and nature took her course  the ox was drawn first from the mire and next from his skin  then the political pull looked back upon the good fat carcase of beef that he was dragging to his lair and said with a discontented spirit  that is hardly my customary fee ill take home this first instalment then return and bring an action for salvage against the skin     the judge and the plaintiff   a man of experience in business was awaiting the judgment of the court in an action for damages which he had brought against a railway company  the door opened and the judge of the court entered  well said he i am going to decide your case today  if i should decide in your favour i wonder how you would express your satisfaction  sir said the man of experience in business i should risk your anger by offering you one half the sum awarded  did i say i was going to decide that case said the judge abruptly as if awakening from a dream  dear me how absentminded i am  i mean i have already decided it and judgment has been entered for the full amount that you sued for  did i say i would give you one half said the man of experience in business coldly  dear me how near i came to being a rascal  i mean that i am greatly obliged to you     the return of the representative   hearing that the legislature had adjourned the people of an assembly district held a massmeeting to devise a suitable punishment for their representative  by one speaker it was proposed that he be disembowelled by another that he be made to run the gauntlet  some favoured hanging some thought that it would do him good to appear in a suit of tar and feathers  an old man famous for his wisdom and his habit of drooling on his shirtfront suggested that they first catch their hare  so the chairman appointed a committee to watch for the victim at midnight and take him as he should attempt to sneak into town acrosslots from the tamarack swamp  at this point in the proceedings they were interrupted by the sound of a brass band  their dishonoured representative was driving up from the railway station in a coachandfour with music and a banner  a few moments later he entered the hall went upon the platform and said it was the proudest moment of his life cheers     a statesman   a statesman who attended a meeting of a chamber of commerce rose to speak but was objected to on the ground that he had nothing to do with commerce  mr chairman said an aged member rising i conceive that the objection is not well taken the gentlemans connection with commerce is close and intimate  he is a commodity     two dogs   the dog as created had a rigid tail but after some centuries of a cheerless existence unappreciated by man who made him work for his living he implored the creator to endow him with a wag  this being done he was able to dissemble his resentment with a sign of affection and the earth was his and the fulness thereof  observing this the politician an animal created later petitioned that a wag might be given him too as he was incaudate it was conferred upon his chin which he now wags with great profit and gratification except when he is at his meals     three recruits   a farmer an artisan and a labourer went to the king of their country and complained that they were compelled to support a large standing army of mere consumers who did nothing for their keep  very well said the king my subjects wishes are the highest law  so he disbanded his army and the consumers became producers also  the sale of their products so brought down prices that farming was ruined and their skilled and unskilled labour drove the artisans and labourers into the almshouses and highways  in a few years the national distress was so great that the farmer the artisan and the labourer petitioned the king to reorganize the standing army  what said the king you wish to support those idle consumers again  no your majesty they repliedwe wish to enlist     the mirror   a silkeneared spaniel who traced his descent from king charles the second of england chanced to look into a mirror which was leaning against the wainscoting of a room on the ground floor of his mistresss house  seeing his reflection he supposed it to be another dog outside and said  i can chew up any such milksoppy pup as that and i will  so he ran outofdoors and around to the side of the house where he fancied the enemy was  it so happened that at that moment a bulldog sat there sunning his teeth  the spaniel stopped short in dire consternation and after regarding the bulldog a moment from a safe distance said  i dont know whether you cultivate the arts of peace or your flag is flung to the battle and the breeze and your voice is for war  if you are a civilian the windows of this house flatter you worse than a newspaper but if youre a soldier they do you a grave injustice  this speech being unintelligible to the bulldog he only civilly smiled which so terrified the spaniel that he dropped dead in his tracks     saint and sinner   my friend said a distinguished officer of the salvation army to a most wicked sinner i was once a drunkard a thief an assassin  the divine grace has made me what i am  the most wicked sinner looked at him from head to foot  henceforth he said the divine grace i fancy will let well enough alone     an antidote   a young ostrich came to its mother groaning with pain and with its wings tightly crossed upon its stomach  what have you been eating the mother asked with solicitude  nothing but a keg of nails was the reply  what exclaimed the mother a whole keg of nails at your age  why you will kill yourself that way  go quickly my child and swallow a clawhammer     a weary echo   a convention of female writers which for two days had been stuffing womans couch with goosequills and hailing the down of a new era adjourned with unabated enthusiasm shouting place aux dames  and echo wearily replied oh damn     the ingenious blackmailer   an inventor went to a king and was granted an audience when the following conversation ensued  inventormay it please your majesty i have invented a rifle that discharges lightning  kingah you wish to sell me the secret  inventoryes it will enable your army to overrun any nation that is accessible  kingin order to get any good of my outlay for your invention i must make a war and do so as soon as i can arm my troopsbefore your secret is discovered by foreign nations  how much do you want  inventorone million dollars  kingand how much will it cost to make the change of arms  inventorfifty millions  kingand the war will cost  inventorbut consider the glory and the spoils  kingexactly  but if i am not seeking these advantages  what if i decline to purchase  inventorthere is no economy in that  though a patriot i am poor if my own country will not patronise me i must seek a market elsewhere  king to prime ministertake this blackmailer and cut off his head     a talisman   having been summoned to serve as a juror a prominent citizen sent a physicians certificate stating that he was afflicted with softening of the brain  the gentleman is excused said the judge handing back the certificate to the person who had brought it he has a brain     the ancient order   hardly had that ancient order the sultans of exceeding splendour been completely founded by the grand flashing inaccessible when a question arose as to what should be the title of address among the members  some wanted it to be simply my lord others held out for your dukeness and still others preferred my sovereign liege  finally the gorgeous jewel of the order gleaming upon the breast of every member suggested your badgesty which was adopted and the order became popularly known as the kings of catarrh     a fatal disorder   a dying man who had been shot was requested by officers of the law to make a statement and be quick about it  you were assaulted without provocation of course said the district attorney preparing to set down the answer  no replied the dying man i was the aggressor  yes i understand said the district attorney you committed the aggressionyou were compelled to as it were  you did it in selfdefence  i dont think he would have hurt me if i had let him alone said the other  no i fancy he was a man of peace and would not have hurt a fly  i brought such a pressure to bear on him that he naturally had to yieldhe couldnt hold out  if he had refused to shoot me i dont see how i could decently have continued his acquaintance  good heavens exclaimed the district attorney throwing down his note book and pencil this is all quite irregular  i cant make use of such an antemortem statement as that  i never before knew a man to tell the truth said the chief of police when dying of violence  violence nothing the police surgeon said pulling out and inspecting the mans tongueit is the truth that is killing him     the massacre   some holy missionaries in china having been deprived of life by the bigoted heathens the christian press made a note of it and was greatly pained to point out the contrast between the bigoted heathens and the law abiding countrymen of the holy missionaries who had wickedly been sent to eternal bliss  yes assented a miserable sinner as he finished reading the articles the heathens of ying shing are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked  by the way he added turning over the paper to read the entertaining and instructive fables i know the heathenese lingo  ying shing means rock creek it is in the province of wyo ming     a ship and a man   seeing a ship sailing by upon the sea of politics an ambitious person started in hot pursuit along the strand but the peoples eyes being fixed upon the presidency no one observed the pursuer  this greatly annoyed him and recollecting that he was not aquatic he stopped and shouted across the waves tumultous roar  take my name off the passenger list  back to him over the waters hollow and heartless like laughter in a tomb rang the voice of the skipper  t aint on  and there in the focus of a million pairs of convergent eyes the ambitious person sat him down between the sun and moon and murmured sadly to his own soul  marooned by thunder     congress and the people   successive congresses having greatly impoverished the people they were discouraged and wept copiously  why do you weep inquired an angel who had perched upon a fence near by  they have taken all we have replied the peopleexcepting they added noting the suggestive visitantexcepting our hope in heaven thank god they cannot deprive us of that  but at last came the congress of 1889     the justice and his accuser   an eminent justice of the supreme court of patagascar was accused of having obtained his appointment by fraud  you wander he said to the accuser it is of little importance how i obtained my power it is only important how i have used it  i confess said the accuser that in comparison with the rascally way in which you have conducted yourself on the bench the rascally way in which you got there does seem rather a trifle     the highwayman and the traveller   a highwayman confronted a traveller and covering him with a firearm shouted your money or your life  my good friend said the traveller according to the terms of your demand my money will save my life my life my money you imply you will take one or the other but not both  if that is what you mean please be good enough to take my life  that is not what i mean said the highwayman you cannot save your money by giving up your life  then take it anyhow the traveller said  if it will not save my money it is good for nothing  the highwayman was so pleased with the travellers philosophy and wit that he took him into partnership and this splendid combination of talent started a newspaper     the policeman and the citizen   a policeman finding a man that had fallen in a fit said this man is drunk and began beating him on the head with his club  a passing citizen said  why do you murder a man that is already harmless  thereupon the policeman left the man in a fit and attacked the citizen who after receiving several severe contusions ran away  alas said the policeman why did i not attack the sober one before exhausting myself upon the other  thenceforward he pursued that plan and by zeal and diligence rose to be chief and sobriety is unknown in the region subject to his sway     the writer and the tramps   an ambitious writer distinguished for the condition of his linen was travelling the high road to fame when he met a tramp  what is the matter with your shirt inquired the tramp  it bears the marks of that superb unconcern which is the characteristic of genius replied the ambitious writer contemptuously passing him by  resting by the wayside a little later the tramp carved upon the smooth bark of a birchtree the words john gump champion genius     two politicians   two politicians were exchanging ideas regarding the rewards for public service  the reward which i most desire said the first politician is the gratitude of my fellowcitizens  that would be very gratifying no doubt said the second politician but alas in order to obtain it one has to retire from politics  for an instant they gazed upon each other with inexpressible tenderness then the first politician murmured gods will be done  since we cannot hope for reward let us be content with what we have  and lifting their right hands from the public treasury they swore to be content     the fugitive office   a traveller arriving at the capitol of the nation saw a vast plain outside the wall filled with struggling and shouting men  while he looked upon the alarming spectacle an office broke away from the throng and took shelter in a tomb close to where he stood the crowd being too intent upon hammering one another to observe that the cause of their contention had departed  poor bruised and bleeding creature said the compassionate traveller what misfortune caused you to be so far away from the source of power  i sought the man said the office     the tyrant frog   a snake swallowing a frog headfirst was approached by a naturalist with a stick  ah my deliverer said the snake as well as he could you have arrived just in time this reptile you see is pitching into me without provocation  sir replied the naturalist i need a snakeskin for my collection but if you had not explained i should not have interrupted you for i thought you were at dinner     the eligible soninlaw   a truly pious person who conducted a savings bank and lent money to his sisters and his cousins and his aunts of both sexes was approached by a tatterdemalion who applied for a loan of one hundred thousand dollars  what security have you to offer asked the truly pious person  the best in the world the applicant replied confidentially i am about to become your soninlaw  that would indeed be giltedged said the banker gravely but what claim have you to the hand of my daughter  one that cannot be lightly denied said the tatterdemalion  i am about to become worth one hundred thousand dollars  unable to detect a weak point in this scheme of mutual advantage the financier gave the promoter in disguise an order for the money and wrote a note to his wife directing her to count out the girl     the statesman and the horse   a statesman who had saved his country was returning from washington on foot when he met a race horse going at full speed and stopped it  turn about and travel the other way said the statesman and i will keep you company as far as my home  the advantages of travelling together are obvious  i cannot do that said the race horse i am following my master to washington  i did not go fast enough to suit him and he has gone on ahead  who is your master inquired the statesman  he is the statesman who saved his country answered the race horse  there appears to be some mistake the other said  why did he wish to travel so fast  so as to be there in time to get the country that he saved  i guess he got it said the other and limped along sighing     an aerophobe   a celebrated divine having affirmed the fallibility of the bible was asked why then he preached the religion founded upon it  if it is fallible he replied there is the greater reason that i explain it lest it mislead  then am i to infer said his questioner that you are not fallible  you are to infer that i am not pneumophagous     the thrift of strength   a weak man going downhill met a strong man going up and said  i take this direction because it requires less exertion not from choice  i pray you sir assist me to regain the summit  gladly said the strong man his face illuminated with the glory of his thought  i have always considered my strength a sacred gift in trust for my fellowmen  i will take you along with me  just get behind me and push     the good government   what a happy land you are said a republican form of government to a sovereign state  be good enough to lie still while i walk upon you singing the praises of universal suffrage and descanting upon the blessings of civil and religious liberty  in the meantime you can relieve your feelings by cursing the oneman power and the effete monarchies of europe  my public servants have been fools and rogues from the date of your accession to power replied the state my legislative bodies both state and municipal are bands of thieves my taxes are insupportable my courts are corrupt my cities are a disgrace to civilisation my corporations have their hands at the throats of every private interestall my affairs are in disorder and criminal confusion  that is all very true said the republican form of government putting on its hobnail shoes but consider how i thrill you every fourth of july     the life saver   an ancient maiden standing on the edge of a wharf near a modern swain was overheard rehearsing the words  noble preserver  the life that you have saved is yours  having repeated them several times with various intonations she sprang into the water where she was suffered to drown  i am a noble preserver said the modern swain thoughtfully moving away the life that i have saved is indeed mine     the man and the bird   a man with a shotgun said to a bird  it is all nonsense you know about shooting being a cruel sport  i put my skill against your cunningthat is all there is of it  it is a fair game  true said the bird but i dont wish to play  why not inquired the man with a shotgun  the game the bird replied is fair as you say the chances are about even but consider the stake  i am in it for you but what is there in it for me  not being prepared with an answer to the question the man with a shotgun sagaciously removed the propounder     from the minutes   an orator afflicted with atrophy of the organ of commonsense rose in his place in the halls of legislation and pointed with pride to his unblotted escutcheon  seeing what it supposed to be the finger of scorn pointed at it the unblotted escutcheon turned black with rage  seeing the unblotted escutcheon turning black with what he supposed to be the record of his own misdeeds showing through the whitewash the orator fell dead of mortification  seeing the orator fall dead of what they supposed to be atrophy of the organ of commonsense his colleagues resolved that whenever they should adjourn because they were tired it should be out of respect to the memory of him who had so frequently made them so     three of a kind   a lawyer in whom an instinct of justice had survived the wreck of his ignorance of law was retained for the defence of a burglar whom the police had taken after a desperate struggle with someone not in custody in consultation with his client the lawyer asked have you accomplices  yes sir replied the burglar  i have two but neither has been taken  i hired one to defend me against capture you to defend me against conviction  this answer deeply impressed the lawyer and having ascertained that the burglar had accumulated no money in his profession he threw up the case     the fabulist and the animals   a wise and illustrious writer of fables was visiting a travelling menagerie with a view to collecting literary materials  as he was passing near the elephant that animal said  how sad that so justly famous a satirist should mar his work by ridicule of people with long noseswho are the salt of the earth  the kangaroo said  i do so enjoy that great mans censure of the ridiculousparticularly his attacks on the proboscidae but alas he has no reverence for the marsupials and laughs at our way of carrying our young in a pouch  the camel said  if he would only respect the sacred hump he would be faultless  as it is i cannot permit his fables to be read in the presence of my family  the ostrich seeing his approach thrust her head in the straw saying  if i do not conceal myself he may be reminded to write something disagreeable about my lack of a crest or my appetite for scrapiron and although he is inexpressibly brilliant when he devotes himself to censure of folly and greed his dulness is matchless when he transcends the limits of legitimate comment  that said the buzzard to his mate is the distinguished author of that glorious fable the ostrich and the keg of raw nails  i regret to add that he wrote also the buzzards feast in which a carrion diet is contumeliously disparaged  a carrion diet is the foundation of sound health  if nothing else but corpses were eaten death would be unknown  seeing an attendant approaching the wise and illustrious writer of fables passed out of the tent and mingled with the crowd  it was afterward discovered that he had crept in under the canvas without paying     a revivalist revived   a revivalist who had fallen dead in the pulpit from too violent religious exercise was astonished to wake up in hades  he promptly sent for the adversary of souls and demanded his freedom explaining that he was entirely orthodox and had always led a pious and holy life  that is all very true said the adversary but you taught by example that a verb should not agree with its subject in person and number whereas the good book says that contention is worse than a dinner of herbs  you also tried to release the objective case from its thraldom to the preposition and it is written that servants should obey their masters  you stay right here     the debaters   a hurledback allegation which after a brief rest had again started forth upon its mission of mischief met an inkstand in midair  how did the honourable member whom you represent know that i was coming again inquired the hurledback allegation  he did not the inkstand replied he isnt at all forehanded at repartee  why then do you come things being even when he had hurled me back  he wanted to be a little ahead     two of the pious   a christian and a heathen in his blindness were disputing when the christian with that charming consideration which serves to distinguish the truly pious from the wolves that perish exclaimed  if i could have my way id blow up all your gods with dynamite  and if i could have mine retorted the heathen in his blindness bitterly malevolent but oleaginuously suave id fan all yours out of the universe     the desperate object   a dishonest gain was driving in its luxurious carriage through its private park when it saw something which frantically and repeatedly ran against a stone wall endeavouring to butt out its brains  hold  hold thou desperate object cried the dishonest gain these beautiful private grounds are no place for such work as thine  true said the object pausing i have other and better grounds for it  then thou art a happy man said the dishonest gain and thy bleeding head is but mere dissembling  who art thou great actor  i am known said the object dashing itself again at the wall as the consciousness of duty well performed     the appropriate memorial   a high public functionary having died the citizens of his town held a meeting to consider how to honour his memory and an other high public functionary rose and addressed the meeting  mr chairman and gintlemen said the other it sames to me and im hopin yez wull approve the suggistion that an appropriet way to honour the mimory of the decaised would be to erect an emolument sootably inscribed wid his vartues  the soul of the great man looked down from heaven and wept     a needless labour   after waiting many a weary day to revenge himself upon a lion for some unconsidered manifestation of contempt a skunk finally saw him coming and posting himself in the path ahead uttered the inaudible discord of his race  observing that the lion gave no attention to the matter the skunk keeping carefully out of reach said  sir i beg leave to point out that i have set on foot an implacable odour  my dear fellow the lion replied you have taken a needless trouble i already knew that you were a skunk     a flourishing industry   are the industries of this country in a flourishing condition asked a traveller from a foreign land of the first man he met in america  splendid said the man  i have more orders than i can fill  what is your business the traveller from a foreign land inquired  the man replied i make boxinggloves for the tongues of pugilists     the selfmade monkey   a man of humble birth and no breading who held a high political office was passing through a forest when he met a monkey  i take it you are one of my constituents the man said  no replied the monkey but i will support you if you can urge a valid claim to my approval  i am a selfmade man said the other proudly  that is nothing the monkey said  and going to a bigger pine he rose by his own unaided exertions to the top branch where he sat all bedaubed with the pitch which that vegetable exudes  now he added i am a selfmade monkey     the patriot and the banker   a patriot who had taken office poor and retired rich was introduced at a bank where he desired to open an account  with pleasure said the honest banker we shall be glad to do business with you but first you must make yourself an honest man by restoring what you stole from the government  good heavens cried the patriot if i do that i shall have nothing to deposit with you  i dont see that the honest banker replied  we are not the whole american people  ah i understand said the patriot musing  at what sum do you estimate this banks proportion of the countrys loss by me  about a dollar answered the honest banker  and with a proud consciousness of serving his country wisely and well he charged that sum to the account     the mourning brothers   observing that he was about to die an old man called his two sons to his bedside and expounded the situation  my children said he you have not shown me many marks of respect during my life but you will attest your sorrow for my death  to him who the longer wears a weed upon his hat in memory of me shall go my entire fortune  i have made a will to that effect  so when the old man was dead each of the youths put a weed upon his hat and wore it until he was himself old when seeing that neither would give in they agreed that the younger should leave off his weeds and the elder give him half of the estate  but when the elder applied for the property he found that there had been an executor  thus were hypocrisy and obstinacy fitly punished     the disinterested arbiter   two dogs who had been fighting for a bone without advantage to either referred their dispute to a sheep  the sheep patiently heard their statements then flung the bone into a pond  why did you do that said the dogs  because replied the sheep i am a vegetarian     the thief and the honest man   a thief who had brought a suit against his accomplices to recover his share of the plunder taken from an honest man demanded the honest mans attendance at the trial to testify to his loss  but the honest man explained that as he was merely the agent of a company of other honest men it was none of his affair and when the officers came to serve him with a subpoena he hid himself behind his back and wiled away the dragging hours of retirement and inaction by picking his own pockets     the dutiful son   a millionaire who had gone to an almshouse to visit his father met a neighbour there who was greatly surprised  what said the neighbour you do sometimes visit your father  if our situations were reversed said the millionaire i am sure he would visit me  the old man has always been rather proud of me besides he added softly i had to have his signature i am insuring his life     aesopus emendatus   the cat and the youth   a cat fell in love with a handsome young man and entreated venus to change her into a woman  i should think said venus you might make so trifling a change without bothering me  however be a woman  afterward wishing to see if the change were complete venus caused a mouse to approach whereupon the woman shrieked and made such a show of herself that the young man would not marry her    the farmer and his sons   a farmer being about to die and knowing that during his illness his sons had permitted the vineyard to become overgrown with weeds while they improved the shining hour by gambling with the doctor said to them  my boys there is a great treasure buried in the vineyard  you dig in the ground until you find it  so the sons dug up all the weeds and all the vines too and even neglected to bury the old man    jupiter and the baby show   jupiter held a baby show open to all animals and a monkey entered her hideous cub for a prize but jupiter only laughed at her  it is all very well said the monkey to laugh at my offspring but you go into any gallery of antique sculpture and look at the statues and busts of the fellows that you begot yourself  sh dont expose me said jupiter and awarded her the first prize    the man and the dog   a man who had been bitten by a dog was told that the wound would heal if he would dip a piece of bread in the blood and give it to the dog  he did so  no said the dog if i were to accept that it might be thought that in biting you i was actuated by improper motives  and by what motives were you actuated asked the man  i desired replied the dog merely to harmonise myself with the divine scheme of things  im a child of nature    the cat and the birds   hearing that the birds in an aviary were ill a cat went to them and said that he was a physician and would cure them if they would let him in  to what school of medicine do you belong asked the birds  i am a miaulopathist said the cat  did you ever practise gohomoeopathy the birds inquired winking faintly  the cat took the hint and his leave    mercury and the woodchopper   a woodchopper who had dropped his axe into a deep pool besought mercury to recover it for him  that thoughtless deity immediately plunged into the pool which became so salivated that the trees about its margin all came loose and dropped out    the fox and the grapes   a fox seeing some sour grapes hanging within an inch of his nose and being unwilling to admit that there was anything he would not eat solemnly declared that they were out of his reach    the penitent thief   a boy who had been taught by his mother to steal grew to be a man and was a professional public official  one day he was taken in the act and condemned to die  while going to the place of execution he passed his mother and said to her  behold your work  if you had not taught me to steal i should not have come to this  indeed said the mother  and who pray taught you to be detected    the archer and the eagle   an eagle mortally wounded by an archer was greatly comforted to observe that the arrow was feathered with one of his own quills  i should have felt bad indeed he said to think that any other eagle had a hand in this    truth and the traveller   a man travelling in a desert met a woman  who art thou asked the man and why dost thou dwell in this dreadful place  my name replied the woman is truth and i live in the desert in order to be near my worshippers when they are driven from among their fellows  they all come sooner or later  well said the man looking about the country doesnt seem to be very thickly settled here    the wolf and the lamb   a lamb pursued by a wolf fled into the temple  the priest will catch you and sacrifice you said the wolf if you remain there  it is just as well to be sacrificed by the priest as to be eaten by you said the lamb  my friend said the wolf it pains me to see you considering so great a question from a purely selfish point of view  it is not just as well for me    the lion and the boar   a lion and a boar who were fighting for water at a pool saw some vultures hovering significantly above them  let us make up our quarrel said the boar or these fellows will get one of us sure  i should not so much mind that replied the lion if they would get the right one  however i am willing to stop fighting and then perhaps i can grab a vulture  i like chicken better than pork anyhow    the grasshopper and the ant   one day in winter a hungry grasshopper applied to an ant for some of the food which they had stored  why said the ant did you not store up some food for yourself instead of singing all the time  so i did said the grasshopper so i did but you fellows broke in and carried it all away    the fisher and the fished   a fisherman who had caught a very small fish was putting it in his basket when it said  i pray you put me back into the stream for i can be of no use to you the gods do not eat fish  but i am no god said the fisherman  true said the fish but as soon as jupiter has heard of your exploit he will elevate you to the deitage  you are the only man that ever caught a small fish    the farmer and the fox   a farmer who had a deadly and implacable hatred against a certain fox caught him and tied some tow to his tail then carrying him to the centre of his own grainfield set the tow on fire and let the animal go  alas said the farmer seeing the result if that grain had not been heavily insured i might have had to dissemble my hatred of the fox    dame fortune and the traveller   a weary traveller who had lain down and fallen asleep on the brink of a deep well was discovered by dame fortune  if this fool she said should have an uneasy dream and roll into the well men would say that i did it  it is painful to me to be unjustly accused and i shall see that i am not  so saying she rolled the man into the well    the victor and the victim   two game cocks having fought a battle the defeated one skulked away and hid but the victor mounted a wall and crowed lustily  this attracted the attention of a hawk who said  behold how pride goeth before a fall  so he swooped down upon the boasting bird and was about to destroy him when the vanquished cock came out of his hidingplace and between the two the hawk was calamitously defeated    the wolf and the shepherds   a wolf passing a shepherds hut looked in and saw the shepherds dining  come in said one of them ironically and partake of your favourite dish a haunch of mutton  thank you said the wolf moving away but you must excuse me i have just had a saddle of shepherd    the goose and the swan   a certain rich man reared a goose and a swan the one for his table the other because she was reputed a good singer  one night when the cook went to kill the goose he got hold of the swan instead  thereupon the swan to induce him to spare her life began to sing but she saved him nothing but the trouble of killing her for she died of the song    the lion the cock and the ass   a lion was about to attack a braying ass when a cock near by crowed shrilly and the lion ran away  what frightened him the ass asked  lions have a superstitious terror of my voice answered the cock proudly  well well well said the ass shaking his head i should think that any animal that is afraid of your voice and doesnt mind mine must have an uncommon kind of ear    the snake and the swallow   a swallow who had built her nest in a court of justice reared a fine family of young birds  one day a snake came out of a chink in the wall and was about to eat them  the just judge at once issued an injunction and making an order for their removal to his own house ate them himself    the wolves and the dogs   why should there be strife between us said the wolves to the sheep it is all owing to those quarrelsome dogs  dismiss them and we shall have peace  you seem to think replied the sheep that it is an easy thing to dismiss dogs  have you always found it so    the hen and the vipers   a hen who had patiently hatched out a brood of vipers was accosted by a swallow who said what a fool you are to give life to creatures who will reward you by destroying you  i am a little bit on the destroy myself said the hen tranquilly swallowing one of the little reptiles and it is not an act of folly to provide oneself with the delicacies of the season    a seasonable joke   a spendthrift seeing a single swallow pawned his cloak thinking that summer was at hand  it was    the lion and the thorn   a lion roaming through the forest got a thorn in his foot and meeting a shepherd asked him to remove it  the shepherd did so and the lion having just surfeited himself on another shepherd went away without harming him  some time afterward the shepherd was condemned on a false accusation to be cast to the lions in the amphitheatre  when they were about to devour him one of them said  this is the man who removed the thorn from my foot  hearing this the others honourably abstained and the claimant ate the shepherd all himself    the fawn and the buck   a fawn said to its father you are larger stronger and more active than a dog and you have sharp horns  why do you run away when you hear one barking  because my child replied the buck my temper is so uncertain that if i permit one of those noisy creatures to come into my presence i am likely to forget myself and do him an injury    the kite the pigeons and the hawk   some pigeons exposed to the attacks of a kite asked a hawk to defend them  he consented and being admitted into the cote waited for the kite whom he fell upon and devoured  when he was so surfeited that he could scarcely move the grateful pigeons scratched out his eyes    the wolf and the babe   a famishing wolf passing the door of a cottage in the forest heard a mother say to her babe  be quiet or i will throw you out of the window and the wolves will get you  so he waited all day below the window growing more hungry all the time but at night the old man having returned from the village club threw out both mother and child    the wolf and the ostrich   a wolf who in devouring a man had choked himself with a bunch of keys asked an ostrich to put her head down his throat and pull them out which she did  i suppose said the wolf you expect payment for that service  a kind act replied the ostrich is its own reward i have eaten the keys    the herdsman and the lion   a herdsman who had lost a bullock entreated the gods to bring him the thief and vowed he would sacrifice a goat to them  just then a lion his jaws dripping with bullocks blood approached the herdsman  i thank you good deities said the herdsman continuing his prayer for showing me the thief  and now if you will take him away i will stand another goat    the man and the viper   a man finding a frozen viper put it into his bosom  the coldness of the human heart he said with a grin will keep the creature in his present condition until i can reach home and revive him on the coals  but the pleasures of hope so fired his heart that the viper thawed and sliding to the ground thanked the man civilly for his hospitality and glided away    the man and the eagle   an eagle was once captured by a man who clipped his wings and put him in the poultry yard along with the chickens  the eagle was much depressed in spirits by the change  why should you not rather rejoice said the man  you were only an ordinary fellow as an eagle but as an old rooster you are a fowl of incomparable distinction    the warhorse and the miller   having heard that the state was about to be invaded by a hostile army a warhorse belonging to a colonel of the militia offered his services to a passing miller  no said the patriotic miller i will employ no one who deserts his position in the hour of danger  it is sweet to die for ones country  something in the sentiment sounded familiar and looking at the miller more closely the warhorse recognised his master in disguise    the dog and the reflection   a dog passing over a stream on a plank saw his reflection in the water  you ugly brute he cried how dare you look at me in that insolent way  he made a grab in the water and getting hold of what he supposed was the other dogs lip lifted out a fine piece of meat which a butchers boy had dropped into the stream    the man and the fishhorn   a truthful man finding a musical instrument in the road asked the name of it and was told that it was a fishhorn  the next time he went fishing he set his nets and blew the fishhorn all day to charm the fish into them but at nightfall there were not only no fish in his nets but none along that part of the coast  meeting a friend while on his way home he was asked what luck he had had  well said the truthful man the weather is not right for fishing but its a redletter day for music    the hare and the tortoise   a hare having ridiculed the slow movements of a tortoise was challenged by the latter to run a race a fox to go to the goal and be the judge they got off well together the hare at the top of her speed the tortoise who had no other intention than making his antagonist exert herself going very leisurely  after sauntering along for some time he discovered the hare by the wayside apparently asleep and seeing a chance to win pushed on as fast as he could arriving at the goal hours afterward suffering from extreme fatigue and claiming the victory  not so said the fox the hare was here long ago and went back to cheer you on your way    hercules and the carter   a carter was driving a waggon loaded with a merchants goods when the wheels stuck in a rut  thereupon he began to pray to hercules without other exertion  indolent fellow said hercules you ask me to help you but will not help yourself  so the carter helped himself to so many of the most valuable goods that the horses easily ran away with the remainder    the lion and the bull   a lion wishing to lure a bull to a place where it would be safe to attack him said my friend i have killed a fine sheep will you come with me and partake of the mutton  with pleasure said the bull as soon as you have refreshed yourself a little for the journey  pray have some grass    the man and his goose   see these valuable golden eggs said a man that owned a goose  surely a goose which can lay such eggs as those must have a gold mine inside her  so he killed the goose and cut her open but found that she was just like any other goose  moreover on examining the eggs that she had laid he found they were just like any other eggs    the wolf and the feeding goat   a wolf saw a goat feeding at the summit of a rock where he could not get at her  why do you stay up there in that sterile place and go hungry said the wolf  down here where i am the brokenbottle vine cometh up as a flower the celluloid collar blossoms as the rose and the tincan tree brings forth after its kind  that is true no doubt said the goat but how about the circusposter crop  i hear that it failed this year down there  the wolf perceiving that he was being chaffed went away and resumed his duties at the doors of the poor    jupiter and the birds   jupiter commanded all the birds to appear before him so that he might choose the most beautiful to be their king  the ugly jackdaw collecting all the fine feathers which had fallen from the other birds attached them to his own body and appeared at the examination looking very gay the other birds recognising their own borrowed plumage indignantly protested and began to strip him  hold said jupiter this selfmade bird has more sense than any of you  he is your king    the lion and the mouse   a lion who had caught a mouse was about to kill him when the mouse said  if you will spare my life i will do as much for you some day  the lion goodnaturedly let him go  it happened shortly afterwards that the lion was caught by some hunters and bound with cords  the mouse passing that way and seeing that his benefactor was helpless gnawed off his tail    the old man and his sons   an old man afflicted with a family of contentious sons brought in a bundle of sticks and asked the young men to break it  after repeated efforts they confessed that it could not be done  behold said the old man the advantage of unity as long as these sticks are in alliance they are invincible but observe how feeble they are individually  pulling a single stick from the bundle he broke it easily upon the head of the eldest son and this he repeated until all had been served    the crab and his son   a logical crab said to his son why do you not walk straight forward your sidelong gait is singularly ungraceful  why dont you walk straight forward yourself said the son  erring youth replied the logical crab you are introducing new and irrelevant matter    the north wind and the sun   the sun and the north wind disputed which was the more powerful and agreed that he should be declared victor who could the sooner strip a traveller of his clothes  so they waited until a traveller came by  but the traveller had been indiscreet enough to stay over night at a summer hotel and had no clothes    the mountain and the mouse   a mountain was in labour and the people of seven cities had assembled to watch its movements and hear its groans  while they waited in breathless expectancy out came a mouse  oh what a baby they cried in derision  i may be a baby said the mouse gravely as he passed outward through the forest of shins but i know tolerably well how to diagnose a volcano    the bellamy and the members   the members of a body of socialists rose in insurrection against their bellamy  why said they should we be all the time tucking you out with food when you do nothing to tuck us out  so resolving to take no further action they went away and looking backward had the satisfaction to see the bellamy compelled to sell his own book     old saws with new teeth certain ancient fables applied to the life of our times   the wolf and the crane   a rich man wanted to tell a certain lie but the lie was of such monstrous size that it stuck in his throat so he employed an editor to write it out and publish it in his paper as an editorial  but when the editor presented his bill the rich man said  be contentis it nothing that i refrained from advising you about investments    the lion and the mouse   a judge was awakened by the noise of a lawyer prosecuting a thief  rising in wrath he was about to sentence the thief to life imprisonment when the latter said  i beg that you will set me free and i will some day requite your kindness  pleased and flattered to be bribed although by nothing but an empty promise the judge let him go  soon afterward he found that it was more than an empty promise for having become a thief he was himself set free by the other who had become a judge    the hares and the frogs   the members of a legislature being told that they were the meanest thieves in the world resolved to commit suicide  so they bought shrouds and laying them in a convenient place prepared to cut their throats  while they were grinding their razors some tramps passing that way stole the shrouds  let us live my friends said one of the legislators to the others the world is better than we thought  it contains meaner thieves than we    the belly and the members   some workingmen employed in a shoe factory went on a strike saying why should we continue to work to feed and clothe our employer when we have none too much to eat and wear ourselves  the manufacturer seeing that he could get no labour for a long time and finding the times pretty hard anyhow burned down his shoe factory for the insurance and when the strikers wanted to resume work there was no work to resume  so they boycotted a tanner    the piping fisherman   an editor who was always vaunting the purity enterprise and fearlessness of his paper was pained to observe that he got no subscribers  one day it occurred to him to stop saying that his paper was pure and enterprising and fearless and make it so  if these are not good qualities he reasoned it is folly to claim them  under the new policy he got so many subscribers that his rivals endeavoured to discover the secret of his prosperity but he kept it and when he died it died with him    the ants and the grasshopper   some members of a legislature were making schedules of their wealth at the end of the session when an honest miner came along and asked them to divide with him  the members of the legislature inquired  why did you not acquire property of your own  because replied the honest miner i was so busy digging out gold that i had no leisure to lay up something worth while  then the members of the legislature derided him saying  if you waste your time in profitless amusement you cannot of course expect to share the rewards of industry    the dog and his reflection   a state official carrying off the dome of the capitol met the ghost of his predecessor who had come out of his political grave to warn him that god saw him  as the place of meeting was lonely and the time midnight the state official set down the dome of the capitol and commanded the supposed traveller to throw up his hands  the ghost replied that he had not eaten them and while he was explaining the situation another state official silently added the dome to his own collection    the lion the bear and the fox   two thieves having stolen a piano and being unable to divide it fairly without a remainder went to law about it and continued the contest as long as either one could steal a dollar to bribe the judge  when they could give no more an honest man came along and by a single small payment obtained a judgment and took the piano home where his daughter used it to develop her biceps muscles becoming a famous pugiliste    the ass and the lions skin   a member of the state militia stood at a street corner scowling stormily and the people passing that way went a long way around him thinking of the horrors of war  but presently in order to terrify them still more he strode toward them when his sword entangling his legs he fell upon the field of glory and the people passed over him singing their sweetest songs    the ass and the grasshoppers   a statesman heard some labourers singing at their work and wishing to be happy too asked them what made them so  honesty replied the labourers  so the statesman resolved that he too would be honest and the result was that he died of want    the wolf and the lion   an indian who had been driven out of a fertile valley by a white settler said  now that you have robbed me of my land there is nothing for me to do but issue invitations to a wardance  i dont so much mind your dancing said the white settler putting a fresh cartridge into his rifle but if you attempt to make me dance you will become a good indian lamented by all who didnt know you  how did you get this land anyhow  the indians claim was compromised for a plug hat and a tin horn    the hare and the tortoise   of two writers one was brilliant but indolent the other though dull industrious  they set out for the goal of fame with equal opportunities before they died the brilliant one was detected in seventy languages as the author of but two or three books of fiction and poetry while the other was honoured in the bureau of statistics of his native land as the compiler of sixteen volumes of tabulated information relating to the domestic hog    the milkmaid and her bucket   a senator fell to musing as follows with the money which i shall get for my vote in favour of the bill to subsidise catranches i can buy a kit of burglars tools and open a bank  the profit of that enterprise will enable me to obtain a long low black schooner raise a deaths head flag and engage in commerce on the high seas  from my gains in that business i can pay for the presidency which at 50000 a year will give me in four years but it took him so long to make the calculation that the bill to subsidise catranches passed without his vote and he was compelled to return to his constituents an honest man tormented with a clean conscience    king log and king stork   the people being dissatisfied with a democratic legislature which stole no more than they had elected a republican one which not only stole all they had but exacted a promissory note for the balance due secured by a mortgage upon their hope of death    the wolf who would be a lion   a foolish fellow who had been told that he was a great man believed it and got himself appointed a commissioner to the interasylum exposition of preserved idiots  at the first meeting of the board he was mistaken for one of the exhibits and the janitor was ordered to remove him to his appropriate glass case  alas he exclaimed as he was carried out why was i not content to remain where the cut of my forehead is so common as to be known as the pacific slope    the monkey and the nuts   a certain city desiring to purchase a site for a public deformatory procured an appropriation from the government of the country  deeming this insufficient for purchase of the site and payment of reasonable commissions to themselves the men in charge of the matter asked for a larger sum which was readily given  believing that the fountain could not be dipped dry they applied for still more and more yet  wearied at last by their importunities the government said it would be damned if it gave anything  so it gave nothing and was damned all the harder    the boys and the frogs   some editors of newspapers were engaged in diffusing general intelligence and elevating the moral sentiment of the public  they had been doing this for some time when an eminent statesman stuck his head out of the pool of politics and speaking for the members of his profession said  my friends i beg you will desist  i know you make a great deal of money by this kind of thing but consider the damage you inflict upon the business of others
