64666539	town and country sermons     sermon i  how to keep passion week    preached before the queen  philippians ii 511   let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god  but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross  wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name  that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father  this the first day of passion week and this text is the keynote of passion week  it tells us of the obedience of christ of the unselfishness of christ and therefore of the true glory of christ  it tells us of one who was in the form of god the coequal and co eternal son the brightness of his fathers glory the express image of his fathers person  but who showed forth his fathers glory and proved that he was the express likeness of his fathers character by the very opposite means to those which man takes when he wishes to show forth his own glory  he was in the form of god  but he did not so the text seems to mean think that the bliss of god was a thing to be seized on greedily for himself  he did not think fit merely to glorify himself to enjoy himself  he was not like the false gods of whom the heathen dreamed who sat aloft in heaven and enjoyed themselves careless of mankind  no  he obeyed his father utterly and at all costs  he emptied himself says st paul  he took on him the form of a slave  he humbled himself  he became obedient obedient to death and that death the shameful and dreadful death of the cross  therefore god has highly exalted him has declared him to be perfectly good worthy of all praise honour glory power and dominion and has given him a name above all names the name of jesussaviour  one who saved others and cared not to save himself  and therefore too god has given him that dominion of which he is worthy and has proclaimed him lord and creator of all beings and all worlds past present and to come  it is of him of his obedience of his unselfishness that passion week speaks to us  it tell us of the mind of christ and says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  how then shall we keep his passion week  there are several ways of keeping it and all more or less good  wisdom is justified of all her children  but no way will be safe for us unless we keep in mind the mind of christobedience and selfsacrifice  some for instance are careful this week to attend church as often as possible and who will blame them  but unless they keep in mind the mind of christ they are apt to fall into the mistake of using vain repetitions as the heathen do and of fancying like them that they shall be heard for their much speaking forgetting their father in heaven knows what they have need of before they ask him  and that is not like the mind of christ  it is not like the mind of christ to fancy that god dwells in temples made with hands or that he can be worshipped with mens hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things  for in him we live and move and have our being and as even the heathen poet knew are the offspring the children of god  it is not according to the mind of christ to worship god as the heathen do in order to win him to do our will  it is according to the mind of christ to worship god in order that we may do his will to believe that gods will is a good will good in itself and good for us and for all things and beings and therefore to ask for strength to do gods will whatever it may cost us  that is the mind of christ who came not to do his own will but the will of him who sent him who taught us to pray as the greatest blessing for which we can ask father thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven who himself in his utter agony cried father not my will but thine be done  therefore it is good to go to church and good for some at least to go as often as possible  but only if we remember why we go and whom we go to worshipa father who asks of us to worship him in spirit and in truth  a father who has told us what that worship is like  is this god asked the jews of old the fast which i have chosen is it a day for a man to afflict his soul and bow down his head like a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him playing at being sad while god has not made him sad  wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord  is not this the fast which i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke  is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and to bring the poor that are cast out to thine house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh  this is that pure worship and undefined before god and the father of which st james tells us and says that it consists in thisto visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world  in a word this worship in the spirit and in truth is nought else but the mind of christ  to believe in to adore the fathers perfect goodness to long and try to copy that goodness here on earth  that is what christ did utterly and perfectly that is what we have to do each according to our powers and without it without the spirit of obedience all our churchgoing is of little worth in the eyes of our heavenly father  others again go into retirement for this week and spend it in examining themselves and thinking over the sufferings of christ and who again will blame them provided they do not neglect their daily duty meanwhile  but they too need to keep in mind the mind of christ if they mean to keep passion week aright  they need it indeed  and such a man before he shuts himself up and begins to examine himself would do well to examine himself as to why he is going to examine himself and to ask why am i going to do this  because it is my interest  because i think i shall gain more safety for my soul  because i hope it will give me more chance of pleasure and glory in the next world  but if so have i the mind of christ  for he did not think of his own interest his own gain his own pleasure his own glory  how is this then  i confess that the root of all my faults is selfishness  shall i examine into my own selfishness for a selfish endto get safety and pleasure by it hereafter  i confess that the very glory of christ is that there is no selfishness in him  shall i think over the sufferings of the unselfish christ for a selfish endto get something by it after i die  i am too apt already to make myself the centre round which all the world must turn  to care for everything only as far as it does me good or harm  shall i make myself the centre round which heaven is to turn  shall i think of god and of christ only as far as it will profit me  and this week too of all weeks in the year  god forgive me  into what a contradiction i am running unawares  no  if i do shut myself up from my fellowmen it shall be only to think how i may do my duty better to my fellowmen  if i do think over christs sufferings it shall be only that i may learn from him how to suffer if need be at the call of duty at least to stir up in me obedience usefulness generosity that i may go back to my work cheerfully willingly careless what reward i get provided only i can do good in my station  but after all will not the text tell us best how to keep passion week  will not our lords own example tell us  can we go wrong if we keep our passion week as christ kept his  and how did he keep it  certainly not by shutting himself up apart certainly not by mere thinking over the glory of selfsacrifice  he taught daily we read in the temple  instead of giving up his work for a while he seems to have worked more earnestly than ever  as the terrible end drew near and his soul was troubled and he was straitened as he looked forward to his baptism of fire and the struggle in him grew fiercer for the bible tells us that there was a struggle between the mans natural desire to save his life and the gods heavenly desire to lay down his life he threw himself more and more into the work which he had to do  we hear more perhaps of our lords saying and doings during this week up to the very moment before he was betrayed to death than we do of the whole three years of his public life  his teaching was never it seems so continual his appeals to the nation which he was trying to save were never so pathetic as at the very last his warnings to the bigots who were destroying his nation never so terrible his contempt for personal danger never so clear  the bible seems to picture him to us as gathering up all his strength for one last effort if by any means he might save that doomed city of jerusalem and in his divine spirit courting death the more the more his human flesh shrank from it  thisthe pattern of perfect obedience perfect unselfishness perfect generosity perfect selfsacrificing loveis what we are to look at in passion week  this i believe is what we are meant to copy in passion week that we may learn the habit of copying it all our lives long  why should not we then keep passion week somewhat as our lord kept it before us  not by merely hiding in our closets to meditate even about him  but by going about our work each in his place dutifully bravely as he went  by doing the duty which lies nearest us and trying to draw our lesson out of it  thus we may keep passion week in spirit and in truth though some of us may hardly have time to enter a church hardly have time for an hours private thought about religion  amid the bustle of daily duties amid the buzz of petty cares amid the anxieties of great labours amid the roar of the busy world which cannot stop and which ought not to stop for our convenience we may keep passion week in spirit and in truth if we will do the duty which lies nearest us and try to draw our lesson out of it  for practiceand i believe practice alonewill teach us to restrain ourselves and conquer ourselves  experienceand i believe experience alonewill show us our own faults and weaknesses  every manevery human spirit on gods earth has spiritual enemies habits and principles within himif not other spirits without him which hinder him more or less from being all that god meant him to be  and we must find out those enemies and measure their strength not merely by reading of them in books not merely by fancying them in our own minds but by the hard blows and sudden falls which they too often give us in the actual battle of daily life  and how can we find them out  this at least we can do  we can ask ourselves at every turnfor what end am i doing this and this  for what end am i living at all  for myself or for others  am i living for ambition for fame for show for money for pleasure  if so i have not the mind of christ  i have not found out the golden secret  i have not seen what true glory is what the glory of christ isto live for the sake of doing my dutyfor the sake of doing good  and am ii surely shall be if i am living for myselfstraggling envying casting an evil eye on those more fortunate than i perhaps letting loose against them a cruel tongue  if i am doing thus god forgive me  what have i of the mind of christ  what likeness between me and him who emptied himself of self who humbled himself gave himself up utterly even to death  is this the mind of christ is this the spirit whose name is love  and yet there should be a likeness  a likeness between christ and us  a likeness between god and us  for christ is the likeness of his father and not only of his father but of our father the father in heaven  and what should a child be but like his father what should man be but like god  but how shall we get that likeness  how shall we get the mind of christ which is the spirit of god  this at least we know  that the father will surely hear the child when the child cries to him  perhaps will hear him all the more tenderly the more utterly the child has strayed away  our highest reason the instincts of our own hearts tell us so christ himself has told us so and said to the jews of old  if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask him  shall give  yes and has given already  from that spirit of god have come and will always come all our purest highest best thoughts and feelings  from him comes all which raises us above the animals and makes us really and truly men and women  all sense of duty obedience order justice law all tenderness pity generosity honour modesty all this if you will receive it is that christ in us of whom st paul tells us and tells us that he is our hope of glory  yes these feelings in us which just as far as we obey them make us respect ourselves and make us blessings to our fellowmen what are they but the spirit of christ the likeness of christ the mind of christ in us the hope of our glory because if we obey them we shall attain to something of the true glory the glory with which christ himself is glorious  then let us pray to god now in this passion week to stir up in us that generous spirit to deepen in us that fair likeness to fill us with that noble mind  let us ask god to quench in us all which is selfish idle mean to quicken to life in us all which is godlike and from god that so we may attain at last to the true glory the glory which comes not from selfish ambition not from selfish pride not from selfish ease but from getting rid of selfishness in all its shapes  the glory which christ alone has in perfection  the glory before which every knee will one day bow whether in earth or heaven  even the glory of doing our duty regardless of what it costs us in the station to which each of us has been called by his father in heaven  amen    sermon ii  the divine hunger and thirst    preached before the queen  psalm xxxvi 7 8 9  how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings  they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures  for with thee is the fountain of life  in thy light shall we see light  this is a great saying  so great that we shall never know certainly never in this life how much it means  it speaks of being satisfied of what alone can satisfy a man  it speaks of man as a creature who is or rather ought to be always hungering and thirsting after something better than he has as it is written  blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled  so says david also in this psalm  i say man ought to be always hungering and thirsting for something better  i do not mean by that that he ought to be discontented nothing less  for just in as far as a man hungers and thirsts after righteousness and truth he will hunger and thirst after nothing else  as long as a man does not care for righteousness does not care to be a better man himself and to see the world better round him so long will he go longing after this fine thing and that tormenting himself with lusts and passions greediness and covetousness of divers sorts and little satisfaction will he get from them  but when he begins to hunger and thirst after righteousness that heavenly and spiritual hunger destroys the old carnal hunger in him  he cares less and less to ask what shall i eat and drink wherewithal shall i be clothedor how shall i win for myself admiration station and all the fine things of this worldwhat he thinks of more and more ishow can i become better and more righteous  how can i make my neighbours better likewise how the world  as for the good things of this life if they will make me a better man let them come  if not why should i care so much about them  what i want is to be righteous like god beneficent and gooddoing like god  that is the man of whom it is written that he shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of gods house gods kingdom for with god is the fountain of life  again as long as a man has no hunger and thirst after truth he is easily enough interested though he is not satisfied  he reads perhaps and amuses his fancy but he does no more  he reads again really to instruct his mind and learns about this and that  but he does not learn the causes of things the reasons of the chances and changes of this world and so he is not satisfied he takes up doctrines true ones perhaps at secondhand out of books and out of sermons without having had any personal experience of them and so when sickness or sorrow doubt or dread come they do not satisfy him  then he longshe ought at least to longfor truth he thirsts for truth  o that i could know the truth about myself about my fellowcreatures about this world  what am i really what are they  where am i  what can i know  what ought i to do i do not want secondhand names and notions  i want to be sure  that is the divine thirst after truth which will surely be satisfied  he will drink of the pleasure of true knowledge as out of an overflowing river and the more he knows the more he will be glad to know and the more he will find he can know if only he loves truth for truths own sake for as it is written in gods light shall that man see light  with god is the well of life and in his light we shall see light the first is the answer to mans hunger after righteousness the second answers to his thirst after truth  with god is the well of life  there is the answer  thou wishest to be a good man to live a good life to live as a good son good husband good father good in all the relations of humanity as it is written and noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god  then do thou walk with god for in him is the life thou wishest for  he alone can quicken thee and give thee spirit and power to fulfil thy duty in thy generation is not his spirit the lord and giver of lifethe only fount and eternal spring of life  from him life flows out unto the smallest blade of grass beneath thy feet the smallest gnat which dances in the sun that it may live the life which god intends for it  how much more to thee who hast an altogether boundless power of life whom god has made in his own likeness that thou mayest be called his son and live his life and do as christ did what thou seest thy heavenly father do  thou feelest perhaps how poor and paltry thine own life is compared with what it might have been  thou feelest that thou hast never done thy best  when the world is praising thee most thou art most ashamed of thyself  thou art ready to cry all day long i have left undone that which i ought to have done till at times thou longest that all was over and thou wert beginning again in some freer fuller nobler holier life to do and to be what thou hast never done nor been here and criest with the poet   tis life whereof my nerves are scant tis life not death for which i pant more life and fuller that i want   then have patience  with god is the fount of life  he will refresh and strengthen thee and raise thee up day by day to that new life for which thou longest  is not holy communion his own pledge that he will do so  is not that gods own sign to thee that though thou canst not feed and strengthen thine own soul he can and will feed and strengthen it and feed itmystery of mysterieswith himself that god may dwell in thee and thou in god  and if god and christ live in thee and work in thee to will and to do of their own good pleasure that shall be enough for thee and thou shall be satisfied  and just so again with that same thirst after truth  that too can only be satisfied by god and in god  not by the reading of books however true not by listening to sermons however clever can we see light  but only in the light of god  know god  know that he is justice itself order itself love itself patience itself pity itself  in the light of that all things will become light and bright to thee  matters which seemed to have nothing to do with god the thought of god will explain to thee if thou thinkest aright concerning god and the true knowledge of him will be the key to all other true knowledge in heaven and earth  for the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and a good understanding have all they that do thereafter  must it not be so how can it be otherwise  for in god all live and move and have their being and all things which he has made are rays from off his glory and patterns of his perfect mind  as the maker is so is his work if therefore thou wouldest judge rightly of the work acquaint thyself with the maker of it and know first and know for ever that his name is love  thus sooner or later in god the fathers good time will thy thirst for truth be satisfied and thou shalt see the light of god he may keep thee long waiting for full truth  he may send thee by strange and crooked paths  he may exercise and strain thy reason by doubts mistakes and failures but sooner or later if thou dost not faint and grow weary he will show to thee the thing which thou knewest not for he is thy father and wills that all his children each according to their powers should share not only in his goodness but in his wisdom also  do any of you say these are words too deep for us they are for learned people clever great saints  i think not  i have seen poor people ignorant people sick people poor old souls on parish pay satisfied with the plenteousness of gods house and drinking so freely of gods pleasure that they knew no thirst fretted not never were discontented  all vain longings after this and that were gone from their hearts  they had very little but it seemed to be enough  they had nothing indeed which we could call pleasure in this world but somehow what they had satisfied them because it came from god  they had a hidden pleasure joy content and peace  they had found out that with god was the well of life that in god they lived and moved and had their being  and as long as their souls lived in god full of the eternal life and goodness obeying his laws loving the thing which he commanded and desiring what he promised they could trust him for their poor wornout dying bodies that he would not let them perish but raise them up again at the last day  they knew very little but what they did know was full of light  cheerful and hopeful they were always for they saw all things in the light of god  they knew that god was light and god was love that his love was shining down on them and on all around them warming cheering quickening into life all things which he had made so that when the world should have looked most dark to them it looked most bright because they saw it lightened up by the smile of their father in heaven  o may god bring us all to such an old age that as our mortal bodies decay our souls may be renewed day by day that as the life of our bodies grows cold and feeble the life of our souls may grow richer warmer stronger more useful to all around us for ever and ever that as the light of this life fades the light of our souls may grow brighter fuller deeper till all is clear to us in the everlasting light of god in that perfect day for which st paul thirsted through so many weary years when he should no more see through a glass darkly or prophesy in part and talk as a child but see face to face and know even as he was known    sermon iii  the transfiguration    preached before the queen  matthew xvii 2 and 9  and he was transfigured before them    and he charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead  any one who will consider the gospels will see that there is a peculiar calm a soberness and modesty about them very different from what we should have expected to find in them  speaking as they do of the grandest person who ever trod this earth of the grandest events which ever happened upon this earthof the events indeed which settled the future of this earth for everone would not be surprised at their using grand wordsthe grandest they could find  if they had gone off into beautiful poetry if they had filled pages with words of astonishment admiration delight if they had told us their own thoughts and feelings at the sight of our lord if they had given us long and full descriptions of our lords face and figure even as forged documents have pretended to do to the very colour of his hair we should have thought it but natural  but there is nothing of the kind in either of the four gospels even when speaking of the most awful matters  their words are as quiet and simple and modest as if they were written of things which might be seen every day  when they tell of our lords crucifixion for instance how easy natural harmless right as far as we can see it would have been to have poured out their own feelings about the most pitiable and shameful crime ever committed upon earth to have spoken out all their own pity terror grief indignation and to have stirred up ours thereby  and yet all they say isand they crucified him  they feel that is enough  the deed is too dark to talk about  let it tell its own story to all human hearts  so with this account of the lords transfiguration  and he took peter and james and john his brother up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light    and while he yet spake a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said  this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased  hear ye him  how soberly simply modestly they tell this strange story  how differently they might have told it  a man might write whole poems whole books of philosophy about that transfiguration and yet never reach the full depth of its beauty and of its meaning  but the evangelists do not even try to do that  as with the crucifixion as with all the most wonderful passages of our lords life they simply say what happened and let the story bring its own message home to our hearts  what may we suppose is the reason of this great stillness and soberness of the gospels  i believe that it may be explained thus the men who wrote them were too much awed by our lord to make more words about him than they absolutely needed  our lord was too utterly beyond them  they felt that they could not understand him could not give a worthy picture of him  he was too noble too awful in spite of all his tenderness for any words of theirs however fine  we all know that the holiest things the deepest feelings the most beautiful sights are those about which we talk least and least like to hear others talk  putting them into words seems impertinent profane  no one needs to gild gold or paint the lily  when we see a glorious sunset when we hear the rolling of the thunderstorm we do not talk about them we do not begin to cry how awful how magnificent we admire them in silence and let them tell their own story  who that ever truly loved his wife talked about his love to her  who that ever came to holy communion in spirit and in truth tried to put into words what he felt as he knelt before christs altar  when god speaks man had best keep silence  so it was i suppose with the writers of the gospels  they had been in too grand company for them to speak freely of what they felt there  they had seen such sights and heard such words that they were inclined to be silent and think over it all and only wrote because they must write  they felt that our lord as i say was utterly beyond them too unlike any one whom they had ever met before too perfect too noble for them to talk about him  so they simply set down his words as he spoke them and his works as he did them as far as they could recollect and left them to tell their own story  even st john who was our lords beloved friend who seems to have caught and copied exactly his way of speaking seems to feel that there was infinitely more in our lord than he could put into words and ends with confessingand there are also many more things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written  the first reason then i suppose for the evangelists modesty was their awe and astonishment at our lord  the next i think may have been that they wished to copy him and so to please him  it surely must have been so if as all good christians believe they were inspired to write our lords life  the lord would inspire them to write as he would like his life to be written as he would have written it if it be reverent to speak of such a thing himself they were inspired by christs spirit and therefore they wrote according to the spirit of christ soberly humbly modestly copying the character of christ  think upon that word modestly  i am not sure that it is the best i only know that it is the best which i can find to express one excellence which we see in our lord which is like what we call modesty in common human beings  we all know how beautiful and noble modesty is how we all admire it how it raises a man in our eyes to see him afraid of boasting never showing off never requiring people to admire him never pushing himself forward or if his business forces him to go into public not going for the sake of display but simply because the thing has to be done and then quietly withdrawing himself when the thing is done content that none should be staring at him or thinking of him  this is modesty and we admire it not only in young people or those who have little cause to be proud  we admire it much more in the greatest the wisest and the best in those who have humanly speaking most cause to be proud  whenever on the other hand we see in wise and good men any vanity boasting pompousness of any kind we call it a weakness in them and are sorry to see them lowering themselves by the least want of divine modesty  now this great grace and noble virtue should surely be in our lord from whom all graces and virtues come and i think we need not look far through the gospels to find it  see how he refused to cast himself down from the temple and make himself a sign and a wonder to the jews  how he refused to show the pharisees a sign  how in this very text when it seemed good to him to show his glory he takes only three favourite apostles and commands them to tell no man till he be risen again  see again how when the jews wanted to take him by force and make him a king he escaped out of their hands  how when he had been preaching to or healing the multitude so that they crowded on him and became excited about him he more than once immediately left them and retired into a desert place to pray  see again how when he did tell the jews who he was in words most awfully unmistakeable the confession was as it were drawn from him at the end of a long argument when he was forced to speak out for truths sake  and even then how simple how modest if i dare so speak are his words  before abraham was i am  the most awful words ever spoken on earth and yet most divine in their very simplicity  the maker of the world telling his creatures that he is their god  what might he not have said at such a moment  what might we not fancy his saying  what words grand enough awful enough might not the evangelists have put into his mouth if they had not been men full of the spirit of truth  and yet what does the lord say  before abraham was i am   could he say more  if you think of the matter no  but could he say less  if you think of the manner no likewise  truly never man spake as he spake because never man was like him  perfect strength wisdom determination endurance and yet perfect meekness simplicity sobriety  zeal and modesty  they are the last two virtues which go together most seldom  in him they went together utterly and were one as he was one in spirit  him some of the evangelists saw and by him all were inspired and therefore they toned their account of him to his likeness and as it were took their keynote from him and made the very manner and language of their gospels a pattern of his manners and his life  and if we wanted a fresh proof as thank god needs not that the gospels are true i think we might find it in this  for when a man is inventing a wonderful story out of his own head he is certain to dress it up in fine words fancies shrewd reflections of his own in order to make people see as he goes on how wonderful it all is whereas no books on earth which describe wonderful events true or false are so sober and simple as the gospels which describe the most wonderful of all events  and this is to me a plain proof as i hope it will be to you that matthew mark luke and john were not inventing but telling a plain and true story and dared not alter it in the least and again a story so strange and beautiful that they dared not try to make it more strange or more beautiful by any words of their own  they had seen a person to describe whom passed all their powers of thought and memory much more their power of words  a person of whom even st paul could only say that he was the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person  words in which to write of him failed them for no words could suffice  but the temper of mind in which to write of him did not fail them for by gazing on the face of the lord they had been changed more or less into the likeness of his glory into that temper simplicity sobriety gentleness modesty which shone forth in him and shines forth still in their immortal words about him god grant that it may shine forth in us  god grant it truly  may we read their words till their spirit passes into us  may we as st paul expresses it looking on the face of the lord as into a glass be changed into his likeness from glory to glory  may he who inspired them to write inspire us to think and work like our lord soberly quietly simply  may god take out of us all pride and vanity boasting and forwardness and give us the true courage which shows itself by gentleness the true wisdom which show itself by simplicity and the true power which show itself by modesty amen    sermon iv  a soldiers training    luke vii 29  and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die  and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant  and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this  for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue  then jesus went with them  and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof  wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee  but say in a word and my servant shall be healed for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it  when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel  there is something puzzling in this speech of the centurions  one must think twice and more than twice to understand clearly what he had in his mind  i indeed am not quite sure that i altogether understand it  but i may perhaps help you to understand it by telling you what this centurion was  he was not a jew  he was a roman and a heathen a man of our race very likely  and he was a centurion a captain in the army and one mind who had risen from the ranks by good conduct and good service  before he got his vinestock which was the mark of his authority over a hundred men he had no doubt marched many a weary mile under a heavy load and fought probably many a bloody battle in foreign parts  that had been his education his training namely discipline and hard work  and because he had learned to obey he was fit to rule  he was helping now to keep in order those treacherous unruly jews and their worthless puppetkings like herod much as our soldiers in india are keeping in order the hindoos and their worthless puppetkings  whether the romans had any right to conquer and keep down the jews as they did is no concern of ours just now  but we have proof that what this centurion did he did wisely and kindly  the elders of the jews said of him that he loved the jews and had built them a synagogue a church  i suppose that what he had heard from them about a one living god who had made all things in heaven and earth and given them a law which cannot be broken so that all things obey him to this dayi suppose i say that this pleased him better than the roman stories of many gods who were capricious and fretful and quarrelled with each other in a fashion which ought to have been shocking to the conscience and reason of a disciplined soldier  there was a great deal besides in the old testament which would surely come home to a soldiers heart when it told him of a god of law and order and justice and might who defended the right in battle and inspired the old jews to conquer the heathen and to fight for their own liberty  for what was it which had enabled the romans to conquer so many great nations  what was it which enabled them to keep them in order and on the whole make them happier more peaceable more prosperous than they had ever been  what was it which had made him the poor common soldier an officer and a wealthy man governing by his little garrison of a hundred soldiers this town of capernaum and the country round  it was this  discipline drill obedience to authority  that roman army was the most admirably disciplined which the world till then had ever seen  so indeed was the whole roman government  every man knew his place and knew his work  every man had been trained to obey orders if he was told to go to go if he was told to do to do or to die in trying to do what he was bidden  this was the great and true thought which had filled this good mans mindduty order and obedience  and by thinking of order and seeing how strength and safety and success lie in order and by giving himself up to obey orders body and soul like a good soldier had that plain man who had certainly no scholarship perhaps could barely read or write caught sight of a higher wider deeper order than even that of a roman army  he had caught sight of that divine and wonderful order by which god has constituted the services of men and angels and all created things that divine and wonderful order by which sun and stars fire and hail wind and vapour cattle and creeping things fulfil his word  fulfil gods word  that was the thought surely which was in the good soldiers mind and which he was trying to speak out clumsily perhaps but truly enough  i suppose then that he thought in his own mind somewhat in this way  there is a word of command among us soldiers  has god then no word of command likewise  and that word of command is enough  is not gods word of command enough likewise  i merely speak and i am obeyed  i am merely spoken to and i obey  shall not god merely speak and be obeyed likewise there is discipline and order among men because it is necessary an army cannot be manoeuvred a government cannot be carried on without it  is there not a discipline and order in all heaven and earth  and that discipline is carried out by simple word of command  a word from me will make a man rush upon certain death  a word from certain other men will make me rush on certain death  for i am a man under authority  i have my tribune colonel as we should say over me and he again the perfect general of brigade over him  their word is enough for me  if they want me to do a thing they do not need to come under my roof to argue with me to persuade me much less to thrust me about and make me obey them by force  they say to me go and i go and i say to those under me go and they go likewise  and if i can work by a word cannot this jesus work by a word likewise  he is a messenger of god with commission and authority from god to work his will on his creatures  are not gods creatures as well ordered disciplined obedient as we soldiers are  are they not a hundred times better ordered  a messenger from god  is he not a god himself a god in goodness and mercy a god in miraculous power  cannot he do his work by a word far more certainly than i can do mine  if my word can send a man to death cannot his word bring a man back to life  surely it can  lord thou needest not to come under my roof speak the word only and my servant shall be healed  by some such thoughts as these i suppose had this good soldier gained his great faith his faith that all gods creatures were in a divine and wonderful order obedient to the will of god who made them and that jesus christ was gods viceroy and lieutenant i speak so because i suppose that is what he as a soldier would have thought to carry out gods commands on earth  now remember that he was the first heathen man of whom we read that he acknowledged christ  remember too that the next heathen of whom we read that he acknowledged christ was also a roman centurion he whom the old legends call longinus who when he saw our lord upon the cross said truly this was the son of god remember again that the next heathen of whom we read as having acknowledged christ he to whom st peter was sent at joppa who is often called the first fruits of the heathen was a roman centurion likewise  surely there must have been a reason for this  there must be a lesson in this and this i think is the lesson  that the soldierlike habit of mind is one which makes a man ready to receive the truth of christ  and why  because the good soldiers first and last thought is duty  to do his duty by those who are set over him and to learn to do his duty to those who are set under him  to turn his whole mind and soul to doing not just what he fancies but to what must be done because it is his duty  this is the character which makes a good soldier and a good christian likewise  if we be undisciplined and undutiful and unruly if we be fanciful self willed disobedient then we shall not understand christ or christs rule on earth and in heaven  if there be no order within us we shall not see his divine and wonderful order all around us if there be no discipline and obedience within us we shall never believe really that christ disciplines all things and that all things obey him  if there be no sense of duty in us governing our whole lives and actions we shall never perceive the true beauty and glory of christs character who sacrificed himself for his duty which was to do his fathers will  i tell you my friends that nothing prevents a man from gaining either right doctrines or right practice so much as the undutiful unruly selfconceited heart  we may be full of religious knowledge of devout sentiments of heavenly aspirations  but in spite of them all we shall never get beyond false doctrine and loose practice unless we have learned to obey to rule our own minds and hearts and tempers soberly and patiently to conform to the laws and to all reasonable rules of society to believe that god has called us to our station in life whatever it may be and to do our duty therein as faithful soldiers and servants of christ for if you will receive it the beginning and the middle and the end of all true religion is simply this  to do the will of god on earth as it is done in heaven    sermon v  christs sheep    mark vi 34  and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd  and he began to teach them many things  this is a text full of comfort if we will but remember one thing that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and for ever and therefore what he did when he was upon earth he is doing now and will do till the end of the world  if we will believe this and look at our lords doings upon earth as patterns and specimens as it were of his eternal life and character then every verse in the gospels will teach us something and be precious to us  the people came to hear jesus in a desert place a wild forest country among the hills on the east side of the lake of gennesaret and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep having no shepherd  and he taught them many things  and what kind of people were these who so moved our lords pity the text tells us that they were like sheep  now in what way were they like sheep  a sheep is simple and harmless and tractable and so i suppose were these people  they may not have been very clever and shrewd not good scholars  no doubt they were a poor wild ignorant set of people but they were tractable they were willing to come and learn they felt their own ignorance and wanted to be taught  they were not proud and selfsufficient not fierce or bloodthirsty  the text does not say that they were like wild beasts having no keeper but like sheep having no shepherd  and therefore christ pitied them because they were teachable willing to be taught and worth teaching and yet had no one to teach them  the scribes and pharisees it seems taught them nothing  they may have taught the people in jerusalem and in the great towns something  but they seem from all the gospels to have cared little or nothing for the poor folk out in the wild mountain country  they liked to live in pride and comfort in the towns with their comfortable congregations round them admiring them but they had no fancy to go out into the deserts to seek and to save those who were lost  they were bad shepherds greedy shepherds who were glad enough to shear gods flock and keep the wool themselves  but they did not care to feed the flock of god  it was too much trouble and they could get no honour and no money by it  and most likely they did not understand these poor people could not speak hardly understand their country language for these galileans spoke a rough dialect different from that of the upper classes  so the scribes and pharisees looked down on them as a bad wild low set of people with whom nothing could be done and said this people who knoweth not the law is accursed  but what they would not do god himself would  god in christ had come to feed his own flock and to seek the lost sheep and bring them gently home to gods fold  he could feel for these poor wild foresters and mountain shepherds he could understand what was in their hearts for he knew the heart of man and therefore he could make them understand him  and it was for this very reason one might suppose that our lord was willing to be brought up at nazareth that he might learn the country speech and country ways and that the people might grow to look on him as one of themselves those scribes and pharisees one may suppose were just the people whom they could not understand fine rich scholars proud people talking very learnedly about deep doctrines  the country folk must have looked at them as if they belonged to some other world and saidthose pharisees cannot understand us any more than we can them with their hard rules about this and that  easy enough for rich men like them to make rules for poor ones  indeed our lord said the very same of thembinding heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and laying them on mens shoulders while they themselves would not touch them with one of their fingers  then the lord himself came and preached to these poor wild folk and they heard him gladly  and why  because his speech was too deep for them  because he scolded and threatened them  no  we never find that our lord spoke harshly to them  they had plenty of sins and he knew it  but it is most remarkable that the evangelists never tell us what he said about those sins  what they do tell us is that he spoke to them of the common things around them of the flowers of the field the birds of the air of sowing and reaping and feeding sheep and taught them by parables taken from the common country life which they lived and the common country things which they saw and shewed them how the kingdom of god was like unto this and that which they had seen from their childhood and how earth was a pattern of heaven  and they could understand that  not all of it perhaps  but still they heard him gladly  his preaching made them understand themselves and their own souls and what god felt for them and what was right and wrong and what would become of them as they never felt before  it is plain and certain that the country people could understand christs parables when the scribes and pharisees could not  the scribes and pharisees in spite of all their learning were those who were without as our lord said who had eyes and could not see and ears and could not hear for their hearts were grown fat and gross  with all their learning they were not wise enough to understand the message which god sends in every flower and every sunbeam the message which christ preached to the poor and the poor heard him gladly the message which he confirmed to them by his miracles  for what were his miracles like  did he call down lightning to strike sinners dead or call up earthquakes to swallow them  no he went about healing the sick cleansing the leper feeding the hungry in the wilderness that therefore they might see by his example the glory of their father in heaven and understand that god is a god of love of mercy a deliverer a saviour and not as the scribes and pharisees made him out a hard taskmaster keeping his anger for ever and extreme to mark what was done amiss  ah that be sure was what made the scribes and pharisees more mad than anything else against christ that he spoke to the poor ignorant people of their father in heaven  it made them envious enough to see the poor people listening to christ when they would not listen to them but when he told these poor folk whom they called accursed and lost sinners that god in heaven was their father then no name was too bad for our lord and they called him the worst name which they could think ofa friend of publicans and sinners  that was the worst name in their eyes  and yet in reality it was the highest honour  but they never forgave him how could they  they felt that if he was doing gods work they were doing the devils that either he or they must be utterly wrong  and they never rested till they crucified him and stopped him for ever as they fancied from telling poor ignorant people laden with sins to consider the flowers of the field how they grow and learn from them that they have a father in heaven who knoweth what they have need of before they ask him  but they did not stop christ  and what is more they will never stop him  he has said it and it remains true for ever for he is saying it over and over again in a thousand ways to his sheep when they are wandering without a shepherd  only let them be christs sheep and he will have compassion on them and teach them many things  many may neglect them  but christ will not  whoever you may be however simple you are however ignorant however lonely still if you are one of christs sheep if you are harmless and teachable willing and wishing to learn what is right then christ will surely teach you in his good time  there never was a soul on earth i believe who really wished for gods light but what gods light came to it at last as it will to you if you be christs sheep  if you are proud and conceited you will learn nothing  if you are fierce and headstrong you will learn nothing  if you are patient and gentle you will learn all that you need to know for christ will teach you  he has many ways of teaching you  by his ministers by the bible by books by good friends by sorrows and troubles by blessings and comforts by stirring up your mind to think over the common things which lie all around you in your daily work  but what need for me to go on counting by how many ways christ will lead you when he has more ways than man ever dreamed of  who hath known the mind of the lord or who shall be his counsellor  only be sure that he will teach you if you wish to learn and be sure that this is what he will teach youto know the glory of his father and your father whose name is love    sermon vi  the hearing ear and the seeing eye    proverbs xx 12  the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made even both of them  this saying may seem at first a very simple one and some may ask what need to tell us that  we know it already  god who made all things made the ear and the eye likewise  true my friends  but the simplest texts are often the deepest and that just because they speak to us of the most common things  for the most common things are often the most wonderful and deep and difficult to understand  the hearing of the ear and the seeing of the eyeevery one hears and sees all day long so perpetually that we never think about our hearing or sight unless we find them fail us  and yet how wonderful are hearing and sight  how we hear how we see no man knows and perhaps ever will know  when the ear is dissected and examined it is found to be a piece of machinery infinitely beyond the skill of mortal man to make  the tiny drum of the ear which quivers with every sound which strikes it puts to shame with its divine workmanship all the clumsy workmanship of man  but recollect that it is not all the wonder but only the beginning of it  the ear is wonderful  but still more wonderful is it how the ear hears  it is wonderful i mean how the ear should be so made that each different sound sets it in motion in a different way  but still more wonderful how that sound should pass up from the ear to the nerves and brain so that we hear  therein is a mystery which no mortal man can explain  so of the eye  all the telescopes and microscopes which man makes curiously and cunningly as they are made are clumsy things compared with the divine workmanship of the eye  i cannot describe it to you nor if i could is this altogether a fit place to do so  but if any one wishes to see the greatness and the glory of god and be overwhelmed with the sense of his own ignorance and of gods wisdom let him read any book which describes to him the eye of man or even of beast and then say with the psalmist i am fearfully and wonderfully made  marvellous are thy works o lord and that my soul knoweth right well  and remember that as with the ear so with the eye the mere workmanship of it is only the beginning of the wonder  it is very wonderful that the eye should be able to take a picture of each thing in front of it that on the tiny black curtain at the back of the eye each thing outside should be printed as it were instantly exact in shape and colour  but that is not sight  sight is a greater wonder over and above that  seeing is this that the picture which is printed on the back of the eye is also printed on our brain so that we see it  there is the wonder of wonders  do some of you not understand me  then look at it thus  if you took out the eye of an animal and held it up to anything a man or a tree a perfect picture of that man or that tree would be printed on the back of the dead eye  but the eye would not see it  and why  because it is cut off from the live brain of the animal to which it belonged and therefore though the picture is still in the eye it sends no message about itself up to the brain and is not seen  and how does the picture on the eye send its message about itself to the brain so that the brain sees it  and how againfor here is a third wonder greater stilldo we ourselves see what our brain sees  that no man knows and perhaps never will know in this world  for science as it is called that is the understanding of this world and what goes on therein can only tell us as yet what happens what god does  but of how god does it it can tell us little or nothing and of why god does it nothing at all and all we can say is at every turn god is great  mind again that these are not all the wonders which are in the ear and in the eye  it is wonderful enough that our brains should hear through our ears and see through our eyes  but it is more wonderful still that they should be able to recollect what they have heard and seen  that you and i should be able to call up in our minds a sound which we heard yesterday or even a minute ago is to me one of the most utterly astonishing things i know of  and so of ordinary recollection  what is it that we call remembering a place remembering a persons face  that place or that face was actually printed as it were through our eye upon our brain  we have a picture of it somewhere we know not where inside us  but that we should be able to call that picture up again and look at it with what we rightly call our minds eye whenever we choose and not merely that one picture only but thousands of suchthat is a wonder indeed which passes understanding  consider the hundreds of human faces the hundreds of different things and places which you can recollect and then consider that all those different pictures are lying as it were over each other in hundreds in that small place your brain for the most part without interfering with or rubbing out each other each ready to be called up recollected and used in its turn  if this is not wonderful what is  so wonderful that no man knows or i think ever will know how it comes to pass  how the eye tells the brain of the picture which is drawn upon the back of the evehow the brain calls up that picture when it likesthese are two mysteries beyond all mans wisdom to explain  these are two proofs of the wisdom and the power of god which ought to sink deeper into our hearts than all signs and wondersgreater proofs of gods power and wisdom than if yon firtrees burst into flame of themselves or yon ground opened and a fountain of water sprung out  most people think much of signs and wonders  just in proportion as they have no real faith in god just in proportion as they forget god and will not see that he is about their path and about their bed and spying out all their ways they are like those godless scribes and pharisees of old who must have signs and wonders before they would believe  so it is  the commonest things are as wonderful more wonderful than the uncommon and yet people will hanker after the uncommon as if they belonged to god more immediately than the commonest matters  if yon trees burst out in flame if yon hill opened and a fountain sprang up how many would cry how awful  how wonderful  here is a sign that god is near us  it is time to think about our souls now  perhaps the end of the world is at hand  and all the while they would be blind to that far more awful proof of gods presence that all around them all day long all over the world millions of human ears are hearing millions of human eyes are seeing god alone knows how millions of human brains are recollecting god alone knows how  that is not faith my friends to see god only in what is strange and rare  but this is faith to see god in what is most common and simple to know gods greatness not so much from disorder as from order not so much from those strange sights in which god seems but only seems to break his laws as from those common ones in which he fulfils his laws  i know it is very difficult to believe that  it has been always difficult and for this reason  our souls and minds are disorderly and therefore order does not look to us what it is the likeness and glory of god  i will explain  if god at any moment should create a fullgrown plant with stalk leaves and flowers all perfect all would say there is the hand of god  how great is god  there is indeed a miraclejust because it would seem not to be according to order  but the tiny seed sown in the ground springing up into rootleaf stalk rough leaf flower seed which will again be sown and spring up into leaf flower and seedin that perpetual miracle people see no miracle  just because it is according to order  because it comes to pass by regular and natural laws  and why  because such as we are such we fancy god to be  and we are all of us more or less disorderly  fanciful changeable fond of doing not what we ought but what we like fond of showing our power not by keeping rules but by breaking rules and we fancy too often that god is like ourselves and make him in our image after our own likeness which is disorder and selfwill and changeableness instead of trying to be conformed to his image and his likeness which is order and law eternal  and therefore whenever god seems for he only seems to our ignorance to be making things suddenly as we make or working arbitrarily as we work then we acknowledge his greatness and wisdom  whereas his greatness his wisdom are rather shown in not making as we make not working as we work  but in this is the greatness of god manifest in that he has ordained laws which must work of themselves and with which he need never interfere  laws by which the tiny seed made up only as far as we can see of a little water and air and earth must grow up into plant leaf and flower utterly unlike itself and must produce seeds which have the truly miraculous power of growing up in their turn into plants exactly like that from which they sprung and no other  ah my friends herein is the glory of god  and he who will consider the lilies of the field how they grow that man will see at last that the highest and therefore the truest notion of god is not that the universe is continually going wrong so that he has to interfere and right it  but that the universe is continually going right because he hath given it a law which cannot be broken  and when a man sees that there will arise within his soul a clear light and an awful joy and an abiding peace and a sure hope and a faith as of a little child  then will that man crave no more for signs and wonders with the superstitious and the unbelieving who have eyes and see not ears and cannot hear whose hearts are waxen gross so that they cannot consider the lilies of the field how they grow  but all his cry will be to the lord of order to make him orderly to the lord of law to make him loyal to the lord in whom is nothing arbitrary to take out of him all that is unreasonable and selfwilled and make him content like his master christ before him to do the will of his father in heaven who has sent him into this noble world  he will no longer fancy that god is an absent god who only comes down now and then to visit the earth in signs and wonders  but he will know that god is everywhere and over all things from the greatest to the least for in god he and all things created live and move and have their being  and therefore knowing that he is always in the presence of god he will pray to be taught how to use all his powers aright because all of them are the powers of god pray to be taught how to see and how to hear pray that when he is called to account for the use of this wonderful body which god has bestowed on him he may not be brought to shame by the thought that he has used it merely for his own profit or his own pleasure much less by the thought that he has weakened and diseased it by misuse and neglect but comforted by the thought that he has done with it what the lord jesus did with his bodymade it the useful servant and not the brutal master of his immortal soul  and he will do that i believe just as far as he keeps in mind what a wonderful and useful thing his body is what a perpetual token and witness to him of the unspeakable greatness and wisdom of god just in proportion as he says day by day with the psalmist thou hast fashioned me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me  such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me i cannot attain unto it  whither shall i go then from thy spirit or whither shall i go from thy presence  if i climb up into heaven thou art there  if i go down to hell thou art there also  if i take the wings of the morning and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea even there also shall thy hand lead me thy right hand shall hold me  just in proportion as he recollects that will he utter from his heart the prayer which follows try me o god and seek the ground of my heart prove me and examine my thoughts  look well if there be any way of wickedness in me and lead me in the way everlasting    sermon vii  the victory of faith    first sunday after easter  1 john v 4 5  whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory which overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god  what is the meaning of overcoming the world  what is there about the world which we have to overcome lest it should overcome us and make worse men of us than we ought to be  let us think awhile  1  in the world all seems full of chance and change  one man rises and another falls one hardly knows why  they hardly know themselves  a very slight accident may turn the future of a mans whole life perhaps of a whole nation  chance and changethere seems to us at times to be little else than chance and change  is not the world full of chance  are not people daily crushed in railways burnt to death shot with their own guns poisoned by mistake without any reason that we can see why one should be taken and another left  why should not an accident happen to us as well as to others  why should not we have the thing we love best snatched from us this day  why not indeed  what then will help us to overcome the fear of chances and accidents  how shall we keep from being fearful fretful full of melancholy forebodings  where shall we find something abiding and eternal a refuge sure and steadfast in which we may trust amid all the chances and changes of this mortal life  st john tells usin that within you which is born of god  2  in the world so much seems to go by fixed law and rule  that is even more terrible to our minds and heartsto find that all around us in the pettiest matters of life there are laws and rules ready made for us which we cannot break laws of trade laws of prosperity and adversity laws of health and sickness laws of weather and storms laws by which not merely we but whole nations grow and decay and dieall around us laws iron laws which we do not make and which we dare not try to break lest they go on their way and grind us to powder  then comes the awful question are we at the mercy of these laws is the world a great machine which goes grinding on its own way without any mercy to us or to anything and are we each of us parts of the machine and forced of necessity to do all we do  is it true that our fate is fixed for us from the cradle to the grave and perhaps beyond the grave  how shall we prevent the world from overcoming us in this  how shall we escape the temptation to sit down and fold our hands in sloth and despair crying what we are we must be and what will come must come whether it be for our happiness or misery our life or death  where shall we find something to trust in something to give us confidence and hope that we can mend ourselves that selfimprovement is of use that working is of use that prudence is of use for god will reward every man according to his work  st john tells usin that within you which is born of god  3  then again in the world how much seems to go by selfishness let every man take care of himself help himself fight for himself against all around him seems to be the way of the world and the only way to get on in the world  but is it really to be so  are we to thrive only by thinking of ourselves  something in our hearts tells us no  something in our hearts tells us that this would be a very miserable world if every man shifted for himself and that even if we got this worlds good things by selfishness they would not be worth having after all if we had no one but ourselves to enjoy them with  what is that  st john answersthat in you which is born of god  it will enable you to overcome the worlds deceits and to see that selfishness is not the way to prosper  4  once again in the world how much seems to go by mere custom and fashion  because one person does a thing right or wrong everybody round fancies himself bound to do likewise  because one man thinks a thing hundreds and thousands begin to think the same from mere hearsay without examining and judging for themselves there is no silliness no cruelty no crime into which people have not fallen and may still fall for mere fashions sake from blindly following the example of those round him  everybody does so and i must  why should i be singular  or everybody does so what harm can there be in my doing so  but there is something in each of us which tells us that that is not right that each man should act according to his own conscience and not blindly follow his neighbour not knowing whither like sheep over a hedge that a man is directly responsible at first for his own conduct to god and that my neighbours did so will be no excuse in gods sight  what is it which tells us this  st john answers that in you which is born of god and it if you will listen to it will enable you to overcome the worlds deceit and its vain fashions and foolish hearsays and blind partycries and not to follow after a multitude to do evil  what then is this thing  st john tells us that it is born of god and that it is our faith  faith will enable us to overcome the world  we shall overcome by believing and trusting in something which we do not see  but in what  are we to believe and trust that we are going to heaven  st john does not say so he was far too wise my friends to say so  for a mans trusting that he is going to heaven if that is all the faith he has is more likely to make the world overcome him than him overcome the world  for it will make him but too ready to say if i am sure to be saved after i die it matters not so very much what i do before i die  i may follow the way of the world here in moneymaking and meanness and selfishness and then die in peace and go to heaven after all  this is no fancy  there are hundreds nay thousands i fear in england now who let the world and its wicked ways utterly overcome them just because their faith is a faith in their own salvation and not the faith of which st john speaksbelieving that jesus is the son of god  but some may ask how will believing that jesus is the son of god help us more than believing the other  for after all we do believe it  we all believe that jesus is the son of god  but as for overcoming the world we dare not say too much of that  we fear we are letting the world overcome us we are living too much in continual fear of the chances and changes of this mortal life  we are letting things go too much their own way  we are trying too much each to get what he can by his own selfish wits without considering his neighbours  we are following too much the ways and fashions of the day and doing and saying and thinking anything that comes uppermost just because others do so round us  is it so my friends  but do you really believe that jesus is the son of god  for sure i am that if you did and i did really and fully believe that we could all lead much better lives than we are leading manful and godly useful and honourable truly independent and yet truly humble fearing god and fearing nothing else  but do you believe it  have you ever thought of all that those great words mean jesus is the son of godthat he who died on the cross and rose again for us now sits at gods right hand having all power given to him in heaven and earth  for think if we really believed that what power it would give us to overcome the world and all its chances and changes all its seemingly iron laws all its selfish struggling all its hearsays and fashions  1  those chances and changes of mortal life of which i spoke first we should not be afraid of them then even if they came  for we should believe that they were not chances and changes at all but the loving providence of our lord and saviour a man of the substance of his mother born in the world who therefore can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities and knows our necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking and orders all things for good to those who love him and desire to copy his likeness  2  those stern laws and rules by which the world moves and will move as long as it lastswe should not be afraid of them either as if we were mere parts of a machine forced by fate to do this thing and that without a will of our own  for we should believe that these laws were the laws of the lord jesus christ that he had ordained them for the good of man of man whom he so loved that he poured out his most precious blood upon the cross for us and therefore we should not fear them we should only wish to learn them that we might obey them sure that they are the laws of life of health and wealth peace and safety honour and glory in this world and in the world to come and we should thank god whenever men of science philosophers clergymen or any persons whatsoever found out more of the laws of that good god in whom we and all created things live and move and have our being  3  if we believe really that jesus was the son of god we should never believe that selfishness was to be the rule of our lives  one sight of christ upon his cross would tell us that not selfishness but love was the likeness of god that not selfishness but love which gives up all that it may do good was the path to honour and glory happiness and peace  4  if we really believe this we should never believe that custom and fashion ought to rule us  for we should live by the example of some one else  but by the example of only oneof jesus himself we should set him before us as the rule of all our actions and try to keep our conscience pure not merely in the sight of men who may mistake and do mistake but in the sight of jesus the word of god who pierces the very thoughts and intents of the heart and we should say daily with st paul it is a small thing for me to be judged by you or any mans judgment for he that judges me is the lord  and so we should overcome the world  our hearts and spirits would rise above the false shows of things to god who has made all things above fear and melancholy above laziness and despair above selfishness and covetousness above custom and fashion up to the everlasting truth and order which is the mind of god that so we might live joyfully and freely in the faith and trust that christ is our king christ is our saviour christ is our example christ is our judge and that as long as we are loyal to him all will be well with us in this world and in all worlds to comeamen    sermon viii  turningpoints    luke xix 41 42  and when jesus was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes  my dear friends here is a solemn lesson to be learnt from this text  what is true of whole nations and of whole churches is very often true of single personsof each of us  to most mento all baptized christian men perhapsthere comes a day of visitation a crisis or turningpoint in our lives  a day when christ sets before us as he did to those jews good and evil light and darkness right and wrong and says choose  choose at once and choose for ever for by what you choose this day by that you must abide till death  if you make a mistake now you will rue it to the last  if you take the downward road now you will fall lower and lower upon it henceforth  if you shut your eyes now to the things which belong to your peace they will be hid from your eyes for ever and nothing but darkness ignorance and confusion will be before you henceforth  what will become of the mans soul after he dies i cannot say christ is his judge and not i  he may be saved yet so as by fire as st paul says  repentance is open to all men and forgiveness for those who repent  but from that day if he chooses wrongly true repentance will grow harder and harder to himperhaps impossible at last  he has made his bed and he must lie on it  he has chosen the evil and refused the good and now the evil must go on getting more and more power over him  he has sold his soul and now he must pay the price  again i say he may be saved at last who am i to say that gods mercy is not boundless when the bible says it is  but one may well say of that man god help him for he will not be able to help himself henceforth  it is an awful thing my friends to think that we may fix our own fate in this world perhaps in the world to come by one act of wilful folly or sin  but so it is  just as a man may do one tricky thing about money which will force him to do another to hide it and another after that till he becomes a confirmed rogue in spite of himself  just as a man may run into debt once so that he never gets out of debt again just as a man may take to drink once and the bad habit grow on him till he is a confirmed drunkard to his dying day  just as a man may mix in bad company once and so become entangled as in a net till he cannot escape his evil companions and lowers himself to their level day by day till he becomes as bad as they  just as a man may be unfaithful to his wife once and so blunt his conscience till he becomes a thorough profligate breaking her heart and ruining his own soul  just asbut why should i go on mentioning ugly examples which we all know too well if we will open our own eyes and see the world and mankind as they are  i will say no more lest i should set you on judging other people and saying there is no hope for them  they are lost  no let us rather judge ourselves as any man can and will who dares face fact and look steadily at what he is and what he might become  do we not know that we could any one of us sell our own souls once and for all if we choose  i know that i could  i know that there are things which i might do which if i did from that moment forth i should have no hope but only a fearful looking forward to judgment and fiery indignation  and have you never felt when you were tempted to do wrong  i dare not do it for my own sake for if i did this one wickedness i feel sure that i never should be an honest man again  if you have felt that thank god indeed for then you have seen the things which belong to your peace you have known the day of your visitation and you will be a better man as long as you live for having fought against that one temptation and chosen the good and refused the evil when god put them unmistakeably before you  no the real danger is lest a man should be as those jews and not know the day of his visitation  ah that is ruinous indeed when a mans eyes are blinded as those jews eyes were when a great temptation comes on him and he thinks it no temptation at all when hell is opening beneath him with the devils trying to pluck him down and heaven opening above him with gods saints and martyrs beckoning him up looking with eyes of unutterable pity and anxiety and love on a poor soul and that poor soul sees neither heaven nor hell nor anything but his own selfish interest selfish pleasure or selfish pride and snaps at the devils bait as easily as a silly fish while the devil instead of striking to frighten him lets him play with the bait and gorge it in peace fancying that he is well off when really he is fast hooked for ever led captive thenceforth from bad to worse by the snare of the devil  oh miserable blindness which comes over men sometimes and keeps them asleep at the very moment that they ought to be most wide awake  and what throws men into that sleep  what makes them do in one minute something which curses all their lives afterwards  love of pleasure  yes  that is a common curse enough as we all know  but a worse snare than even that is pride and selfconceit  that was what ruined those old jews  that was what blinded their eyes  they had made up their minds that they saw therefore they were blind that they could not go wrong therefore they went utterly and horribly wrong thenceforth  that they alone of all people knew and kept gods law therefore they crucified the son of god himself for fulfilling their law  they were taken unawares because they were asleep in vain security  and so with us  by conceit and carelessness we may ruin ourselves in a moment once and for all  when a man has made up his mind that he is quite worldlywise that no one can take him in that he thoroughly understands his own interest then is that man ripe and ready to commit some enormous folly which may bring him to ruin  when a man has made up his mind that he knows all doctrines and is fully instructed in religion and can afford to look down on all who differ from him then is that man ripe and ready for doing something plainly wrong and wicked which will blunt his conscience from that day forth and teach him to call evil good and good evil more and more till in the midst of all his fine religious professions he knows not plain right from plain wrongfull of the form of godliness but denying the power of it in scandal of his everyday life  yes my friends our only safeguard is humility  be not high minded but fear  avoid every appearance of evil  believe that in every temptation heaven and hell may be at stake  and that the only way to be safe is to do nothing wilfully wrong at all for you never know how far downward one wilful sin may lead you  the devil is not simple enough to let you see the bottom of his pitfall  but it is so deep nevertheless that he who falls in may never get out again  and do not say in your hearts about this thing and that well it is wrong  but it is such a little matter  a little draught may give a great cold and a great cold grow to a deadly decline  a little sin may grow to a great bad habit and a great bad habit may kill both body and soul in hell  a little bait may take a great fish and the devil fishes with a very fine line and is not going to let you see his hook  the only way to be safe is to avoid all appearance of evil lest when you fancy yourself most completely your own master you find yourself the slave of sin  oh may god give us all the spirit of watchfulness and godly fear of watchfulness lest sin overtake us unawares and of godly fear that we may have strength to say with joseph how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god  of watchfulness too not only against sin but for god of godly fear not only fear of gods anger but fear of gods love  do you ask what i mean  this my friends that as we cannot tell at any moment what danger may be coming on us so we cannot tell at any moment what blessing from god may be coming on us  those jews in the day of their visitation were blind and they rejected christ but recollect that it was christ whom they rejected that christ was there not in anger but in love not to judge but to save that the power of the lord was present not to destroy but to heal them  they would have none of him  true but they might have had him if they had chosen  they denied him but he could not deny himself  he was there to teach and to save as he comes to teach and to save every man  therefore i say be watchful  believe that christ is looking for you always and expect to meet him at any moment  i do not mean in visible form in vision or apparition  no  he comes not by observation that a man may say lo here and lo there but he comes within you to your hearts with the still small voice which softens a man and sobers him for a moment and makes him yearn after good and say in his heart ah that i were as when i was a child upon my mothers knee  oh listen to that softening sobering voice  through very small things it may speak to you  but it is christ himself who speaks  whenever your heart is softened to affection toward parent or child or your fellowman then christ is speaking to you and showing you the things which belong to your peace  whenever the feeling of justice and righteous horror of all meanness rises strong in you then christ is speaking to you whenever your heart burns within you with admiration of some noble action then christ is speaking to you  whenever a chance word in sermons or in books touches your conscience and reproves you then christ is speaking to you  oh turn not a deaf ear to those instincts  they may be the very turningpoints of your lives  one such godly motion one such pure inspiration of the spirit of god listened to humbly and obeyed heartily may be the means of putting you into the right path thenceforward that you may go on and grow in strength and wisdom and favour with god and man till you become again in the world to come what you were when you were carried home from the baptismal font a little child pure from all spot of sin    sermon ix  obadiah    1 kings xviii 3 4  and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house  now obadiah feared the lord greatly  for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water  this is the first and last time throughout the bible that we find this obadiah mentioned  we find the same name elsewhere but not the same person  it is a common jewish name obadiah and means i believe the servant of the lord  all we know of the man is contained in this chapter  we do not read what became of him afterwards  he vanishes out of the story as quickly as he came into it and as we go on through the chapter and read of that grand judgment at carmel between elijah and the priests of baal and the fire of god which came down from heaven to shew that the lord was god we forget obadiah and care to hear of him no more  and yet obadiah was a great man in his day  he was it seems king ahabs vizier or prime minister the second man in the country after the king and a prime minister in those eastern kingdoms had and has now far greater power than he has in a free country like this  yes obadiah was a great man in his day i doubt not and people bowed before him when he went out and looked up to him in that lawless country for life or death for ruin or prosperity their money and their land their very lives might depend on his taking a liking toward them or a spite against them  and he had wealth no doubt and his fair and great house there among the beautiful hills of samaria ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion with its olive groves and vineyards and rich gardens full of gay flowers and sweet spices figs and peaches and pomegranates and all the lovely vegetation which makes those eastern gardens like paradise itself  and he had his great household of slaves menservants and maidservants guards and footmen singing men and singing womenperhaps a hundred souls and more eating and drinking in his house day by day for many a year  a great man full of wealth and pomp and power  we know that it must have been so because we know well in what luxury those great men in the east lived  but where is it now  where is it now  vanished and forgotten  be not thou afraid though one be made rich or if the glory of his house be increased for he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth neither shall his pomp follow him  seeof all obadiahs wealth and glory the bible does not say one word  it is actually not worth mentioning  people admired obadiah i doubt not while he was alive envied him too tried to thrust him out of his place slander him to king ahab drive him out of favour and step into his place that they might enjoy his wealth and his power instead of him  the fine outside of obadiah was what they saw and coveted and enviedas we are tempted now to say in our hearts ah if i was rich like that man  ah if i could buy what i liked go where i liked do what i liked like that great lord and yet that is but the outside the shell the gay clothing not the persons themselves  the day must come when they must put off all that when nothing shall remain but themselves and they themselves naked as they were born shall appear before the judgmentseat of god  and did obadiah then carry away nothing with him when he died yes and yet again no  his wealth and his power he left behind him  but one thing he took with him into the grave better than all wealth and power and he keeps it now and will keep it for ever and that is a good and just and merciful actionconcerning which it is written blessed are the dead which die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their works do follow them  yes though a mans wealth will not follow him beyond the grave his works will and so obadiahs one good deed has followed him  he feared the lord greatly and when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water  that has followed obadiah for by it we know him now two thousand years and more after his death here in a distant land of the name of which he never heard  by that good deed he lives  he lives in the pages of the holy bible he lives in our minds and memories and more than all by that good deed he lives for ever in gods sight he is rewarded for it and the happier for it doubt it not at this very moment and will be the happier for it for ever  oh blessed thought that there is something of which death cannot rob us  that when we have to leave this pleasant world wife and child home and business and all that has grown up round us here on earth till it has become like a part of ourselves yet still we are not destitute  we can turn round on death and saythough i die yet canst thou not take my righteousness from me  blessed thought that we cannot do a good deed not even give a cup of cold water in christs name but what it shall rise again like a guardian angel to smooth our deathbed pillow and make our bed for us in our sickness and follow us into the next world to bless us for ever and ever  and blessed thought too that what you do well and lovingly for gods sake will bless you here in this world before you die  yes my friends in the dark day of sorrow and loneliness and fear and perplexity you will find old good deeds which you perhaps have forgotten coming to look after you as it were and help you in the hour of need  those whom you have helped will help you in return and if they will not god will for he is not unrighteous to forget any work and labour of love which you have showed for his names sake in ministering to his saints  so found obadiah in that sad day when he met elijah  for he was in evil case that day as were all souls rich and poor throughout that hapless land  for three weary years there had been no drop of rain  the earth beneath their feet had been like iron and the heavens above them brass and obadiah had found poverty want and misery come on him in the midst of all his riches  he had seen his fair gardens wither and his olives and his vines burnt up with droughthis cattle had perished on the hills and his servants too perhaps in his house  perhaps his children at home were even then crying for food and water and crying in vain in spite of all their fathers greatness  what was the use of wealth  he could not eat gold nor drink jewels  what was the use of his power  he could not command the smallest cloud to rise up off the sea and pour down one drop of water to quench their thirst  yes obadiah was in bitter misery that day no doubt and all the more because he felt that all was gods judgment on the peoples sins  they had served baalim and ashtaroth the sun and moon and stars and prayed to them for rain and fruitful seasons as if they were the rulers of the weather and the soil instead of serving the true god who made heaven and earth and all therein  and now god had judged them  he had given his sentence and verdict about that matter and told them by a sign which could not be mistaken that he and not the sun and moon was master of the sky and the sea and the rain and the soil  they had prayed to the sun and moon and this was the fruit of their prayers that their prayers had not been heard  but instead of rain and plenty was drought and barrennesscarcasses of cattle scattered over the pasturesevery village full of living skeletons too weak to work though what use in working when the ground would yield no cropcrawling about their tongues cleaving to the roof of their mouths in vain searching after a drop of water  fearful and sickening sights must obadiah have seen that day as he rode wearily on upon his pitiful errand  and the thought of what a pitiful errand he was going on and what a pitiful king he served must have made him all the more miserable for instead of turning and repenting and going back to the true god which was the plain and the only way of escaping out of that misery that wretched king ahab seems to have cared for nothing but his horses  we do not read that he tried to save one of his wretched people alive  all his cry was go into the land to all fountains of water and all brooks perhaps we shall find grass enough to save the horses and mules alive  that we lose not all the beasts  the horses were what he cared for more than the human beings as many of those bad kings of israel did  moses had expressly commanded them not to multiply horses to themselves but they persisted always in doing so nevertheless  and why  because they wanted horses to mount their guards to keep up a strong force of cavalry and chariots in order to oppress the poor country people whom they had brought down to slavery from having been free yeomen as they were in the days of moses and joshua  and what hope could he have for his wretched country  the people shewed no signs of coming to their senses the king still less  his wicked queen jezebel was as devoted as ever to her idols the false prophets of baal were four hundred and fifty men and the prophets of the groves where the stars were worshipped four hundred and these cheats contrived as such false teachers generally do to take good care of themselves and to eat at jezebels table while all the rest of the people were perishing  what could be before the country and him too but utter starvation and hopeless ruin  and all this while his life was in the hands of a weak and capricious tyrant who might murder him any moment and of a wicked and spiteful queen who certainly would murder him if she found out that he had helped and saved the prophets of the lord  who so miserable as he  but on that day obadiah found that his alms and prayers had gone up before god and were safe with god and not to be forgotten for ever  when he fell on his face before elijah in fear for his life he found that he was safe in gods hands that god would not betray him or forsake him  elijah promised him with a solemn oath that he would keep his word with him he kept it and before many days were past obadiah had an answer to all his prayers and a relief from all his fears and the lord sent a gracious rain on his inheritance and refreshed it when it was weary  yes my friends though welldoing seems for a while not to profit you persevere  in due time you shall reap if you faint not  though the lord sometimes waits to be gracious he only waits he does not forget and it is to be gracious that he waits not ungracious  cast therefore thy bread upon the waters and thou shall find it after many days  give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth  do thy diligence to give of what thou hast for so gatherest thou thyself in the day of necessity in which with what measure you have measured to others god will measure to you again  this is true for the scripture says so this must be true for reason and consciencethe voice of god within ustell us that god is just that god must be true though every man be a liar  hear says our lord what the unjust judge says  and shall not god the just judge avenge his own elect who cry day and night to him though he bear long with them  yes my friends gods promise stands sure now and for ever  trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed  but now comes in a doubtand it ought to come inwhat are our works at best  what have we which is fit to offer to god  full of selfishness vanity selfconceit the best of them and not half done either  what have we ever done right but what we might have done more rightly and done more of it also  bad in quality our good works are and bad in quantity too  how shall we have courage to carry them in our hand to that god who charges his very angels with folly and the very heavens are not clean in his sight  too true if we had to offer our own works to god  but thanks be to his holy name we have not to offer them ourselves for there is one who offers them for usjesus christ the lord  he it is who takes these imperfect clumsy works of ours all soiled and stained with our sin and selfishness and washes them clean in his most precious blood which was shed to take away the sin of the world he it is who in some wonderful and unspeakable way cleanses our works from sin by the merit of his death and sufferings so that nothing may be left in them but what is the fruit of gods own spirit and that god may see in them only the good which he himself put into them and not the stains and soils which they get from our foolish and sinful hearts  oh my friends bear this in mind  whensoever you do a thing which you know to be right and good instead of priding yourself on it as if the good in it came from you offer it up to the lord jesus christ and to your heavenly father from whom all good things come and say oh lord the good in this is thine and not mine the bad in it is mine and not thine  i thank thee for having made me do right for without thy help i should have done nothing but wrong for mine is the laziness and the weakness and the selfishness and the selfconceit and thine is the kingdom for thou rulest all things and the power for thou doest all things and the glory for thou doest all things well for ever and ever  amen    sermon x  religious dangers    preached at the chapel royal whitehall 1861 for the london diocesan board of education  st mark viii 4 5 8  and the disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness    how many loaves have ye  and they said seven    so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets  i think that i can take no better text for the subject on which i am about to preach than that which the gospel for this day gives me  for is not such a great city as this london at least in its present amorphous unorganised state having grown up and growing still any how and any whither by the accidental necessities of private commerce private speculation private luxuryis it not i say literally a wilderness  i do not mean a wilderness in the sense of a place of want and misery on the contrary it is a place of plenty and of comfort  i think that we clergymen and those good people who help our labours are too apt exclusively to forget london labour in our first and necessary attention to the london poor to fix our eyes and minds on london want and misery till we almost ignore the fact of london wealth and comfort  we must remember if we are to be just to god and just to our great nation that there is not only more wealth in london but that that wealth is more equitably and generally diffused through all classes from the highest to the lowest than ever has been the case in any city in the world  we must remember that there is collected together here a greater number of free human beings than were ever settled on the same space of earth earning an honest independent and sufficient livelihood and enjoying the fruits of their labour in health and cheapness freedom and security such as the world never saw before  there is want and misery  i know it too well  there are great confusions to be organised great anomalies to be suppressed  but remember that if want and misery confusion and anomaly were the rule of london and not as they are the exception then london instead of increasing at its present extraordinary pace would decay london work instead of being better and better done would be worse and worse done till it stopped short in some such fearful convulsion as that of paris in 1793  no my friends compare london with any city on the continent compare her with the old greek and roman cities with alexandria antioch constantinople with that imperial rome itself which was like london in nothing but its size and then thank god for england for freedom and for the church of christ  and yet i have called london a wilderness  i have  there is a wilderness of want but there is a wilderness of wealth likewise and the latter is far more dangerous to human nature than the former one  it is not in the waste and howling wilderness of rock and sand and shingle with its scanty acacia copses and groups of date trees round the lonely well that nature shews herself too strong for man and crushes him down to the likeness of the ape  there the wild arab struggling to exist and yet not finding the struggle altogether too hard for him can gain and keep if not spiritual life virtue and godliness yet still something of manhood something of   the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight thought and skill   no if you would see how low man can fall you must go to the tropic jungle where geniality of climate plenty and variety of food are in themselves a cause of degradation to the soul as long as the spirit of christ is absent from it  not in the barren desert but in the rich forest wanders the true savage eating and eating all day long like the ape in the trees above his head and i had almost said like the ape too with no thoughts save what his pampered senses can suggest  i had almost said it  thank god i dare not say it altogether for after all the savage is a man and not an ape  yes to the lowest savage in the forests of the amazon comes a hunger of the soul and whispers from the unseen world to remind him of what he might have been and still may be  in the dreams of the night they come in vague terrors of the unseen vague feelings of guilt and shame vague dread of the powers of nature driving him to unmeaning ceremonies to superstitious panics to horrible and bloody ritesas they might drive tomorrow my friends an outwardly civilized population debauched by mere peace and plenty entangled and imprisoned in the wilderness of a great city  i can imagineimaginehave we not seen again and again human souls so entangled and opprest by this vast labyrinth of brick and mortar as never to care to stir outside it and expand their souls with the sight of gods works as long as their brute wants are supplied just as the savage never cares to leave his accustomed forest haunt and hew himself a path into the open air through the tangled underwood  i can imaginenay have we not seen that too and can we not see it any day in the streethuman souls so dazzled and stupefied instead of being quickened by the numberless objects of skill and beauty which they see in their walks through the streets that they care no more for the wonders of mans making than the savage does for the wonders of gods making which he sees around him in every insect bird and flower  the man who walks the streets every day is the very man who will see least in the streets  the man who works in a factory repeating a thousand times a day some one dull mechanical operation or even casting up day after day the accounts of it is the man who will think least of the real wonderfulness of that factory of the amount of prudence skill and science which it expresses of its real value to himself and to his class of its usefulness to far nations beyond the seas he is like a savage who looks up at some glorious tree capable in the hands of civilized man of a hundred uses and teeming to him with a hundred scientific facts and thinks all the while of nothing but his chance of finding a few grubs beneath its bark  think over i beseech you this fact of the stupefying effect of mere material civilization and remember that plenty and comfort do not diminish but increase that stupefaction that hebrew prophets knew it and have told us again and again that by fulness of bread the heart waxeth gross that greek sages knew it and have told us again and again that need and not satiety was the quickener of the human intellect  believe that man requires another bread than the bread of the body that sometimes the want of the bodily bread will awaken the hunger for that bread of the soul bear in mind that the period during which the middle and lower classes of england were most brutalized was that of their greatest material prosperity the latter half of the eighteenth century remember that with the distress which came upon them at the end of the french war their spiritual hunger awakenedoften in forms diseased enough  but growing healthier as well as keener year by year and that if they are not brutalized once more by their present unexampled prosperity it will be mainly owing to the spiritual life which was awakened in those sad and terrible years  remember that the present carelessness of the masses about either religious or political agitation though it may be a very comfortable sign to those who believe that a mans life consists in the abundance of the things which he possesses is a very ominous sign to some who study history and to some also who study their bibles  and ask yourselves earnestly the question from where shall a man find food for these men in this wilderness not of want but of wealth  for believe me that spiritual hunger though stopped awhile by physical comfort will surely reawaken  any severe and sudden depression in tradethe stoppage of the cotton crop for instance will awaken in the minds of hundreds of thousands deep questionsfor which we if we are wise shall have an explicit answer ready  for it is a very serious moment my friends when large masses have had enough to eat and drink and have been saying let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die and then suddenly by not having enough to eat and drink and yet finding themselves still alive are awakened to the sense that there is more in them than the mere capacity for eating and drinking  then begin once more the world old questions why are we thus  who put us here  who made us god  is there a god and if there be what is he like  what is his will toward us good or evil  is it hate or love  my friends those are questions which have been asked often enough in the worlds history by vast masses at once  and they may be answered in more ways than one  they may be answered as the weavers of a certain country thank god not england answered them in the potato famine with their mad song we looked to the earth and the earth deceived us  we looked to the kings and the kings deceived us  we looked to god and god deceived us  let us lie down and die  or they may answer themthey will be more likely to answer them in england just now because there are those who will teach them so to answerin another but a scarcely less terrible tone  yes there is a god and he is angry with us  and why  because there is something or some one in the nation which he abhorsheretics papistswhat notany man or class of men on whom cowardly and terrified ignorance may happen to fix as a scapegoat and cry these are the guilty  we have allowed these men indulged them the accursed thing is among us therefore the face of the lord is turned from us  we will serve him truly henceforthand hate those whom he hates  we will be orthodox henceforthand prove our orthodoxy by persecuting the heretic  does this seem to you extravagant impossible  remember my friends that within the last century lord george gordons riots convulsed london  can you give me any reason why lord george gordons riots cannot occur again  believe me the more you study history the more you study human nature the more possible it will seem to you  it is not i believe infidelity but fanaticism which england has to fear just now  the infidelity of england is one of mere doubt and denial a scepticism which is in itself weak and selfdestructive  the infidelity of france in 1793 was strong enough but just because it was no scepticism but a faith a positive creed concerning human reason and the rights of man which men could formulize and believe in and fight for and persecute for and if need was die for  but no such exists in england now and what we have most to fear in england under the pressure of some sudden distress is a superstitious panic and the wickedness which is certain to accompany that panic mean and unjust cruel and abominable things done in the name of orthodoxy  though meanwhile whether what the masses and their spiritual demagogues will mean by orthodoxy will be the same that we and the church of england mean thereby is a question which i leave for your most solemn consideration  that however rather than any proclamation of the abstract rights of man or installations of a goddess of reason is the form which spiritual hunger is most likely to take in england now  alas are there not tokens enough around us now whereby we may discern the signs of this time  i say the spiritual hunger will reawaken and woe to us who really understand and love the church of england woe to us who are really true to her principles honestly subscribe her formulas if we cannot appease it in that day  but wherewith  we may look my friends appalled at the danger and the need  we may cry to our lord from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread in the wilderness  but his answer will be as far as i dare to predict it the same as to his apostles of old on another and a similar occasion give ye them to eat  they need not depart  i am not going to draw any farfetched analogy between the miracle recorded in the gospel and the subject on which i am speaking  i am not going to put any mystical and mediaeval interpretation on the seven loaves or the two small fishes  i only ask you to accept the plain moral practical lesson which the words convey  use the means which you have already however few and weak they seem  if christ be among you as he is indeed he will bless them and multiply them you know not how  use the means which you have though they may seem to you inadequate though they may seem to the world antiquated and decrepit try them  they need not depart from us these masses to seek spiritual food they know not where if we have but faith  let us give them what we have the organization of the church of england and the teaching of the church of england  the organization of the church  not merely its parochial system but its diocesan system  in london more than in any part of england the diocesan system is valuable  a london parish is not like a country one a selfdependent corporate body made up of residents of every rank capable of providing for the physical and spiritual wants of its own stationary population  in london population fluctuates rapidly sometimes rolling away from one quarter always developing itself in fresh quarters in london all ranks do not dwell side by side within sight and sound of each other  but the rich and the poor the employed and the unemployed dwell apart work apart and are but too often out of sight out of mind  these and many other reasons make it impossible for the mere parochial system to bring out the zeal and the liberality of london churchmen  if they are to realize their unity and their strength they must do so not as members of a parish but of a diocese their bishop must be to them the sign that they are one body their good works must be organized more and more under him and round him  this is no new theory of mine it is a historic law the priest for the village the bishop for the city has been the natural and necessary organization of the church in every age and it was in strict accordance with this historic law that the london diocesan board of education was founded in 1846 not to override the parochial system but to do for it what it cannot in a great city do for itself to establish elementary schools and now i am happy to say evening schools also in parishes which were too poor to furnish them for themselves  i as the son of a london rector can bear my testimony to the excellent working of that board and it is with grief i hear that in spite of the vast work which it has done since 1846 and which it is still doing on an income which is now not 300 pounds a yearproving thereby how cheaply and easily your work may be done when it is done in the right wayit is with grief i say that i hear that it is more and more neglected by the religious public  with grief  but not with surprise  for the religious public even the church portion of it has of late been more and more inclined to undervalue the organization and the teaching of the church of england and to supply its place with nostrums borrowed from those denominations who disagree with the church alike in their doctrines of what man should be and of what god is  how have their energies their zeal their money for zealous they are and generous too been frittered away  but i will not particularize lest i hurt the feelings of better people than myself by holding up their good works to the ridicule of those who do us no good works at all  but i entreat them to look at their own work to look at the vastness of its expense compared with the smallness of its results and then to ask themselves whether the one cause of their failurefor failures i must call too many of the religious movements of this day in spite of their own loud selflaudationswhether i say one cause of these failures may not be that the religious world is throwing itself into anything and everything novel and exciting rather than into the simple and unobtrusive work of teaching little children their catechism that they may go home as angels of god and missionaries of christ teaching their parents in turn as they have been taught themselves and so awakening that sacred family life without which there can be no sound christianity  i know well that there has been much work done in the right direction but when i look at the ugly fact that the population of london is increasing far faster than its schools that in 25 of the poorest parishes thereof there are now nearly 60000 children who go to no school at all and that the proportion of scholars to the population is lower in middlesex than in almost any county in england while the proportion of crime is highest i cannot but sigh over the thousands which i see squandered yearly on rash novelties by really pious and generous souls and cry ah that onefourth onetenth of it all had been spent in the plain work of helping elementary schools i cannot but call on all london churchmen of the plain old school to stand by the organization and the doctrines of the church to which they belong to rally in this matter round their bishop and work for him and with him  and now there may be some here who will ask scornfully enough and do you talk of nostrums and then after confessing that the masses are hungering for the bread of life offer them nothing but your own nostrum the catechism  yes my friends i do  i know that the church catechism is not the bread of life  neither i beg you to remember is any other catechism or doctrine or tract or sermon or book or anything else whatsoever  christ is the bread of life  but how shall they know christ unless they be taught what christ is and how can they be taught what christ is unless the conception of him which is offered them be true  and i say that the catechism does give a true conception of christ and more a far truer onei had almost said an infinitely truerthan any which i have yet seen in these realms  that from the catechism a child may learn who god is who christ is who he himself is what are his relation and duty to god what are his relation and duty to his neighbours to his country and to the whole human race far better than from any document of the kind of which i am aware  i know well the substitutes for the catechism which are becoming more and more fashionable the limitations the explainings away the nonnatural and dishonest interpretations which are more and more applied to it when it is used and i warn you that those substitutes for and those defacements of the catechism will be no barrier against an outburst of fanaticism did one arise nay that many of them would directly excite it and prove when too late that instead of feeding the masses with the bread of life which should preserve them soul and body some persons had been feeding them with poison which had maddened them soul and body  but i see no such danger in the catechism  i see in the catechism in its freedom alike from sentimental horror and sentimental raptures its freedom alike from slavish terror and from pharisaic assurance a guarantee that those who learn it will learn something of that sound religion sober trusty cheerful manful which may be seen still thank god in country church folk of the good old school and which will in the day of trial be proof against the phantoms of a diseased conscience and the ravings of spiritual demagogues  and therefore i preach gladly for this institution therefore i urge strongly its claims on you whom i am bound to suppose honest churchmen because the fact of its being a diocesan board of education is at least in this diocese a guarantee that the schools which it supports will teach their children honestly and literally the catechism of the church of england which may god preserve  not that i expect it to teach only that  i take for granted that that will be its primary object the guarantee that all the rest is well done  but i know that much more than that must be done that much more will be done even unintentionally  for shall ii trust that i shall notmake a too fanciful application of the last fact recorded of this great miracle if i bid you find in it a fresh source of hope in your work  and they took up of the fragments which were left seven baskets full  the plain historic fact is that not only do the seven loaves feed 4000 but that what they leave and are about to throw away far exceeds the original supply  i believe the fact  i ask you to consider why it was recorded surely like all facts in the gospels to teach us more of the character of christ which a fact too often forgotten in these days is the character of god  to teach us that he is an utterly bountiful god  that as in him there is no weakness nor difficulty so in him is no grudging no parsimony  that he is not only able but willing to give exceeding abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think  that there is a magnificence in god and in gods workings which ought to fill us with boundless hope if we are but fellowworkers with god  you see that magnificence in the seeming prodigality of nature in the prodigality which creates a thousand beautiful species of butterfly where a single plain one would have sufficed in the prodigality which creates a thousand acorns only one of which is destined to grow into an oak  everywhere in the kingdom of nature it shows itself believe that it exists as richly in the higher kingdom of grace  yes  believe that whenever you begin to work according to gods law and gods will let your means seem as inadequate as they may not only will your work multiply as by miracle under your hands but the very fragments of it which you are inclined to neglect and overlook will form in time a heap of unexpected treasure  plans which you have thrown aside because they seemed to fail details which seemed to encumber you accessory work which formed no part of your original plan all will be of use to some one somehow somewhere  you began for instance by wishing to educate the masses of london you are educating over and above indirectly thousands who never saw london  you began by wishing to teach them spiritual truth you have been drawn on to give them an excellent secular education besides  you intended to make them live as good christians here at home  but since you began the interpenetration of town and country by railroads and the rush of emigrants to our colonies have widened infinitely the sphere of your influence and you are now teaching them also to live as useful men in the farthest corners of these isles and in far lands beyond the seas to become educated emigrants loyal colonists to raise by their example rude settlers and ruder savages and so the very fragments of your good work without your will or intent will bless thousands of whom you never heard and help to sow the seeds of civilization and christianity wherever the english flag commands justice and the english church preaches love    sermon xi  blessing and cursing    preached at the chapel royal whitehall ash wednesday 1860  deuteronomy xxviii 15  it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee  many good people are pained by the commination service which we have just heard read  they dislike to listen to it  they cannot say amen to its awful words  it seems to them to curse men and their conscience forbids them to join in curses  to imprecate evil on any living being seems to them unchristian barbarous a relic of dark ages and dark superstitions  but does the commination service curse men  are these good people who are certainly right in their horror of cursing right in the accusations which they bring against it  or have they fallen into a mistake as to the meaning of the service owing it may be supposed to that carelessness about the exact use of words that want of accurate and critical habits of mind which is but too common among religious people at the present day  i cannot but think that they mistake when they say that the commination service curses men  for to curse a man is to pray and wish that god may become angry with him and may vent his anger on the man by punishing him  but i find no such prayer and wish in any word of the commination service  its form is not cursed be he that doeth such and such things but cursed is he that doeth them  does this seem to you a small difference  a finedrawn question of words  is it then a small difference whether i say to my fellow man i hope and pray that you may be stricken with disease or whether i say you are stricken with disease whether you know it or not  i warn you of it and i warn you to go to the physician  for so great and no less is the difference  and if any one shall say that it is very probable that the authors of the liturgy were not conscious of this distinction but that they meant by cursing what priests in most ages have meant by it i must answer that it is dealing them most hard and unfair measure to take for granted that they were as careless about words as we are that they were like some of us so ignorant of grammar as not to know the difference between the indicative and the imperative mood and to assume this in order to make them say exactly what they do not say and to impute to them a ferocity of which no hint is given in their commination service  but some will say granted that the authors of the commination service did not wish evil to sinnersgranted that they did not long to pray with bell book and candle that they might be tormented for ever in gehennagranted that they did not desire to burn their bodies on earth those words are still dark and unchristian  they could only be written by men who believed that god hates sinners that his will is to destroy them on earth and torture them for ever after death  we may impute alas what motives and thoughts we choose in the face of our lords own words judge not and ye shall not be judged but we shall not be fair and honest in imputing unless we first settle what these men meant in the words which they have actually written  what did they mean by cursed is the question  and that we can only answer by the context of the commination service  and that again we can only answer by seeing what it means in the bible which the reformers profess to follow in all their writings  now what does the bible mean by a curse and cursingfor we are bound to believe in all fairness that the reformers meant the same and neither more nor less  the text i think tells us plainly enough  we know that its words came true  we know that the jews did perish out of their native land as the author of this book foretold in consequence of doing that against which moses warned them  we know also that they did not perish by any miraculous intervention of providence  but simply as any other nation would have perished by profligacy internal weakness civil war and at last by foreign conquest  we know that their destruction was the natural consequence of their own folly  why are we to suppose that the prophet meant anything but that  he foretells the result  why are we to suppose that he did not foresee the means by which that result would happen  why are we in the name of all justice to impute to him an expectation of miraculous interferences about which he says no word  the curse which he foretold was the natural consequence of the sins of the nation  why are we not to believe that he considered it as such why are we not to believe that the bible meaning of a curse is simply the natural illconsequence of mens own illactions  i believe that if you will apply the same rule to other places of scripture you will have reason to reverence the letter and the spirit of scripture more and more and will free your minds from many a superstitious and magical fancy which will prevent you alike from understanding the bible and the commination service  the book of deuteronomy like the rest of moses laws says nothing whatever about the life to come  it says that sin is to be punished and virtue rewarded in this life and the commination service when it quotes the book of deuteronomy means so so i presume likewise  indeed if we look at the very remarkable and most invaluable address which the commination service contains we shall find its author saying the same thing in the very passages which are to some minds most offensive  for even in this life the door of mercy may be shut and we may cry in vain for mercy when it is the time for justice  this is not merely a doctrine  it is a fact a common patent fact  men do wrong and escape again and again the just punishment of their deeds but how often there are cases in which a man does not escape when he is filled with the fruit of his own devices and left to the misery which he has earned when the covetous and dishonest man ruins himself past all recovery when the profligate is left in a shameful old age with wornout body and defiled mind to rot into an unhonoured grave when the hypocrite who has tampered with his conscience is left without any conscience at all  they have chosen the curse and the curse is come upon them to the uttermost  so it is  is the commination service uncharitable is the preacher uncharitable when they tell men so  no more so than the physician is uncharitable when he saysif you go on misusing thus your lungs or your digestion you will ruin them past all cure  is god to be blamed because this is a fact  why then because the other is a fact likewise  now if this be as i believe the doctrine of the commination service if this be as i believe the message of ashwednesday it is one which is quite free from superstition or cruelty  but it is a message more disagreeable and more terrible too than any magical imprecations of harm to the sinner could bring  more disagreeable for which is more galling to human pride to be toldsin is certainly a clever and politic and successful trade as far as this world is concerned  it is only in the next world or in the case of rare and peculiar visitations and judgments in this world that it will harm you  or to be toldsin is no more clever politic or successful here than hereafter  the wrongdoing which looks to you so prudent is folly  you man of the world as you may think yourself are simply as often as you do wrong blind ignorant suicidal  you are your own curse your acts are their own curse  the injury to your own character and spirit the injury to your fellowcreatures which will again react on youthese are the curses of god which you will feel some day too heavy to be borne  and which is more terrible  to tell a man that god will judge and curse him by unexpected afflictions or at least by casting him into gehenna in the world to come  or to tell him you are judged already  the curse is on you already  the first threat he may get rid of by denying the fact by saying that god does not generally interfere to punish bad men in this life that he does not strike them dead swallow them up and he may even quote scripture on his side and call on solomon to bear witness how as dieth the fool so dieth wise man and that there is one event to the righteous and the wicked  as for the fear of gehenna again after he dies  that is too dim and distant too unlike anything which he has seen in this life now that the tortures and autos da fe of the middle age have disappeared to frighten him very severely except in rare moments when his imagination is highly excited  and even then he canin practice he doeslook forward to making his peace with god as it is called at last and fulfilling baalams wish of dying the death of the righteous after living the life of the wicked  he knows well too that when that day comes he can findalas that it should be sopriests and preachers in plenty of some communion or other who will give him his viaticum and bid him depart in peace to that god who has said that there is no peace to the wicked  but terrible truly terrible and heart searching for the wrongdoer is the messagegod does not curse thee  thou hast cursed thyself god will not go out of his way to punish thee  thou hast gone out of his way and thereby thou art punishing thyself just as by abusing thy body thou bringest a curse upon it so by abusing thy soul  god does not break his laws to punish drunkenness or gluttony  the laws themselves the laws of nature the beneficent laws of life nutrition growth and health they punish thee and kill by the very same means by which they make alive  and so with thy soul thy character thy humanity  god does not break his laws to punish its sins  the laws themselves punish every fresh wrong deed and wrong thought and wrong desire of thine sets thee more and more out of tune with those immutable and eternal laws of the moral universe which have their root in the absolute and necessary character of god himself  all things that he has ordained the laws of the human body the laws of the human soul the laws of society the laws of all heaven and earth are arrayed against thee for thou hast arrayed thyself against them  they have not excommunicated thee  thou hast singlehanded excommunicated thyself  in thine own selfwill thou hast set thyself to try thy strength against god and his whole universe  dost thou fancy that he needs to interfere with the working of that universe to punish such a worm as thee no more than the great mill engine need stop and the overseer of it interfere with the machinery if the drunken or careless workman should entangle himself among the wheels  the wheels move on doing their duty spinning cloth for the use of man  but the workman who should have worked with them is entangled among them  he is out of his place and slowly but irresistibly they are grinding him to powder as the whole universe is grinding thee  heartsearching indeed is such a message for it will come home not merely to that very rare character the absolutely wicked man the ideal sinner at whom the preacher too often aims ideal arrows which vanish in the air  not to him merely will it come home but to ourselves to us average human beings inconsistent halfformed struggling lamely and confusedly between good and evil  oh let us take home with us today this belief the only belief in this matter possible in an age of science which is daily revealing more and more that god is a god not of disorder but of order  let us take home i say the awful belief that every wrong act of ours does of itself sow the seeds of its own punishment and that those seeds will assuredly bear fruit now here in this life  let us believe that gods judgments though they will culminate no doubt hereafter in one great day and one divine faroff event to which the whole creation moves are yet about our path and about our bed now here in this life  let us believe that if we are to prepare to meet our god we must do it now here in this life yea and all day long for he is not far off from any one of us seeing that in him we live and move and have our being and can never go from his presence never flee from his spirit  let us believe that gods good laws and gods good order are in themselves and of themselves the curse and punishment of every sin of ours and that ashwednesday returning year after year whether we be glad or sorry good or evil bears witness to that most awful and yet most blessed fact  my friends this is the preachers ashwednesdays message  but thanks be to god it is not all  it is writtenif thou lord wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss  oh lord who may abide it  for there is mercy with thee therefore shalt thou be feared  it is writtenon whomsoever this stone shall fall it shall grind him to powder but it is written toowhosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken and again the broken and the contrite heart o god thou shall not despise  there is such a thing as pardon pardon full and free for the sake of the precious blood of christ  lent may be a time of awe and of shame  but it is not a time of despair  meanwhile remember this that god has set before you blessing and cursing and that you may turn your life and gods whole universe as you will either into that blessing or into that curse    sermon xii  work    twentyfourth sunday after trinity  proverbs xiv 23  in all labour there is profit  i fear there are more lessons in the book of proverbs than most of us care to learn  there is a lesson in every verse of it and a shrewd one  certain i am that for a practical business man who has to do his duty and to make his way in this world there is no guide so safe as these same proverbs of solomon  in this world i say for they say little about the world to come  their doctrine is that what is good for the next world is good for this that he who wishes to go out of this world happily must first go through this world wisely and more that he who wishes to go through this world happily must likewise go through it wisely  the righteous says solomon shall be recompensed in the earth and not merely at the end of judgment hereafter  much more the wicked and the sinner  that is the doctrine of the proverbs that men do to a very great extent earn for themselves their good or their evil fortunes and are filled with the fruit of their own devices and it is that doctrine which makes them the best of textbooks for the practical man  for the proverbs do not look on religion as a thing to be kept out of our daily dealings and thought of only on sundays  they look on true religion which is to obey god as a thing which mixes itself up with all the cares and business of this mortal life this work day world and therefore they are written in workday language in homely words taken from the common doings of this mortal life as our lords parables are  and like the most simple of those parables the most simple of the proverbs have often the very deepest meaning  in all labour there is profit  whatsoever is worth doing is worth doing well  it is always worth while to take pains  in another proverb homely enoughbut if it be in the bible it is not too homely for uswhere no oxen are the crib is clean solomon says the same thing as in the text  he says where no oxen are the farmer is saved trouble the clearing away of dirt and refuse and all the labour required to keep his cattle in condition  but all that trouble solomon says if a man will but undergo it will repay itself for much increase is in the strength of the ox  for the ox in that country as in most parts of the world now is the beast used for ploughing and for all the work of the farm  now herein i think solomon gives us a lesson which holds good through all matters of life  that it is a shortsighted mistake to avoid taking trouble for god has so well ordered this world that industry will always repay itself  no doubt it is much easier and pleasanter for the savage to scratch the seed into the ground with some rude wooden tool and sit idle till the grain ripens  much easier and pleasanter than to breed and break in beasts and to labour all the year round at the different duties of a wellordered farm  but here is the mighty difference that the savage growing only enough for himself is in continual danger of famine he and all his tribe while the civilized farmer producing many times more than he needs for himself gains food comfort and safety not only for himself but for many other human beings  the savage has an easy life enough if that be any gain  but it is a life of poverty uncertainty danger of starvation  the civilized man works hard and heavily using body and mind more in one month than the savage does in the whole year  but he gains in return a life of safety comfort and continually increasing prosperity  this is solomons lesson  and be sure it holds good not only of tilling the ground but of all other labours all other duties to which god may call us  whatsoever thy hand findeth to do says solomon do it with all thy might  god has set thee thy work then fulfil it  fill it full  throw thy whole heart and soul into it  do it carefully accurately completely  it will be better for thee and for thy children after thee  all neglect carelessness slurring over work is a sin a sin against god who has called us to our work a sin against our country and our neighbours who ought to profit by our work and a sin against ourselves also for we as i shall shew you soon ought to be made wiser and better men by our work  oh if there is one rule above another which i should like to bring home to young men and women setting out in life it is thistake pains  take trouble  whatever you do do thoroughly  whatever you begin finish  it may not seem to be worth your while at the moment to be so very painstaking so very exact  in after years you will find that it was worth your while that it has paid you by training your character and soul paid you by giving you success in life paid you by giving you the respect and trust of your fellowmen paid you by helping you towards a good conscience and enabling you in old age to look back and say i have been of use upon the earth i leave this world according to my small powers somewhat better than i found it  instead of having to look back as too many have upon opportunities thrown away plans never carried out talents wasted a whole life a failure for want of taking pains  why do i say these things to you  to persuade you to work  thank god there is no need of that for you are englishmen and it has pleased god to put into the hearts of englishmen a love of work and a power of work which has helped to make this little island one of the greatest nations upon earth  no thanks be to god i say there is no need to bid you work  what i ask you to do is to look upon your work as an honourable calling and as a blessing to yourselves not merely as a hard necessity a burden which must be borne merely to keep you from starvation  it is not that my friends but far more than that  for what is more honourable than to be of use  and in all labour as solomon says there is profit it is all of use and all trade manufacture tillage even of the smallest all management and ordering whether of an estate a parish or even of the pettiest office in it all is honourable because all is of use all helping forward more or less the wellbeing of gods human creatures and of the whole world  and therefore all is worth taking trouble over worth doing as diligently and honestly as possible in sure trust that it will bring its reward with it  why not  almsgiving is blessed in gods sight and charity to the poor and god will repay it  but is not useful labour blessed in his sight also and shall he not repay it will he not say of it as well as of almsgiving inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these little ones ye have done it unto me  we may trust so my friends indeed i may say more than we may trust  we can see see that industry has its reward  by increasing the wellbeing of others and the safety of others you increase your own  so it is and so it should be for god has knit us all together as brethren members of one family of god and the wellbeing of each makes up the wellbeing of all so that sooner or later if one member rejoice all the others rejoice with it  but more  and here i speak to young people for their elders i doubt not have found it out long since for themselves  work hard work is a blessing to the soul and character of the man who works young men may not think so  they may say what more pleasant than to have ones fortune made for one and have nothing before one than to enjoy life  what more pleasant than to be idle  or at least to do only what one likes and no more than one likes  but they would find themselves mistaken  they would find that idleness makes a man restless discontented greedy the slave of his own lusts and passions and see too late that no man is more to be pitied than the man who has nothing to do  yes thank god every morning when you get up that you have something to do that day which must be done whether you like or not  being forced to work and forced to do your best will breed in you temperance and selfcontrol diligence and strength of will cheerfulness and content and a hundred virtues which the idle man will never know  the monks in old time found it so  when they shut themselves up from the world to worship god in prayers and hymns they found that without working without hard work either of head or hands they could not even be good men  the devil came and tempted them they said as often as they were idle  an idle monks soul was lost they used to say and they spoke truly  though they gave up a large portion of every day and of every night also to prayer and worship yet they found they could not pray aright without work  and working is praying said one of the holiest of them that ever lived and he spoke truth if a man will but do his work for the sake of duty which is for the sake of god  and so they worked and worked hard not only at teaching the children of the poor but at tilling the ground clearing the forests building noble churches which stand unto this day none among them were idle at first and as long as they worked they were good men and blessings to all around them and to this land of england which they brought out of heathendom to the knowledge of christ and of god and it was not till they became rich and idle and made other people work for them and till their great estates that they sank into sin and shame and became despised and hated and at last swept off the face of the land lastly my friends if you wish to see how noble a calling work is consider god himself who although he is perfect and does not need as we do the training which comes by work yet works for ever with and through his son jesus christ who said my father worketh hitherto and i work  yes think of god who though he needs nothing and therefore need not work to benefit himself yet does work simply because though he needs nothing all things need him think of god as a king working for ever for the good of his subjects a father working for ever for the good of his children for ever sending forth light and life and happiness to all created things and ordering all things in heaven and earth by a providence so perfect that not a sparrow falls to the ground without his knowledge and the very hairs of your head are all numbered  and then think of yourselves called to copy god each in his station and to be fellowworkers with god for the good of each other and of yourselves  called to work because you are made in gods image and redeemed to be the children of god  not like the brutes who cannot work and can therefore never improve themselves or the earth around them but like children of god whom he has called to the high honour of subduing and replenishing this earth which he has given you and of handing down by your labour blessings without number to generations yet unborn  and when you go back one to his farm another to his shop another to his daily labour say to yourselves this too as well as my prayers in church is my heavenly fathers command in doing this my daily duty honestly and well i can do christs will copy christ approve myself to christ singleeyed and singlehanded doing my work as unto god and not unto men and so hear i may hope at last christs voice saying to me well done thou good and faithful servant  i set thee not to govern kingdoms to lead senates to command armies to preach the gospel to build churches to give large charities to write learned books to do any great work in the eyes of men  i set thee simply to buy and sell to plough and reap like a christian man and to bring up thy family thereby in the fear of god and in the faith of christ  and thou hast done thy duty more or less and in doing thy duty has taught thyself deeper and sounder lessons about thy life character and immortal soul than all books could teach thee  and now thou hast thy reward  thou hast been faithful over a few things  i will make thee ruler over many things  enter thou into the joy of thy lord    sermon xiii  false prophets    eighth sunday after trinity  matthew vii 16  ye shall know them by their fruits  people are apt to overlook i think the real meaning of these words  they do so because they part them from the words which go just before them about false prophets  they consider that fruit means only a mans conductthat a man is known by his conduct  that professions are worth nothing and practice worth everything  that the good man after all is the man who does right and the bad man the man who does wrong  excellent doctrine and always needed  god grant that we may never forget it  but the text surely does not quite mean that  fruit here does not mean a mans own conduct but the conduct of those whom he teaches for seeour lord is talking of prophets that is preachers who set up to preach the word of god in the name of god  beware he says of false prophets  by their fruits ye shall know them  by what you gather from them he says  for do men gather grapes off thorns or figs off thistles  now what is a preachers fruit  surely the fruit of his preaching and that is not what he does himself but what he makes you do his fruit is what you gather from him and what you gather from him is not merely the notions and doctrines which he puts into your head but the way of life in which he makes you live  what he makes you do is the fruit which you get from him  does he make you a better man or does he not that is the question  that is the test whether he is a false prophet or a true one whether he is preaching to you the eternal truth of god or mans inventions and devils lies  does he make you a better man  notdoes he make you feel better butdoes he make you behave better  there is too much preaching in the world which makes men feel betterso much better indeed that they go about like the pharisee thanking god that they are not as other men before they have any sound reason to believe that they are not as other men because they live just such lives as other men do as far as respectability and the fear of hurting their custom or their character allow them to do  they have their prophets their preachers who teach them and by their fruits in these men the preachers may be known by those who have eyes to see and hearts to understand  therefore beware of false prophets  there are too many of them in the world now as there were in our lords time men who go about with the name of god on their lips and the bible in their hands in sheeps clothing outwardly but inwardly ravening wolves  in sheeps clothing truly smooth and sanctimonious meek and sleek but wolves at heart wolves in cunning and slyness as you will find if you have to deal with them wolves in fierceness and cruelty as you will find if you have to differ from them wolves in greediness and covetousness and care of their own interest and their own pockets  and wolves too in hardness of heart in the hard dark horrible unjust doctrines which they preach with a smile upon their lips not merely in sermons but in books and tracts innumerable making out the heavenly father the god whose name is love and justice to be even such a one as themselves wolves too in their habit of hunting in packs each keeping up his courage by listening to the howl of his fellows  they may come in the name of god  they may tell you that they preach the gospel that no one but they preach the gospel  but by their fruits ye shall know them  will they make you better men  is it not written the disciple is not above his master  what will you learn from them but to be like them  and the more you take in their doctrines the more like them you will be for is it not written he that is perfect shall be as his master  can they lead you to eternal life  is it not written if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch  but by their fruits ye shall know them  by their fruits in the world at large if you have eyes to see it  by their fruits in your own lives if you give yourselves up to listen to their false doctrines for you will surely find that in the first place they will not make you honest men  they will not teach you to be just and true in all your dealings  they will not teach you common morality  no my friends it is most sad to see how much preaching and tractwriting there is in england now which talks loud about protestant doctrine and gospel truths while all the fruit of it seems to be to teach men to abuse the pope and to fancy that every one is going to hell who does not agree with their opinions while their own lives their own conduct their own morality seems not improved one whit by all this preaching  and yet men like such preaching and run to hear it  of course they do for it leaves them to behave all the week as if there was no law of god if only they will go on sundays and listen to what is called i fear most untruly the gospel of god leaves them on condition of belonging to some particular party and listening to some favourite preacher free to give way to their passions their spite their meanness to grind their servants cheat their masters trick their customers adulterate their goods and behave in moneymatters as if all was fair in business and the gospel of jesus christ had nothing to do with common honesty and all the while   compound for sins they are inclined to by damning those they have no mind to   my friends these things ought not so to be  there is a gospel of god which preaches full forgiveness for the sake of jesus christ to all who turn from their sins  but there is a law of god likewise which executes sure vengeance against all who do not turn from their sins be their professions as high or their doctrines as correct as they may  a law which is in the gospel itself and says by the mouth of the apostle st john little children let no man deceive you  he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as god is righteousheand not he who expects to be saved by listening to some false preacher who teaches his congregation how to go to heaven without having thought one heavenly thought or done one heavenlydeed  yes  there is an eternal law of god which people are forgetting i often fear more and more in england just now  i sometimes dread lest we should be sinking into that hideous state of which the old hebrew prophet speaksthe prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof  what indeed if people are to be taught more and more that religion is a matter merely of doctrines and fancies and feelings and has nothing to do with common morality and common honesty and common selfcontrol and improvement of character and conduct  my friends in these dangerous days for dangerous they truly are like those of the scribes and pharisees of old days in which bigotry and hardness of heart hypocrisy and lipprofession stalk triumphant days in which men like the scribes and pharisees of old boast of the bible worship the bible think they have eternal life in the bible spend vast sums every year in spreading the bible and yet will neither read the bible honestly nor obey its plain commandsin such days as these what prophet shall we fall back upon  what preacher shall we trust  we can at least trust our bible  we can read it honestly if only there be in us the honest and good heart we can obey its plain commands if only we hunger and thirst after righteousness and desire really to become good men  read your bibles for yourselves with a single eye and with a pure heart which longs to know gods will because it longs to do gods will and you will need no false prophets under pretence of explaining it to you to draw you away from the holy catholic faith into which you were baptized  but if you must have a commentary on the bible if you must have some book to give you a general notion of what the bible teaches you and what it expects of you go to the prayerbook  go to the good old catechism which you learnt at school  there though not from the popular preachers you will learn that god is just and true loving and merciful and no respecter of persons  there you will learn that christ died not for a few elect but for the sins of the whole world  there you will learn that in baptism by gods free grace and not by any experiences or feelings of your own you were made children of god members of christ and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven  there you will learn that the elect whom the holy spirit sanctifies are not merely a favoured few but you every baptized man woman and child  that the holy spirit is with you every one of you to sanctify you if you will open your hearts to his gracious inspirations  and there you will learn what sanctification really means  not a few fancies and feelings about which any man can deceive himself and any man also deceive his neighbours  no that sanctification means being made holy righteous virtuous good  that sanctification means to love your neighbour as yourself and to do to all men as they should do unto youto love honour and succour your father and mothershall i go on  or do you all know the plain old duty to your neighbours which stands in the church catechism  if you do thank god that you were taught it in your youth  read it over and over again  think over it  pray to god to give you grace to act upon it and to shew the fruit of it in your lives  and then by its fruits you shall know it  by its fruits you shall know the virtue of the catechism and of the great and good men true prophets of god who wrote that catechism  yes  cling to that catechism even if it convinces you of many sins and makes you sadly ashamed of yourselves again and again for believe me it will prove your best safeguard in doctrine your best teacher in practice in these dangerous days days in which every man who believes that right is right and wrong is wrong has need to pray with all his heartfrom all false doctrine heresy and schism from hardness of heart and contempt of thy word and commandments good lord deliver us    sermon xiv  the rock of ages    ninth sunday after trinity  1 corinthians x 4  they drank of that spiritual rock which followed them and that rock was christ  st paul has been speaking to the corinthians about the holy communion  in this text st paul is warning the corinthians about it  he says you may be christian men you may have the means of grace you may come to the communion and use the means of grace and yet you may become castaways  st paul himself says in the very verse before i keep under my body and bring it into subjection  lest      i myself should be a castaway  look he says then at the old jews in the wilderness  they all partook of gods grace  but they were not all saved  they were all baptized to moses in the cloud and in the sea  they all ate the same spiritual meat the manna from heaven  they all drank the same spiritual drink the water out of the rock in horeb  and yet with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrowntheir corpses were scattered far and widein the wilderness  the spiritual meat and the spiritual drink could not keep them alive if they sinned and deserved death  so says st paul with you  you are members of christs body  the cup of blessing which we bless is the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is the communion of the body of christ but beware they will not save you if you sin  nothing will save you if you sin  if you lust after evil things as those old jews did if you are idolaters as they were if you are profligates as they were if you tempt christ as they did if you murmur against god as they murmured you will be destroyed like them  note here two things  first that st paul says that we really receive christ in the holy communion  he does not say as some do that the communion is merely a remembrance of christs death he says that the faithful verily and indeed receive christs body and blood in the sacrament  he says so distinctly plainly literally and if that be not true his whole argument goes for nothing and will not stand  the jews he says drank of the spiritual rock which followed them and that rock was christ and so he says to you  but that did not save them from the punishment of their sins when they went and sinned afresh  neither will it save you  but nowwhat are these strange words which st paul uses  these old jews drank of the spiritual rock which followed them and that rock was christ  where in the old testament do we read of the rock following them  we read of moses striking the rock in horeb at the beginning of their wanderings in the wilderness but not of its following them afterwards  st paul is here using a beautiful old tradition of the rabbis that the rock which moses struck in horeb followed the jews through all their forty years wanderings and that on every sabbath day when they stopped it stopped also and the elders called to it flow out o fountain and the water flowed  a beautiful old story which st paul turns into an allegory to teach as by a picture the deepest and the highest truth  whether that rock followed them or not he says there was one who did follow them from whom flowed living water and that rock is christ  christ followed them christ the creator the preserver the inspirer the light the life the guide of men and of all the universe  it was to christ they owed their deliverance from egypt to christ they owed their knowledge of god and of the law of god to christ they owed whatever reason justice righteousness good government there was among them  and to christ we owe the same  the rock was a type of him from whom flows living water  as he himself said on earth whosoever drinketh of the water which i shall give him shall never thirst but the water which i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life  just as the manna also was a type of him as he himself declared when the jews talked to him of the manna our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat  then jesus said to them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven  no  but only a type and picture of it  my father giveth you the true bread from heaven  for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world    i am that bread of life  my friends herein is a great mystery  something of what it means however we may learn from that wise and good jew philo who was st pauls teacher according to the flesh before he became a christian and who himself was so near to the kingdom of god that st paul often in his epistles uses philos very words putting into them a christian meaning  and what says he concerning the rock of living waters  the soul he says falls in with a scorpion in the wilderness and then thirst which is the thirst of the passionsof the lusts which war in our membersseizes on it till god sends forth on it the stream of his own perfect wisdom and causes the changed soul to drink of unchangeable health  for the steep rock is the wisdom of god by whom he means the word of god whom philo knew not in the flesh but whom we know as the lord jesus christ which being both sublime and the first of all things he quarried out of his own powers and of it he gives drink to the souls which love god and they when they have drunk are filled with the most universal manna  so says philo the good jew who knew not christ and therefore he says only a part of the truth  if you wish to learn the whole truth you must read st johns gospel and st pauls epistles especially this very text and again the opening of the epistle to the ephesians and again that most royal passage in the opening of the colossians where he speaks of the everlasting being of christ who is before all things and by whom all things consistin whom dwells all the fulness of the godhead bodily and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge  therefore he is rightly called the rock the rock of ages the eternal rock because on him all things rest and have rested since the foundation of the world being made and kept together and ruled and inspired by him alone  therefore he is rightly called the rock of living waters for in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and from him they flow forth freely to all who cry to him in their thirst after truth and holiness  yes my friends by christ all things live and therefore most of all by christ our souls live  to be parted from christ is death  to be joined to christ and the body of christ is life  but what life  the life of the soul  and what is the life of the soul  holiness righteousness sanctification virtuecall it what pleases you best  i shall call it goodness  that is the only life of the soul  and why  because it is the life of christ  that is the only wisdom of the soul  and why  because it is the mind of christ  that is the living water  and why  because it flows eternally from christ  for who is christ but the likeness of god and the glory of god and what is the likeness of god but goodness and what is the glory of god but goodness  therefore christ is goodness itself as it is written now the lord is that spirit  yes if you will believe it christ the onlybegotten son coequal and coeternal is the very and essential goodness of the father coming out everlastingly in action and in life in himself and in his people who are his mystical body filled with the spirit of him and his father who is the holy spirit the spirit of goodness  from christ and not from any created being comes all goodness in man or angel  comes from christ  it were more right and more according to st pauls own words to say that all goodness is christ christ dwelling in a man christ forming himself in a man little by little step by step as he grows in grace in purity in selfcontrol in experience in knowledge in wisdom in strength in patience in love in charity till he comes to the stature of a perfect man to the measure of the fulness of christ  meanwhile let the good which a man does be much or be it little he must say the good which i do i do not but christ who dwelleth in me  for in every age of man it is christ who is awakening in him the hunger and thirst after righteousness and then satisfying it with the only thing which can satisfy them namely his most blessed self  yes believe it  it is christ in the child which makes it speak the truth christ in the child which makes it shrink from whatever it has been told is wrong  it is christ in the young man which fills him with lofty aspirations hopes of bettering the world around him hopes of training his soul to be all that it can be and of putting forth all his powers in the service of christ  it is christ in the middleaged man which makes him strong in good works labouring patiently wisely and sturdily so that having drunk of the living waters himself they may flow out of him again to others in good deeds a fountain springing up in him to an eternal life of goodness  it is christ in the old man which makes him look on with calm content while his own body and mind decay knowing that the kingdom of god cannot decay for christ is ruling it in righteousness and all will be well with him and with his children after him and with all mankind and all heaven and earth if they themselves only will it long after he has been gathered to his fathers  yes such a man knows in whom he has believed  he knows that the spiritual rock has been following him through all his wanderings in this weary world and that that rock is christ  he can recollect how again and again at his sabbath haltings in his lifes journey it was to him in the holy communion as to the israelites of old in their haltings in the wilderness when the priests of jehovah cried to the mystic rock flow forth o fountain and the waters flowed so can he recollect how in holy communion there flowed into his soul streams of living water the water of life quenching that thirst of his soul which no created thing could slake the water of life of christs life which is the light of men shewing them what they ought to be and do the life which is the light the life which is according to the eternal and divine reason the life of wisdom which is the life of love which is the life of justice which is the life of christ which is the life of god  but if these things are soand so they are for christ has said it st paul has said it st john has said itbut if these things are so will they not teach us much about holy communion how we may receive it worthily and how unworthily  if what we receive in the communion be christ himself the good christ who is to make us good then how can we receive it worthily if we do not hunger and thirst after goodness  if we do not come thither longing to be made good and sanctified then we come for the wrong thing to the wrong place  we are like those corinthians who came to the lords supper not to be made good men but to exalt their own spiritual selfconceit and so only ate and drank their own damnation not discerning the lords body that it was a holy body a body of righteousness and goodness  but if we come hungering and thirsting to be made good men then we come for the right thing to the right place  then we need not stay away because we feel ourselves intolerably burdened with many sins that will be our very reason for coming that we may be cleansed from our sinscleansed not only from their guilt but from their power and cry in spirit and in truth as we kneel at that holy table   rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee by the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed be of sin the double cure cleanse me from its guilt and power   yes from its guilt and from its power also  let us all pray each in his own fashion  oh lamb eternal beyond all place and time  oh lamb slain eternally before the foundation of the world  oh lamb which liest slain eternally in the midst of the throne of god  let the blood of life which flows from thee procure me pardon for the past let the water of life which flows from thee give me strength for the future  i come to cast away my own life my life of self and selfishness which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts that i may live it no more and to receive thy life which is created after the likeness of god in righteousness and true holiness that i may live it for ever and ever and find it a well of life springing up in me to everlasting life  eternal goodness make me good like thee  eternal wisdom make me wise like thee  eternal justice make me just like thee  eternal love make me loving like thee  then i shall hunger no more and thirst no more for   thou o christ art all i want more than all in thee i find raise me fallen cheer me faint heal me sick and lead me blind thou of life the fountain art freely let me take of thee spring thou up within my heart rise to all eternity   oh come to holy communion with the words of that glorious hymn not merely on your lips but in your hearts and you will never come amiss    sermon xv  antipathies    tenth sunday after trinity  1 cor xii 3 4 5 6  wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed  and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit  and there are differences of administrations but the same lord  and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all  we are to come to the communion this day in love and charity with all men  but are we in love and charity with all men  i do not mean are there any persons whom we hate against whom we bear a spite whom we should be glad to see in trouble or shame god forbid my friends god forbid  there are indeed devils tempers  and yet more easy for us to keep in the bottom of our hearts and more difficult to root them out than we fancy  it is easy enough for us to forgive in words at least a man who has injured us  easy enough to make up our minds that we will not revenge ourselves  easy enough to determine even that we will return good for evil to him and do him a kindness when we have a chance  yes we would not hurt him for the world  but what if god hurt him  what if he hurt himself  what if he lost his money what if his children turned out ill  what if he made a fool of himself and came to shame  what if he were found out and exposed as we fancy that he deserves  should we be so very sorry  we should not punish him ourselves  no  but do we never catch ourselves thinking whether god may not punish him thinking of that with a base secret satisfaction almost hoping for it at last  oh if we ever do god forgive us  if we ever find those devils thoughts rising in us let us flee from them as from an adder flee to the foot of christs cross to the cross of him who prayed for his murderers father forgive them for they know not what they do and there cry aloud for the blood of life which shall cleanse us from the guilt of those wicked thoughts and for the water of life which shall cleanse us from the power of them  lest they get the dominion over us and spring up in us and spread over our whole hearts not a well of life but a well of poison springing up in us to everlasting damnation  oh let us pray to him to give us truth in our inward parts that we may forgive and love not in word only but in deed and in truth  i could not help saying this in passing  but it is not what the text is speaking of not what i want to speak of myself today  i want to speak of a matter which is smaller and not by any means so sinful  and which yet in practice is often more tormenting to a truly tender conscience because it is more common and more continual  how often when one examines oneself whether one be in love and charity with all men one must recollect that there are many people whom one does not like  i do not mean that one hates them  not in the least  but they do not suit one  there is something in them which we cannot get on with as the saying is  something in their opinions manners ways of talking evengod forgive usmerely in their voice or their looks or their dress which frets us and gives us what is called an antipathy to them  and one dislikes them though they never have harmed us or we them and we know them perhaps to be better people than ourselves  now are we in love and charity with these people  i am afraid not  i know one is tempted to answer but i am afraid the answer is worth very littlewhy not  we cannot help it  you cannot expect us to like people who do not suit us  any more than you can expect us to like a beetle or a spider  we know the beetle or the spider will not harm us  we know that they are good in their places and do good as all gods creatures are and do and there is room enough in the world for them and us  but we have a natural dislike to them and cannot help it and so with these people  we mean no harm in disliking them  it is natural to us and why blame us for it  now what is the mistake here  saying that it is natural to us we are not meant to live according to nature but according to grace and grace must conquer nature my friends if we wish to save our souls alive  it is nature brute nature which makes some dogs fly at every strange dog they meet  it is nature brute nature which makes a savage consider every strange savage as his enemy and try to kill him  but unless nature be conquered in that savage it will end where following brute nature always ends in death and the savages will as all savages are apt to do destroy each other off the face of the earth by continual war and murder  it is brute nature which makes low and ignorant persons hate foreign people because their dress and language seem strange  but unless that natural feeling had been in most of us conquered by the grace of god which is the spirit of justice and of love then england would have remained alone in conceit and ignorance hated by all the nations instead of being what thank god she isthe sanctuary of the world to which all the oppressed of the earth may flee and find a welcome and safety and freedom and justice and peace  and so with us my friends  it is natural and according to the brute nature of the old adam to dislike this person and that just because they do not suit us  but it is according to grace and the new adam who is the lord from heaven to honour all men to love the brotherhood to throw away our own private fancies and personal antipathies and like the lord jesus christ copy the allembracing charity of god  and no one has a right to answer but i must draw the line somewhere  thou must not  i am afraid that thou wilt and that i shall too god forgive us both because we are sinful human beings  we may but we must not draw a line as to whom we shall endure in charity  for christ draws no line  is it not written no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost  is not the spirit of christ in a christian man unless he be a reprobate and who is reprobate we know not and dare not try to know for it is written judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned  but what has the text to do with all this  my friends is not this just what the text is telling us  i said this moment that the spirit of christ was in a christian man unless he be a reprobate  and the text says further that there are diversities of gifts in christian men  but the same spirit in all of them  yes  people will be different one from another  there are diversities of gifts  differences in talents in powers in character in kinds of virtue and piety so that you shall find no two good men no two useful men like each other  but there is the same spirit  the same spirit of god is in each though bearing different fruit in each  and there are differences of administrations of offices in gods kingdom  god sets one man to do one work and another to do another  but it is the same lord who puts each man in his place and shows him his work and gives him power to do it  and there are diversities of operations that is of ways of working so that if you put any two men to do the same thing they will most probably do it each in a different way and yet both do it well  but it is the same god who is working in them both the god who works all in all and has his work done by a thousand different hands by a thousand different ways  and it is right and good that people should be so different from each other  for the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal  to profit to be of use  if all men were alike no one could learn from his neighbour  if all mankind were as like each other as a flock of sheep there would be no more work no more progress no more improvement in mankind than there is in a flock of sheep  now each man can bring his own little share of knowledge or usefulness into the common stock  each man has or ought to have something to teach his neighbour  each man can learn something from his neighbour  at least he can learn thisto have patience with his neighbour  to live and let live  to bear with what in him seems odd and disagreeable trusting that god may have put it there that god has need of it that god will make use of it god makes use of many things which look to us ugly and disagreeable he makes use of the spider and of the beetle  how much more of our brethren members of christ children of god inheritors of the kingdom of heaven  shall they be to us even if they be odd or disagreeable in some thingsshall they be to us as the beetle or the spider or any other merely natural things  they are men and women in whom is the spirit of the living god  and my friends if they are good enough for god they are good enough for us  think but one moment  god the father adopts a man as his child god the son dies for that man god the holy ghost inspires that man and shall we be more dainty than god  if in spite of the mans little weaknesses and oddities god shall condescend to come down and dwell in that man making him more or less a good man doing good work shall we pretend that we cannot endure what god endures  shall we be more dainty i ask again than the holy and perfect god  oh my friends let us pray to him to take out of our hearts all selfishness fancifulness fastidiousness and hasty respect of persons of all which there is none in god  let us ask for his spirit the spirit of charity which sees god in all and all in god and therefore sees good in all and sees all in love  then we shall see how much more there is in our neighbours to like than to dislike  then all these little differences will seem to us trifles not to be thought of before the broad fact of a mans being after all a man an englishman a christian and a good christian doing good work where god has put him  then we shall be ashamed of our old narrowness of heart ashamed of having looked so much at the little evil in our neighbours and not at the great good in them  then we shall go about the world cheerfully and our neighbours faces will seem to us full of light  instead of seeming full of darkness because our own eyes and minds are dark for want of charity  then we shall come to the communion not with hearts narrowed and shut up perhaps from the very person who kneels next to us  but truly openhearted with hearts as wideah god that it were possibleas the sacred heart of christ in which is room for all mankind  and so receiving his body which is the blessed company of all faithful people we shall receive christ who dwelleth in them and they in him    sermon xvi  st paul    eleventh sunday after trinity  1 cor xv 8  last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time  for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god  you heard in this text part of the epistle for this day st pauls opinion of himself  you heard also in the second lesson for this day the ninth chapter of acts the extraordinary story of his conversion  and what may we learn from that story  we may learn many lessons lessons without number  we may learn first not to be astonished if we have to change our opinions as we grow older  when we are young we are very positive about this thing and that as st paul was violent in favour of our own opinions ready to quarrel with any one who differs from us as st paul was  but let ten years twenty years roll over our heads and we may find our opinions utterly changed as st paul did and look back with astonishment on ourselves for having been foolish enough to believe what we did as st paul looked back and with shame as did st paul likewise at having said so many violent and unjust things against people who we now see were in the right after all  next we may learn not to be ashamed of changing our minds  but if we find ourselves in the wrong to confess it boldly and honestly as st paul did  what a fearful wrench to his mind and his heart what a humiliation to his selfconceit to have to change his mind once for all on all matters in heaven and earth  what must it not have cost him to throw up at once all his friends and relations to part himself from all whom he loved and respected on earth to feel that henceforth they must look upon him as a madman an infidel an enemy  to an affectionate man and st paul was an extremely affectionate man what a bitter struggle that must have cost him but he faced that struggle and conquered in it like a brave and honest man  and the consequence was that he had in time and after many lonely years many christian friends for each jewish friend that he had lost and to him was fulfilled as it will be to all men our lords great saying there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time    and in the world to come eternal life  next we may take comfort in the hope that god will not impute to us these early follies and mistakes of ours if only there be in us as there was in st paul the honest and good heart that is the heart which longs to know what is true and right and bravely acts up to what it knows  st paul did so  god when he set him apart as he says from his very birth gave him a great grace even the honest and good heart and he was true to it and used it  he tried to learn his best and do his best  he profited in the jews religion beyond all his fellows  he was touching the righteousness which was in the law blameless  he was so zealous for what he thought right that he persecuted the church of christ as the pharisees his teachers had taught him to do  in all things whether right or wrong in each particular case he was an honest earnest seeker after truth and righteousness  and therefore christ instead of punishing him fulfilled to him his own great sayingto him that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance  he had not yet as he himself says again and again the grace of christ which is love to his fellowmen and therefore his works were not pleasing to god and had as the article says the nature of sin  his empty forms and ceremonies could not please god  his persecuting the church had plainly the nature of sin  but there was something which god had put in him and which god would not lose sight of or suffer to be lost and that was the honest and good heart of which our lord speaks in the parable of the sower  in that christ sowed the word of god even himself and his grace and holy spirit and behold it sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold over all christian nations to this day  keep therefore if you have it the honest and good heart  if you have it not pray for it earnestly  determine to learn what is true whatever be the trouble and to do what is right whatever be the cost and then though you may make many mistakes and have more than once perhaps to change your mind in shame and confusion yet all will come right at last for the grace of christ sooner or later will lead you into all truth which you require for this world and all worlds to come  again we may learn from st paul this lesson  that though god has forgiven a man that is no reason that he should forgive himself that may seem a startling saying just now  for the common teaching now is that if a man finds or fancies that god has forgiven him he may forgive himself at once that if he gets assurance that his sins are washed away in christs blood he may go swaggering and boasting about the world i can call it no less as if he had never sinned at all that he may be as you see in these revivals from which god defend us one moment in the deepest agonies of conscience and dread of hellfire and the next moment in raptures of joy declaring himself to be in heaven  alas alas such people forget that sin leaves behind it wounds which even the grace of christ takes a long time in healing and which then remain as ugly but wholesome scars to remind us of the fools which we have been they are like a man who is in great bodily agony and gets sudden relief from a dose of laudanum  the pain stops and he feels himself as he says in heaven for the time  but he is too apt to forget that the cause of the pain is still in his body and that if he commits the least imprudence he will bring it back again just as happens i hear in too many of these hasty and noisy conversions nowadays  that is one extreme  the opposite extreme is that of many old roman catholic saints and hermits who could not forgive themselves at all but passed their whole lives in fasting poverty and misery bewailing their sins till their dying day  that was a mistake  it sprang out of mistaken doctrines of which i shall not speak here but it did not spring entirely from them  there was in them a seed of good for which i shall always love and honour them even though i differ from them and that was a noble hatred of sin  they felt the sinfulness of sin and they hated themselves for having sinned the mercy of god made them only the more ashamed of themselves for having rebelled against him  their longing after holiness only made them loathe the more their past unholiness  they carried that feeling too far  but they were noble people men and women of god and we may say of them that wisdom is justified of all her children  but i wish you to run into neither extreme  i only ask you to look at your past lives if you have ever been open sinners as st paul looked at his  there is no sentimental melancholy in him no pretending to be miserable no trying to make himself miserable  he is saved and he knows it  he is an apostle and he stands boldly on his dignity  he is cheerful hopeful joyful  but whenever he speaks of his past life and he speaks of it often it is with noble shame and sorrow  then he looks to himself the chief of sinners not worthy to be called an apostle because he persecuted the church of christ  what he is he will not deny  what he was he will not forget he dare not forget lest he should forget that the good which he does he does notfor in him that is in his flesh his own natural character dwelleth no good thingbut christ who dwells in him lest he should grow puffed up careless selfindulgent lest he should neglect to subdue his evil passions and so after having preached to others himself become a castaway  so let us do my friends  let us not be too hasty in forgiving ourselves  let us thank god cheerfully for the present  let us look on hopefully to the future let us not look back too much at the past or rake up old follies which have been pardoned and done away  but let us thank god whenever he thinks fit to shew us the past and bring our sin to our remembrance  let us thank him when meeting an old acquaintance passing by an old haunt looking over an old letter reminds us what fools we were ten twenty thirty years ago  let us thank him for those nightly dreams in which old tempers old meannesses old sins rise up again in us into ugly life and frighten us by making us in our sleep what we were once god forgive us when broad awake  i am not superstitious  i know that those dreams are bred merely of our brain and of our blood but i know that they are none the less messages from god  they tell us unmistakeably that we are the same persons that we were twenty years ago  they tell us that there is the same infection of nature the same capability of sin in us that there was of old  that in our flesh dwells no good thing  that by the grace of god alone we are what we are  and that did his grace leave us we might be once more as utter fools as we were in the wild days of youth  yes  let us thank god for everything which reminds us of what we once were let us humble ourselves before him whenever those memories return to us and let us learn from them what st paul learnt  to be charitable to all who have not yet learnt the wisdom which god as we may trust has taught to us to feel for them feel with them be sure that they are our brothers men of like passions with ourselves who will be tried by the same standard as we whom therefore we must not judge lest we be judged in turn  and let us have as st paul had hope for them all hope that god who has forgiven us will forgive them that god who has raised us from the death of sin to something of the life of righteousness will raise them up likewise in his own good time  amen    sermon xvii  the broken and contrite heart    isaiah lvii 1521  for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones  for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth  for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made  for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him  i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart  i have seen his ways and will heal him  i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners  i create the fruit of the lips  peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him  but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt  there is no peace saith my god to the wicked  this is part of isaiahs prophecy  he is telling the jews that they should come back safe at last to their own land  he tells them why god had driven them out and why god was going to bring them back  he had driven them out for their sins  but he was not going to bring them back for their righteousness  he was going to bring them back out of his own free grace his own pure love and mercy which was wider deeper and higher than all their sins or than the sins of the whole world  he had sworn to abraham to be the friend of those foolish rebellious jews and he would keep his promise for ever  their wickedness could not conquer his goodness or their denying him make him deny himself  but one thing he did require of them  not that they should turn and do right all at once  that must come afterwards  but that they should open their eyes and see that they had done wrong  he wanted to produce in them the humble and the contrite heart  now as i told you last sunday a contrite heart does not merely mean a broken heart it means more  it means literally a heart crushed a heart ground to powder  you can have no stronger word  it was this heart which god wished to breed in these rebellious jews  a heart like isaiahs heart when he said after having seen gods glory woe is me for i am a man of unclean lips and dwell among a people of unclean lips  a heart like jeremiahs heart when he said oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people  a heart like daniels heart when he confessed before god that to him and all his people belonged shame and confusion of face  why do i mention these three men  they were not bad men but good men  what need had they of a contrite heart  i mention them because they were good men  and why were they good men  for any good works of their own  not in the least  what made them good men was just the having the humble and the contrite heart just feeling that in themselves they were as bad as the sinners round them that the only thing which kept them out of the idolatry and profligacy of their neighbours was confessing their own weakness and clinging fast to god by faith confessing that their own righteousness was as filthy rags and that god must clothe them with his righteousness  do you suppose that isaiah jeremiah and daniel would have been good men if they had said to themselves we are prophets we are inspired we know gods law  and therefore we are righteous we are safe  but these peoplethese idolaters these drunkards these covetous tyrannous profligate people round to whom we preach and who know not the lawthey are accursed  if they had they would have said just what the pharisees said afterwards  and what came of their saying so  instead of knowing the lord christ when he came they crucified him showing that they were really worse at heart than the ignorant common people instead of better  no my friends isaiah and jeremiah and daniel were better men than those round them just because they had the humble and contrite heart because they confessed that the root of sin was in them too as much as in their fellowcountry men because they took their share of the public blame their share of the public burden  and their work and wish was to breed in their fellowcountrymen the same humble and contrite heart which they had to make them confess that their only hope lay in turning back to god and doing right but they could not succeed  sin was too strong for them  so as isaiah had warned the jews god did the work himself  god took the matter into his own hands and arose out of his place to punish those jews and to make short work with them by famine and pestilence and earthquake and foreign invasion till they were all carried away captive to babylon  to see if that would teach them to know that god was the lord to see if that would breed in them the humble and contrite heart  but god says to these poor jews do not fancy that i have taken a spite against you  not so  i will not contend for ever  i will not be always angry for then the spirit would fail before me and the souls which i have made  i have made you god says and i love you  i wish to save you and not to destroy you  if god really hated any man do you suppose that he would endure that man for a moment in his universe  do you suppose that he would not sweep that man away as easily and as quickly as we do a buzzing gnat when it torments us  do you fancy that god lets you or me or any man or any creature live one single instant except in the hope of saving him and of making him better than he is of making him of some use somewhere some day or other  do you suppose i say that god endures sinners one moment save because he loves sinners and willeth not the death of a sinner but that he should be converted and live  no  god our saviour says st paul to timothy willeth that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth and therefore if they are not saved it must be their own fault and not gods it must be they who will not be saved though god wills that they should be as isaiah goes on to show  for he saysgod cries to men peace  i create the fruit of the lips that is i give men cause to thank me  i create it  i make it without their help  i do not sell them my mercy  i give it them freely  i say peace peace to them all to him who is near and him who is afar off peace to all mankind peace on earth and goodwill to men god is everlastingly at peace with himself and at peace with all his creatures and with all his works and he wills in his boundless love to bring them all into his peace the peace which passeth understanding that they may be at peace with him and therefore at peace with themselves and at peace with each other  but how can they be at peace when there is no peace in them  if they will do wrong if they will quarrel if they will defraud each other if they will give way to the lusts and passions which war within them  how can they be at peace  they are like a troubled sea says isaiah when it cannot rest which casts up mire and dirt and there is no peace to them  it is not god who casts up the mire and dirt  it is they who cast it up  god has not made them restless  but they themselves with their pride selfishness violent passions longings after this and that  god has not made them foul and dirty but they themselves with their own foul words and foul deeds which keep them from being at peace with themselves because they are ashamed of them all the while which keep them from being at peace with their neighbours which make them hate and fear their neighbours because they know that their neighbours do not respect them or are afraid of their neighbours finding them out  what says brave plainspoken st jameslet no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god  for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man  from whence come wars and fightings among you  come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members  ye lust and have not  ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain  ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not  but as for god he says from him comes nothing but good  do not fancy anything else  do not err my beloved brethren  every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning  of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures  my friends all these things were written for our examples  god grant that we may lay the lesson to heart  a dark night may come to any one of us a night of darkness upon darkness and sorrow upon sorrow and bad luck upon bad luck till we know not what is going to happen next and are ready to say with davidall thy waves and thy billows are gone over me and with hezekiahi reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones  from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me  god grant that before that day comes we may have so learnt to know god as to know that the billows are gods billows and the storms his storms and after a while not to be afraid though all earthly hope and help seem swept away  god grant that when trouble comes after trouble we may be able to see that our father in heaven is only dealing with us as he dealt with those poor jews that he is all the while saying peace to us whether we be near him or far off from him and is ready to heal us the moment that he has worked in us the broken and contrite heart  and we may trust him that he will do it  with him one day is as a thousand years  and in one day of bitter misery he can teach us lessons which we could not teach ourselves in a thousand years of reading and studying or even of praying  but our prayers we shall find have not been in vain he has not forgotten one of them and there is the answer in that very sorrow  in sorrow he is making short work with our spirits in one terrible and searching trial our souls may be as the poet says   heated hot with burning fears and bathed in baths of hissing tears and battered by the strokes of doom to shape and use   yes  he will make short work at times with mens spirits  he grinds hearts to powder that they may be broken and contrite before him  but only that he may heal them that out of the broken fragments of the hard proud selfdeceiving heart of stone he may create a new and harder heart of flesh human and gentle humble and simple  and then he will return and have mercy  he will show that he will not contend for ever  he will show that he does not wish our spirits to fail before him but to grow and flourish before him to everlasting life  he will create the fruit of the lips and give us cause to thank him in spirit and in truth  he will show us that he was nearest when he seemed furthest off and that just because he is the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy who dwelleth in the high and holy place for that very reason he dwells also with the humble and the contrite heart because that heart alone can confess his height and its own lowliness confess its own sin and his holiness and so can cling to his majesty by faith and partake of his holiness by the inspiration of his holy spirit  god grant that we may all so humble ourselves under his mighty hand whenever that hand lies heavy upon us that he may raise us up in due time changed into his divine likeness from glory to glory till we come to the measure of christ and to the stature of perfect men renewed into the image of the son of man jesus christ our lord  amen    sermon xviii  st peter    matt xvi 18  thou art peter and on this rock i will build my church  this is st peters day  it will be well worth our while to think a little over st peter and what kind of man he was  for st peter was certainly one of the most important and most famous men who ever lived in the whole world  you just heard what our lord said to him in the text  and certainly from those words and from many other things which are told of st peter he was the chief of the apostlesat least till st paul arose  st paul says himself that he had as much authority as st peter and that he was not a whit behind the very chiefest of the apostles but st peter for some time after our lords death seems to have been looked up to by the rest of the apostles and the disciples as their leader the man of most weight and authority among them  it was to st peter especially that our lord looked to strengthen the other apostles after he had been converted himself  it was to st peter that our lord first revealed that great gospel that the gentiles were fellowheirs with the jews in all gods promises  the same thing was afterwards revealed to st paul too and far more fully  but it was st peter who had the great honour of baptizing the first heathen and of using as our lord had bid him do the keys of the kingdom of heaven to open its doors to all the nations upon earth  now what sort of a man was this on whom the lord jesus christ put so great an honour  if we say that st peter was nothing in himself that all the goodness and worth in him was given him by jesus christ then we must ask what sort of goodness what sort of worth did the lord give st peter to make him fit for so great an office  and how did he use christs gifts  for mind he might have used them wrongly as well as rightly and the greater gifts he had the more harm he would have done if he had used them ill  we shall see presently how he did use them ill more than once and how our lord had to reprove him and say very stern and terrible words to him to bring him to his senses  but this we may see that st peter was always a frank brave honest highspirited man who if he thought that a thing ought to be done would do it at once  the first thing we hear of him is how jesus walking by the lake of galilee saw peter with his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers  and he said unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men  and they straightway left their nets and followed him  this was most likely not the first time that st peter had seen our lord or heard him speak  living in the same part of the country he must have known all his miracles  but still it was a great struggle no doubt for him and doubly so because he was a married man to throw up his employment and go wandering after one who had not where to lay his head  yet he did it and did it at once  and you may see that he did it for a much higher and nobler reason than if he had only gone to wonder at our lords miracles as the multitude did or even to be able to work miracles himself  jesus did not say to him follow me and i will give you the power of working miracles and being admired and wondered at all he says is i will make you fishers of men i will make you able to get a hold on mens hearts and teach them and make them happier and better  and for that st peter followed him  it seems as if from the first his wish was to do good to his fellowcreatures  and gradually he seems to have become the spokesman for the other apostles  when they wished to ask our lord anything we generally find st peter asking and when as in the gospel for today our lord asks them a question st peter answers for them all  whom say ye that i am  and peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god  this is what st peter had learnt because he had kept his eyes and his ears open and his heart ready and teachable that he might see gods truth when it should please god to show it him and god did show it him  and taught him something which his own eyes and ears could not teach him which all his thinking could not have taught him which no man could have taught him flesh and blood could not reveal to him that jesus was the son of god flesh and blood could not draw aside the veil of flesh and blood and make him see in that poor man of nazareth who was called the carpenters son the only begotten of the father god made man  no  god the father only could teach him that by the inspiration of his holy spirit  but do you think that god would have taught st peter that or that st peter could have learnt it if his mind had been merely full of thoughts about himself and what honour he was to get for himself or what profit he was to get for himself out of the lord jesus christ  no  st peter loved the lord jesus loved him with his whole heart when afterwards our lord asked him simon son of jonas lovest thou me  he answered lord thou knowest that i love thee  and because he loved him he saw how beautiful and glorious the lords character was and his eyes were opened to see that the lord was too beautiful too glorious to be merely a mortal man and at last to see that he was the brightness of gods glory and the express image of his fathers person  but as i said just now st peters great and excellent gifts might have made him only the more dangerous man if he used them ill  and this seems to have been his danger  he was plainly a very bold and determined man who knew his own power and was ready to use it fearlessly  and what would he be tempted to do  to fancy that his power belonged to him and not to christ that his wisdom belonged to himself that his faith belonged to himself his authority belonged to himself and that therefore he could use his excellent gifts as he liked and not merely as christ liked  he was liable as we say in homely english to have his head turned by his honour and his power  for instance immediately after our lord had put this great honour on him i will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven we find peter mistaking his power and therefore misusing it  from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day  then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord  this shall not be unto thee  but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan  thou art an offence unto me  for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men  st peters words in the greek tongue really seem to mean that st peter fancied that he could protect our lord that he had the power of delivering him by binding his enemies the jews and loosing the lord himself  that seems to have been the way in which he took our lords words  but what does our lord answer  as stern words as man could hear  get thee behind me satan for thou art an offence unto me  or rather thou art my stumblingblock  so that st peter while he fancied himself near to the angels found out to his shame that he was behaving like a devil and had to be called satan to his face and that while he thought he could save the lord jesus he found that he was doing all he could to harm and ruin his master trying to do the very work which the devil tried to do when he tempted the lord jesus in the wilderness  so near beside each other do heaven and hell lie  so easy is it to give place to the devil and fall into the worst of sin just when we are puffed up with spiritual pride  and more than once afterwards st peter had to learn that same lesson when for instance he leaped boldly overboard from the boat and came walking towards jesus on the sea  that was noble worthy of st peter  but he fancied himself a braver man than he was  he became afraid and the moment that he became afraid he began to sink  jesus saved him and then told him why he had become afraid  because his faith had failed him  he had ceased trusting in christs power to keep him up and became helpless at once  that should have been a lesson to st peter that he was not to be so very sure of his own faith and his own courage that without his lord he might become cowardly and helpless any moment  but he did not take that gentle lesson so he had to learn it once and for all by a very terrible trial  we all know how he fellone day protesting vehemently to his lord though i die with thee i will not deny thee the next declaring with oaths and curses i know not the man  no wonder that when jesus turned and looked on him peter went out and wept bitterly as bitter tears of shame as ever were shed on earth  for he knew he was sure that he loved his lord all along  and now he had denied him  he who was so bold and confident to fall thus and into the very sins most contrary to his nature the very sins in which he would have expected least of all to fall  he so frank and honest and bravehe to turn coward  he to tell a base lie  i dare say that for the moment he could hardly believe himself to be himself  but so it is my friends  if we forget that all which is good and strong in us comes from god and not from ourselves if we are conceited and confident in ourselves then we cut ourselves off from gods grace and give place to satan the devil that he may sift us like wheat as he did st peter and then in some shameful hour we may find ourselves saying and doing things which we would never have believed we could have done  god grant that if ever we fall into such unexpected sin it may happen to us as it did to st peter  for satan gained little by sifting st peter  he sifted out the chaff  but the wheat was left behind safe for gods garner the chaff was st peters rashness and selfconceit which came from his own sinful nature and that went and st peter was rid of it for ever  the wheat was st peters courage and faith and honour which came from god and that remained and st peter kept them for ever  that we read was st peters conversion that worked the thorough and complete change in his character and made him a new man from that day forth  and then after that terrible and fiery trial st peter was ready to receive the gift of the holy spirit which gave him courage with fervent zeal to preach the gospel of his crucified lord and at last to be crucified himself for that lords sake and so fulfil the lords words to him  when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest  but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not  by that our lord seems to have meant you were strong and proud and self willed enough in your youth  the day will come when you will be tamed down ready and willing to suffer patiently even agony from which your flesh and blood may shrink and the lords words came true  for say the old stories when st peter was led to be crucified he refused to be crucified upright as the lord jesus had been saying that it was too great an honour for him who had once denied his lord to die the same death as his lord died  so he was crucified they say with his head downward and ended a glorious life in a humble martyrdom  and what may we learn from st peters character  i think we may learn this  frankness boldness a high spirit a stout will and an affectionate heart these are all gods gifts and they are pleasant in his eyes and ought to be a blessing to the man who has them  ought to be a blessing to him because they are the stuff out of which a good and noble and useful christian man may be made but they need not be a blessing to a man they are excellent gifts  but they will not of themselves make a man an excellent man who excels that is surpasses others in goodness  we may see that ourselves from experience  we see too many brave men freespoken men affectionate men who come to shame and ruin  how then can we become excellent men like st peter  by being baptised as st peter was with the holy ghost and with fire  baptized with the holy ghost to put into our hearts good desires to make us see what is good and love what is good long to do good but baptized with fire also  he shall baptize you john the baptist said with the holy ghost and with fire  does that seem a hard saying  do not some at least of you know what that means  some know i believe  all will know one day for it is true for all  to all sooner or later christ comes to baptise them with fire with the bitter searching affliction which opens the very secrets of their hearts and shows them what their souls are really like and parts the good from the evil in them the gold from the rubbish the wheat from the chaff  and he shall gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he shall burn up with unquenchable fire  god grant to each of you that when that day comes to you there may be something in you which will stand the fire something worthy to be treasured up in gods garner unto everlasting life  but do not think that the baptism of fire comes only once for all to a man in some terrible affliction some one awful conviction of his own sinfulness and nothingness  no with manyand those perhaps the best peopleit goes on month after month year after year  by secret trials chastenings which none but they and god can understand the lord is cleansing them from their secret faults and making them to understand wisdom secretly burning out of them the chaff of selfwill and selfconceit and vanity and leaving only the pure gold of his righteousness  how many sweet and holy souls look cheerful enough before the eyes of man because they are too humble and too considerate to intrude their secret sorrows upon the world and yet they have their secret sorrows  they carry their cross unseen all day long and lie down to sleep on it at night  and they will carry it for years and years and to their graves and to the throne of christ before they lay it down  and none but they and christ will ever know what it was what was the secret chastisement which he sent to make that soul better which seemed to us to be already too good for earth  so does the lord watch his people and tries them with fire as the refiner of silver sits by his furnace watching the melted metal till he knows that it is purged from all its dross by seeing the image of his own face reflected in it  god grant that our afflictions may so cleanse our hearts that at the last christ may behold himself in us and us in himself that so we may be fit to be with him where he is and behold the glory which his father gave him before the foundation of the world    sermon xix  elijah    tenth sunday after trinity  1 kings xxi 19 20  and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine  and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy  and he answered i have found thee  because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord  of all the grand personages in the old testament there are few or none i think grander than the prophet elijah  consider his strange and wild life wandering about in forests and mountains suddenly appearing and suddenly disappearing again so that no man knew where to find him and as obadiah said when he met him if i tell my lord behold elijah is here then as soon as i am gone from thee the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not  consider again his strange activity and strength as when he goes forty days and forty nights far away out of judea over the waste wilderness to horeb the mount of god or as again when he girds up his loins and runs before ahabs chariot for many miles to the entrance of jezreel  one can fancy him from what the bible tells us of him clearly enough as a man mysterious and terrible not merely in the eyes of women and children but of soldiers and of kings  he seems to have been especially a countryman a mountaineer born and bred in gilead among the lofty mountains and vast forests full of wild beasts lions and bears wild bulls and deer which stretch for many miles along the further side of the river jordan with the waste desert of rocks and sand beyond them  a wild man bred up in a wild country he had learnt to fear no man and no thing but god alone  we do not know what his youth was like we do not know whether he had wife or children or any human being who loved him most likely not  he seems to have lived a lonely life in sad and bad times  he seems to have had but one thought that his country was going to ruin from idolatry tyranny false and covetous ways and one determination to say so to speak the truth whatever it cost him  he had found out that the lord was god and not baal or any of the idols and he would follow the lord and tell all israel what his own heart had told him the lord he is god was the one thing which he had to say and he said it till it became his name whether given him by his parents or by the people his name was elijah the lord is god  how long halt ye between two opinions he cries upon the greatest day of his life  if the lord be god then follow him but if baal then follow him  how grand he is on carmel throughout that noble chapter which we read last sunday there is no fear in him no doubt in him  the poor wild peasant out of the savage mountains stands up before all israel before king priests nobles and people and speaks and acts as if he too were a king because the spirit of god is in him  and he is right and he knows that he is right  and they obey him as if he were a king even before the fire comes down from heaven and shows that god is on his side from the first they obey him  king ahab himself obeys him trembles before himand it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim  now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebels table  so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel  the tyrants guilty conscience makes a coward of him  and he quails before the wild man out of the mountains who has not where to lay his head who stands alone against all the people though baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men and the prophets of the groves four hundred and they eat at the queens table and he only is left and they seek his lifeyet no man dare touch him not even the king himself  such power is there such strength is there in being an honest and a godfearing man  yes my friends this was the secret of elijahs power  this is the lesson which elijah has to teach us  not to halt between two opinions  if a thing be true to stand up for it if a thing be right to do it whatsoever it may cost us  make up your minds then my friends to be honest men like elijah the prophet of old  for your own sake for your neighbours sake and for gods sake be honest men  for your own sake  if you want to be respected if you want to be powerfuland it is good to be powerful sometimesif god has set you to govern people whether it be your children and household your own farm your own shop your own estate your own country or neighbourhooddo you want to know the great secret of successbe honest and brave  let your word be as good as your thought and your deed as good as your word  who is the man who is respected who is the man who has influence  the complaisant manthe cringing manthe man who cannot say no or dare not say no  not he  the passionate man who loses his temper when anything goes wrong who swears and scolds and instead of making others do right himself does wrong and lowers himself just when he ought to command respect  my experience isnot he  but the man who says honestly and quietly what he thinks and does fearlessly and quietly what he knows  people who differ from him will respect him because he acts up to his principles  when they are in difficulty or trouble they will go and ask his advice just because they know they will get an honest answer  they will overlook a little roughness in him they will excuse his speaking unpleasant truths  because they can trust him even though he is plainspoken  for your neighbours sake i say and again for your childrens sake for the sake of all with whom you have to do be honest and brave  for our childreno my friends we cannot do a crueller thing by them than to let them see that we are inconsistent  if they hear us say one thing and do anotherif while we preach to them we do not practice ourselves they will never respect us and never obey us from love and principle  if they do obey us it will be only before our faces and from fear  if they see us doing only what we like when our backs are turned they will do what they like  and worse will come than their not respecting usthey will learn not to respect god  if they see that we do not respect truth and honesty they will not respect truth and honesty and he who does not respect them does not respect god  they will learn to look on religion as a sham  if we are inconsistent they will be profane  but some may sayi have no power and i want none  i have no people under me for whom i am responsible  then if you think that you need not be honest and brave for your own sake or for other peoples sake be honest and brave for gods sake  do you ask what i mean  i mean this  recollect that truth belongs to god  that if a thing is true it is true because god made it so and not otherwise and therefore if you deny truth you fight against god  if you are honest and stand up for truth you stand up for god and what god has done  and recollect this too  if a thing be right for you to do god has made it right and god wills you to do it and therefore if you do not do your duty you are fighting against god and if you do your duty you are a fellowworker with god fulfilling gods will therefore i say be honest and brave for gods sake  and in this way my friends all may be brave all may be noble  speak the truth and do your duty because it is the will of god  poor weak women people without scholarship cleverness power may live glorious lives and die glorious deaths and gods strength may be made perfect in their weakness  they may live did i say  i may say they have lived and have died already by thousands  when we read the stories of the old martyrs who in the heathen persecution died like heroes rather than deny christ and scorned to save themselves by telling what they knew to be a lie but preferred truth to all that makes life worth havinghow many of themi may say the greater part of themwere poor creatures enough in the eyes of man though they were rich enough noble enough in the eyes of god who inspired them  few rich and few noble as the apostle says were called  it was to poor people old people weak women illused and untaught slaves that god gave grace to defy all the torments which the heathen could heap on them and to defy the scourge and the rack the wild beasts and the fire sooner than foul their lips and their souls by denying christ and worshipping the idols which they knew were nothing and worth nothing  and so it may be with any of you here whosoever you may be however poor however humble  though your opportunities may be small your station lowly your knowledge little though you may be stupid in mind slow of speech weakly of body yet if you but make up your mind to say the thing which is true and to do the thing which is right you may be strong with the strength of god and glorious with the glory of christ  it is a grand thing no doubt to be like elijah a stern and bold prophet standing up alone against a tyrant king and a sinful people but it is even a greater thing to be like that famous martyr in old time st blandina who though she was but a slave and so weakly and mean and fearful in body that her mistress and all her friends feared that she would deny christ at the very sight of the torments prepared for her and save herself by sacrificing to the idols yet endured day after day tortures too horrible to speak of without cry or groan or any word save i am a christian and having outlived all her fellowmartyrs died at last victorious over pain and temptation so that the very heathen who tortured her broke out in admiration of her courage and confessed that no woman had ever endured so many and so grievous torments  so may gods strength be made perfect in womans weakness  you are not called to endure such things  no  but you and i and every christian soul are called on to do what we know to be right not to halt between two opinions  but if god be god to follow him if we make up our minds to do that we shall be sure to have our trials  but we shall be safe because we are on gods side and god on ours  and if god be with us what matter if the whole world be against us  for which is the stronger of the two the whole world or god who made it and rules it and will rule it for ever    sermon xx  the loftiness of humility    1 peter v 5  be clothed with humility  for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble  this is st peters command  are we really inclined to obey it for if we are there is nothing more easy  there is no vice so easy to get rid of as pride  if one wishes  nothing so easy as to be humble  if one wishes  that may seem a strange saying considering that selfconceit is the vice of all others to which man is most given the first sin and the last sin and that which is said to be the most difficult to cure  but what i say is true nevertheless  whosoever wishes to get rid of pride may do so  whosoever wishes to be humble need not go far to humble himself  but how  simply by being honest with himself and looking at himself as he is  let a man recollect honestly and faithfully his past life let him recollect his sayings and doings for the past week even for the past twentyfour hours  and i will warrant that man that he will recollect something or perhaps many things which will not raise him in his own eyes something which he had sooner not have said or done something which if he is a foolish man he will try to forget because it makes him ashamed of himself something which if he is a wise man he will not try to forget just because it makes him ashamed of himself and a very good thing for him that he should be so  i know that it is so for me and therefore i suppose it is so for every man and woman in this church  i am not going to give any examples  i am not going to say suppose you thought this and this about yourself and were proud of it and then suppose that you recollected that you had done that and that  would you not feel very much taken down in your own conceit  i like that personal kind of preaching less and less  those random shots are dangerous and cruel likely to hit the wrong person and hurt their feelings unnecessarily  it is very easy to say a hard thing  but not so easy to say it to the right person and at the right time  no  the heart knoweth its own bitterness  almost every one has something to be ashamed of more or less which no one but himself and god knows of and which perhaps it is better that no one but he and god should know  i do not mean any great sin or great shamegod forbid but some weak point as we call it  something which he had better not say or do and yet which he is in the habit of saying and doing  i do not ask what it is  with some it may be a mere pardonable weakness with others it may be a very serious and dangerous fault  all i ask now is that each and every one of us should try and find it out and feel it and keep it in mind that we may be of a humble spirit with the lowly which is better than dividing the spoil with the proud  but why better  the world and human nature look up to the proud successful man  one is apt to say happy is the man who has plenty to be proud of happy is the man who can divide the spoil of this world with the successful of this world  happy is the man who can look down on his fellowmen and stand over them and manage them and make use of them and get his profit out of them  but that is a mistake  that is the highmindedness which goes before a fall which comes not from above but is always earthly often sensual and sometimes devilish  the true and safe high mindedness which comes from above is none other than humility for if you will look at it aright the humble man is really more highminded than the proud man  think  suppose two men equal in understanding in rank in wealth in what else you like one of them proud the other humble  the proud man thinkshow much better wiser richer more highly born more religious more orthodox am i than other people round me  not of course than all round him but than those whom he thinks beneath him  therefore he is always comparing himself with those below himself always watching those things in them in which he thinks them worse meaner than himself he is always looking down on his neighbours  now which is more highminded which is nobler which is more fit for a man to look down or to look up  at all events the humble man looks up  he thinks how much worse not how much better am i than other people  he looks at their good points and compares them with his own bad ones  he admires them for those things in which they surpass him  he thinks ofperhaps he loves to read of men superior to himself in goodness wisdom courage  he pleases himself with the example of brave and righteous deeds even though he fears that he cannot copy them and so he is always looking up his mind is filled with high thoughts though they be about others not about himself  if he be a truly christian man his thoughts rise higher still  he thinks of christ and of god and compares his weakness ignorance and sinfulness with their perfect power wisdom goodness  do you not see that this mans mind is full of higher nobler thoughts than that of the proud man  is he not more highminded who is looking up up to god himself for what is good noble heavenly  even though it makes him feel small poor weak and sinful in comparison still his mind is full of grace and wisdom and glory  the proud man meanwhile for the sake of feeding his own selfconceit at other mens expense is filling his mind with low mean earthly thoughts about the weaknesses sins and follies of the world around him  is not he truly lowminded thinking about low things  now i tell you my friends that both have their reward  that the humble man as years roll on becomes more and more noble and the proud man becomes more and more lowminded and finds that pride goes before a fall in more senses than one  yes  there is nothing more hurtful to our own minds and hearts than a domineering contemptuous frame of mind  it may be pleasant to our own self conceit  but it is only a sweet poison  a man lowers his own character by it  he takes the shape of what he is always looking at and if he looks at base and low things he becomes base and low himself just as slaveowners all over the world and in all time sooner and later by living among slaves learn to copy their own slaves vices and while they oppress and look down on their fellowman become passionate and brutal false and greedy like the poor wretches whom they oppress  better better to be of a lowly spirit  better to think of those who are nobler than ourselves even though by so doing we are ashamed of ourselves all day long  what loftier thoughts can man have  what higher and purer air can a mans soul breathe  yes my friends believe it and be sure of it  the truly highminded man is not the proud man who tries to get a little pitiful satisfaction from finding his brother men as he chooses to fancy a little weaker a little more ignorant a little more foolish a little more ridiculous than his own weak ignorant foolish and perhaps ridiculous self  not he but the man who is always looking upwards to goodness to good men and to the allgood god  filling his soul with the sight of an excellence to which he thinks he can never attain and saying with david all my delight is in the saints that dwell in the earth and in those who excel in virtue  but i do not say that he cannot attain to that excellence  to the goodness of god of course no man can but to the goodness of man he may  for what man has done man may do and the grace of god which gave power to one man to rise above sin and weakness and ignorance will give power to others also  but only to those who look upward at better men than themselves  not to those who look down like the pharisee but to those who look up like the publican for as the text says god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble  and why does god resist and set himself against the proud  to turn him out of his evil way of course if by any means he may be converted that is turned round and live  for the proud man has put himself into a wrong position where no immortal soul ought to be  he is looking away from god and down upon men and so he has turned his face and thoughts away from god the fountain of light and life and is trying to do without god and to stand in his own strength and not in gods grace and to be somebody in himself instead of being only in god in whom we live and move and have our being  so he has set himself against god and god will in mercy to that foolish mans soul set himself against him  god will humble him god will overthrow him god will bring his plans to nought if by any means he may make that man ashamed of himself and empty him of his selfconceit that he may turn and repent in dust and ashes when he finds out what those proud laodicaean christians of old had to find outthat all the while that they were saying i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing they did not know that they were wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked  and how does god give grace to the humble  my friends even the wise heathen knew that  listen to a heathen 328 a good and a wise man though and one who was not far from the kingdom of god or he would not have written such words as these  it is our duty he says to turn our minds to the best of everything so as not merely to enjoy what we read but to be improved by it  and we shall do that by reading the histories of good and great men which will in our minds produce an emulation and eagerness which may stir us up to imitation  we may be pleased with the work of a mans hands and yet set little store by the workman  perfumes and fine colours we may like well enough  but that will not make us wish to be perfumers or painters  but goodness which is the work not of a mans hands but of his soul makes us not only admire what is done but long to do the like  and therefore he says he thought it good to write the lives of famous and good men and to set their examples before his countrymen  and having begun to do this he says in another place for the sake of others he found himself going on and liking his labour for his own sake  for the virtues of those great men served him as a lookingglass in which he might see how more or less to order and adorn his own life  indeed it could be compared he says to nothing less than living with the great souls who were dead and gone and choosing out of their actions all that was noblest and worthiest to know  what greater pleasure could there be than that he asks or what better means to improve his soul  by filling his mind with pictures of the best and worthiest characters he was able to free himself from any low malicious mean thoughts which he might catch from bad company  if he was forced to mix at times with base men he could wash out the stains of their bad thoughts and words by training himself in a calm and happy temper to view those noble examples  so says the wise heathen  was not he happier wiser better a thousand times thus keeping himself humble by looking upwards than if he had been feeding his petty pride by looking down and saying god i thank thee that i am not as other men are  if you wish then to be truly highminded by being truly humble read of and think of better men wiser men braver men more useful men than you are  above all if you be christians think of christ himself  that good old heathen took the best patterns which he could find  but after all they were but imperfect sinful men but you have an example such as he never dreamed of a perfect man and perfect god in one  let the thought of christ keep you always humble  and yet let it lift you up to the highest noblest purest thoughts which man can have as it will  for all that this old heathen says of the use of examples of good men all that and far more st paul says almost in the same words  by looking at christ he says we rise and sit with him in heavenly places and enjoy the sight of his perfect goodness ashamed of ourselves indeed and bowed to the very dust by the feeling of our own unworthiness and yet filled with the thought of his worthiness till by looking we begin to admire and by admiring we begin to love and so are drawn and lifted up to him till by beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord and the perfect beauty of his character we become changed into the same image from glory to glory  and thus instead of receiving the just punishment of pride and contempt which is lowering our characters to the level of those on whom we look down we shall receive the just reward of true humility which is having our characters raised to the level of him up to whom we look  oh young people think of this and remember why god has given you the advantage of scholarship and education  not that you may be proud of the very little you know not that you may look down on those who are not as well instructed as you are not that you may waste your time over silly books which teach you only to laugh at the follies and ignorance of some of your fellowmen to whom god has not given as much as to you but that you may learn what great and good men have lived and still live in the world what wise and good and useful things have been and are being done all around you and to copy them  above all that you may look up to christ and through christ to god and learn to copy him till you come as st paul says to be perfect men to the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ  to which may he bring you all of his mercy  amen    sermon xxi  the knowledge of god    trinity sunday  john v 19  then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do  for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise  this is trinity sunday and on this day we are especially to think of the mystery of the everblessed trinity and on the athanasian creed which was read this morning  now there is much in this athanasian creed which simple country people however good their natural abilities may be cannot be expected to understand  the creed was written by scholars and for scholars and for very deep scholars too far deeper than i pretend to be and the reasonable way for most men to think of the athanasian creed will be to take it very much upon trust as a child takes on trust what his father tells him even though he cannot understand it himself or as we all believe that the earth moves round the sun and not the sun round the earth though we cannot prove it but only believe it because wiser men than we have proved it  so we must think of the athanasian creed and say to ourselveswiser men than i can ever hope to be have settled that this is the true doctrine and the true meaning of holy scripture and i will believe them  they must know best  still one is bound to understand as much as one can one is bound to be able to give some reason for the faith which is in us and above all one is bound not to hold false doctrines which are contrary to the athanasian creed and to the bible  some people are too apt to say nowadays but what matter if one does hold false doctrine  that is a mistake of the head and not of the heart  provided a man lives a good life what matter what his doctrines are  no doubt my friends if a man lives a good life all is well  but do people live good lives  i am not speaking of infidels  thank god there are none here to god let us leave them trusting in the good friday collect and the goodwill of god which is that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth  but as for christian people this i will tell you that unless you hold true doctrines you will not lead good lives  my experience is that people are often wrong when they say false doctrine is a mistake of the head and not of the heart  i believe false doctrine is very often not bred in the head at all but in the heart in the very bottom of a mans soul that it rises out of his heart into his head and that if his heart was right with god he would begin at once to have clearer and truer notions of the true christian faith i do not say that it is always so god forbid  but i do say that it is often so because i see it so because i see every day false doctrines about god making men lead bad lives and commit actual sins take gods name in vain dishonour their fathers and mothers lie cheat bear false witness against their neighbours and covet other mens goods  i say i see it and i must believe my own eyes and ears and when i do see it i begin to understand the text which says this is eternal life to know thee the only god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent and i begin to understand the athanasian creed which says that if a man does not believe rightly the name of god and the incarnation of our lord jesus christ he will perish everlastingly his soul will decay more and more become more and more weak unhealthy and corrupt till he perishes everlastingly  and whatsoever that may mean it must mean something most awful and terrible worse than all the evil which ever happened to us since we were born  there is a very serious example of this to my mind in what is called the greek church the greeks and russians  they split off from the rest of christs catholic church many hundred years ago because they would not hold with the rest of the church that the holy spirit proceeded from the son as well as from the father  they said that the holy spirit proceeded from the father alone  now that may seem a slight matter of words  but i cannot help thinking that it has been a very solemn matter of practice with them  it seems to megod forgive me if i am judging them hardlythat because they denied that the holy spirit proceeded from the son they forgot that he was the spirit of the son the spirit of jesus christ by whom he says for ever father not my will but thine be done and so they forgot that the holy spirit is the spirit of sonship the spirit of adoption which must proceed and come from christ to us that we may call god our father and say with christ father i come to do thy will and so in course of time they seem to have forgotten that christian men were in any real practical sense gods children and when people forget that they are gods children they forget soon enough to behave like gods children and to live righteous and godlike lives  i give you this as an example of what i mean how not believing rightly the athanasian creed may make a man lead a bad life  now let me give an example nearer home one which has to do with you and me  god grant that we may all lay it to heart  you read in the athanasian creed that we are not to confound the persons of the trinity nor divide the substance but to believe that such as the father is such is the son and such is the holy ghost the glory equal the majesty coeternal  now there is little fear of our confounding the persons as some people used to do in old times but there is great fear of our dividing gods substance parting gods substance that is fancying that god is made up of different parts and not perfectly one god  for people are very apt to talk as if gods love and gods justice were two different things different parts of god as if his justice had to be satisfied in one way and his love in another as if his justice wished to destroy sinners and his love wished to save sinners and so they talk as if there was a division in god as if different attributes of god were pulling two different ways and that god has parts of which one desires to do one thing and one part another  it sounds shocking i am sure you will feel when i put it into plain english  i wish it to sound shocking  i wish you to feel how wrong and heretical it is that you may keep clear of such notions and believe the orthodox faith that god has neither parts nor passions nor division in his substance at all but is absolutely and substantially one and that therefore his love and his justice are the very same things his justice however severe it may seem is perfect love and kindness and his love is no indulgence but perfect justice  but you may sayvery likely that is true but why need we take so much care to believe it  it is always worth while to know what is true  you are children of the light and of the truth adopted by the god of truth that you may know the truth and do it and no mistake or falsehood can by any possibility do anything for you but harm you  always therefore try to find out and believe what is true concerning everything and above all concerning god on whom all depend in whom you live and move and have your being  for all things in heaven and earth depend on god and therefore if you have wrong notions about god you will sooner or later have wrong notions about everything else  for see now how this false notion of gods justice and love being different things leads people into a worse error still  a man goes on to fancy that while god the son is full of love towards sinners god the father is or at least was once only full of justice and wrath against sinners but if a man thinks that god the son loves him better than god the father does then of course he will love god the son better than he loves god the father  he will think of christ the son with pleasure and gratitude because he says to himself christ loves me cares for me i can have pity and tenderness from him if i do wrong  while of god the father he thinks only with dread and secret dislike  thus from dividing the substance he has been led on to confound the persons imputing to the son alone that which is equally true of the father till he comes as i have known men do to make for himself as it were a heavenly father of jesus christ the son  now my dear friends it does seem to me that if anything can grieve the spirit of christ and the sacred heart of jesus this is the way to grieve him  oh read your bibles and you will see this that whatever jesus came down on earth for it certainly was not to make men love him better than they love the father and honour him more than they honour the father and rob the father of his glory to give it to jesus  what did the lord jesus say himself  that he did not come to seek his own honour or shew forth his own glory or do his own will  but his fathers honour his fathers glory his fathers will  though he was equal with the father as touching his godhead yet he disguised himself if i may so say and took on him the form of a servant and was despised and rejected of men  why that men might honour his father rather than him  that men might not be so dazzled by his glory as to forget his fathers glory therefore he bade his apostles while he was on earth tell no man that he was the christ  therefore when he worked his work of love and mercy he took care to tell the jews that they were not his works but the works of his father who sent him that he was not doing his own will but his fathers  therefore he was always preaching of the father in heaven and holding him up to men as the perfection of all love and goodness and glory  and only once or twice it seems when he was compelled as it were for very truths sake did he say openly who he was and claim his coequal and co eternal glory saying before abraham was i am  and after all this if anything can grieve him now must it not grieve him to see men fancying that he is better than his father is more loving and merciful than his father is more worthy of our trust and faith and adoration and gratitude than his father is his father for whose honour he was jealous with a divine jealousy his father who he knows well loved the world which shrinks from him so well that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him up for it  oh my friends believe me if any sin of man can add a fresh thorn to christs crown it is to see men under pretence of honouring him dishonouring his father  for just think for once of thiswhat nobler feeling on earth than the love of a son to his father  what greater pain to a good son than to see his father dishonoured and put down below him  but what is the love of an earthly son to an earthly father compared to the love of the son to the father  what is the jealousy of an earthly son for his fathers honour compared with the jealousy of god the son for god the fathers honour  all men the father has appointed are to honour the son even as they honour the father  because as the athanasian creed says such as the father is such is the son  but if that be true we are to honour the father even as we honour the son because such as the son is such is the father  both are true and we must believe both and therefore we must not give to christ the honour which we should to a loving friend and give to the father the honour which we should to an awful judge  we must give them both the same honour  if we have a godly fear of the father we ought to have a godly fear of christ and if we trust christ we ought to trust the father also  we must believe that jesus christ the son is the brightness of the fathers glory and the express image of his person and therefore we must believe that because jesus is love therefore the father is love because jesus is longsuffering therefore the father is longsuffering because jesus came to save the world therefore the father must have sent him to save the world or he would never have come for he does nothing he says of himself  because we can trust jesus utterly therefore we can trust the father utterly  because we believe that the son has life in himself to give to whomsoever he will we must believe that the father has life in himself likewise and not as some seem to fancy only the power of death and destruction  because nothing can separate us from the love of jesus nothing can separate us from the love of his father and our father whose name is light and love  if we believe this we shall indeed honour the father and indeed honour the son likewise  but if we do not we shall dishonour the son while we fancy we are honouring him  we shall rob christ of his true glory to give him a false glory which he abhors  if we fancy that he does anything for us without his fathers commands if we fancy that he feels anything for us which his father does not feel and has not always felt likewise  then we dishonour him  for his glory is to be a perfectly good and obedient son and we fancy himmay he forgive us for ita selfwilled son  this is christs glory that though he is equal with his father he obeys his father if he were not equal to his father there would be less glory in his obeying him  take away the mystery of the everblessed trinity and you rob christ of his highest glory and destroy the most beautiful thing in heaven except one  the most beautiful and noble thing of all in heaventhat if you will receive it out of which all other beautiful and noble things in heaven and earth come is the father for ever saying to the son thou art my son this day have i begotten thee  and in thee i am well pleased  the other most beautiful thing is the coequal and coeternal son for ever saying to the father father not my will but thine be done  i come to do thy will o god  thy law is written in my heart  do you not see it  oh my dear friends i see but a very little of it  who am i that i should comprehend god  and who am i that i should be able to make you understand the glory of god by any dull words of mine  but god can make you understand it   the spirit of god can and will shew you the glory of god  because he proceedeth from the father he will shew you what the glory of the father is like  because he proceedeth from the son he will shew you what the glory of the son is like  because he is consubstantial coequal and coeternal with the father and the son he will shew you that the glory of the father and the son is not the glory of mere power but a moral and spiritual glory the glory of having a perfectly glorious noble and beautiful character  and unless he shews you that you will never be thoroughly good men  for it is a strange thing that men are always trying more or less to be like god  and yet not a strange thing for it is a sign that we all came from god and can get no rest till we are come back to god because god calls us all to be his children and be like him  a blessed thing it is if we try to be like the true god  but a sad and fearful thing if we try to be like some false god of our own invention  but so it is  it was so even among the old heathen  whatsoever a man fancies god to be like that he will try himself to be like  so if you fancy than god the fathers glory is stern and awful power that he is extreme to mark what is done amiss or stands severely on his own rights then you will do the same you will be extreme to mark what is done amiss you will stand severely on your rights you will grow stern and harsh unfeeling to your children and workmen and fond of shewing your power just for the sake of shewing it  but if you believe that the glory of the father son and holy spirit is all one and that it is a loving glory if you believe that such as jesus christ is such is his father gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenting him of the evil if you believe that your father in heaven is perfect just because he sendeth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust and is good to the unthankful and the evil if you believe this i say then you will be good to the unthankful and the evil you will be longsuffering and tender good fathers good masters good neighbours and your characters will become patient generous forgiving truly noble truly godlike  and all because you believe the athanasian creed in spirit and in truth  in like manner if you believe that jesus christ is not a perfect son if you fancy that he has any will but his fathers will that he has any work but what his father gives him to do who has committed all things into his hands that he knows anything but what his father sheweth him who sheweth him all things because he loveth him then you will be tempted to wish for power and honour of your own to become ambitious selfwilled vain and disobedient to your parents  but if you believe that jesus is a perfect son all that you would wish your son to be to you and millions of times more and if you believe that that very thing is christs glory that his glory consists in being a perfect son perfectly obedient having no will or wish but his fathers then will you by thus seeing christ in spirit and in truth see how beautiful and noble it is to be good sons and you will long to try to be good sons  and what you long for and try for you will surely be in gods good time for he has promisedblessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness  for they shall be filled  and all through believing the athanasian creed  all  yes all  but will not the holy spirit teach us without the athanasian creed  the holy spirit will teach us  must teach us if we are really to learn one word of all this in spirit and in truth  but whether the holy spirit does teach us will depend i fear very much upon whether we pray for him and whether we pray for him aright will depend on whether we know who he is and what he is like and that again the athanasian creed will tell us  now go home with gods blessing  remember that such as the son is such is the father and such is the holy ghost  pray to be made good fathers after the likeness of the father from whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named good sons after the likeness of god the son and good and holy spirits after the likeness of the holy spirit and you will be such at last in gods good time as far as man can become like god for you will be praying for the holy spirit himself and he will hear you and come to you and abide with you and all will be well    sermon xxii  the torment of fear    first sunday after trinity  1 john iv 16 18  and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us  god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment  because as he is so are we in this world  there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear  because fear hath torment  he that feareth is not made perfect in love  the text tells us how to get one of the greatest blessings a blessing which all long for but all do not find and that is a happy death  all wish to die happily even bad men  like balaam when he was committing a great sin they can say let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his  but meanwhile like balaam they find it too hard to live the life of the righteous which is the only way to die the death of the righteous  but something within them if false preachers will but leave them alone tells them that they will not succeed  reason and common sense tell them so  for how can a man expect to get to a place without travelling the road which leads to it  and the spirit of god the spirit of truth and right tells them that they will not succeed  for how can a man win happiness save by doing right every one shall receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad  so says scripture and so say mens own hearts by the inspiration of gods holy spirit  and therefore such mens fear of death continues  and why the text tells us the secret  as long as we do not love god we shall be tormented with fear of death  and as long as we do not love our neighbour we shall not love god  we may try as thousands have tried and as thousands try still to love god without loving their neighbour to be very religious and worship god and sing his praises and think over all his mercy to them and all that he has done for them by the death of his blessed son jesus christ and so to persuade themselves and god that they love him while they keep in their hearts selfishness pride spite uncharitableness  but they do not succeed  if they think they succeed they are only deceiving themselves  so says st john  he who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen  but they cannot deceive themselves long  you will see if you watch such people and still more if you watch yourselves that if you do not love your neighbours in spirit and in truth then those tormenting fears soon come back again worse than ever  ay whenever we indulge ourselves in hard words and cruel judgments the thought of god seems darkened to us there and then the face of god seems turned from us and peace of mind and brightness of spirit and lightness of soul do not come back to us till we have confessed our sins and have let the kindly the charitable the merciful thoughts rise up in us once more as by the grace of christ they will rise up  yes my friends as far as i can see people are filled with the peace of god just in as far as they are at peace with their fellow men  they are bright calm and content looking forward with cheerfulness to death and with a humble and holy boldness to judgment just in as far as their hearts are filled with love gentleness kindness to all that god has made  they dwell in god and god in them and perfect love has cast out fear  but if a man does not live in love then sooner or later he will hear a voice within him which whispers thou art going wrong and if thou art going wrong how canst thou end at the right place none but the right road can end there  the wrong road must lead to the wrong place  then the man gets disturbed and terrified in his mind and tormented with fears as the text says  he knows that the day of judgment is coming and he has no boldness to meet it  he shrinks from the thought of death of judgment of god  he thinkshow shall i meet my god  i do not love my neighbour  i do not love god and god does not love me  the truth is that the man cannot love god even if he will  he looks on god as his enemy whom he has offended who is coming to take vengeance on him  and as long as we are afraid of any one and fancy that they hate us and are going to hurt us we cannot love them  so the man is tormented with fear fear of death fear of judgment fear of meeting god  then he takes to superstition he runs from preacher to preacher and what notthere is no folly men have not committed and do not commit still to rid themselves of that tormenting fear  but they do not rid themselves of it  sermons churchgoings almsgivings leaving the church and turning dissenters or roman catholics joining this sect and that sect nothing will rid a man of his superstitious fear  nothing but believing the blessed message of the text  and what does the text say  it says thisgod is love  god does not hate thee he loves thee  he willeth not thy death o sinner but rather that thou shouldest turn from thy wickedness and live thy sins have not made him hate thee  but only pity thee pity thy folly which will lead on the road to death when he wishes to put thee on the road to life that thou mayest have boldness in the day of judgment instead of shrinking from god like a guilty coward and what is the way of life  surely the way of christ who is the life  live like him and thou wilt not need to fear to die  so says the text  we are to have boldness in the day of judgment because as christ is so are we in this world  and how was and is and ever will be christ in this world  full of love of brotherly kindness charity forgiveness peace and good will to men  that says st john is the life which brings a joyful death for god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  oh consider this my good friends  consider this lest when you come to die the ghosts of all your sins should rise up at your bedside and torment you with fearthe ghosts of every cruel word which you ever spoke against your fellow men of every kind action which you neglected as well as of every unjust one which you ever committed  and if they do rise up in judgment against you what must you do  cast yourself upon the love of god and remember that god is love and so loved us that he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins  ask him to forgive you your sins for the sake of that precious blood which was shed on the cross  but not that you may keep your sins and may escape the punishment of them  god forbid what use in having your past sins forgiven if the sinful heart still remains to run up fresh sins for the future  no  ask him not merely to forgive the past but to mend the future to create in you a new heart which wishes no ill to any human being and a right spirit which desires first and utterly to do right and is filled with the holy spirit of god the spirit of love by which god made and redeemed the world and all that therein is  so will all tormenting fears cease  you will feel yourself in the right way the way of charity the way in which christ walked in this world and have boldness in the day of judgment facing death without conceit indeed but also without superstitious fear    sermon xxiii  the flesh and the spirit    eighth sunday after trinity  romans viii 12  therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die  what does walking after the flesh mean  st paul tells us himself in gal v where he uses exactly the same form of words which he does here  the works of the flesh he says are manifest  when a man gives way to his passions and appetiteswhen he cares only about enjoying his own flesh and the pleasures which he has in common with the brutes then there is no mistake about the sort of life which he will leadnow the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like  an ugly list my friends and god have mercy on the man who gives way to them  for disgraceful as they are to him and tormenting also to him in this life the worst is that if he gives way to them he will die  i do not mean that he will bring his mortal body to an untimely end that he will ruin his own health or that he will get himself hanged though that is likely enoughcommon enough  i think st paul means something even worse than that  the man himself will die  not his body merely  but his soul his character will die all in him that god made all that god intended him to be will die all that his father and mother loved in him all that they watched over and hoped and prayed that it might grow up into life in order that he might become the man god meant him to be all that will die his soul and character will become one mass of disease  he will think wrong feel wrong about everything of which he does think and feel  while about the higher matters of which every man ought to know something he will not think or feel at all  love to his country love to his own kinsfolk even above all love to god will die in him and he will care for nothing but himself and how to get a little more foul pleasure before he goes out of this world he dare not think whither  all power of being useful will die in him honour and justice will die in him  he will be shut up in himself in the ugly prisonhouse of his own lusts and passions parted from his fellowmen caring nothing for them knowing that they care nothing for him  he will have no faith in man or god  he will believe no good he will have no hope either for himself or for the world  this this is death indeed the death of sin the death in which human beings may go on for years walking eating and drinking worse than those who walk in their sleep and see nothing though their eyes are staring wide  oh pitiable sight  the most pitiable sight in the whole world a human soul dead and rotten in sin  it is a pitiable sight enough to see a human body decayed by disease to see a poor creature dying even quietly and without pain  pitiable but not half so pitiable as the death of a human soul by sin  for the death of the body is not a mans own fault  but that death in life of sin is a mans own fault  in a christian country at least it is a mans own fault if he goes about the world as i have seen many a one go having a name to live and yet dead in trespasses and sins while his soul only serves to keep his body alive and moving  how shall we escape this death in life  st paul tells us if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live  through the spirit  the spirit of god and of christ  keep that in mind for that is the only way the right way to mortify and kill in us these vices and passions which unless we kill them will kill us  the only way  for men have tried other ways in old times do try other ways now  but they fail  i could mention many plans which they have tried  but i will only mention the one which you and i are likely to try  a young man runs wild for a few years as young men are too apt to do  but at last he finds that illliving does not pay  it hurts his health his pocket his character  he makes himself ill he cannot get employed he has ruin staring him in the face from his wild living  he must mend  if he intends to keep out of the workhouse the gaol the grave he must mortify the deeds of the body  he must bridle his passions give up lying about drinking swearing cheating running after bad women  and if he has a strong will he does it from mere selfish prudence  but is he safe  i think not as long as he loves still the bad ways he has given up he has given them up not because he hates them because he is ashamed of them because he knows them to be hateful to god and ruinous to his own soul  but because they do not pay  the man himself is not changed  his heart within is not converted  the outside of his life is whitewashed but his heart may be as foul as ever as full as ever of selfishness greediness meanness  and what happens to him  too often what happened to the man in the parable when the unclean spirit went out of him and came back again  the unclean spirit found his home swept and garnished  but empty  all very neat and respectable  but empty  there was no other spirit dwelling there  no good spirit who could fight the unclean spirit and keep him out  so he took to himself seven other spirits worse than himselfhypocrisy cant cunning covetousness and all the smoothshaven sins which beset middleaged and elderly men and they dwell there and so does the unclean spirit of youth too  alas  how often have i seen men whom that description would fit but too wellmen who have kept themselves respectable till they have got back their character in the worlds eyes  and when they get into years and have risen perhaps in life and made money are looked up to by their fellows  but what are they at heart  as great scoundrels as they were thirty years beforecunning false covetous and hypocriticaland indulging perhaps the unclean spirit of youth as much as they dare without being found out  god help them for their last state is worse than their first  but that is the fruit of trying to mortify and kill their own vices by mere worldly prudence and not by the spirit of god which alone can cleanse the heart of any man or make him strong enough really to conquer and kill his sins  and what is this spirit of god  we may know in this way  what says our lord in the gospel  the tree is known by its fruits  then if we know the fruits of the spirit we shall surely know something at least of what the spirit is like  what then says st paul the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance  therefore the spirit is a loving spirita peaceable a gentle a good a faithful a sober and temperate spirit  and if you follow it you will live  if you give yourselves up honestly frankly and fully to be led by that good spirit and obey it when it prompts you with right feelings you your very self will live  you will be what god intended you to be you will grow as god intended you to grow grow as christ did in grace in all which is graceful amiable worthy of respect and love and therefore in favour with god and man  your character will improve and strengthen day by day and rise day by day to fuller stronger healthier spiritual life  you will be able more and more to keep down low passions evil tempers and all the works of the flesh when they tempt you you will despise and hate them more and more for having seen the beauty of goodness you will see the ugliness of sin  so the bad passions and tempers instead of being merely put to sleep for a while to wake up all the stronger for their rest will be really mortified and killed in you  they will die out of you and you the real you whom god made will live and grow continually  and instead of having your character dragged down diseased and at last ruined it will rise and progress as you grow older in the sure and safe road of eternal life  to which god bring us all in his mercy  amen    sermon xxiv  the unrighteous mammon    ninth sunday after trinity  luke xvi 18  and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods  and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward  then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship  i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed  i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses  so he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and said unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord  and he said an hundred measures of oil  and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty then said he to another and how much owest thou  and he said an hundred measures of wheat  and he said unto him take thy bill and write fourscore  and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely  for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light  this parable has always been considered a difficult one to understand  fathers and divines in all ages have tried to explain it in different ways and have never it seems to me been satisfied with their own explanations  they have always felt it strange that our lord should seem to hold up as an example to us this steward who having been found out in one villainy escapes so it seems from the common explanation by committing a second  they have not been able to see either how we are really to copy the steward  our lord says that we are to copy him by making ourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness  but how  by giving away a few alms or a great many  does any rational man seriously believe that if his mammon was unrighteous that is if his wealth were illgotten he would save his soul and be received into eternal life for giving away part of it or even the whole of it  no doubt there always have been men who will try  men who having cheated their neighbours all their lives have tried to cheat the devil at last by some such plan as the unjust stewards but that plan has never been looked on as either a very honourable or a very hopeful one  i think that if i had been an usurer or a grinder of the poor all my life i should not save my soul by founding almshouses with my money when i died or even ten years before i died  it might be all that i was able to do  but would it justify me in the sight of god  that which saves a soul alive is repentance and of repentance there are three parts contrition confession and satisfactionin plain english making the wrong right and giving each man back as far as one can what one has taken from him  to each man i say for i have no right to rob one man and then give to another  i ought to give back again to the man whom i have robbed  i have no right to cheat the rich for the sake of the poor and after i have cheated the rich i do not make satisfaction either to god or man by giving that money to the poor  good old zaccheus the publican knew better what true satisfaction was like  he had been gaining money not altogether in an unjust way but in a way which did him no credit he had been farming the taxes and he was dissatisfied with his way of life therefore behold lord he says the half of my goods of what i have a right to in the worlds eyeswhat is my own and i could keep if i likedi give to the poor  but if i have done wrong to any man i restore to him fourfold  then said the lord this day is salvation come to this mans house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham a just and faithful man who knows what true repentance is  but now my friends suppose that this was just what our lord tells us to do in this parable  suppose that this was just what the unjust steward did  i only say suppose for i know that more learned men than i explain the difficulty otherwise  only i ask you to hear my explanation  the steward is accused of wasting his lords goods  he will be put out of his stewardship  he goes to his lords debtors and bids them write themselves down in debt to him at far less sums than they had thought that they owed  now suppose that these debtors were the very men whom he had been cheating  suppose that he had been overcharging these debtors and now in his need had found out that honesty was the best policy and charged them what they really owed him  they were probably tenants under his lord paying their rents in kind as was often the custom in the east  one rented an olive garden and paid for it so many measures of oil another rented cornland and paid so many measures of meal  now suppose that the steward as he easily might had been setting these poor mens rents too high and taking the surplus himself  that while he had been charging one tenant a hundred he had been paying to his lord only fifty and so forth  what does he do then in his need  he does justice to his lords debtors  he tells them what their debts really are  he sets their accounts right  instead of charging the first man a hundred he charges him fifty instead of charging the second a hundred he charges him eighty and he does not as far as we are told conceal this conduct from his lord  he rights them as far as he can now so he shews that he honestly repents  he has found out that honesty is the best policy that the way to make true friends is to deal justly by them and if he cannot restore what he has taken from them already for i suppose he had spent it at least to confess his sin to them and to set the matter right for the time to come  this i think is what our lord bids us do if we have wronged any man and fouled our hands with the unrighteous mammon that is with illgotten wealth  and i think so all the more from the verses which come after  for when he has said make yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness he goes on in the very next verse to say he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in that which is much  if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches  now surely this must have something to do with what goes before  and if it has what can it mean but thisthat the way to make friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness is to be faithful in it just in it honest in it  but some one may say if mammon be unrighteous how can a man be righteous and upright in dealing with it  if money be a bad thing in itself how can a man meddle with it with clean hands  so some people will say and so some will be glad to say  but why because they do not want to be righteous upright just and honest in their money dealings and therefore they are glad to make out that they could not be upright if they tried because money being a bad thing altogether a man must needs if he has to do with money do things which he knows are wrong  i say some people are glad to believe that  i do not mean any one in this congregation  god forbid  i mean in the world in general  we do see people religious people too do things about money which they know are mean covetous cruel and then excuse themselves by sayingwell of course i would not do so to my own brother but in the way of business one cant help doing these things  now i do not quite believe them  i have seldom seen the man who cheated his neighbour who would not cheat his own brother if he had a chance  but so they say  and if they be religious people they will quote scripture and sayah it is the fault of the unrighteous mammon and in dealing with the unrighteous mammon we cannot help these little failings and so forth  till they seem to have two quite different rules of right and wrong one for the saving of their own souls which they keep to when they are hearing sermons and reading good books and the other for money which they keep to when they have to pay their debts or transact business  now my dear friends be not deceived  god is not mocked  god tempts no man  man tempts himself by his own lusts and passions god does not tempt us when he gives us money puts us in the way of earning money or spending money  money is not bad in itself wealth is not bad in itself  if mammon be unrighteous we make money into mammon when we make an idol of it and worship it more than gods law of right and justice  we make it unrighteous by being unrighteous and unjust ourselves  money is good for money stands for capital for moneys worth for houses land food clothes all that man can make and they stand for labour employment wages and they stand for human beings for the bodily life of man  without wealth where should we be now  if god had not given to man the power of producing wealth where should we be now  not here  fourfifths of us would not have been alive at all  instead of eight hundred people in this parish all more or less well off there would be perhaps one hundredperhaps far less living miserably on game and roots  instead of thirty millions of civilized people in great britain there would be perhaps some two or three millions of savages  money i say stands for the lives of human beings  therefore money is good an ordinance and a gift of god as it is written it is god that giveth the power to get wealth  but like every other good gift of god we may use it as a blessing or we may misuse it and make it a snare and a curse to our own souls  if we let into our hearts selfishness and falsehood if we lose faith in god and fancy that gods laws are not wellmade enough to prosper us but that we must break them if we want to prosper then we turn gods good gift into an idol and a snare into the unrighteous mammon  it is not the quantity of money we have to deal with which is the snare it is our own lusts and covetousness which are the snares it is just as easy to sell our souls for five pounds as for five thousand  it is just as easy to be mean and tricky about paying little debts of a shilling or two as it is about whole estates  i do not see that rich people are at all more unjust about money than poor ones and if any say  yes but the poor are tempted more than the rich i answer then look at those who are neither poor nor rich who have enough to live on decently and are not tempted as the poor are to steal or tempted as the rich are to luxury and extravagance  are they more honest than either rich or poor  not a whit  all depends on the mans heart  if his heart be selfish and mean he will be dishonest as a poor man as a middleclass man as a great lord  if his heart be faithful and true he will be honest whether he lives in a cottage or in a palace  any man can do justly and love mercy if his heart be right with god  i have seen daylabourers who had a hard struggle to live at all keep out of debt and out of shame and live in a noble poverty rich in the sight of god because their hearts were rich in goodness  i have seen tradesmen and farmers among all the temptations of business keep their honour as bright as any gentlemansbrighter than too many gentlemens because they had learnt to fear god and work righteousness  i have seen great merchants and manufacturers because that they were their brothers keepers spread not only employment but comfort education and religion among the hundreds of workmen whom god had put into their charge  i have seen great landowners live truly royal lives doing with all their might the good which their hand found to do and after the likeness of their heavenly father causing their sun to shine on the evil and on the good and their rain to fall on the just and on the unjust  yes in every station of life thy dealings will be right with men if thy heart be right with god  yes  let us bear in mind thisthat whatever we cannot be we can at least be honest men  let us go to our graves if possible with the feeling that there is not a man on earth a penny the worse for us  and if we have ever fouled our hands with the unrighteous mammon let us cleanse them by the only possible plan by making restitution to those whom we have wronged and so make friends of the mammon of unrighteousness who shall forgive us and receive us as friends in heaven instead of making enemies and going out of the world with the fearful thought that we shall meet at gods judgmentseat people whom we have made miserable who will rise up to accuse us and demand payment of us when it is too late for ever  let us bear in mind even though we cannot copy the dying words of muhammed the arab who when he found his end draw near went forth into the marketplace and asked before all the people was there any man whom he had wronged  if so his own back should bear the stripes  was there any man to whom he owed money and he should be paid  yes cried some one those coins which you borrowed from me on such a day  pay him said muhammed  better to be shamed now on earth than shamed in the day of judgment  he was a heathen  and shall we christians be worse than he  then let us pray for the holy spirit of god the spirit of truth which will make us faithful and true so that no man may be the worse for us in this life no man may have to say of us when he hears that we lie dying he wronged me he cheated me he lied to me god forgive him but that our friends as they carry us to the grave may feel that they have lost one whom they could respect and trust and say as the earth rattles in upon the coffin lid there lies an honest man    sermon xxv  the sighs of christ    twelfth sunday after trinity  mark vii 34 35  and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened  and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain  why did the lord jesus look up to heaven  and why too did he sigh  he looked up to heaven we may believe because he looked to god the father to god of whom the glorious collect tells us that he is more ready to hear than we to pray and is wont to give more than either we desire or deserve  he looked up to the father who is the fountain of life of order of health of usefulness who hates all death disease infirmity who wills that none should perish body or soul  my friends think of these cheering words and try to look up to god the father as christ looked up  look up to him i say if but once as a father  not merely as your father but as the father of the spirits of all flesh the good god who creates and delights to create who orders all worlds and heavens with perfect wisdom perfect power perfect justice perfect love and peoples them with immortal souls and spirits that they may be useful happy blessed in keeping his laws and doing the work which he has ordained for them  oh think if but once of god the perfect and allloving father and then you will know why jesus looked up to him  and you will see too why jesus sighed  he sighed because he was one with the father  he sighed because he had the mind of god because god the lord of health and order hates disease and disorder  because god the lord of bliss and happiness hates misery and sorrow  because god made the world at first very good and behold by mans sin it has become bad  why did he sigh  surely also from pity for the poor man  his infirmity was no such great one he had an impediment in his speech and with it as many are apt to have deafness also  but it was an infirmity  it was a disease  it was something out of order something gone wrong in gods world and as such christ could not abide it he grieved over it  he sighed because there was sickness in a world where there ought to be nothing but health and sorrow where there ought to be nothing but happiness  he sighed because man had brought this sickness and sorrow on himself by sin for remember man alone is subject to disease  the wild animal in the wood the bird upon the tree seldom or never know what sickness is seldom or never are stunted or deformed  they live according to their nature healthy and happy and die in a good old age  while manwhy should i talk of what man is of how far man is fallen from what god the father meant him to be while one hundred thousand corpses of brave men are now fattening the plains of italy for next years crop while even in our favoured land we find at every turn prisons and reformatories lunatic asylums hospitals for numberless kinds of horrible diseases sickness weakness and death all round us  only look up yonder to windsor forest and see the vast building now in progress there before your eyes for lunatic convictsthe most miserable perhaps and pitiable of human beingsand let that building be a sign to you how far man is fallen and what cause jesus had to sigh and has to sigh still over the miseries of fallen man  yes my friends not without reason did the old heathen poet who had no sure and certain hope of everlasting life say that man was the most wretched of all the beasts of the field not without reason did st paul say that if in this life only we have hope in christ then the christian man who dare not indulge his passions and appetites dare not say let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die but must curb himself and give up his own pleasure and his own fancy at every turn is of all men most miserable  if christs work is done if his mercy and help ended when he died upon the cross if all he did was to heal the sick for three short years in judea a long while ago  then what have we to which we can look forward  what hope have we not merely for ourselves who are here now but for all the millions who have died and suffered already  yes  what reasonable hope for mankind can they have who do not believe that christ is very god of very god the perfect likeness of the heavenly father  but what if that which was true of him then is true of him now what if he be the same yesterday today and for ever  what if he be ascended on high that he might fill all things with his almighty power and declare that almighty power most chiefly by shewing mercy and pity  what if he be for ever looking up to his father and our father to his god and our god interceding for ever for mankind for ever offering up to the father that sacrifice of himself which he perfected upon the cross for the sins of the whole world  what if he be for ever sighing over every sin every sorrow every cruelty every injustice over all things great and small which go wrong throughout the whole world and saying for ever father this is not according to thy will  let thy will be done on earth as in heaven  and what if he does not look up in vain nor sigh in vain  what if the will of god the father be that sin and sorrow disease and death being contrary to his will and law should be at last rooted out of this world and all worlds for ever  what if christ have authority and commission from god to fight against all evil sin disease and death and all the ills which flesh is heir to and to teach men to fight them likewise till they conquer them by his might and by his light  what if he reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and he has delivered up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all what if the day shall come when all the nations of the earth shall thus see christs good works and glorify his father and their father who is in heaven and by obeying the law of their being and the commandment of god which is life eternal shall live for ever in that glory of which it is written that a river of water of life shall proceed out of the throne of god and of the lamb and the leaves of the trees which grow thereby shall be for the healing of the nations and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in the city of god and his servants shall serve him and the lord god shall give them light and they shall reign for ever and ever  what those words mean i know not and hardly dare to think  but as long as those words stand in the bible we will have hope  for god the father who willeth that none should perish and jesus the only begotten son who sighed over the poor mans infirmity in judea are the same yesterday today and for ever    sermon xxvi  the woman of samaria    twelfth sunday after trinity 1856  2 kings xviii 912  and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it  and at the end of three years they took it  even in the sixth year of hezekiah that is the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken  and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozon and in the cities of the medes  because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them  these are very simple words  but they are awful words enough awful enough to the poor creatures of whom they speak  you here most of you can hardly guess all that these words mean  you may thank god that you do not  that you do not know the horrors of war and the misery of a conquered country in old times  to lose all they had ever earned all that makes life worth having to have their homes burnt over their heads their crops carried off their fields  to see their women dishonoured their old men and children murderedto be insulted beaten and tortured to make them tell where their money was hidden and after they and theirs had suffered every unspeakable shame and misery from the hands of brutal enemies to be stripped bound and marched away for hundreds of miles across the deserts into the cold and dreary mountains of the north of assyria there to live and die as slaves and never again to see their native land  and such a land as it was and is still or rather might be still if there were men in it worthy the name of men  for of all countries in the world that land of israel is one of the most rich and beautiful  the climate and the soil there is such that two crops can often be grown in the year of almost any kind which man may need there are rich valleys well watered where not only wheat and every graincrop but the olive and the fig and the vine flourish in perfection rich parklike uplands where sheep and cattle without number may find pasture great forests of timber fit for every use and all kept cool and fruitful even beneath that burning eastern sun by the clear streams which flow for ever down from hermon the great snowmountain ten thousand feet high which overlooks that pleasant land  there is hardly travellers say a lovelier or richer country upon earth than the land of israel from hebron on the south to hermon on the north nor a country which might have been stronger and safer and more prosperous if these jews had been but wise  it is so to speak one great castle rising most of it two thousand feet high and walled in by god in a way as is seen hardly in any other land  on the west lies the sea on the south and on the east vast wildernesses of sandy desert and on the north the mighty mountains of hermon and lebanon which no invading army could have crossed if the jews had had courage to keep them out  and that the noble and divine law of moses would have given them  it would have made them one free brave godfearing people at unity with itself and the promise of moses would have been fulfilledthat one of them should chase a thousand and no man or nation be able to stand against them  in davids time and in solomons time also that promise came true and that small people of the jews became a very powerful nation respected and feared by all the kingdoms round  but when they fell into idolatry and forsook the true god and his law  all was changed  idolatry brought sin and sin brought bad passions hatred division weakness ruin  the first beginning was the breaking up of the nation into two the kingdom of judah to the south the kingdom of israel to the north  and with that division came envy spite quarrels wars between israel and judah which were but madness  for what could come of those two brothernations fighting against each other but that both should grow weaker and weaker and so fall a prey to some third nation stronger than them both  the ruin of the kingdom of israel of which the text tells us arose out of some unnatural quarrel of this kind  pekah the king of israel had made friends with the heathen king of syria and got him to join in making war on judah  and a fearful war it was for the israelites according to one account killed in that war a hundred and twenty thousand of the jews men of their own blood and language all abrahams descendants as well as they  on which ahaz king of judah not to be behind hand in folly sent to the heathen king of assyria to help him just as the king of israel had sent to the king of damascus  he had better have been dead than to have done that  for those terrible assyrians who had set their hearts on conquering the whole east were standing by watching all the little kingdoms round tearing themselves to pieces by foolish wars till they were utterly weak and the time was ripe for the assyrians to pounce upon them  the king of assyria came  he swept away all the heathen people of damascus and killed their king  but he did not stop there  in a very few years he came on into the land of israel besieged samaria for three years and took it and carried off the whole of the inhabitants of the country and there was an end of that miserable kingdom of israel which had been sinking lower and lower ever since the days of jeroboam  this was the natural outcome of all their sin and folly of which we have been reading for the last few sundays  elijahs warnings had been in vain and elishas warnings also they liked at heart ahabs and jezebels idolatries better than they did the worship of the true god  and why  because if they worshipped god and kept his laws they must needs have been more or less good men upright just merciful cleanly and chaste livers while on the other hand they might worship their idols and nevertheless be as bad as they chose  indeed the very idolfeasts and sacrifices were mixed up with all sorts of filthy sin drunkenness and profligacy so that it is a shame even to speak of the things which went on especially at those sacrifices to ashtaroth the queen of heaven of which they were so fond  they choose the worse part and refused the better and they were filled with the fruit of their own devices as every unrepenting sinner surely will be  but did the jews of judea and their king escape who had thus brought the king of assyria down to murder their own countrymen and lay that fair land waste  not they  a very few years more the assyrians were back again and overran judea itself laying the country waste with fire and sword till nothing was left to them but the mere city of jerusalem  and so they too were filled with the fruit of their own devices  in their madness they had destroyed their brethren the people of israel who ought to have been a safeguard for them to the north now there was nothing and no man to prevent the assyrians or any other invaders from pouring right down into their land  truly says solomon he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he who breaketh a hedge a serpent shall bite him  from that day judah became weaker and weaker standing all alone  good king hezekiah good king josiah could only stave off her ruin for a few years a little while longer and her cup was full too and the babylonians came and swept the jews away into captivity as the assyrians had swept away israel and that fair land lay desolate for many a year  the king of assyria we read after he had carried away the people of israel brought heathens from assyria and settled them in the holy land instead of the israelites  but the lord sent lions among them we read the land i suppose lying waste the wild beasts increased and became very dangerous  so these poor ignorant settlers sent to the king of assyria to beg for a jewish priest to teach them as they said the manner of the god of that land that they might worship him and not be terrified by the lions any more it was a simple confused notion of theirs  but it brought a blessing with it for the king of assyria sent them one of the jewish priests who had been carried away from samaria and he came and lived at bethel and taught them to fear the lord  so these poor people got some confused notion of the one true god  but they mixed it up sadly with their old heathen idolatry and made gods of their own and some of them even burnt their children in the fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim from which town they had come  and so they went on for several hundred years marrying with the remnant of the israelites who were left behind and worshipping idols and the true god at the same time  now these people are the samaritans of whom you read so often in the new testament  the jews when they came back hated and despised the samaritans and would not speak to them eat with them trade with them because they were only halfblooded jews and did not observe moses law rightly and so they were left to themselves  but as time went on they seemed to have got rid of their old idolatry and built themselves a temple on mount gerizim by samaria in jacobs old haunts by jacobs well and there worshipped they knew not what  but still they did their best  and their reward came at last  many a hundred years had passed away  the proud pharisees of jerusalem were still calling them dogs and infidels when there came to that halfheathen city of samaria such a one as never came there before or since and yet had been very near that place and those poor samaritans for a thousand years  and being wearied with his journey he sat down upon the edge of jacobs well by josephs tomb  the well is still there choked with rubbish to this very day and josephs tomb by it all in ruins among broad fields of corn  and on the edge of that well he sat  along the very road which was before him jeroboam and ahab and many a wicked king of israel had gone in old times travelling between shechem and samaria  along that road the terrible assyrians had marched back to their own land leading strings of weeping prisoners out of their pleasant native land to slavery and misery in the far north  he knew it all and doubt not that he thought over it all as never man thought on earth  doubt not that his heart yearned over these poor ignorant samaritans and over the sinful woman who came to draw water at the well  after all half heathens as they were jacobs blood was in their veins and if not were they not still human beings  they were worshipping they knew not what  but still they were worshipping the best which they knew  jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father  ye worship ye know not what  we know what we worship  for salvation is of the jews  but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him  god is a spirit  and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth  the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ  when he is come he will tell us all things  jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he    so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days  and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying  for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world  oh my friends despise no man for christ despises none  he is no respecter of persons  but in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted with him  despise no man for by so doing you deny the father who has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the earth and has appointed them their times and the bounds of their habitation if haply they may feel after him and find him  though he be not far from any of us for in him we live and move and have our being and are the offspring of god for hundreds of years those poor ignorant samaritans had felt after him in that foreign land to which the cruel assyrian conqueror had banished them  but it was god who had appointed them their habitation there and their time also and in due time they found god  for he came to them and found them and spoke with them face to face  better to have been one of those ignorant samaritans than to have been king ahab or king hoshea in all their glory with all their proud jewish blood  better to have been one of those ignorant samaritans than one of those conceited pharisees at jerusalem who while they were priding themselves on being abrahams children and keeping moses law ended by crucifying him who made abraham and moses and his law and them themselves  better to be the poorest negro slave if in the midst of his ignorance and misery and shame he believes in christ and works righteousness than the cleverest and proudest and freest englishman if in the midst of his great light he works the works of darkness and while he calls himself a child of god lives the sinful life on which gods curse lies for ever  so you who have many advantages take warning by the fate of those foolish jews who knew a great deal and yet did not do it and so came to shame and ruin  and you who have few advantages take comfort by those poor samaritans who knew a very little and yet made the best of it and so at last saw a great light after sitting in darkness for so long  schools books churchgoing ordinances of all kinds they are good  if you can get them use them and thank god for them  but remember god does not ask for learning but for goodness and holiness  he does not ask for knowledge but for a right life  and do not fancy that because your children have a good education now and you had none that god does not love you as well as he loves them  his mercy is over all his works and the promises are to you as well as to your children  there is many a poor soul who never read a book in her life who is nearer god than many a great scholar and fine preacher and learned divine  all christ asks of you is to receive him when he comes to you and to love and thank and admire him and try to be like him because he will make you like him  while for the rest to whom little is given of him shall little be required and to him who uses what he has be it little or much more shall be given and he shall have abundance for god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted by him    sermon xxvii  the invasion of the assyrians    thirteenth sunday after trinity morning  2 kings xix 1519  and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the lord even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth  lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see  and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living god  of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire  for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone  therefore they have destroyed them  now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only  this noble story which we read in church every year seems to have had a great hold on the minds of the jews  they plainly thought it a very important story  for it is told three times over in the bible  first in the book of kings then in the book of chronicles and again in that of the prophet isaiah  indeed many chapters of isaiahs prophecies speak altogether of this invasion of the assyrians and their destruction  but what has this story to do with us you may ask  there are no miracles in our day  we can expect no angels to fight for our armies  we must fight for ourselves  true my friends  but the lesson of these old stories the moral of them stands good for ever  and i am thankful that this very story is appointed to be read publicly in church once a year to put us in mind of many things which all men are too apt to forget  for instance  to learn one lesson out of many which this chapter may teach us  we are too apt to think that peace and prosperity are the only signs of gods favour  that if a nation be religious it is certain to thrive and be happy  but it is not so  we find from history that the times in which nations have shewn most nobleness most courage most righteousness most faith in god have been times of trouble and danger and terror  when nations have been invaded persecuted trampled under foot by tyrants then all the good which was in them has again and again shewed itself  then to the astonishment of the world they have become greater than themselves and done deeds which win them glory for ever  then they are truly purged in the fire of affliction that whatever dross and trash is in their hearts may be burnt out and the pure gold left  so it was with the jews in hezekiahs time  so again in the time of the maccabees  so with the old greeks when the great kings of persia tried to enslave them  so with the old romans when the carthaginians set upon them  so it was with us english three hundred years ago when for a time the whole world seemed against us because we alone were standing up for the gospel and the bible against the pope of rome  then the king of spain who was then as terrible a conqueror and devourer of nations as the assyrians of old sent against us the great armada  then was england in greater danger than she had ever been before or has been since  and what came of it  that that dreadful danger brought out more faith more courage than perhaps has ever been among us since that when we seemed weakest we were strongest  that while all the nations of europe were looking on to see us devoured up by those spaniards our laws and liberties taken from us the popish inquisition set up in england and england made a spanish province what they did see was the people of this little island rising as one man to fight for themselves on earth while the tempests of god fought for them from heaven and all that mighty fleet of the king of spain routed and scattered till not one man in a hundred ever saw their native country again  and in england after that terrible trial had passed over us there rose up the best and noblest time which she had ever yet beheld  yes my friends three hundred years ago we went through just such a fiery trial as the jews went through in hezekiahs time and god grant that we may never forget that lesson  but what is true of whole nations is often true also of each single person of you and me  to almost every man at least once in his life comes a time of trialwhat we call a crisis  a time when god purges the man and tries him in the fire and burns up the dross in him that the pure sterling gold only may be left  to some people it comes in the shape of some terrible loss or affliction  to others it comes in the shape of some great temptation  nay if we will consider it comes to us all perhaps often in that shape  a man is brought to a point where he must choose between right and wrong  god puts him where the two roads part  one way turns off to the broad road which leads to destruction  the other way turns off to the narrow road which leads to life  the man would be glad to go both ways at once and do right and wrong too  but it so happens that he cannot  then he would be glad to go neither way and stay where he is  but he cannot  he must move on  he must do something  perhaps he is asked a question which he does not wish to answer  but he must  it would be well worth his while to tell a lie  it would be very safe for him profitable for him while it would be very dangerous for him to tell the truth  he might ruin himself once and for all by being an honest man  now which shall he do  he would be glad to do both glad to do neither  but choose he must speak he must  he must either lie or tell the truth  then comes the trial whether he believes in god and in christ or whether he does not  if he only believes as too many do without knowing it in a dead god a god far away he will lie  if he only believes as too many do without knowing it in a dead christ a christ who bore his sins on the cross eighteen hundred years ago but since then has had nothing to do with him to speak of as far as he knowsthen he will lie  and that is the god and the christ which most people believe in  and therefore when the time of trial comes they fall away and do and say things of which they ought to be ashamed because their trust is not in god but in man  but if that man believes in the living god and believes that he lives and moves and has his being in god he cannot lie  as it is written he that is born of god sinneth not for his seed remaineth in him and that wicked one toucheth him not  he will say whatever happens i must obey god and not man  the lord is on my side therefore i will not fear what man can do to me  and what is the seed which remains in that man and keeps him from playing the coward  christ himself the seed and son of god  if he believes in the living christ if he believes that christ is really his master his teacher who is watching over him training him from his cradle to his graveif he believes that christ is dwelling in him that whatever wish to do right he has comes from christ whatever sense of honour and honesty he has comes from christ then it will seem to him a dreadful thing to lie to play the hypocrite or the coward to sin against his own better feelings  it will be sinning against christ himself  remember the great martin luther when he stood on one side a poor monk standing up for the bible and the gospel and against him were arrayed the pope and the emperor cardinals bishops and almost all the princes in europe and his friends wanted him to hold his tongue or to say yes and no at once in short to smooth over the matter in some waywhat conceit said many of one poor monk standing up against all the world and what folly too  he would certainly be burnt alive  but luther could not hold his tongue  he was afraid enough no doubt  he disliked being burnt as much as other men  but he felt he must speak gods truth then or never  he must bear witness for christs free gospel against pope emperor all the devils in hell if need be or else hereafter for ever hold his peace  he must play the honest man that day or be a hypocrite and a rogue for ever  his friends said to him if you go to the council duke george will have you burnt  he answered if it snowed duke georges nine days together i must go  they said if you go into that town you will never leave it alive  he said if there were as many devils in the town as there are tiles on the houses i must go  and he went bible in hand and said here i stand i can do no otherwise  god help me  he went and he conquered  and so it will be with you my friends if you will believe in the living god and in the living christ then when temptation comes you will be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand  and you will feel yourselves better men from that day forward  you will feel that you have made one great step upward you will look back upon that time of temptation and perplexity as the beginning of a new life as a sign to you that christ is with you and in you training you and shaping your character till he makes you at last somewhat like himself somewhat of the stature of a true man somewhat like what he has bidden you to be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect    sermon xxviii  the ten lepers    fourteenth sunday after trinity  luke xvii 17 18  were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine  there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger  no men one would have thought had more reason to thank god than those nine lepers  afflicted with a filthy and tormenting disease hopelessly incurable at least in those days they were cut off from family and friends cut off from all mankind forced to leave their homes and wander away forbidden to enter the houses of men or the churches of god forbidden for fear of infection to go near any human being keeping no company but that of wretched lepers like themselves and forced to get their living by begging by standing as the gospel says afar off and praying the passersby to throw them a coin  in this wretched state in which they had been certain of living and dying miserably they met the lord  and suddenly instantly beyond all hope or expectation they found themselves cured restored to their families their homes their power of working their rights as citizens restored to all that makes life worth having and that freely and in a moment  if such a blessing had come to us should we have thought any thanks too great  would not our whole lives have been too short to bless god for his great mercy  should we have gone away like those nine without a word of thanks to god or even to the man who had healed us  what stupidity hardhearted ness ingratitude of those nine never to have even thanked the lord for their restoration to health and happiness  ay so we think  yet those nine lepers were men of like passions with ourselves and what they did we perhaps might do in their place  it is very humbling to think so  but the bible is a humbling book  and therefore a wholesome book profitable for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness  and i am very much afraid that when the bible tells us that nine out of ten of those lepers were ungrateful to god it tells us that nine out of ten of us are ungrateful likewise  ungrateful to god  i fear so and more ungrateful i fear than those ten lepers  for which of the two is better off the man who loses a good thing and then gets it back again or the man who never loses it at all but enjoys it all his life  surely the man who never loses it at all  and which of the two has more cause to thank god  those lepers had been through a very miserable time they had had great affliction and that they might feel was a set off against their good fortune in recovering their health  they had bad years to balance their good ones  but wehow many of us have had nothing but good years  oh consider consider the history of the average of us  how we grow up tolerably healthy tolerably comfortable in a free country under just laws with the power of earning our livelihood and the certainty of keeping what we earn famine we know nothing of in this happy land war and the horrors of war we knew nothing ofgod grant we never may  in health safety and prosperity most of us grow up forced it is true to work hard  but that too is a blessing for what better thing for a man soul and body than to be forced to work hard  in health safety and prosperity leaving children behind us to prosper as we have done  and how many of us give god the glory or christ the thanks  but if these be our bodily blessings what are our spiritual blessings  has not god given us his onlybegotten son jesus christ has he not baptised us into his church  has he not forgiven our sins  has he not revealed to us that he is our father and we his children  has he not given us the absolutely inestimable blessing of his commandments  of knowing what the right thing to be done is that we may do it and live for ever that treasure of which not only solomon but the wise men of old held that to know what was right was a more precious possession than rubies and fine gold and all the wealth of ind  has he not given us the hope of a joyful immortality of everlasting life after death not only with those whom we have loved and lost but with god himself  and how many of us give god the glory and christ the thanks  do we not copy those nine lepers and just shew ourselves to the priest come to church on the sunday because it is the custom people expect it of us and god we understand expects it too  but where is the gratitude  where is the giving of glory to god for all his goodness  which are we most like  children of god looking up to our father in heaven and saying at every fresh blessing father i thank thee  truly thou knowest my necessities before i ask and my ignorance in askingor like the stalled ox which eats and eats and eats and never thanks the hand which feeds him  we are too comfortable i think at times  we are so much accustomed to be blest by god that we take his blessings as matters of course and feel them no more than we do the air we breathe  the wise man says   our torments may by length of time become our elements   and i am sure our blessings may  they say that people who endure continual pain and misery get at length hardly to feel it  and so on the other hand people who have continual prosperity get at length hardly to feel that  god forgive us  my friends when i say this to you i say it to myself  if i blame you i blame myself if i warn you i warn myself  we most of us need warning in these comfortable times for i believe that it is this very unrighteousness of ours which brings many of our losses and troubles on us  if we are so dull that we will not know the value of a thing when we have got it then god teaches us the value of it by taking it from us  he teaches us the value of health by making us feel sickness he teaches us the value of wealth by making us feel poverty  i do not say it is always so  god forbid  there are those who suffer bitter afflictions not because they have sinned but that like the poor blind man the glory of god may be made manifest in them  there are those too who suffer no sorrow at all even though they feel in their thoughtful moments that they deserve it  and miserable enough should we all be if god punished us every time we were ungrateful to him  if he dealt with us after our sins and rewarded us according to our iniquities where should we be this day  but still i cannot but believe that if we do go on in prosperity careless and unthankful we are running into danger we are likely to bring down on ourselves some sorrow or anxiety which will teach us which at least is meant to teach usfrom whom all good things come and to know that the lord has given when the lord has taken away  god grant that when that lesson is sent to us we may learn it learn it perhaps at once and in a moment we cannot  weak flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of god and see that he is ruling us and all things in love and justice and our eyes are as it were dimmed with our tears so that we cannot see gods handwriting upon the wall against us  but at length when the first burst of sorrow is past we may learn it and like righteous job justify god sayingthe lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord  if we do that and give god the glory it may be with us after all as it was with job when god gave him back sevenfold for all that he had taken away wealth and prosperity sons and daughters  for god doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men out of spite  his punishments are not revenge but correction and as a father he chastises his children not to harm but to bless them  and god grant that if that day too comesif after sorrow comes joy if after storm comes sunshinewe may not forget god afresh in our prosperity nor go our ways like those dullhearted jews after they were cleansed from their leprosy  but like the samaritan return and give glory to god who gives and delights in giving and only takes away that he may lift up our souls to him in whom we live and move and have our being  and so knowing who we are and where we are may live in god and by god and for god in this life and for ever    sermon xxix  pardon and peace    twentyfirst sunday after trinity  psalm xxxii 17  blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered  blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile  when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long  for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me  my moisture is turned into the drought of summer  i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid  i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin  for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found  surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him  thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance  the collect for today is a very beautiful one  there is something musical in the sound of the very words so musical that it is sung as an anthem in many churches  let us think a little over it grant we beseech thee merciful lord to thy faithful people pardon and peace that they may be cleansed from all their sins and serve thee with a quiet mind through jesus christ our lord  amen that is a noble prayer and a prayer for each and every one of us every day  i say for every day  it is not like the fiftyfirst psalm the prayer of a man who has committed some black and dreadful crime who fears lest god should take his holy spirit from him and leave him to remorse and horror who feels that he needs to be utterly changed and have a new heart created within him  it is not a prayer of that kind  it is rather the prayer of a man who is weary with the burden of sinful mortality who finds it very hard work to do his duty even tolerably well who is dissatisfied with himself and ashamed of himself not about one great fault but about many little faults and who wants to be cleansed from them who is tempted to be fretful anxious out of heart because things go wrong and because he feels it partly his own fault that things go wrong and who therefore wants peace that he may serve god with a quiet mind  now then dear friends did i not speak truth when i said this is a prayer for every one of us and for every day  for which of us does his duty as he ought  i take for granted we are all trying to do our duty better or worse  but i take for granted too that the more we try to do our duty the more dissatisfied with ourselves we are and the more we find we have sins without number to be cleansed from  for the more we try to do our duty the higher notion we get of what our duty is the more we do the more we feel we ought to do and the more we feel that we leave undone a great many things which we ought to do and do a great many things which we ought not to do and that there is no health in us  but a great deal of disease and weaknessdisease of soul in the way of conceit pride selfishness temper obstinacy weakness in the way of laziness fearfulness and very often of sheer stupidity we do not see or rather will not take the trouble to see what we ought to do and how to do it  and therefore we must be or rather ought to be dissatisfied with ourselves and our consciences accuse us when we lie down at night of a hundred petty miserable mistakes which we ought to have avoided  we are continually knowing what is right and doing what is wrong till we get deservedly angry with ourselves and think at times that god must be deservedly angry with us that we are such poor paltry creatures that he can only look on us with dislike and contempt and even worse that perhaps he does not care to see us mend that our struggles to do right are of no value in his eyes  but that he has sternly left us to ourselves to struggle through life right or wrong as best we may and to be punished at last for all that we have done amiss  such thoughts will cross our minds  they have crossed the minds of all mankind since the first mans conscience awoke and he discovered that he was not a brute animal by finding in himself that awful thought which no brute animal can havei have done wrong  and therefore the consciences of men will cry for pardon just in proportion as they are worthy of the name of men and not merely a superior sort of animals and therefore just in proportion as our souls are alive in us alive with the feeling of duty of justice of purity of love of a just and orderly god abovejust in that proportion shall we be tormented by the difference between what we are and what we ought to be and the sense of sin and the longing for pardon will be more keen in us and we shall have no rest till the sins are got rid of and the pardon sure  that is the price we pay for having immortal souls  it is a heavy price truly but it is well worth the paying if it be only paid aright  if that tormenting feeling of being continually wrong in this life ends by making us continually right for ever in the world to come if christ be formed in us at last if out of our sinful and mortal manhood a sinless and immortal manhood is bornthen shall we like the mother over her newborn babe forget our anguish for joy that a man is born into the world  but again besides pardon we want peace  who does not know that state of mind in which perhaps without any great reason in reality one has no peace  when everything seems to go wrong with a man  when he suspects everybody to be against him  when little troubles which he could bear easily enough at other times seem quite intolerable to him  when he is troubled with vain regrets about the pastah if i had done this and that and vain fears for the future conjuring up in his mind all sorts of bad luck which may but most probably never will happen and yet from off which he cannot turn his mind  who does not know this frame of mind  true a great deal of this may depend on illhealth and will pass away as the mans bodily condition gets better  we know in the same way that the strange anxiety which comes over us in sleepless nights comes from bodily causes  that is merely because the circulation of our blood being quickened our brain becomes more active and because we are lying alone in the silent darkness with nothing to listen to or look at we cannot turn our attention away from the thoughts which get possession of us and torment us  that is only bodily and yet it may be very useful to our souls  as we lie awake our own past lives our own past mistakes and sins and gods past blessings and mercies too may rise up before us with clearness and teach us more than a hundred sermons and we may find with david that our reins chasten us in the nightseason when i am in heaviness i will think upon god when my heart is vexed i will complain  thou holdest mine eyes waking    i have considered the days of old and the years that are past  i call to remembrance my song and in the night i commune with my own heart and search out my spirits  will the lord absent himself for ever and will he be no more intreated  is his mercy clean gone for ever and is his promise come utterly to an end for evermore  hath god forgotten to be gracious  and will he shut up his lovingkindness in displeasure  and i said it is mine own infirmity  but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most highest  these sleepless hours taught the psalmist somewhat and they may teach us likewise  and so again with these sad and fretful frames of mind even if they do partly come from our bodies they have a real effect which cannot be mistaken on our souls and they may have a good effect on us if we choose  i believe that we shall find that even if they do come from ill health and weak nerves what starts them isthat we are dissatisfied with ourselves  we feel something wrong not merely in our bodies but in our souls our characters and then we try to lay the blame on the world around us and shift it off ourselves saying in our hearts i should do very well if other people and things about me would only let me but the more we try to shift off the blame the less peace we have  nothing mends matters less than throwing the blame on others  that is plain  other people we cannot mend they must mend themselves circumstances about us we cannot mend god must mend them  so as long as we throw the blame on them we cannot return to a cheerful and hopeful frame of mind  but the moment we throw the blame on ourselves that moment we can have hope that moment we can become cheerful again for whatsoever else we cannot mend we can at least mend ourselves  now a man may forget this in health  he may be put out and unhappy for a while  but when his good spirits return he does not know why  things have not improved but somehow they do not affect him as they did before  now this is not wrong  god forbid  in such a world as this one is glad to see a man rid of sadness by any means which is not wrong  better anything than that a poor soul should fret himself to death  but it may be very good for a man now and then not to forget to be kept low whether by ill health or by any other cause till he faces fairly his own state and finds out honestly what does fret him and torment him  and then i believe his experience will generally be like davids as long as i kept silence my bones waxed old through my groaning all the day long  think over these words i beg you  i chose them for my text just because they seem to me to contain all that i wish you to understand  as long as the psalmist held his peaceas long as he did not confess his sin to godall seemed to go wrong with him  he fretted his very heart away  the moment that he made a clean breast to god peace and cheerfulness came back to him  this psalm may speak of some really great sin which he had committed  but that makes all the more strongly for us  for if he got forgiveness for a great sin by merely confessing it how much more may we hope to be forgiven for the comparatively little sins of which i am now speaking  surely there is forgiveness for them surely we christians are not worse off than the old jews  god forbid  what does the bible tell us  if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us  and again if we walk in the light that is if we look honestly at our own hearts and confess honestly to god what we see wrong there then we have fellowship one with another all our frettings and grudgings against our fellowmen pass away and the blood of jesus christ cleanseth us from all sin god forbid again  for what is the message of the absolution whether general in the church or private by the sickbed but this that there is continual forgiveness for those who really confess and repent  god forbid again  for what is the message of the holy communion but that we really are forgiven really helped by god not to do the like again that the stains and scars of our daily misdoings are truly healed by gods grace and power given us to lead a healthier life the longer we persevere in the struggle after god  therefore instead of proudly laying the blame of our unhappiness on our fellowmen much less on god and his providence let us cast ourselves in every hour of shame or of sadness on the boundless love of him who hateth nothing that he hath made who so loved the world that he spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all  how shall he not with him freely give us all things  let us open our weary hearts to him who watches with tender interest as of a father watching the growth of his child over every struggle of ours from worse to better and so we shall have our reward  the more we trust to the love of god the more shall we feel his love feel that we are pardonedfeel that we are at peace  we may not grow more cheerful as we grow older but we shall grow more peaceful  sadder men it may be but wiser men also caring less and less for pleasure caring even less and less for mere happiness but finding a lasting comfort in the knowledge that we are doing our lifes work not altogether ill under the smile of almighty god aware more and more of our own weakness and of our own failings but trusting that god will take the will for the deed and forgive us what we have left undone and accept what we have done for the sake of christ in whom and not in our own poor paltry selves he looks upon us as his adopted children  only let us remember to ask for pardon and to ask for peace that we may use them as the collect bids usto ask for pardon not merely that we may escape punishment not even to escape punishment at all if punishment be wholesome for us as it often is  but that we may be cleansed from our sins that we may not be left to our own weakness and our own bad habits to grow more and more useless more and more unhappy day by day but that we may be cleansed from them and grow purer nobler juster stronger more worthy of our place in gods kingdom as our years roll by  let us remember to ask for peace not merely to get rid of unpleasant thoughts or unpleasant people or unpleasant circumstances and then sit down and say soul take thine ease eat and drink for thou hast much goods laid up for many years  but let us ask for peace that we may serve god with a quiet mind that we may get rid of the impatient cowardly discontented hopeless heart which will not let a man go about his business like a man and get instead of it by the inspiration of gods holy spirit the calm contented brave hopeful heart in the strength of which a man can work with a will wherever god may put him even amidst vexation confusion disappointment slander and persecution and in his place and calling serve the lord who served him when he died for him and who serves him and all his people now and for ever in heaven  so shall we have real pardon and real peace  a pardon which will make us really better and a peace which will make us really more useful  and to be good and to be useful were the two ends for which god sent us into the world at all    sermon xxx  the central sun    sunday after ascension evening  ephesians iv 9 10  now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth  he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things  this is one of those very deep texts which we are not meant to think about every day only at such seasons as this when we have to think of christ ascending into heaven that he might send down his spirit at whitsuntide  of this the text speaks and therefore we may i hope think a little of it today but reverently and cautiously like men who know a very little and are afraid of saying more than they know  these deep mysteries about heaven we must always meddle with very humbly lest we get out of our depth in haste and self conceit  as it is said   fools rush in where angels fear to tread   for if we are not very careful we shall be apt to mistake the meaning of scripture and make it say what we like and twist it to suit our own fancies and our own ignorance  therefore we must never with texts like this say positively it must mean this  it can mean only this  how can we tell that  this world which we do see is far too wonderful for us to understand  how much more wonderful must be the world which we do not see  how much more wonderful must heaven be  how can we tell what is there or what is not there  we can tell of some things that are not there and those are sin evil disorder harm of any kind  heaven is utterly good  beyond that we know nothing therefore i dare not be positive about this text for fear i should try to explain it according to my own fancies  wise fathers and divines have differed very much as to what it means how far any one of them is right i cannot tell you  the ancient way of explaining this text was this  people believed in old times that the earth was flat  then they held hell was below the earth or inside it in some way  and the burning mountains out of which came fire and smoke were the mouths of hell  and when they believed that it was easy for them to suppose that st paul spoke of christs descending into hell  he went down says st paul into the lower parts of the earth  what could those lower parts be they asked but the hell which lay under the earth  now about that we know nothing  st paul himself never says that hell is below the earth  indeed and this is a very noteworthy thing st paul never in his epistles mentions in plain words hell at all so what st paul thought about the matter we can never know  whether by christs descending into the lower parts of the earth he meant descending into hell or merely that our lord came down on this earth of ours poor humble and despised laying his glory by for a while this we cannot tell  some wise men think one thing some another  two of the wisest and best of the great old fathers of the church think that he meant only christs death and burial  so how dare i give a positive opinion where wiser men than i differ  but about the other half of the text which says that he ascended high above all heavens there is no such difficulty  all agree as to what that means  though perhaps in old times they would have put it in different words  the old belief was that as hell was below the flat earth so heaven was above it and that there were many heavens seven heavens in layers as it were one above the other and that the seventh heaven which was the highest of all was where god dwelt  now whether st paul believed this we cannot tell  he speaks of being himself caught up into the third heaven and here christ is spoken of as ascending above all heavens  my own belief though i say it very humbly is that st paul spoke of these things only as a figure of speech for the sake of the ignorance of the people to whom he was writing  they talked in that way and he was forced now and then to talk in that way too to make them understand him  i think that when he spoke of being caught up into the third heaven he did not mean that he was lifted bodily off the earth into the skies  but that his soul was raised up and enlightened to understand high and wonderful heavenly matters though not the highest or most wonderful  if he had meant that he would have said that he was caught up into the seventh heaven  we know that our lord in the same way continually used parables because as he said the ignorant people could not understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and he had therefore to put them into parables taken from the common country matters and country forms of speech if by any means he might make them understand  and so i suppose it was with st paul  he had to speak in such a way that he could be understood and no more  but when he says that christ ascended far above all heavens we are to believe thisthat he ascended to god himself  so high that he could go no higher so far that he could go no farther  we now do not believe that there are seven heavens above the earth and we need not  it is no doctrine of the church or of the creeds  we know that the earth is round and not flat and that the heavens if by that we mean the sky is neither above it nor below it but round it on every side  but some may say whither then did our lord ascend  to what place did his body go up  and that is a right question for we must always bear in mind that not merely christs godhead but his manhood not merely christs soul but his body also ascended into heaven  if we do not believe that we do not hold the catholic faith  whither then did christ ascend  my friends we know this  that this earth and the planets move round the sun which is in the centre of them  we know this too that all the countless stars which spangle the sky are really suns likewise perhaps with worlds which we cannot see moving round them as we move round the sun  we know too that these fixed stars as they seem to be are not really fixed but have some regular movements among themselves which seem very slow and small to us from their immense distance but which really are very great and fast  now all these suns and stars it is reasonable to believe most probably have a centre  there must be order among them and they most probably move round one thing one place one central sun as it were which is the very heart of all the worlds and the whole universe  where that place is or what it is like we know not and cannot know  only this we may believe that it is glorious beyond all that eye hath seen and ear heard or hath entered into the heart of man to conceive  if this world be beautiful how beautiful must that world of all worlds be  if the sun be glorious how glorious must the sun of all suns be  if the heaven over us be grand how grand must that heaven of heavens be  we will not talk of it for we cannot imagine it  and if we tried to we should only lower it to our own low fancies  but is it not reasonable to suppose that there god the father does perhaps in some unspeakable way shew forth his glory  that there in the heart of all the worlds cherubim and seraphim continually adore him crying day and night holy holy holy lord god of sabaoth  heaven and earth are full of the majesty of thy glory before his throne from which goes forth light and power and life to all worlds and all created things  and is it not reasonable to believe that there christ is in the bosom of the father and at the right hand of god  we know that those too are only figures  that god is a spirit everywhere and nowhere and has not hands as we have  but it is only by such figures that the bible can make us understand the truth that christ is the highest being in all heavens and worlds equal with god the father and sharer of his kingdom and power and glory god blessed for ever  amen  what then does st paul mean when he says that he may fill all things  i do not know  and i will take care not to lessen and spoil st pauls words by any ignorant words of my own  but one thing i know it will mean one day for st paul says so  that christ reigns and will reign triumphant over sin and death and hell till he have put all enemies under his feet and the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death  then shall he deliver up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all what that means i do not know  but this i can say and you can say we can pray that god will finish the number of his elect and hasten his kingdom that we with all that are departed in the true faith may have our perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul in his eternal kingdom  and this i can say that it means now for you and me for whitsuntide tells methat whatever else christ can or cannot fill he can at least fill our hearts because he is in the bosom of the father himself and therefore from him as from the father proceeds the holy spirit the lord and giver of life  that spirit will proceed even to us if we will have him  he will fill our hearts with himself with the spirit of goodness which proceeds out of the heaven of heavens and out of the bosom of god himself with love peace longsuffering gentleness goodness with truth honour duty earnestness and all that is the likeness of christ and of god  oh let us pray for that spirit the spirit of truth which christ promised us when he ascended up into the heaven of heavens to keep us sound in our most holy faith and the spirit of goodness to give us strength to live the good lives of good christian men  and then it will matter little what opinions we hold about deep things which the wisest man can never put into words  and it will matter little whether what i have been telling you today about the heaven of heavens be exactly true or not for what says st paul of such deep matters  that we know in part and prophesy in part and that prophecies shall fail and knowledge vanish away  but charity love and right feeling and right doing which is the very holy spirit of god shall abide for ever  and if that spirit be with us he will guide us in due time into all truth teach us all we need to know and enable us to practise all we ought to do  amen    sermon xxxi  christmas peace    sunday before christmas  phil iv 4  rejoice in the lord alway  and again i say rejoice  this is a glorious text and one fit to be the keynote of christmasday  if we will take it to heart it will tell us how to keep christmasday  st paul has been speaking of two good women who seem to have had some difference and he beseeches them to make up their difference and be of the same mind in the lord  and then he goes on to tell them and all christian people why they should make up their differences  and for that reason i suppose the church has chosen it for the epistle before christmasday on which all men are to make friends with each other and rejoice in the lord  let your moderation he says be known to all men  the greek word signifies forbearance reasonable dealing consideration for one another readiness to give way not standing too severely on ones own rights  now this is just the temper in which we ought to meet our friends at christmas forbearance  they may not have always behaved well to us  be it so  no more have we to them  let us once in the year at least forget old grudges  let us do as we would be done by give and forgive live and let live bury our past quarrels and shake hands over their graves  for the lord is at hand  close to all of us  watching all we do and setting the right value on it  he cannot mistake  he sees both sides of a matter and all sidesa thousand sides which we cannot see  he can judge better than we  let him judge  why do i say let him judge  he has judged already weeks months ago as soon as each quarrel happened  and perhaps he found us in the wrong as well as our neighbours and if so the least said the soonest mended  let us forgive and forget lest we be neither forgotten nor forgiven  and because the lord is at hand be anxious about nothing  the word here is the same as in the sermon on the mount  it means do not fret do not terrify yourselves for the lord is at hand he knows what you want  and will he not give it  is not christmasday a sign that he will give ita pledge of his love  what did he do on the first christmasday  what did he shew himself to be on the first christmasday  now here is the root of the whole matter and a deep root it is as deep as the beginning of all things which are or ever were or ever will be  and yet if we will believe our bibles it is a root which we all may find  what did the angels say the first christmas night  peace on earth and goodwill to men that is what god proclaimed  that is what he said that he had and would give  now says the apostle if you will believe the latter half of this same christmas message then the first half of it will come true to you  if you will believe that gods will is a good will to you then you will have peace on earth  for believe in christmasday believe that the lord is at hand that he has been made man for ever and ever and that to the man christ jesus all power is given in heaven and earth  and then if you want aught instead of grudging or grinding your neighbours ask him  in everything let your requests be made known unto god  and then the peace of god will keep your hearts through christ jesus  you will feel at peace with god through christ jesus because you have found out that god is at peace with you that god is not against you but for you that god does not hate you but love you and if god is at peace with you what cause have you to be at war with him  and so the message of christmasday will bring you peace  you will be at peace with your neighbours through christ jesus when you see god stooping to make peace with sinful men you will be ashamed to be quarrelling with them  when you see god full of love you will be ashamed to keep up peevishness grudging and spite when you see gods heaven full of light you will be ashamed to be dark yourselves your hearts will go out freely to your fellow creatures you will long to be friends with every one you meet and you will find in that the highest pleasure which you ever felt in life  but mind one thingwhat sort of a peace this peace of god is  it passes all understanding the very loftiest understanding the cleverest and most learned men that ever lived could not have found itwe know they did not find itby their own cleverness and learning  no more will you find gods peace if you seek for it with your understanding  thinking will not bring you peace think as shrewdly as you may  reading will not bring it read as deeply as you may  some people think otherwise that they can get the peace of god by understanding  if they could but understand more their minds would be at rest  so they weary themselves with reading and thinking and arguing perhaps trying to understand predestination election assurance perhaps trying to understand which is the true church  what do they get thereby  certainly not the peace of god  they certainly do not set their minds at rest they cannot  books cannot give a live soul rest  understanding cannot  nothing can give you or me rest save god himself  the peace is gods and he must give it himself with his own hand or we shall never get it  go then to god himself  thou art his child as christmasday declares  be not afraid to go unto thy father pray to him tell him what thou wantest  say father i am not moderate reasonable forbearing  i fear i cannot keep christmas day aright for i have not a peaceful christmas spirit in me and i know that i shall never get it by thinking and reading and understanding for it passes all that and lies far away beyond it does peace in the very essence of thine undivided unmoved absolute eternal godhead which no change nor decay of this created world nor sin or folly of men or devils can ever alter but which abideth for ever what it is in perfect rest and perfect power and perfect love  o father give me thy peace  soothe this restless greedy fretful soul of mine as a mother soothes a sick and feverish child  how thou wilt do it i do not know  it passes all understanding  but though the sick child cannot reach the mother the mother is at hand and can reach it  though the eagle by flying cannot reach the sun yet the sun is at hand and can reach all the earth and pour its light and warmth over all things  and thou art more than a mother  thou art the everlasting father  pour thy love over me that i may love as thou lovest  thou art more than the sun  thou art the light and the life of all things  pour thy light and thy life over me that i may see as thou seest and live as thou livest and be at peace with myself and all the world as thou art at peace with thyself and all the world  again i say i know not how for it passes all understanding  but i hope that thou wilt do it for me  i trust that thou wilt do it for me for i believe the good news of christmasday  i believe that thou art love and that thy mercy is over all thy works  i believe the message of christmasday  that thou so lovest the world that thou hast sent thy son to save the world and me  i know not how for that too passes understanding  but i believe that thou wilt do it for i believe that thou art love and that thy mercy is over all thy works even over me  i believe the message of christmasday that thy will is peace on earth even peace to me restless and unquiet as i am and goodwill to men even to me the chief of sinners    sermon xxxii  the life of the spirit    first sunday after christmas  isaiah xxxviii 16  o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit  these words are the words of hezekiah king of judah and they are true words words from god  but if they are true words they are true words for every onefor you and me for every one here in this church this day  for they do not say by these things certain men live one man here and another man there but all men  whosoever is really alive that is has life in his spirit his soul his heart the life of a man and not a beast the only life which is worthy to be called life then that life is kept up in him in the same way that it was kept up in hezekiah and by the same means  let us see then what things they were which gave hezekiahs spirit life  great joy great honour great success wealth health prosperity and pleasure  was it by these things that hezekiah found men lived  not so but by great sorrow  in those days was hezekiah sick unto death  and isaiah the prophet the son of amos came unto him and said thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shall die and not live  then hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the lord and hezekiah wept sore  trouble upon trouble came on hezekiah and that just when he might have expected a little rest  the lord had just delivered hezekiah and the jews from a fearful danger of which we read in the chapter before  hezekiah had believed gods promise by the mouth of isaiah he held fast his faith in god when sennacherib and his assyrian army were camping round jerusalem for god had said i will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant davids sake he defended his city bravely and nobly and showed himself a true and valiant and godly king  and perhaps hezekiah expected to be rewarded for his faith and rewarded for having done his duty  but it was not so  he had to wait and to endure more  and now this fresh trouble was come upon him  isaiah told him he should die and not live  and he must prepare himself to meet death  hezekiah you see was horribly afraid of death  i do not mean that he was afraid of going to hell for he does not say so  but he felt to use his own words the grave cannot praise thee death cannot celebrate thee  they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth  and therefore death looked to him an ugly and an evil thingas it is the lords enemy and his last enemy the one with which he will have the longest and sorest fight  he conquered death by rising from the dead  but nevertheless we die and death is an ugly fearful hateful thing in itself and rightly called the king of terrors  for terrible it is to those who do not know that christ has conquered it  hezekiah lived before the lord jesus came into the flesh to bring life and immortality to light by rising from the dead and therefore the life after death was not brought to light to him any more than it was to david or any other old testament jew  he dreaded it because he knew not what would come after death  and therefore he prayed hard not to die  he did not pray altogether in a right way  but still he prayed  remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which was good in thy sight  and the lord heard his prayer  then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years  then what was the use of gods warning to him  what was the use of his sickness and his terror if after all his prayer was heard and after the lord had told him thou shall die and not livethat did not come to pass  but the very contrary happened that he lived and did not die  of what use to him was it  of this use at least that it taught him that the lord god would hear the prayers of mortal men  oh my friends is not that worth knowing  is not that worth going through any misery to learnthat the lord will hear us  that he is not a cold arbitrary tyrant who goes his own way never caring for our cries and tears too proud to turn out of his way to hear us  but that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy and repenting him of the evil  hezekiah did not pray rightly  he thought himself a better man than he was  he said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight  and hezekiah wept sore  but he did pray  he went to god and told his story to him and wept sore and the lord god heard him and taught him that he was not as good as he fancied taught him that after all he had nothing to say for himselfno reason to shew why he should not die what shall i say  he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it  i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul  and so he felt that instead of justifying himself he must throw himself utterly on gods love and mercy that god must undertake for him  o lord i am oppressed crushedthe heart is beaten out of me  i have nothing to say for myself  undertake for me  i have nothing to say for myself but i have plenty to say of thee  thou art good and just  thou wilt not leave my soul in hell i can say no more  and then he found that the lord was ready to save him  that what the lord wished was not to kill him but to recover him and make him livelive more really and fully and wisely and manfullyby making him trust more utterly in gods goodness and love and mercy making him more certain that good as he thought himself and perfect in heart he was full of sins  and yet that the lord had cast all these sins of his behind his back forgotten and forgiven them as soon as he had made him see that all that was good and strong in him came from god and all that was evil and weak from himself  and then he says o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit  god meant all along to receive me and make me live  he chastened me and brought me low to shew me that my own faith my own righteousness was no reason for his saving me  but that his own love and mercy was a good reason for saving me  behold he goes on to say for peace i had great bitterness  but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption  for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back  and my dear friends what hezekiah saw but dimly we ought to see clearly  the blessed news of the gospel ought to tell us it clearly  for the blessed gospel tells us that the same lord who chastened and taught and then saved hezekiah was made flesh and born a man of the substance of a mortal woman that he might in his own person bear all our sicknesses and carry our infirmities that he might understand all our temptations and be touched with the feeling of our infirmities seeing that he himself was tempted in all points likewise yet without sin  oh hear this you who have had sorrows in past times  hear this you who expect sorrows in the times to come  he who made he who lightens every man who comes into the world he who gave you every right thought and wholesome feeling that you ever had in your lives  he counts your tears he knows your sorrows he is able and willing to save you to the uttermost  therefore do not be afraid of your own afflictions  face them like men  think over them  ask him to help you out of them  or if that is not to be at least to tell you what he means by them  be sure that what he must mean by them is good to you  a lesson to you that in some way or other they are meant to make you wiser stronger hardier more sure of gods love more ready to do gods work whithersoever it may lead you  do not be afraid of the dark day of affliction i say it may teach you more than the bright prosperous one  many a man can see clearly in the cloudy day who would be dazzled in the sunlight  the dull weather they say is the best weather for battle and sorrow is the best time for seeing through and conquering ones own self  therefore do not be afraid i say of sorrow  all the clouds in the sky cannot move the sun a foot further off and all the sorrow in the world cannot move god any further off  god is there still where he always was near you and below you and above you and around you for in him you live and move and have your being and are the offspring and children of god nay he is nearer you if possible in sorrow than in joy  he is informing you and guiding you with his eye and like a father teaching you the right way which you should go  he is searching and purging your hearts and cleansing you from your secret faults and teaching you to know who you are and to know who he isyour father the knowledge of whom is life eternal  by these things my friends by being brought low and made helpless till ashamed of ourselves and weary of ourselves we lift up eyes and heart to god who made us like lost children crying after a fatherby these things i say we live and in all these things is the life of our spirit    sermon xxxiii  the unchangeable one    psalm cxix 8996  for ever o lord thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations  thou hast established the earth and it abideth  they continue this day according to thine ordinances  for all are thy servants  unless thy law had been my delight i should then have perished in mine affliction  i will never forget thy precepts  for with them thou hast quickened me  i am thine save me for i have sought thy precepts  the wicked have waited for me to destroy me  but i will consider thy testimonies i have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandment is exceeding broad  the psalmist is in great trouble  he does not know whom to trust what to expect next whom to look to  everything seems failing and changing round him  his psalm was most probably written during the babylonish captivity at a time when all the countries and kingdoms of the east were being destroyed by the chaldean armies  then he says be it so  if everything else changes god cannot if everything else fails gods plans cannot  he can rest on the thought of god of his goodness his faithfulness order providence  god is governing the world righteously and orderly whatever disorder there is on earth there is none in heaven  gods word endures for ever there  then he looks on the world round him all is well orderedseasons animals sun and stars abide  they continue this day according to gods ordinances  the unchangeableness of nature is a comfort to him for it is a token of the unchangeablenes of god who made it  now i do beg you to think carefully over this verse because it is quite against the very common notion that because the earth was cursed for adams sake therefore it is cursed now that because it was said to him thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee therefore that holds good now  it is not so my friends neither is there as far as i know in any part whatsoever of scripture any mention of adams curse continuing to our day  st john in the revelations certainly says and there shall be no more curse but if you will read the revelation you will find that what he plainly refers to is to the fearful curses the plagues the vials of wrath as he calls them which were to be poured out on the earth and then to cease when the new jerusalem came down from heaven  st paul again knows nothing about any such curse upon the earth he says that death came into the world by adams sin  but that must be understood only of man and the world of man and for this simple reason that we know without the possibility of doubt that animals died in this world just as they do now not only thousands but hundreds of thousands of years before man appeared on earth  what st paul says of the creation in one of his most glorious passages is thisnot that it is cursed but that it groans and travails continually in the pangs of labour trying to bring forth trying to bring forth something better than itself to develop and rise from good to better and from that to better still till all things become perfect in a way which we cannot conceive but which god has ordained before the foundation of the world  besides as a fact the earth does not bring forth thorns and thistles to us but good grain and fruitful crops and an abundant return for our labour if we choose to till the ground  and wise men who study gods works can find no curse at all upon the earth nor sign of a curse neither in plants nor beasts no nor in the smallest gnat in the air  the more they look into the wonders of gods world the more they find it true that there is order everywhere beauty everywhere fruitfulness everywhere usefulness everywherethat all things continue as at the beginning that as the psalmist says in another place god has made them fast for ever and ever and given them a law which cannot be broken  and if you will look at genesis viii 21 22 you will find from the plain words of scripture itself that adams curse whatever it was was taken off after the flood and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more everything living as i have done  while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease  therefore my friends open your eyes and your hearts freely to the message which god is sending you in summer and winter in seedtime and in harvest in sunshine and in storm that god is not a hard god a revengeful god a god of curses who is extreme to mark what is done amiss and keepeth his anger for ever  no  but that he is your father in heaven who hateth nothing that he has made and whose mercy is over all his works who made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is who keepeth truth for ever who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong who feedeth the hungry a god who feeds the birds of the air though they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns and who clothes the grass of the field which toils not neither doth it spin and who will much much more clothe and feed you to whom he has given reason understanding and the power of learning his laws the rules by which this world of his is made and works and of turning them to your own profit in rational and honest labour  and think my friends if the old psalmist before christ came could believe all this and find comfort in it much more ought we shame to us if we do not  i had almost said we deny christ if we do not  for who said those last words concerning the birds of the air and the grass of the field  who told us that we have not merely a master or a judge in heaven but a father in heaven  who but that very word of god whom the psalmist saw dimly and afar off he knew that the word of god abode for ever in heaven  but he knew not as far as we can tell that that same word would condescend to be made flesh and dwell among men that we might see his glory full of grace and truth  the old psalmist knew that gods word was full of truth and that gave him comfort in the wild and sad times in which he lived but he did not knownone of the old testament prophets knewhow full gods word was of grace also  that he was so full of love condescension pity generosity so full of longing to seek and save all that was lost to set right all that was wrong in one word again so full of grace that he would condescend to be born of the virgin mary suffer under pontius pilate to be crucified dead and buried that he might become a faithful high priest for us full of understanding fellowfeeling pity love because he has been tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  my friends was not the old psalmist a jew and are not we christian men  then if the old psalmist could trust god how much more should we  if he could find comfort in the thought of gods order how much more should we  if he could find comfort in the thought of his justice how much more should we  if he could find comfort in the thought of his love how much more should we  yes let us be full of troubles doubts sorrows let times be uncertain dark and dangerous let strange new truths be discovered which we cannot at first sight fit into what we know to be true already  we can still say i will not fear though the earth be moved and the hills be carried into the midst of the sea  for the word of god abideth for ever in heaven even jesus christ who is the light of the world and the life of men  to him all power is given in heaven and earth  he is set on the throne judging right and ministering true judgment among the people  all things as the psalmist says come to an end all mens plans mens notions mens systems mens doctrines grow old wear out and perish   the old order changes giving place to the new but god fulfils himself in many ways   for men are not ruling the world  christ is ruling the world and his commandment is exceeding broad  his laws are broad enough for all people all countries all ages and strangely as they may seem to work in the eyes of us shortsighted timorous human beings still all is going well and all will go well for christ reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and god be all in all    sermon xxxiv  greek en toyto nika    good friday 1860  1 corinthians i 2325  but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god  because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men  the foolishness of god  the weakness of god  these are strange words  but they are st pauls words not mine  if he had not said them first i should not dare to say them now  but what do they mean  can god be weak  can god be foolish  no says st paul  nothing less  for so strong is god that his very weakness if he seems weak is stronger than all mankind  so wise is god that his very foolishness if he seems foolish is wiser than all mankind  why then talk of the weakness of god of the foolishness of god if he be neither weak nor foolish  why use words which seem blasphemous if they are not true  i do not say these ugly words for myself  st paul did not say these ugly words for himself  but men have said them too many men and too often  the jews who sought after a sign said them in st pauls time  the corinthian greeks who sought after wisdom said them also  there are men who say them now  we all are tempted at times to say them in our hearts  as often as we forget good friday and what good friday means and what good friday brought to all mankind we do say them in our hearts and charge godthough we should not like to confess it even to ourselveswith weakness and with folly  now how is this  let us consider first how it was with these jews and greeks  why did the cross of christ and the message of good friday seem to them weakness and folly  why did they answer st paul your christ cannot be god or he would never have allowed himself to be crucified  the jews required a sign a sign from heaven a sign of gods power thunder and earthquakes armies of angels taking vengeance on the heathen these were the signs of christ which they expected  a christ who came in such awful glory as that they would accept and follow and look to him to lead them against the romans that they might conquer them and all the nations upon earth  and all that st paul gave them was a sign of christs weakness  he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief    he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted  he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth  he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth  then said the jews this is no christ for us this weak despised crucified christ then answered st paulweak  i tell you that what seems to you weakness is the very power of god  you jews wish to conquer all mankind  and behold instead you yourselves are rushing to ruin and destruction  but what you cannot do christ on his cross can do  weak shamed despised dying man as he seemed he is still conqueror and he will conquer all mankind at last and draw all men to himself  know that what seems to you weakness is the very power of god the power of doing good and of suffering all things that he may do good  and that that will conquer the world when riches and glory and armies aye the very thunder and the earthquake have failed utterly  the greeks again sought after wisdom  if st paul was as he said the apostle of god then they expected him to argue with them on cunning points of philosophy about the being of god the nature of the world and of the soul about finite and infinite cause and effect being and not being and all those dark questions with which they astonished simple people and gained power over them and set up for wise men and teachers to their own profit and glory pampering their own luxury and selfconceit  and all st paul gave them seemed to them mere foolishness  he could have argued with these greeks on those deep matters for he was a great scholar and a true philosopher and could speak wisdom among those who were perfect  but he would not  he determined to know nothing among them but jesus christ and him crucified and he told them you disputers of this world while you are deceiving simple souls with enticing words of mans wisdom and philosophy falsely so called you are trifling away your own souls and your hearers into hell what you need and what they need is not philosophy but a new heart and a right spirit  sin is your disease and you know that it is so in the depth of your hearts  then know this that god so loved you sinners as you are that he condescended to become mortal man and to give himself up to death even the shameful and horrible death of the cross that he might save you from your sins and he that would be saved now let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow him  and to that those proud greeks answeredthat is a tale unworthy of philosophers  the cross  it is a death of shamethe death of slaves and wretches  tell your tale to slaves not to us  to give himself up to the death of the cross is foolishness and not the wisdom which we want  then answered st paul and saidtrue  the cross is a slaves and a wretchs death and therefore slaves and wretches will hear me though you will not for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called  but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are  that no flesh should glory in his presence  for the foolishness of god is wiser than all the wisdom of men  you greeks with all your philosophy and your wisdom have been trying for hundreds of years to find out the laws of heaven and earth and to set the world right by them and you have not done it  you have not found out the secrets of the world  you have not set the world right  you have not even set your own hearts and lives right  but what your seeming wisdom cannot do the seeming foolishness of christ on his cross will do does it seem to you foolish of him to believe that he could save the world by giving himself up to a horrible and shameful death does it seem to you foolishness in me to preach nothing but him crucified and to say behold god dying for men  then know that what seems to you foolishness is the very wisdom of god  that god knows the secret of touching convincing and converting the hearts of men though you do not  that god knows how the world is made and how to set it right though you do not  that god knows the law which keeps all heaven and earth in order though you do not and that that law is charityselfsacrificing love which shines out from the cross of christ  know that when all your arguments and philosophies have failed to teach men what they ought to do one earnest penitent look at christ upon his cross will teach them that their hearts will leap up in answer and cry if this be god i can believe in him  if this be god i can trust him  if this be god i can obey him  that one look at christ upon his cross will make themwhat you could never make themnew men filled with a new thought the thought that god is love and that he who dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him and that the poor slaves and wretches whom you despise will look unto the cross and be saved and become new men and lead new lives and rise to be saints and martyrs to god and to his christ giving themselves up to torments and death as christ did before them and that out of them shall spring that church of christ which shall reign over all the world when you and your philosophies have crumbled into dust  my friends let us look earnestly humbly and solemnly this day at christ upon his cross  let us learn that love the utter self sacrificing love which christ shewed on his cross is stronger than all pomp and might all armies riches governments aye that it is the very power of god by which all things consist which holds together heaven and earth and all that is therein  let us learn that love the utter selfsacrificing love which christ shewed on his cross is wiser than all arguments doctrines philosophies whether they be true or false aye that it is the very wisdom of god by which he convinces and converts all hearts and souls and let us look to the cross and see there the wisdom of god and the power of god mighty to save to the uttermost all who come through christ to him  and let us remember this that whenever we fancy ourselves to be strong and powerful and think to aggrandize ourselves at our neighbours expense and to crush those who are weaker than ourselves then we are forgetting the lesson of good friday that whenever we fancy that the way to be wise is to use our wit and our knowledge for our own glory and by them to manage our fellowmen and make them admire us and bow down to us then we forget the lesson of good friday  for whosoever gives himself up to selfish ambition or to selfish cunning charges christ upon his cross with weakness and with foolishness and denies the lord who bought him with his blood  my friends i have no more to say  much more i might say  for good friday has many other meanings and all the sermons of a lifetime would not exhaust them all  but one thing seemed to me fit to be said and i say it again and entreat you to carry it home with you and live by the light of it all the year round  do you wish to be powerful  then look at christ upon his cross at what seems to men his weakness and learn from him how to be strong do you wish to be wise  then look at christ upon the cross and at what seemed to men his folly and learn from him how to be wise for sooner or later i hope and trust you will find that true which st buonaventura wise and strong himself used to saythat all the learning in the world had never taught him so much as the sight of christ upon the cross    sermon xxxv the eternal manhood    first sunday after easter  john xx 29  jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed  the eighth day after the lord jesus rose from the dead he appeared a second time to his disciples  on this day he strengthened st thomass weak faith by giving him proof sensible proof that he was indeed and really the very same person who had been crucified wearing the very same human nature the very same mans body  blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed  you have not seen  you have never beheld with your bodily eyes or touched with your bodily hand as st thomas did the lord jesus christ  and yet you may be more blessed now this day than st thomas was then  we are too apt to fancy that to have seen the lord with our eyes to have walked with him and talked with him as the apostles did was the greatest honour and blessing which could happen to man  we fancy perhaps at times that if the lord jesus were to come visibly among us now we should want nothing more to make us good  that we could not help listening to him obeying him loving him  but the scriptures prove to us that it was not so  the scribes and pharisees saw him and talked with him yet they hated him  judas iscariot yet he betrayed him  pilate yet he condemned him  the word preached profited them nothing not being mixed with faith in those who heard him  jesus christ the lord of glory came and preached himself to them declared to them who he was proved who he was by his mighty works of love and mercy and by fulfilling all the prophecies of scripture which spoke of him and yet they did not believe him they hated him they crucified him because they had no faith  you see therefore that something more than seeing him with our bodily eyes is wanted to make us believe in the lord jesus christ something more than seeing him with our bodily eyes is wanted to make us blessed  st thomas saw him st thomas was allowed by the boundless condescension and mercy of the lord jesus to put his hand into his side  and yet the lord does not say to himsee how blessed thou art see how honoured thou art by being allowed to touch me  no our lord rather rebukes him for requiring such a proof  there are those who will not believe without seeing who say i must have proof  what i hear in church is too much for me to believe without many more reasons than are given for it all  many people for instance stumble at the stumblingblock of the cross and cannot bring themselves to believe that god would condescend to suffer and to die for men  others cannot make up their minds about the resurrection  it seems to them a strange and impossible thing that jesus body should have risen from the grave and ascended to heaven and that our bodies should rise also  that was the great puzzle to the greeks who thought themselves very learned and cunning and were great arguers and disputers about all deep matters in heaven and earth  when st paul preached to them on mars hill they heard him patiently enough till he spoke of jesus rising from the dead and then they mocked laughed at the notion as absurd and we find that the corinthians even after they were converted and baptised christians were puzzled about this same matter  they could not understand how the dead were raised and with what body they would come  with such the lord is not angry  if they really wish to know what is true and to do what is right if they really are as st paul says feeling after the lord if haply they may find him then the lord will give them light in due time and shew them what they ought to believe and give them the sort of proof which they want  all such he treats as he did thomas when he said in his great condescension reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing  so the lord sent to those corinthians the very sort of proof which they wanted by the hand of the learned apostle st paul  they were great observers of the works of nature of the strange movement and change birth and death which goes on in beasts and in plants and in the clouds and the rivers and the very stones under our feet  and they said we cannot believe in the resurrection of the dead because we see nothing like it in the world around us  and st paul was sent to tell them  no  you do see something like it if you will look deeper into the working of the world around you you will see that the rising again of the dead instead of being an unnatural or an absurd thing is the most reasonable and natural thing the perfect fulfilment and crowning wonder of wonderful laws which are working round you in every seed which you sow in the flesh of beasts and fishes in bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial  and so in that glorious chapter which we read in the burial service st paul tells the corinthians who went altogether by sense and reasoning about the things which they could see and handle that sense and reasoning were on his side on gods side and that the mysteries of faith like the resurrection of the body were not contrary to reason but agreed with it  so does the lord clear up the doubts of his people in the way which is best for them  but he does not call them as blessed as others there is a higher faith than that  there is a better part  the same part which mary chose  the same faith of which our lord says blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed  the faith of the heart the childlike undoubting ready willing faith which welcomes the news of the lord which runs to meet it and is not astonished at it and if it ever doubts for a moment only doubts for very joy and delight and feeling that the news of the gospel is good news cannot help feeling now and then that it is too good news to be true shewing its love and its faith in its very hesitation  this is the childlike heart whereof it is written except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  the hearts of little children the hearts which begin by faith and love toward god himself the hearts which know god the hearts to whom god has revealed himself and taught them they know not how that he is love  they are so sure of gods goodness so sure of his power so sure of his love his willingness to have mercy and to deliver poor creatures that they find nothing strange nothing difficult in the mysteries of faith  to them it is not a thing incredible that god should have come down and died upon the cross when they hear the good news of him who gave his own life for them it seems a natural thing to them a reasonable thing  not of course a thing which they could have expected but yet not a thing to doubt of or to be astonished at  for they know that god is love  and now some of you may say then are we more blessed than thomas we have not seen and yet we have believed  we never doubted  we never wanted any arguments or learned books or special inward assurances  from the moment that we began to learn our catechisms at school we believed it of course every word of it  do we not say the creed every sunday i believe inand so forth  o my friends do you believe indeed  if you do blessed are you  but are you sure that you speak truth  you may believe it  but do you believe in it  have you faith in it  do you put your trust in it  is your heart in it  is it in your heart  do you love it rejoice in it delight to think over it to look forward to it to make yourselves ready and fit for it do you believe in it in short or do you only believe it as you believe that there is an emperor of china or that there is a country called america or any other matter with which you have nothing to do for which you care nothing and which would make no difference at all to you if you found out tomorrow that it was not so  that is mere dead belief faith without works which is dead the belief of the brains not the faith of the heart and spirit  oh do you really believe the good news of this text in which the son of god himself said to mortal men like ourselves handle me and see that it is i indeed for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have  do you believe that there is a man evermore on the right hand of god  that now as we speak a man is offering up before the father his perfect and allcleansing sacrifice  that in the midst of the throne of god is he himself who was born of the virgin mary and crucified under pontius pilate  do you wish to find out whether you believe that or not  then look at your own hearts look at your own prayers  do you think of the lord jesus christ do you pray to the lord jesus christ as a man very man born of woman  do you pray to him as to one who can be touched with the feeling of your infirmities because he has been tempted in all things like as you are yet without sin  when you are sad perplexed do you take all your sorrows and doubts and troubles to the lord jesus and speak them all out to him honestly and frankly however reverently as a man speaketh to his friend  do you really cast all your care on him because you believe that he careth for you  if you do then indeed you believe in the resurrection of the lord jesus christ and you will surely have your reward in a peace of mind amid all the chances and changes of this mortal life which passes mans understanding  that blessed knowledge that the lord knows all cares for all condescends to allthat thought of a loving human face smiling upon your joys sorrowing over your sorrows watching you educating you from youth to manhood from manhood to the grave from the grave to eternities of eternities whosoever has felt that has indeed found the pearl of great price for which if need be he would give up all else in earth or heaven  or do you say to yourselves at times i must not think too much about the lord jesuss being man lest i should forget that he is god  do you shrink from opening your heart to him  do you say within yourself he is too great too awful to condescend to listen to my little mean troubles and anxieties  besides how can i expect him to feel for them i a mean sinful man and he the almighty god  how do i know that he will not despise my meanness and paltriness  how do i know that he will not be angry with me  i must be more reverent to him than to trouble him with very petty matters  he was a man once when he was upon earth  but now that he is ascended up on high very god of very god in the glory which he had with the father before the worlds were made i must have more awful and solemn thoughts about him and keep at a more humble distance from him  do you ever have such thoughts as those come over you my friends when you are thinking of the lord jesus and praying to him  if you do shall i tell you what to say to them when they arise in your minds get thee behind me satan  get thee away thou accusing devil who art accusing my lord to me and trying to make me fancy him less loving less condescending less tender less understanding than he was when he wept over the grave of lazarus get thee away thou lying hypocritical devil who pretendest to be so very humble and reverent to the godhead of the lord jesus in order that thou mayest make me forget what his godhead is like forget what gods likeness is forget that it was in his manhood in his mans words his mans thoughts his mans actions that he shewed forth the glory of god the express image of his person and fulfilled the blessed words and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness  get thee behind me satan  i believe in the good news of easter day and thou shall not rob me of it  i believe that he who died upon the cross rose again the third day as very and perfect man then and now as he was when he bled and groaned on calvary and shuddered at the fear of death in the garden of gethsemane  thou shalt not make my lords incarnation his birth his passion his resurrection all that he did and suffered in those thirtythree years of none effect to me  thou shalt not take from me the blessed message of my bible that there is a man in heaven in the midst of the throne of god  thou shalt not take from me the blessed message of the athanasian creed that in christ the manhood is taken into god  thou shalt not take from me the blessed message of holy communion which declares that the very human flesh and blood of him who died on the cross is now eternal in the heavens and nourishes my body and soul to everlasting life  thou shalt not under pretence of voluntary humility and willworship tempt me to go and pray to angels or to saints or to the blessed virgin because i choose to fancy them more tender more loving and condescending more loving more human than the lord himself who gave himself to death for me  if the lord god the son of the father is not ashamed to be man for ever and ever i will not be ashamed to think of him as man to pray to him as man to believe and be sure that he can be touched with the feeling of my infirmities to entreat him by all that he did and suffered as a man to deliver me from those temptations which he himself has conquered for himself and to cry to him in the smallest as well as in the most important mattersby the mystery of thy holy incarnation by thine agony and bloody sweat by thy cross and passion by thy precious death and burial by thy glorious resurrection and ascension by all which thou hast done and suffered and conquered as a man upon this earth of ours good lord deliver us    sermon xxxvi  the battle within    fourteenth sunday after trinity 1858  galatians v 16 17  this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh  for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh  and these are contrary the one to the other  so that ye cannot do the things that ye would  does this text seem to any of you difficult to understand  it need not be difficult to you for it does not speak of anything which you do not know  it speaks of something which you have all felt which goes on in you every day of your lives  it speaks of something certainly which is very curious mysterious difficult to put into words  but what is not curious and mysterious  the commonest things are usually the most curious  what is more wonderful than the beating of your heart your pulse which beats all day long without your thinking of it  just so this battle this struggle which st paul speaks of in this text is going on in us all day long and yet we hardly think of it now what is this battle  what are these things which are fighting continually in your mind and in mine  st paul calls them the flesh and the spirit  the flesh he says lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh  they pull opposite ways  one wants to do one thing and the other the other  but if so one of them must be in the right and the other in the wrong  now st paul says when these two fall out with each other the spirit is in the right and the flesh in the wrong  and therefore the secret of life is to walk in the spirit and so not to fulfil the lusts of the flesh  but if so it must be worth our while to find out which is flesh and which is spirit in us that we may know the foolish part of us from the wise  what the flesh is we may see by looking at a dumb beast which is all flesh and has no immortal soul  it may be very cunning brave curiously formed beautiful but one thing you will always see that a beast does what it likes and only what it likes and this is the mark of the flesh that it does what it likes  it is selfish and selfindulgent cares for nothing but itself and what it can get for itself  true you may raise a dumb beast above that by taming and training it  you may teach a horse or dog to do what it does not like and give it a sense of duty and as it were awaken a soul in it  that is very wonderful that we should be able to do so  it is a sign that man is made in gods likeness  but i cannot stay to speak of that now  i say our flesh our animal nature is selfish and self indulgent  i do not say therefore that it is bad  god forbid god made our bodies and brains as well as our souls and god makes nothing bad  it is blasphemous to say that he does  no our bodies as bodies are good the flesh as flesh is good when it is in its right place and its right place is to be servant not master  we are not to walk after the flesh says st paul  but the flesh is to walk after the spiritin english our bodies are to obey our spirits our souls  for man has something higher than body in him he has a spirit in him and it is just having this spirit which makes him a man  for this spirit cares about higher things than mere gain and comfort  it can feel pity and mercy love and generosity justice and honour and when a man not only feels them but obeys them then he is a true mana christian man  but on the other hand if a man does not if he be a man in whom there is no mercy or pity no generosity no benevolence no justice or honour who cares for nothing and no one but himself and filling his own stomach and his own pulse and pleasing his own brute appetites in some way what should you say of that man  you would say he is like a brute beastand you would say rightyou would say just what st paul says  st paul would say that man is fulfilling the lusts of the flesh and you and st paul would mean just the same thing now st paul says the flesh in us lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh  and what do we gain by the spirit in us lusting against the flesh and pulling us the opposite way  we gain this st paul says that we cannot do the things that we would  does that seem no great gain to you  let me put it a little plainer  st paul means this and just this that you may not do whatever you like  st paul thought it the very best thing for a man not to be able to do whatever he liked  as long st paul says as a man does whatever he likes he lives according to the flesh and is no better than a dumb beast  but as soon as he begins to live according to the spirit and does not do whatever he likes but restrains himself and keeps himself in order then and then only he becomes a true man  but why not do whatever we like  because if we did do so we should be certain to do wrong  i do not mean that you and i here like nothing but what is wrong  god forbid  i trust the spirit of god is with our spirits  but i mean thisthat if you could let a child grow up totally without any control whatsoever i believe that before that lad was twentyone he would have qualified himself for the gallows seven times over  thank god that cannot happen in england because people are better taught most of them at least and more we dare not do what we like for fear of the law and the policeman  but if you knew the lives which savages lead who have neither law outside them to keep them straight by fear nor the spirit of god within them to keep them straight by duty and honour then you would understand what i mean only too well  now st paul saysit is a good thing for a man not to be able to do what he likes  but there are two ways of keeping him from it one is by the law the other is by the spirit of god  the law works on a man from the outside by fear but the spirit of god works in a man by honour by the sense of duty by making him like and love what is right and making him see what a beautiful and noble thing right is  now st paul wants us to restrain ourselves not from fear of being punished but because we like to do right  that is what he means when he says that we are to be led by the spirit instead of being under the law  it is better to be afraid of the law than to do wrong  but it is best of all to do right from the spirit and of our own free will  am i puzzling you  i hope not  but lest i should be 1 will give you one simple example which ought to make all clear as to the struggle between a mans flesh and his spirit and also as to doing right from the spirit or from law  suppose you were a soldier going into battle  you see your comrades falling around you disfigured and cut up you hear their groans and cries and you are dreadfully afraid  and no shame to you  it is the common human instinct of selfpreservation  the bravest men have told me that they are afraid at first going into action and that they cannot get over the feeling  but what part of you is afraid  your flesh which is afraid of pain just as a beast is of the whip  then your flesh perhaps says run awayor at least skulk and hidetake care of yourself  but next if you were a coward the law would come into your mind and you would say but i dare not run away for if i do i shall be shot as a deserter or broke and drummed out of the army  so you may go on even though you are a coward  but that is not courage  you have not conquered your own fearyou have not conquered yourselfbut the law has conquered you  but if you are a brave man as i trust you all are a higher spirit than your own speaks to your spirit and makes you say to yourself i dare not run away but more i cannot run away  i should like tobut i cannot do the things that i would  it is my duty to go on it is right it is a point of honour with me to my country my regiment my queen my god and i must go on  then you are walking in the spirit  you have conquered yourself and so are a really brave man  you have obeyed the spirit and you have your reward by feeling inspirited as we say you can face death with spirit and fight with spirit  but the struggle between the spirit and the flesh is not ended there  when you got excited there would probably come over you the lust of fighting you would get angry get mad and lose your self possession  there is the flesh waking up again and saying be cruel kill every one you meet  and to that the spirit answers no be reasonable and merciful  do not fulfil the lusts of the flesh and turn yourself into a raging wild beast  your business is not to butcher human beings but to win a battle  well and even if you have conquered the enemy you may not have conquered your worst enemy which is yourself  for after having fought bravely and done your duty what would the flesh say to you i am sure it would say it to me  what butboast  talk of your own valiant deeds and successes get all the praise and honour you can and shew how much finer a person you are than any of your comrades but what would the spirit sayand i trust you would all listen to the spirit  the spirit would say no do not boast do not lower yourself into the likeness of a vain peacock  but be just and be modest  give every man his due try to praise and recommend every one whom you can and trust to god to make your doing your duty as clear as the light and your brave actions as the noonday  so you see all through a mans flesh might be lusting and would be lusting against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and see too how in each case the flesh is tempting the man to be cowardly brutal vain selfish and wrong in some way and the spirit is striving to make him forget himself and think of his comrades and his duty  now when a man is led by the spirit if he is tempted to do wrong he does not say i will not do this wrong thing but i cannot  i cannot do what you want me  i like to hear a man say that  it is a sign that he feels gods voice in him which he must obey whether he likes or not as joseph said when he was tempted  not i had rather not or i dare not  but how can i do this great wickedness against my master who has trusted me and put everything into my hand and so by being a treacherous traitor sin against god  now is this spirit part of our spirits or not  i think we confess ourselves that it is not  st paul says that it is not  for he says there is one spiritthat is one good spiritof whom he speaks as the spirit and this he says is the spirit of god and the spirit of christ and the spirit which inspires the spirits of all noble christlike godlike men  in this spirit there is nothing proud spiteful cruel nothing selfish false and mean nothing violent loose debauched  but he is an altogether good and noble spirit whose fruit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance  this he says is the spirit of god and this spirit he gives to those spiritssouls as we call them nowwho desire it that they may become righteous with the righteousness of christ and good with the goodness of god  and is not this good news  i say my friends if we will look at it aright there is no better news no more inspiriting news for men like us mixed up in the battle of life and often pulled downward by our own bad passions and ashamed of ourselves more or less every day of our livesno better news i say than this that what is good and right in us is not our own but gods that our longings after good our sense of duty and honour kindliness and charity are not merely our own likings or fancies  but the voice of gods almighty and everlasting spirit  good news indeed  for if god be for us who can be against us  if gods spirit be with our spirits they must surely be stronger than our selfish pleasureloving flesh if god himself be labouring to make us good if he be putting into our hearts good desires surely he can enable us to bring those desires to good effect  and all that is wanted of us is to listen to gods voice within and do the right like men whatever pain it may cost us sure that we by gods help shall win at last in the hardest battle of all battles the victory over our own selves    sermon xxxvii  hypocrisy    matthew xvi 3  oh ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times  it will need i think some careful thought thoroughly to understand this text  our lord in it calls the pharisees and sadducees hypocrites because though they could use their common sense and experience to judge of the weather they would not use them to judge of the signs of the times of what was going to happen to the jewish nation  but how was their conduct hypocritical  stupid we might call it or unreasonable  but how hypocritical  that i think we may see better by considering what the word hypocrite means  we mean now generally by a hypocrite a man who pretends to be one thing while he is another who pretends to be pious and good while he is leading a profligate life in secret who pretends to believe certain doctrines while at heart he disbelieves them a man in short who is a scoundrel and knows it but who does not intend others to know it  who deceives others but does not deceive himself  my friends such a man is a hypocrite  but there is another kind of hypocrite and a more common one by far and that is the hypocrite who not only deceives others but deceives himself likewise the hypocrite who as one of the wisest living men puts it is astonished that you should think him hypocritical  i do not say which of these two kinds is the worse  my duty is to judge no man  i only say that there are such people and too many of them that we ourselves are often in danger of becoming such hypocrites and that this was the sort of people which the pharisees for the most part were  hypocrites who had not only deceived others but themselves also who thought themselves perfectly right honest and pious who were therefore astonished and indignant at christs calling them hypocrites  how did they get into this strange state of mind  how may we get into it  consider first what a hypocrite means  it means strictly neither more nor less than a playactor one who personates different characters on the stage  that is the one original meaning of the word hypocrite  now recollect that a man may personate characters like a play actor and pretend to be what he is not for two different objects he may do it for other peoples sake or for his own  1  for other peoples sake  as the pharisees did when they did all their works to be seen of men and therefore naturally gave their attention as much as possible to outward forms and ceremonies which could be seen by men  now understand me before i go a step further i am not going to speak against forms and ceremonies  no man less  and above all not against the church forms and ceremonies which have grown up gradually and naturally out of the piety and experience and practical common sense of many generations of gods saints  men must have forms and ceremonies to put them in mind of the spiritual truths which they cannot see or handle  men cannot get on without them and those who throw away the church forms have to invent fresh ones and less good ones for themselves  all i say have their forms and ceremonies and all are in danger as we churchmen are of making those forms stand instead of true religion  in the church or out of the church men are all tempted to have like the pharisees their traditions of the elders their little rules as to conduct over and above what the bible and the prayerbook have commanded and all are tempted to be more shocked if those rules are broken than if really wrong and wicked things are done and like the pharisees of old to be careful in paying tithe of mint anise and cummin the commonest garden herbs and yet forget the weighty matters of the law justice mercy and judgment  i have known those who would be really more shocked at seeing a religious man dance or sing than at hearing him tell a lie  but i will give no examples lest i should set you on judging others  or rather the only example which i will give is that of these pharisees who have become by our lords words about them famous to all time as hypocrites  now you must bear in mind that these pharisees were not villains and profligates  many people feeling perhaps how much of what the lord had said against the pharisees would apply to them have tried to escape from that ugly thought by making out the pharisees worse men than our lord does  but the fact is that they cannot be proved to be worse than too many religious people nowadays  there were adulterers secret looselivers among them  are there none nowa days  they were covetous  are no religious professors covetous nowadays  they crept into widows houses and for a pretence made long prayers  does no one do so now  there would of course be among them as there is among all large religious parties as there is now a great deal of inconsistent and bad conduct  but on the whole there is no reason to suppose that the greater number of them were what we should call illlivers  in that terrible twenty third chapter of st matthew in which our lord denounces the sins of the scribes and pharisees he nowhere accuses them of profligate living and the pharisee of whom he tells us in his parable who went into the temple to pray no doubt spoke truth when he boasted of not being as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers  he trusted in himself that he was righteous  true  but whatever that means it means that he thought that he was righteous after a fashion though it proved to be a wrong one  what our lord complains of in them is first their hardness of heart their pride in themselves and their contempt for their fellowmen  their very name pharisee meant that  it meant separatethey were separate from mankind a peculiar people who alone knew the law with whom alone god was pleased  while the rest of mankind even of their own countrymen knew not the law and were accursed and doomed to hell ah god who are we to cast stones at the pharisees of old when this is the very thing which you may hear said in england from hundreds of pulpits every sunday with the mere difference that instead of the word law men put the word gospel  for this our lord denounced them and next for their hypocrisy their playacting the outward show of religion in which they delighted trying to dress and look and behave differently from other men doing all their good works to be seen of men sounding a trumpet before them when they gave away alms praying standing at the corners of the streets going in long clothing making broad their phylacteries the written texts of scripture which they sewed to their garments washing perpetually when they came from the market or any public place lest they should have been defiled by the touch of an unclean thing or person loving the chief seats in their religious meetings and the highest places at feasts and so forthfull of affectation vanity and pride  i could tell you other stories of their ridiculous affectations but i shall not  they would only make you smile  and we could not judge them fairly not being able to make full allowance for the difference of customs between the jews and ourselves  many of the things which our lord blames them for were not nearly so absurd in judea of old as they seem to us in england now  indeed no one but our lord seems to have thought them absurd or seen through the hollowness and emptiness of themas he perhaps sees through my friends a great deal which is thought very right in england now making allowance for the difference of the country and of the times the pharisees were perhaps no more affected for jews than many people are now for englishmen  and if it be answered that though our religious fashions nowadays are not commanded expressly by the bible or the prayer book yet they carry out their spirit remember in gods name that that was exactly what the pharisees said and their excuse for being righteous above what was written and that they could and did quote texts of scripture for their phylacteries their washings and all their other affectations  another reason i have for not dwelling too much on these affectations and it is this  because a man may be a playactor and a selfdeceiver in religion without any of these tricks at all and without much of the vanity and pride which cause them  for recollect that a man may act for his own amusement as well as for other peoples  children do so perpetually and especially when no one is by to listen to them  they delight in playing at being this person and that and in living for a while in a daydream  oh let us take care that we do not do the same in our religion  it is but too easy to do so  too easy and too common  for is it not play acting like any child to come to this church and here to feel repentance feel forgiveness feel gratitude feel reverence and then to go out of church and awake as from a dream and become our natural selves for the rest of the week till sunday comes round again comforting ourselves meanwhile with the fancy that we had been very religious last sunday and intended to be very religious next sunday likewise  would there not be hypocrisy and playacting in that my friends  now my dear friends if we give way to this sort of hypocrisy we shall get as too many do into the habit of living two lives at once without knowing it  outside us will be our religious life of praying and reading and talking of good things and doing good work as thank god many do whose hearts are not altogether right with god or their eyes single in his sight good work which i trust god will not forget in the last day in spite of all our inconsistencies  outside us i say will be our religious life and inside us our own actual life our own natural character too often very little changed or improved at all  so by continually playing at religion we shall deceive ourselves  we shall make an entirely wrong estimate of the state of our souls  we shall fancy that this outward religion of ours is the state of our soul  and then if any one tells us that we are playacting and hypocrites we shall be as astonished and indignant as the pharisees were of old  we shall make the same mistake as a man would who because he always wore clothes should fancy at last that his clothes were himself part of his own body  so i say many deceive themselves and are more or less hypocrites to themselves  they do not in general deceive others they are not on the whole hypocrites to their neighbours  for their neighbours after a time see what they cannot see themselves that they are playacting that they are two different people without knowing it  that their religion is a thing apart from their real character  a hundred signs shew that  how many there are for instance who are or seem tolerably earnest about religion and doing good as long as they are actually in church or actually talking about religion  but all the rest of their time what are they doing  what are they thinking of  mere frivolity and empty amusement  idle butterflies pretending to be industrious bees once in the week  others again will be gentle and generous enough about everything but religion and as soon as they get upon that will become fierce and hard and narrow at once  others again and this is most common commit the very same fault as the pharisees in the text who could use their common sense to discern the signs of the weather and yet could not use it to discern the signs of the time because they were afraid of looking honestly at the true state of public feeling and conscience and at the danger and ruin into which their religion and their party were sinking  for about all worldly matters these men will be as soundheaded and reasonable as they need be  but as soon as they get on religious matters they become utterly silly and unreasonable and will talk nonsense listen to nonsense and be satisfied with nonsense such as they would not endure a moment if their own worldly interest or worldly character were in question  but most of all do these poor souls not deceive their neighbours when a time of temptation comes upon them  for then alas it comes out too often that they are of those whom our lord spoke of who heard the word gladly but had no root in themselves and in time of temptation fell away  for then before the storm of some trying temptation away goes all the playacting religion and the mans true self rises up from underneath into ugly life  up rise perhaps pride and selfwill and passion up rise perhaps meanness and love of money up rise perhaps cowardice and falsehood or up rises foul and gross sin causing some horrible scandal to religion and to the name of christ while fools look on and laughing an evil laugh crythese are your high professors these are your pharisees who were so much better than everybody else  when they are really tried it seems they behave no better than we sinners  oh these are the things which make a clergymans heart truly sad these are the things which make him long that all were over that christ would shortly accomplish the number of his elect and hasten his kingdom that we with all those who are departed in the true faith of his holy name may rest in peace for ever from sin and sinners  not that i mean that some of these very people in spite of all their inconsistency will not be among that number  god forbid how do we know that  how do we know that they are one whit worse than we should be in their place  how do we know above all that to have been found out may not be the very best thing that has happened to them since the day that they were born  how do we know that it may not be gods gracious medicine to enable them to find themselves out to make them see themselves in their true colours to purge them of all their playacting and begin all over again crying to god not with the lips only but out of the depth of an honest and a noble shame as david did of oldbehold i was shapen in wickedness conceived in sin and i have found it out at last but thou requirest truth in the inward parts in the very root and ground of the heart and not merely truth in the head in the lips and in the outward behaviour  make me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me  thou desirest no sacrifice else would i give it thee  but thou delightest not in burntofferings the sacrifice of god is a broken spirit as mine is now  a broken and a contrite heart ground down by the shame of its own sin that o god thou wilt not despise  and thenwhen that prayer has gone up in earnest and has been answered by the gift of a clean heart and of a right spirit which desires nothing but to be made clean and made right to learn its duty and to do itthen i say that man may go back safely and freely to such forms and ceremonies as he has been accustomed to and have been consecrated by the piety and wisdom of his forefathers  for says david though forms and ceremonies sacrifice and burntoffering cannot make any peace with god yet i am not going to give up forms and ceremonies sacrifice and burnt offerings  no  when my peace is made when the broken and the contrite heart has put me in my true place again and my heart is clean and my spirit right once more then he says will god be pleased with my sacrifices with my burntofferings and oblations because they will be the sacrifice of righteousness of a righteous man desiring to shew honour to that god from whom his righteousness comes and gratitude to that god to whom he owes his pardon  and so with us my friends if ever we have fallen and been pardoned and risen again to a new a truer a more honest a more righteous life  our forms of devotion ought then to become not a snare and a hypocrisy but honest outward signs of the spiritual grace which is within us as honest and as rational as the shake of the hand to the friend whom we truly love as the bowing of the knee before the queen for whom we would gladly die  o may god give us all grace to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness  to seek first the kingdom of god to work earnestly each in his place to do gods will and to teach and help others to do it likewise  to seek his righteousness which is the righteousness of the heart and spirit  and then all other things will be added to us  all outward forms and ceremonies ways of speaking ways of behaving which are good and right for us will come to us as a matter of course growing up in us naturally and honestly without any affectation or hypocrisy and the purity and soberness the reverence and earnestness of our outward conversation will be a pattern of the purity and soberness the reverence and earnestness which dwells in our hearts by the inspiration of the holy spirit of god    sermon xxxviii  a people prepared for the lord    ephesians iii 36  how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto the holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel  this day is the feast of the epiphany  epiphany as many of you know means shewing because on this day the lord jesus christ was first shewn to the gentiles to the gentile wise men who as you heard in the gospel saw his star in the east and came to worship him  and the part of scripture from which i have taken my text is used for the epistle this day because in it st paul explains to us the meaning of the epiphany  the meaning of those wise men being shewn our lord and worshipping him though they were not jews as he was but gentiles  he says that it means this that the gentiles were fellowheirs with the jews and of the same body as them and partakers of gods promise in christ by the gospel  this does not seem so very wonderful to us and why  because we though we are gentiles like those wise men have lived so long we and our forefathers before us in the light of the gospel that we are inclined to take it as a matter of course forgetting what a wonderful unspeakable condescension it was of god not to spare his only begotten son but freely to give him for us  god forgive us  we are so heaped with blessings that we neglect them forget them take them as our right instead of remembering our sins and ungratefulness and saying thy mercies are new every morning it is only of thy mercies that we are not consumed  but to st paul it was very wonderful news  a mystery as he said quite a new and astonishing thought that heathens had any share in gods love and christs salvation  and so it was to st peter  god had to teach it him by that wonderful vision in which he saw coming down from heaven all sorts of animals and god bade him kill and eat and when he refused because they were common and unclean god forbade him to call anything common or unclean now that god had cleansed all things by the precious blood of his dear son  then peter was bidden to go to the gentile roman soldier cornelius  and he went though he said he had been used to think it unlawful for a jew even to eat with a gentile  and when he went he found to his astonishment that gods love was over that gentile soldier and his family because they were good men as far as they had light and knowledge just as much as if they had been good jews  and god gave st peter a sign which there was no mistaking that he really did care for those gentile romans just as much as if they had been jews for as he was preaching christ to them the holy ghost fell on them not after but before they were baptised  so that st peter astonished as he was was forced by his own conscience and reason to say can any man forbid water that these should not be baptised who have received the holy ghost as well as we jews  then he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the lord  and what was the lesson which god taught st peter by this  st peter himself tells us for he opened his mouth and said of a truth i see that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted by him  now my dear friends this is as the lord jesus christ tells us gods everlasting law that he that hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundantly but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he seems to have  so it was as i have just shewn you with cornelius and so it was with those wise men  they were worshippers as is supposed of the one true god though in a dim confused way  but they had learnt enough of what true faith was and of what true greatness was too not to be staggered and fall into unbelief when they saw the king of the jews whom they had come so many hundred miles to see laid not in a palace but in a manger and attended not by princesses and noblewomen but by a poor maiden espoused to a carpenter therefore god bestowed on them that great honour that they first of all the gentiles should see the glory and the love of god in the face of jesus christ his son  and so it was with our forefathers my friends  and i think that on this epiphany we ought to thank god among all his other blessings for having given us such forefathers and letting us be born of that noble stock to whom he gave the kingdom of god after he took it away from the faithless and rebellious jews and afterwards from the false and profligate greeks and romans to whom the epistles of the apostles were written  i will tell you what i mean  when the lord jesus came on earth our forefathers did not live here in england but in countries across the sea in germany denmark and sweden which did not belong to the roman empire for the romans who had conquered all the world beside could never conquer our forefathers  it was gods will that whenever they tried they were beaten back with shame and slaughter and our forefathers almost alone of all remained free men even as we are at this day but for that very reason the apostles could never come among us to preach the gospel to us for they could not pass the bounds of the roman empire and that was so large that they had enough to do to preach the gospel in it so that it was not till at least 400 years after the apostles death that their successors zealous missionaries priests and bishops came and preached to our forefathers and when they came they found us a people prepared for the lord who heard the word gladly and turned thousands sometimes in one day from vain idols to serve the living god and were baptised into that holy church in which we now stand  and it has been among us and the nations who are our kinsmen that the light of the gospel has shone ever since while all through the east where the apostles preached most and earliest it has died out  so that our lords words have been fulfilled that many that are last shall be first and those that are first shall be last  god grant that it may not always be so  god grant that his kingdom may return to its ancient seat at jerusalem and that all nations may go up to the mountain of the lords house in the day of which st paul prophesies when the times of the gentiles are fulfilled and all israel shall be saved when the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  but it is not so now and cannot be so as far as we can see for many a year to come  but in the meanwhile why were our forefathersheathens though they were and sinners in many things being truly children of wrath fierce bloodthirsty revengeful without the grace of christ which is love and charitynevertheless a people prepared for the lord how was it true of them that to him that hath shall be given  i will tell you  there is an old book written in latin by a heathen gentleman of rome who lived in st pauls time and wrote this book about twenty years after st pauls death  it is a little book but it is a very precious one  and i think it is a great mercy of god that while so many famous old books have been lost this little book should have been preserved  for this roman gentleman had travelled among our forefathers and when he returned he wrote this book to shame his countrymen at rome  in it he calls us germans but that was the roman fashion  by germans they meant not only the people who now live in germany but the english and the danes and the swedes and the franks who afterwards conquered france  in fact he meant our own forefathers  and he said to the romans  look at these wild germans  you despise them because they go half naked and cannot read or write and live in mud cottages while you go in silk and gold and have all sorts of learning and live in great cities palaces and temples in worldly pomp and glory  but i tell you he said that these wild germans are better men than you for while you are living in sin in cheating and falsehood in covetousness adultery murder and every horrible iniquity they are honest chaste truthful they honour their fathers and mothers they are obedient and loyal to their kings and their laws they shew hospitality to strangers they do not commit adultery steal bear false witness covet their neighbours goods  and therefore this roman felt and really it seems as if a spirit of prophecy from god had come on him something great and glorious will come out of these wild germans while the romans will rot away and perish in their sins  that was true enough  we see it true at this day  for what happened  that great roman empire babylon the great as st john calls it in the revelations perished miserably and horribly by its own sins while our forefathers rose and conquered it all and live and thrive till this day  but it is curious that they never throve really though they made great conquests and did many wonderful deeds till they became christians  but as soon as they became christians they began to thrive at once and settled down and became that great family of nations and kingdom of god which we call christendom england france spain italy germany sweden and the other countries of christian europe which god has so prospered for his son jesus christs sake in spite of many sins and shortcomings with wealth and numbers skill and learning and strength that now the empire of the whole world depends upon these few small christian nations which in our lords time were only tribes of heathen savages  so that here again our lords great parable was fulfilled  the gospel seed which the apostle sowed in those rich luxurious clever learned romans was like the seed which fell on thorny ground and the cares and pleasures of this life and the deceitfulness or riches sprang up and choked the word and it remained unfruitful  but the gospel seed which was sown among our poor wild simple ignorant forefathers was the seed which fell on an honest and good heart and took root and brought forth fruit some thirty some fifty and some one hundred fold  epiphany came late to usnot for three hundred years after our lords birth but when it came the light which it brought remained with us and lights us even now from our cradle to our grave  and so again was fulfilled the scripture which says that god chooses the weak things of this world to confound the strong the foolish to confound the wise yea and things which are not to bring to nought the things which are that no flesh should glory in his presence  that no flesh should glory in his presence  for mind my friends our business is not to be highminded but to fear  and we english are too apt to be highminded now  we pride ourselves on our english character english cleverness english courage english wealth  my friends be not highminded but fear  we have no right to pride ourselves on being englishmen if we do the very things which our forefathers were ashamed to do even when they were heathens  they honoured their fathers and mothers  do we  they were loyal and obedient to law  are we  they were chaste and clean livers  adultery was seldom heard of among them and when it was they punished it in the most fearful way  while what astonished that old roman gentleman of whom i spoke most of all was the pure and respectable lives of the young men and women  is it so nowa days among us my friends  they were honest too and just in all their dealings  are we  they were true to their word no men on earth more true  are we  they hated covetousness and overreaching do we  they were generous openhanded hospitable  are we  my friends this was the old english spirit which god accepted in our forefathers  is it in us now  we must not pride ourselves on it unless we have it  nay more what is it but a shame to us if while our forefathers were good heathens we are bad christians they had but a small spark a dim ray as it were of the light which lighteth every man who comes into the world  but they were more faithful to that little than many are now who live in the full sunshine of gods gospel in the free dispensation of gods spirit with christs sacraments christs churches means of grace and hopes of glory of which they never dreamed  may they not rise up against some of us in the day of judgment and condemn us and say are you our children  do you boast of knowing god better than we did while you did things which we dared not do  we knew that god hated such sins and therefore we kept from them  you should know that better than we for you had seen gods horror of sin in the death of his own son jesus christ and yet you went on committing the very sins which crucified the lord of glory  my friends i speak sober earnest  god grant that our old heathen forefathers may not rise up against us in the day of judgment and condemn us  let us turn to the lord this day with all our hearts and come to this holy table confessing all our sins and unfaithfulness and backslidings that we may get there cleansing from his most precious blood strength from his most precious body life from his life and spirit from his spirit that so we may go away to lead new lives following the commandments of god and living up to our great light and knowledge at least as well as our forefathers lived up to their little light  and so we shall really keep the feast of epiphany in spirit and in truth  for epiphany means the shewing of jesus christ to us gentiles and the way to prove that jesus christ has been shewn to us and that we have seen his glory the glory as of the onlybegotten of the father full of grace and truth is to keep his commandments and live lives like his    sermon xxxix  the wrath of love    psalm cvii 6  then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses  if i were asked to give a reason why i believed the old testament to be an inspired and divine book as well as the new i could not do better i think than to lay my hand on this 107th psalm and say this is my reason for believing the old testament to be inspired  i have hundreds of others  but this one is enoughthis one psalm it contains an account of gods dealings with men such as the world never heard before and very seldom since save from a very few men who really saw what the bible meant and honestly followed its teaching  it gives a notion of the justice of god and an explanation of the chances and changes of this mortal life such as you will find nowhere else save in the bible and in the books of christian men who have been taught by the bible  the man who wrote that psalm knew so much more than other men that he must have been indeed inspired by the spirit of truth and the holy ghost of god  and i should say i have come to this opinion mainly by comparing this psalm with the writings of heathens even the wisest and the best of them  for the heathens like all men used to have their troubles and to ask themselves who has sent this trouble  and why has he sent it  and their answers remain to us in their writings some worse some better some very foolish some tolerably wise but when one compares the heathen writings with this psalm or with any psalms or passages of the old testament which talk of gods dealings with man then we shall be altogether astonished at the superiority of the bible  the bible will seem to us quite infinitely wiser than heathen books on this matter as on others so much more simple and yet so much more deep so much more rational also and so much more true  agreeing so much more with the facts which we see happen round us  agreeing so much more with our own reason experience inward conscience about what is just and unjustthat we shall begin to see as much difference between heathen books and the old testament as there is between the dim dawn of morning and the full blaze of noonday light  one of the earliest heathen notions why troubles came was it seems that the gods were offended with men because they had not shown them due honour flattered them enough or offered sacrifices enough to them  or else they fancied that the gods envied men  grudged their prosperity did not like to see them too happy  that dark and base notion gradually faded away as men got higher notions of right and wrong and of the gods as the judges and avengers of wrong  then they began to think these troubles were punishments for doing wrong  the gods or god punished sin inflicting so much pain for so much sin very much as the heathens are apt to punish their criminals still and as christian nations used to punish theirs namely with shameful and horrible tortures before they began to find out that the end of punishment is not to torment but to reform the criminal wherever it is possible  but then the thought would comewhy after all should god if he be just and merciful punish my sin by pain and misery  how can it profit god how can it please god to give me pain  because it satisfies his justice  how can it do that  it would not satisfy mine  suppose my child or even my dog disobeyed me would it satisfy my sense of justice to beat him  it might satisfy my passion  but god has no passions  it would be base blasphemous to fancy that he takes pleasure in hurting me as i take pleasure in beating my dog when i lose my temper with it  god forbid  the old prophets saw that and criedhave i any pleasure in the death of him saith the lord and not rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  then naturally the thought would come into the mind of a wise and serious mani punish my child or my dog and god punishes me  may he not punish me for the same reason that i punish them  i punish them to correct them and make them better  surely god punishes me to correct me and make me better  i punish my child because i love him and wish him good  god punishes me because he loves me and desires that i may be a partaker of his holiness  and as soon as that blessed thought had risen up in any mans mind by the inspiration of gods holy spirit all the world would begin to look bright and clear and full of hope  this earth with all its sorrows and sufferings would look no longer to him as gods prison house where poor sinners sat tortured and wailing fast bound in misery and iron till they should pay the uttermost farthing which they never could pay  no  it would look to him as gods school house gods reformatory in which he is training and chastening and correcting the souls of men that he may deliver them from the ruin and misery which sin brings on them both the original sin which is born in them and the actual sin which they commit  then god appears to him a gracious and merciful father  he can see a blessed meaning and a wholesome use in all human suffering and he can break out as the psalmist does in this glorious psalm into praise and thanksgiving and call on mankind to give thanks to the lord for he is gracious and his mercy endureth for ever  in every kind of human suffering i say he sees now a meaning and a use  first he takes it seems his own countrymen the jews coming back from babylon into their own country after the seventy years captivity  they had been punished for their sins  but for what purpose  that they might know as ezekiel said that god was the lord  and when they cried unto him in their trouble he delivered them out of their distress  then he goes on to those who have brought themselves into poverty and shame and sit fast bound in misery and iron  it is their own fault  they have brought it on themselves by rebelling against the word of the lord and lightly regarding the counsel of the most highest  but god does not hate them  god is not going to leave them to the net which they have spread for their own feet  when they cry unto the lord in their troubles he delivers them out of their distress  god himself by strange and unexpected ways will deliver them from their darkness of ignorance and sin and from the danger and misery which they have brought upon themselves  then he goes on to those who have injured their health by their own folly till their soul abhors all manner of food and they are even hard at deaths door  neither does god hate them  they too are in gods schoolhouse  and when they cry to the lord in their trouble he will deliver them too out of their distress and send his word and heal them and save them from destruction  then he goes on to men who are exposed to danger and terror and death in their lawful calling and his instance is the seamenthose who go on to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters  the storms come up they know not when or how  but they are not the sport of a blind chance they are not the victims of the wrath of god  the wild sea too is his schoolhouse where they are to see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep and so by strange dangers and strange deliverances learn as i have seen many a seaman learn a courage and endurance a faith a resignation which puts us comfortable landsmen to shame  then he goes on to even a deeper matterto those terrible changes in nature so common in the east in which whole districts by earthquake or drought are rendered worthless and barren  they too he says are gods lessons though sharp ones enough  he turneth the rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein  again he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings  and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitation and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increase  lastly he goes on to political changes which bring a whole nation low into oppression and misery  they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow  he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way  yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock  the righteous shall see it and rejoice  and all iniquity shall stop her mouth  whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the lord  and so in all the changes of this mortal life he sees no real chance no real change but the orderly education of a just and loving father whose mercy endureth for ever who chastens men as a father chastens his children for their profit that they may be partakers of his holiness in which alone is life and joy health and wealth  surely here is a gospel and good newsnews so good that it turns what seems to the superstitious the worst of news into the very best  for it seems at first sight the worst of news that which the ninth article tells us that our original sin in every person born into this world deserves gods wrath and damnation  and so it would be the worst of news if god were merely a judge inflicting so much pain and misery for so much sin without any wish to mend us and save us  but if we remember only the blessed message of this psalm if we will remember that god is our father that god is educating us that god hath neither parts nor passions and that therefore gods wrath is not different or contrary to his love but that gods wrath is his love in another shape punishing men just because he loves menthen the ninth article will bring us the very best of news  we shall see that it is the best thing that can possibly befall us that our sin deserves gods wrath and damnation and that it would have been the worst thing which could possibly have befallen us if our sin had not deserved gods wrath and damnation  for if our sin had not deserved gods anger then he would not have been angry with it and then he would have left it alone instead of condemning it and dooming it to everlasting destruction as he has done and then if our sin had been left alone we should have been left alone to sin and sin on growing continually more wicked till our sin became our ruin  but now god hates our sin and loves us and therefore he desires above all things to deliver us from sin and burn our sin up in his unquenchable fire that we ourselves may not be burned up therein for if our sins live we shall surely die  but if our sins die then and then only shall we live  do these words seem strange to some of you  i doubt not that they will  but if they do that will be only a fresh proof to me that the bible is inspired by the holy ghost  yes nothing shews me how wide how deep how wise how heavenly the bible is as to see how far average christians are behind the bible in their way of thinking how the salvation which it offers is too free for them the love which it proclaims too wide for them the god whom it reveals too good for them  so that they shrink from taking the bible and trusting the bible in its fulness and are perpetually falling back on heathen notionsthe very old heathen notions from which this psalm delivers usconcerning what gods anger means and what gods punishment means because they are afraid of taking the words of scripture literally and fully and believing honestly the blessed news that god is love  they try to make gods ways as their ways and gods thoughts as their thoughts  but do not you do so  receive the bible in its fulness  believe that it tells you infinitely more of gods character and dealings than you can ever tell yourselves that gods ways are not as your ways nor gods thoughts as your thoughts even at their best  but that gods ways are always wider and deeper than yours were you the most learned of men gods thoughts are always more loving and just than yours were you the most holy of men and that when you have learned all that you can learn or that any man can learn out of the bible there will be still left behind treasures beside which you have not yet found out  for the riches of christ are unsearchable like the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of god whose onlybegotten son and perfect likeness he is and the man who reads the scripture with a single eye and an humble heart will see that the more he finds in the bible the more he has yet to find and that if he studied it to all eternity he would have fresh and fresh cause for ever to cry with the psalmist oh give thanks to the lord for he is gracious and his mercy endureth for ever  footnotes  328  plutarch
