does not much matter     chapter i the troubles of king prigio   prince ricardo and lady tied up p13jpg  im sure i dont know what to do with that boy said king prigio of pantouflia  if you dont know my dear said queen rosalind his illustrious consort i cant see what is to be done  you are so clever  the king and queen were sitting in the royal library of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages all equally familiar to king prigio  the queen could not read most of them herself but the king used to read them aloud to her  a good many years had passedseventeen in factsince queen rosalind was married but you would not think it to look at her  her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful her dark hair as dark and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing as on the day when she was a bride  and she was as fond of the king as when he was only prince prigio and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball  no i dont know what to do with dick said the king  he meant his son prince ricardo but he called him dick in private  i believe its the fault of his education his majesty went on  we have not brought him up rightly  these fairy books are at the bottom of his provoking behaviour and he glanced round the shelves  now when i was a boy my dear mother tried to prevent me from reading fairy books because she did not believe in fairies  but she was wrong you know said the queen  why if it had not been for all these fairy presents the cap of darkness and all the rest of them you never could have killed the firebeast and the icebeast andyou never could have married me the queen added in a happy whisper blushing beautifully for that was a foolish habit of hers  it is quite true said the king and therefore i thought it best to bring dick up on fairy books that he might know what is right and have no nonsense about him  but perhaps the thing has been overdone at all events it is not a success  i wonder if fathers and sons will ever understand each other and get on well together  there was my poor father king grognio he wanted me to take to adventures like other princes fighting firedrakes and so forth and i did not care for it till you set me on and he looked very kindly at her majesty  and now heres dick the monarch continued i cant hold him back  he is always after a giant or a dragon or a magician as the case may be he will certainly be ploughed for his examination at college  never opens a book  what does he care off after every adventure he can hear about  an idle restless youth  ah my poor country when i am gone what may not be your misfortunes under ricardo  here his majesty sighed and seemed plunged in thought  but you are not going yet my dear said the queen  why you are not forty  and young people will be young people  you were quite proud when poor dick came home with his first brace of gigantic fierce birds killed off his own sword and with such a pretty princess he had rescueddear jaqueline  im sure she is like a daughter to me  i cannot do without her  i wish she were a daughterinlaw i wish dick would take a fancy to marry her said the king  a nicer girl i never saw  and so accomplished added queen rosalind  that girl can turn herself into anythinga mouse a fly a lion a wheelbarrow a church  i never knew such talent for magic  of course she had the best of teachers the fairy paribanou herself but very few girls in our time devote so many hours to practice as dear jaqueline  even now when she is out of the schoolroom she still practises her scales  i saw her turning little dollie into a fish and back again in the bathroom last night  the child was delighted  in these times you must know princesses learned magic just as they learn the piano nowadays but they had their music lessons too dancing calisthenics and the use of the globes  yes shes a dear good girl said the king yet she looks melancholy i believe myself that if ricardo asked her to marry him she would not say no but thats just one of the things i object to most in dick round the world he goes rescuing ladies from every kind of horrorfrom dragons giants cannibals magicians and then when a girl naturally expects to be married to him as is usual off he rides  he has no more heart than a flounder  why at his age i  at his age my dear you were so hardhearted that you were quite a proverb  why i have been told that you used to ask girls dreadful puzzling questions like who was caesar borgia  what do you know of edwin and morcar and so on  i had not seen you then said the king  and ricardo has not seen her whoever she may be  besides he cant possibly marry all of them  and i think a girl should consider herself lucky if she is saved from a dragon or a giant without expecting to be married next day  perhaps but it is usual said the king and their families expect it and keep sending ambassadors to know what dicks intentions are  i would not mind it all so very much if he killed the monsters off his own sword as he did that first brace in fair fight  but ever since he found his way into that closet where the fairy presents lie everything has been made too easy for him  it is a royal road to glory or giantslaying made easy  in his cap of darkness a poor brute of a dragon cant see him  in his shoes of swiftness the giants cant catch him  his sword of sharpness would cut any oak asunder at a blow  but you were very glad of them when you made the icebeast and the fire beast fight and kill each other said the queen  yes my dear but it wanted some wit if i may say so to do that and dick just goes at it hammer and tongs anybody could do it  its intellect i miss in ricardo  how am i to know whether he could make a good fight for it without all these fairy things  i wonder what the young rogue is about today  hell be late for dinner as usual i daresay  i cant stand want of punctuality at meals remarked his majesty which is a sign that he was growing old after all for where is the fun of being expected always to come home in time for dinner when perhaps you are fishing and the trout are rising splendidly  young people will be young people said the queen  if you are anxious about him why dont you look for him in the magic crystal  now the magic crystal was a fairy present a great ball of glass in which if you looked you saw the person you wanted to see and what he was doing however far away he might be if he was on the earth at all 21  ill just take a look at it said the king it only wants threequarters of an hour to dinnertime  his majesty rose and walked to the crystal globe which was in a stand like other globes  he stared into it he turned it round and round and queen rosalind saw him grow quite pale as he gazed  i dont see him anywhere said the king and i have looked everywhere i do hope nothing has happened to the boy  he is so careless  if he dropped his cap of darkness in a fight with a giant why who knows what might occur  oh gio how you frighten me said the queen  king prigio was still turning the crystal globe  stop he cried i see a beautiful princess fastened by iron chains to a rock beside the sea in a lonely place  they must have fixed her up as a sacrifice to a seamonster like whatshername  this proves how anxious he was or being so clever and learned he would have remembered that her name was andromeda  i bet dick is not far off where there is an adventure on hand  but where on earth can he be     my word suddenly exclaimed the monarch in obvious excitement  what is it dear cried the queen with all the anxiety of a mother  why the sea where the girl is has turned all red as blood exclaimed the king  now it is all being churned up by the tail of a tremendous monster  he is a whopper  hes coming on shore the girl is fainting hes out on shore  he is extremely poorly blood rushing from his open jaws  hes dying  and hooray heres dick coming out of his enormous mouth all in armour set with sharp spikes and a sword in his hand  hes covered with blood but hes well and hearty  he must have been swallowed by the brute and cut him up inside  now hes cutting the beasts head off  now hes gone to the princess a very neat bow he has made her  dicks manners are positively improving  now hes cutting her iron chains off with the sword of sharpness  and now hes made her another bow and hes actually taking leave of her  poor thing  how disappointed she is looking  and shes so pretty too  i say rosalind shall i shout to him through the magic horn and tell him to bring her home here on the magic carpet  i think not dear the palace is quite full said the queen  but the real reason was that she wanted ricardo to marry her favourite princess jaqueline and she did not wish the new princess to come in the way  as you like said the king who knew what was in her mind very well besides i see her own people coming for her  im sorry for her but it cant be helped and dick is halfway home by now on the shoes of swiftness  i daresay he will not keep dinner waiting after all  but what a fright the boy has given me  at this moment a whirring in the air and a joyous shout were heard  it was prince ricardo flying home on his sevenleague boots  hi ross he shouted just weigh this beasts head  ive had a splendid day with a seamonster  get the head stuffed will you  well have it set up in the billiardroom  yes master dicki mean your royal highness said ross a highland keeper who had not previously been employed by a reigning family  its a fine head whatever he added meditatively  ross weighing the beasts head p28jpg  prince ricardo now came beneath the library window and gave his parents a brief account of his adventure  i picked the monster up early in the morning he said through the magic telescope father  what country was he in said the king  the country people whom i met called it ethiopia  they were niggers  and in what part of the globe is ethiopia ricardo  oh i dont know  asia perhaps answered the prince  the king groaned  that boy will never understand our foreign relations  ethiopia in asia he said to himself but he did not choose to make any remark at the moment  the prince ran upstairs to dress  on the stairs he met the princess jaqueline  oh dick are you hurt she said turning very pale  no not i but the monster is  i had a capital day jack rescued a princess too  was shewas she very pretty dick  oh  i dont know  pretty enough i daresay  much like other girls why you look quite white  whats the matter  now you look all right again for indeed the princess jaqueline was blushing  i must dress  im ever so late he said hurrying upstairs and the princess with a little sigh went down to the royal drawingroom     chapter ii princess jaqueline drinks the moon   the king and the prince p30jpg  when dinner was over and the ladies had left the room the king tried to speak seriously to prince ricardo  this was a thing which he disliked doing very much  theres very little use in preaching his majesty used to say to a man or rather a boy of another generation  my taste was for books i only took to adventures because i was obliged to do it  dicks taste is for adventures i only wish some accident would make him take to books but everyone must get his experience for himself and when he has got it he is lucky if it is not too late  i wish i could see him in love with some nice girl who would keep him at home  the king did not expect much from talking seriously to dick  however he began by asking questions about the days sport which ricardo answered with modesty  then his majesty observed that from all he had ever read or heard he believed ethiopia where the fight was to be in africa not in asia  i really wish ricardo that you would attend to your geography a little more  it is most necessary to a soldier that he should know where his enemy is and if he has to fight the dutch for instance not to start with his army for central asia  i could always spot them through the magic glass father said dick it saves such a lot of trouble  i hate geography  but the glass might be lost or broken or the fairies might take it away and then where are you  oh you would know where to go or mr belsham  now mr belsham was his tutor from oxford  but i shall not always be here and when i die  dont talk of dying sire said dick  why you are not so very old you may live for years yet  besides i cant stand the notion  you must live for ever  that sentiment is unusual in a crown prince thought the king but he was pleased for all that  well to oblige you ill try to struggle against old age he said but there are always accidents  now dick like a good fellow and to please me work hard all tomorrow till the afternoon  ill come in and help you  and theres always a splendid evening rise of trout in the lake just now so you can have your play after your work  youll enjoy it more and i daresay you are tired after a long day with the big game it used to tire me i remember  i am rather tired said dick and indeed he looked a little pale for a day in the inside of a gigantic seamonster is fatiguing from the heat and want of fresh air which are usually found in such places  i think ill turn in goodnight my dear old governor he said in an affectionate manner though he was not usually given to many words  then he went and kissed his mother and the princess jaqueline whom he engaged to row him on the lake next evening while he fished  and dont you go muffing them with the landingnet jack as you generally do said his royal highness as he lit his bedroom candle  i wish he would not call me jack said the princess to the queen  its better than lina my dear said her majesty who in late life had become fond of her little joke that always sounds as if someone else was fatterand i hope there is not someone else  the princess was silent and fixed her eyes on her book  presently the king came in and played a game with lina at picquet  when they were all going to bed he said  just come into the study lina  i want you to write a few letters for me  the princess followed him and took her seat at the writing table  the letters were very short  one was to herr schnipp tailor to the king and royal family another was to the royal swordmaker another to the bootmaker another to the optician another to the tradesman who supplied the august family with carpets and rugs another to his majestys hatter they were all summoned to be at the palace early next morning  then his majesty yawned apologised and went to bed  the princess also went to her room or bower as it was then called but not to sleep  she was unhappy that dick did not satisfy his father and that he was so careless and also about other things  and why does the king want all these tailors and hatters so suddenly telescopemakers and swordmakers and shoemakers too she asked herself as she stood at the window watching the moon  i could find out  i could turn myself into a dog or a cat and go into the room where he is giving his orders  but that is awkward for when the servants see rip that was the dog in two places at once they begin to think the palace is haunted and it makes people talk besides i know it is wrong to listen to what one is not meant to hear it is often difficult to be a magician and a good girl  the temptations are so strong stronger than most people allow for  so she remained with the moon shining on her pretty yellow hair and her white dress wondering what the king intended to do and whether it was something that dick would not like  how stupid of me she said at length after all the lessons i have had  why i can drink the moon  now this is a way of knowing what anyone else is thinking of and intends to do for the moon sees and knows everything  whether it is quite fair is another matter but at all events it is not listening  and anyone may see that if you are a magician like the princess jaqueline a great many difficult questions as to what is right and wrong at once occur which do not trouble other people  king prigios secret why he sent for the tailor and the other people was his own secret  the princess decided that she would not find it out by turning herself into rip or the cat whose name was semiramis and so far she was quite right  but she was very young and it never occurred to her that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by drinking the moon as by listening in disguise  as she grew older she learned to know better but this is just the danger of teaching young girls magic and for that very reason it has been given up in most countries  however the princess did not think about right and wrong unluckily  she went to the bookcase and took down her cornelius agrippa in one great tall black volume with silver clasps which nobody else could open for as the princess said there are books which it would never do to leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read them  nobody could undo the clasps however strong or clever he might be but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign and the book flew open at the right placebook iv chapter vi about the middle of page 576  the magic spell was in latin of course but the princess knew latin very well and soon she had the magic song by heart  then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf  then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame opposite the window  and into that mirror the moon shone white and full filling all the space of it so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light  now the whole room seemed to sway gently waving and trembling and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music as if it were filled with the waves of the sea  then the princess took a great silver basin covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver  she poured water into the basin and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the latin book  it was something like this in english     oh lady moon on the waters riding       on shining waters in silver sheen    show me the secret the heart is hiding       show me the truth of the thought oh queen     oh waters white where the moon is riding       that knows what shall be and what has been    tell me the secret the heart is hiding       wash me the truth of it clear and clean  as she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled and then fell still again and the princess knelt in the middle of the room and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water  then the princess raised the basin and stooped her mouth to it and drank the water spilling a few drops and so she drank the moon and the knowledge of the moon  then the moon was darkened without a cloud and there was darkness in the sky for a time and all the dogs in the world began to howl  when the moon shone again the princess rose and put out the two white lights and drew the curtains and presently she went to bed  the princess drinks the moon p41jpg  now i know all about it she said  it is clever everything the king does is clever and he is so kind that i daresay he does not mean any harm  but it seems a cruel trick to play on poor ricardo  however jaqueline is on the watch and ill show them a girl can do more than people thinkas indeed she could  after meditating in this way the princess fell sleep and did not waken till her maid came to call her  oh your royal highness whats this on the floor said the faithful rosina as she was arranging the princesss things for her to get up  why what is it asked the princess  ever so manyfour five six sevenlittle shining drops of silver lying on the carpet as if they had melted and fallen there  they have not hurt the carpet said the princess  oh dear the queen wont be pleased at all  it was a little chemical experiment i was trying last night  but she knew very well that she must have dropped seven drops of the enchanted water  no your royal highness the carpet is not harmed said rosina only your royal highness should do these things in the laboratory  her majesty has often spoke about it  you are quite right said the princess but as there is no harm done well say nothing about it this time  and rosina you may keep the silver drops for yourself  your royal highness is always very kind said rosina which was true but how much better and wiser it is not to begin to deceive  we never know how far we may be carried and so jaqueline found out  for when she went down to breakfast there was the king in a great state of excitement for him  its most extraordinary said his majesty  what is asked the queen  why didnt you notice it  no you had gone to bed before it happened but i was taking a walk in the moonlight on the balcony and i observed it carefully  observed what my dear asked the queen who was pouring out the tea  didnt you see it dick  late as usual you young dog the king remarked as ricardo entered the room  see what sir said dick  oh you were asleep hours before now i think of it  but it was the most extraordinary thing an unpredicted eclipse of the moon  you must have noticed it jaqueline you sat up later  how the dogs howled  no i mean yes murmured poor jaqueline who of course had caused the whole affair by her magic arts but who had forgotten in the excitement of the moment that an eclipse of the moon especially if entirely unexpected is likely to attract very general attention  jaqueline could not bear to tell a fib especially to a king who had been so kind to her besides fibbing would not alter the facts  yes i did see it she admitted blushing  had it not been predicted  not a word about it whispered anywhere said his majesty  i looked up the almanack at once  it is the most extraordinary thing i ever saw and ive seen a good many  the astronomers must be duffers said prince ricardo  i never thought there was much in physical science of any sort most dreary stuff  why they say the earth goes round the sun whereas any fool can see it is just the other way on  king prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth of his son and heir the hope of pantouflia  but what was the king to say in reply the astronomers of pantouflia who conceived that they knew a great deal had certainly been taken by surprise this time  indeed they have not yet satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon though they have written volumes about it  why it may be the sun next exclaimed his majesty  anything may happen  the very laws of gravitation themselves may go askew  at this moment the butler william who had been in the queens family when she was a girl entered and announced  some of the royal tradesmen by appointment to see your majesty  so the king who had scarcely eaten any breakfast much to the annoyance of the queen who was not agitated by eclipses went out and joined the tailors and the rest of them     chapter iii the adventure of the shopkeepers   man with sword p48jpg  dick went on with his breakfast  he ate cold pastry and poached eggs and ham and rolls and raspberry jam and hot cakes and he drank two cups of coffee  meanwhile the king had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders  they were all met in the royal study where the king made them a most splendid bow and requested them to be seated  but they declined to sit in his sacred presence and the king observed that in that case he must stand up  i have invited you here gentlemen he said on a matter of merely private importance but i must request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your duties  it is difficult i know not to talk about ones work but in this instance i am sure you will oblige me  your majesty has only to command said herr schnipp  there have been monarchs in neighbouring kingdoms who would have cut off all our heads after we had done a bit of secret business but the merest word of your majesty is law to your loving subjects  the other merchants murmured assent for king prigio was really liked by his people  he was always goodtempered and polite  he never went to war with anybody  he spent most of the royal income on public objects and of course there were scarcely any taxes to speak of  moreover he had abolished what is called compulsory education or making everybody go to school whether he likes it or not a most mischievous and tyrannical measure  a fellow who cant teach himself to read said the king is not worth teaching  for all these reasons and because they were so fond of the queen his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for king prigio  only one tradesman bowing very deep and blushing very much said  your majesty will you hear me for one moment  for an hour with pleasure herr schmidt said the monarch  it is an untradesmanlike and an unusual thing to decline an order and if your majesty asked for my hearts blood i am ready to shed it not to speak of anything in the line of my businessnamely boot and shoe making  but keep a secret from my wife i fairly own to your majesty that i can not  herr schmidt went down on his knees and wept  herr schmidt went down on his knees p52jpg  rise herr schmidt said the king taking him by the hand  a more honourable and chivalrous confession of an amiable weakness if it is to be called a weakness i never heard  sir you have been true to your honour and your prince in face of what few men can bear the chance of ridicule  there is no one here i hope but respects and will keep the secret of herr schmidts confession  the assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from tears  long live king prigio the good they exclaimed and vowed that everything should be kept dark  indeed sire said the swordmaker all the rest of us are bachelors  that is none the worse for my purpose gentlemen said his majesty but i trust that you will not long deprive me of sons and subjects worthy to succeed to such fathers  and now if herr schmidt will kindly find his way to the buttery where refreshments are ready i shall have the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your labours  thus speaking the king with another magnificent bow led the way upstairs to a little turretroom in a deserted part of the palace bidding the tradesmen enter he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things an old cap or two a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion an old broadsword a shabby old persian rug an ivory spy glass and other articles  these were in fact the fairy presents which had been given to the king at his christening and by aid of which and his natural acuteness he had in his youth succeeded in many remarkable adventures  the caps were the wishing cap and the cap of darkness  the rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the air wherever he wished to go  the sword was the sword of sharpness  the ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see however far off  the boots were the sevenleague boots which hopomythumb stole from the ogre about 1697 there were other valuable objects but these were the most useful and celebrated  of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were  now gentlemen said his majesty you see these old things  for reasons which i must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself i wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these with all the look of age  the tradesmen examined the objects each choosing that in his own line of business  as to the sword sire said the cutler it is an andrea ferrara a fine old blade  by a lucky accident i happen to have one at home in a small collection of ancient weapons exactly like it  this evening it shall be at your majestys disposal  perhaps herr schnitzler you will kindly write an order for it as i wish no one of you to leave the palace if you can conveniently stay till your business is finished  with pleasure your majesty says the cutler  as to the old rug said the upholsterer i have a persian one quite identical with it at home at your majestys service  then you can do like herr schnitzler who was the cutler  and i said the hatter have two old caps just like these part of a bankrupt theatrical stock  we are most fortunate said the king  the boots now i come to think of it are unimportant at least for the present  perhaps we can borrow a pair from the theatre  as for the glass said the optician if your majesty will allow me to take it home with me  i am afraid i cannot part with it said the king but that too is unimportant or not very pressing  then he called for a servant to order luncheon for the shopkeepers and paper for them to write their orders on  but no one was within hearing and in that very old part of the palace there were no bells  just pardon me for an instant while i run downstairs said his majesty and it seems a strange thing to ask but may i advise you not to sit down on that carpet  i have a reason for it  in fact he was afraid that someone might sit down on it and wish he was somewhere else and be carried away as was the nature of the carpet  king prigio was not absent a minute for he met william on the stairs but when he came back there was not one single person in the turretroom  where on earth are they cried the king rushing through all the rooms in that part of the castle  he shouted for them and looked everywhere but there was not a trace of tailor hatter optician swordmaker upholsterer  the king hastened to a window over the gate and saw the sentinels on duty  hi he called  and the sentinels turned round looked up and saluted  have you seen anyone go out he cried  no one sire answered the soldiers  the king who began to guess what had happened hurried back to the turretroom  there were all the tradesmen with parcels under their arms  what means this gentlemen said his majesty severely  for what reason did you leave the room without my permission  they all knelt down humbly imploring his compassion  get up you donkeys said the king forgetting his politeness  get up and tell me where you have been hiding yourselves  the hatter came forward and said  sire you will not believe me indeed i can scarcely believe it myself  nor none of us cant said the swordmaker  we have been home and brought the articles  all orders executed with punctuality and dispatch he added quoting his own advertisement without thinking of it  on this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the andrea ferrara blade which was exactly like the sword of sharpness  the upholsterer undid his parcel and there was a persian rug which no one could tell from the magical carpet  the hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel when he suddenly remembered what the king in his astonishment had not noticed that he had a cap on himself  he pulled it off in a hurry and the king at once saw that it was his wishing cap and understood all about the affair  the hatter in his absence had tried on the wishing cap and had wished that he himself and his friends were all at home and back again with their wares at the palace  and what he wished happened of course as was natural  in a moment the king saw how much talk this business would produce in the country and he decided on the best way to stop it  seizing the wishing cap he put it on wished all the tradesmen including the shoemaker back in the town at their shops and also wished that none of them should remember anything about the whole affair  in a moment he was alone in the turretroom  as for the shopkeepers they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed something odd but as it went no further of course they did not talk about it and nobody was any the wiser  owl that i am said king prigio to himself  i might have better wished for a complete set of sham fairy things which would not work  it would have saved a great deal of trouble but i am so much out of the habit of using the cap that i never thought of it  however what i have got will do very well  then putting on the cap of darkness that nobody might see him he carried all the real fairy articles away except the sevenleague boots to his own room where he locked them up leaving in their place the sham wishing cap the sham cap of darkness the sham sword of sharpness and the carpet which was not a magic carpet at all  his idea was of course that ricardo would start on an expedition confiding in his fairy things and he would find that they did not act then he would be left to his own cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape  that would teach him thought the king to depend on himself and to set a proper value on cleverness and learning and minding his book  of course he might have locked the things up and forbidden ricardo to touch them but that might have seemed harsh  and as you may easily imagine with all the powers at his command the king fancied he could easily rescue ricardo from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians or monsters  he only wanted to give him a fright or two and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than himself     chapter iv two lectures   the prince with the telescope p64jpg  for several days prince ricardo minded his books and according to his tutors made considerable progress in polite learning  perhaps he ought not to be praised too highly for this because in fact he saw no means of distinguishing himself by adventures just at that time  every morning he would climb the turret and sweep the horizon and even much beyond the horizon with the ivory spyglass  but look as he would he saw no monsters preying on humankind anywhere nor princesses in distress  to be sure he saw plenty of poor people in distress and being a goodhearted though careless lad dick would occasionally fly off with the purse of fortunatus in his pocket and give them as much money as they neededit cost him nothing  but this was not the kind of adventure which he enjoyed  dragons for his money  one day the princess jaqueline took a curious plan of showing ricardo how little interest after all there is in performing the most wonderful exploits without any real difficulty or danger  they were drifting before a light breeze on a hill lake ricardo was fishing and jaqueline was sculling a stroke now and then just to keep the boat right with the wind  ricardo had very bad sport when suddenly the trout began to rise all over the lake  dick got excited and stumbled about the boat from stern to bow tripping over jaquelines feet and nearly upsetting the vessel in his hurry to throw his flies over every trout he saw feeding  drifting in a light breeze p66jpg  but as too often occurs they were taking one particular fly which was on the water and would look at nothing else  oh bother them cried ricardo  i cant find a fly in my book in the least like that little black one they are feeding on  he tried halfadozen different flyhooks but all to no purpose he lost his temper got his tackle entangled in jaquelines hair and then in the landingnet and though such a big boy he was nearly crying with vexation  the princess jaqueline with great pains and patience disentangled the casting line first from her hair which ricardo was anxious to cut the great stupid oafher pretty hair then from the landingnet but dick had grown sulky  its no use he said i have not a fly that will suit  lets go home and he threw a tin can at a rising trout  now dick said jaqueline you know i can help you  i did not learn magic for nothing  just you look the other way for a minute or two and you will find the right fly at the end of your line  dick turned his head away it is not proper to look on at magical arts and then in a moment saw the right hook on his cast but jaqueline was not in the boat  she had turned herself into an artificial fly a small black gnat and dick might set to his sport again  what a trump that girl is he said aloud  clever too and he began casting  he got a trout every cast great big ones over a pound and soon he had a basketful  but he began to feel rather bored  theres not much fun taking them he said when they are so silly  at that very moment he noticed that the fly was off his cast and jaqueline was sitting at the oars  you see ricardo she said i was right after all  there is not much pleasure in sport that is easy and certain  now apply this moral to dragonkilling with magic instruments  it may be useful when one is obliged to defend oneself but surely a prince ought not to give his whole time to nothing else  dick had no answer ready so he only grumbled  youre always preaching at me jack everybody always is  i seem to have been born just to be preached at  some people are and it does grow rather tedious in the long run  but perhaps what jaqueline said may have made some impression on ricardo for he stuck to his books for weeks and was got into decimal fractions and euclid  all this of course pleased the king very much and he began to entertain hopes of ricardos becoming a wise and learned prince and a credit to his illustrious family  things were not always to go smoothly far from it and it was poor jaqueline who fell into trouble next  she had been very ready to lecture dick as we saw and took a good deal of credit to herself for his steadiness  but one day king prigio happened to meet jaquelines maid rosina on the stairs and as rosina was a pretty girl and the king was always kind to his dependents he stopped to have a chat with her  why rosina what a pretty little silver cross you are wearing he said and he lifted a curious ornament which hung from a chain on rosinas neck  it consisted of seven drops of silver set like this  the drops p72jpg   may i look at it his majesty asked and rosina all in a flutter took it off and gave if to him  hm said the king  very curious and pretty  may i ask you where you got this rosina  hm said the king  very curious and pretty p73jpg  now rosina generally had her answer ready and i am very sorry to say that she did not always speak the truth when she could think of anything better  on this occasion she was anxious to think of something better for fear of getting jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom  but rosina was fluttered as we said by the royal kindness and she could think of nothing but to curtsy and say  please your majesty the princess gave me the drops  very interesting said the king  there is a little white moon shining in each of them  i wonder if they shine in the dark  he opened the door of a cupboard which had no windows where the housemaid kept her mops and brooms and shut himself in  yes there was no mistake the darkness was quite lighted up with the sheen of the seven little moons in the silver  the king looked rather grave  if you can trust me with this cross till tomorrow rosina i should like to have it examined and analysed  this is no common silver  of course rosina could only curtsy but she was very much alarmed about the consequences to her mistress  after luncheon the king asked jaqueline to come into his study as he often did to help him with his letters  when they had sat down his majesty said  my dear jaqueline i never interfere with your pursuits but i almost doubt whether cornelius agrippa is a good book for a very young lady to read  the fairy paribanou i am sure taught you nothing beyond the ordinary magical accomplishments suited to your rank but there are a great many things in the cornelius which i think you should not study till you are older and wiser  what does your majesty mean said poor jaqueline feeling very uncomfortable for the king had never lectured her before  why said his majesty taking the silver cross out of his pocket did you not give this to rosina  yes sire i did give her the drops  she had them made up herself  then give it back to her when you see her next  i am glad you are frank jaqueline  and you know of course that the drops are not ordinary silver  they are moon silver and that can only be got in one way so far as i know at leastwhen one spills the water when he or she is drinking the moon  now there is only one book which tells how that can be done and there is only one reason for doing it namely to find out what is some other persons secret  i shall not ask you whose secret you wanted to find out but i must request you never to do such a thing again without consulting me  you can have no reason for it such as a great king might have whose enemies are plotting against his country  oh sire i will tell you everything cried jaqueline  no dont i dont want to know  i am sure you will make no use of your information which you think i should not approve of  but there is another thingthat eclipse of the moon  oh jaqueline was it honourable or fair to the astronomers and men of science to say nothing about it  their european reputations are seriously injured  poor jaqueline could only cry  never mind said his majesty comforting her  there is no great harm done yet and perhaps they would not believe you if you did explain but just think if some people ceased to believe in science what would they have left to believe in  but you are young of course and cannot be expected to think of everything  i never thought about it at all wept jaqueline  evil is wrought by want of thought said the king quoting the poet now run away dry your tears and i think you had better bring me that book and ill put it back in one of the lockedup shelves  later when you are older we shall see about it  the princess flew to her room and returned with her book  and the king kissed her and told her to go and see if her majesty meant to take a drive  ill never deceive him again never    unless it is quite necessary said the princess to herself  indeed it is not so easy to deceive the king  what a lot he has read  in fact king prigio had been very studious when a young man before he came to the throne  poor child thought the king  no doubt she was trying her fortune wondering if ricardo cares for her a little  of course i could not let her tell me that poor child  in this guess as we know his majesty was mistaken which seldom happened to him  i wonder who she is the king went on speaking to himself  that great booby ricardo saved her from wild birds which were just going to eat her  she was fastened to a mountain top but where thats the question  ricardo never has any notion of geography  it was across the sea he noticed that but which seaatlantic pacific the black sea the caspian the sea of marmora the red sea the indian ocean the german ocean the mediterranean  her ornaments were very peculiar there was a broad gold sun on her breast  i must look at them again some day she said she was being sacrificed to wild birds which her people worshipped because there was some famine or war or trouble in the country  she said she was a daughter of the sun but that of course is absurd unlessby jove  i believe i have it said the king and he went into the royal library and was looking for some old spanish book when his secretary came and said that the russian ambassador was waiting for an interview with his majesty  dismal old muscovite sighed the king  a monarch has not a moment to himself for his private studies  ah prigio why wert thou not born to a private station  but duty before everything and wreathing his royal countenance in smiles his majesty prepared to give count snoreonski an audience  it was all about the attitude of pantouflia in the event of a polish invasion of russia  the king reassured count snoreonski affirming that pantouflia while deeply regretting the disturbed relations between two states in whose welfare she was deeply interested would ever preserve an attitude of benevolent neutrality unless her own interests were threatened  i may give your message to my august mistress the czarina said the ambassador  by all means adding an expression of my tender interest in her majestys health and welfare said the king presenting the count at the same time with a magnificent diamond snuffbox containing his portrait  the old count was affected to tears and withdrew while king prigio said  i have not lost a day i have made an amiable but very stupid man happy  such are or rather such were the toils of monarchs     chapter v prince ricardo crosses the path of history   hand reaching for a crown with wings p83jpg  i say jack said prince ricardo one morning heres a queer letter for me  king prigio had gone to a distant part of his dominions on business of importance and the young people were sitting in the royal study  the letter which ricardo handed to jaqueline was written on a great broad sheet of paper folded up without any envelope as was the custom then and was sealed with a huge seal in red wax  i dont know the arms ricardo said  oh ricardo how you do neglect your heraldry  old green stocking is in despair over your ignorance  now green stocking was the chief herald of pantouflia just like blue mantle in england  why these are the royal arms of england you great ignorant dick  but rome isnt in england is itand the postmark is roma thats rome in some lingo i expect  it is in latin anyhow i know  mortuus est romaehe died at rome  its in the latin grammar  lets see what the fellow says anyhow added ricardo breaking the seal  he begins prins and dear cousin  i say jaqueline he spells it prins now it is prince  he must be an ignorant fellow  people in glass houses should not throw stones dick said jaqueline  he signs himself charles p w said ricardo looking at the end who on earth can he be  why does he not put p w charles if these are his initials  look here its rather a long letter you might read it to us jack  the princess took the epistle and began  how nice it smells all scented  the paper is giltedged too  luxurious beggar whoever he is said ricardo  well he says prins and dear cousinyou and me oh what grammar are much the same age i being fifteen next birthday and we should be better ackwainted  all the wurld has herd of the fame of prins ricardo whose name is feerd and his sord dreded wherever there are monsters and tirants  prins you may be less well informed about my situation  i have not killed any dragguns there being nun of them here but i have been under fiar at gaeta  wheres gaeta dick  never heard of it said ricardo  well it is in italy and it was besieged lately  he goes on and i am told that i did not misbehave myself nor disgrace the blud of bruce  ive heard of robert bruce said dick he was the man who did not kill the spider but he cracked the head of sir harry bohun with one whack of his axe  i remember him well enough  well your correspondent seems to be a descendant of his  thats getting more interesting said dick  i wish my father would go to war with somebody  with the sword of sharpness id make the enemy whistle  drive on jack  as a prins in distress i apeal to your valler so renouned in europe i am kept out of my own my royal father king gemswell this is the worst spelling i ever saw in my life  he means king jamesmy royal father king gems being druv into exile by a crewl usurper the elector of hannover  king gems is old and likes a quiat life but i am determined to make an effort if i go alone and europe shall here of prince charles  having heardas who has notof your royal highnesss courage and sordsmanship i throw myself at your feet and implore you to asist a prins in distres  let our sords be drawn together in the caus of freedom and an outraged country my own  i remain prins and dear cuzen charles p w  p w means prince of wales added jaqueline  he is turned out of england you know and lives at rome with his father  i like that chap said prince ricardo  he does not spell very well as you say but i sometimes make mistakes myself and i like his spirit ive been looking out for an adventure but the big game is getting shy and my sword rusts in his scabbard  ill tell you what jackive an idea  ill put him on the throne of his fathers its as easy as shelling peas and as for that other fellow the elector ill send him back to hanover wherever that may be and he can go on electing and polling his vote in peace and quietness at home  just wait till i spot the places  the prince ran up to the turret fetched the magic spyglass and looked up london rome and hanover as you would in a map  well dick but how do you mean to do it  do itnothing simpler  i just take my sevenleague boots run over to rome pick up prince charles put him on the magic carpet fly to london clap the cap of darkness on him so that nobody can see him set him down on the throne of his fathers pick up the elector carry him over to his beloved hanover and the trick is donewhat they call a bloodless revolution in the history books  but if the english dont like prince charles when they get him  like him theyre sure to like him a young fellow like that  besides ill take the sword with me in case of accidents  but dick it is your fathers rule that you are never to meddle in the affairs of other countries and never to start on an expedition when he is not at home  oh he wont mind this time  theres no kind of danger and im sure he will approve of the principle of the thing  kings must stick up for each other  why some electing characters might come here and kick us out  your father is not the sort of king who is kicked out said jaqueline  but there was no use in talking to dick  he made his simple preparations and announced that he would be back in time for luncheon  what was poor jaqueline to do  she was extremely anxious  she knew as we saw what king prigio had intended about changing the fairy things for others that would not work  she was certain dick would get himself into a scrape how was she to help him  she made up her mind quickly while dick was putting his things together  she told the queen it was the nearest to the truth she could think of that she was going for a turn with dick  then she changed herself into a mosquitoa kind of gnat that bitesand hid herself under a fold of dicks coat  of course he knew nothing about her being there  then he started off in his seven league boots and before you could say jack robinson he was in rome in the grounds of a splendid palace called the villa borghese  there he saw an elderly gentleman in a great curled wig sound asleep on a seat beneath a tree  the old gentleman had a long pale melancholy face and across his breast was a broad blue ribbon with a star  ah how changed was king james from the handsome prince who had loved fair beatrix esmond thirty years ago  near him were two boys not quite so old as prince ricardo  the younger was a pretty dark boy with a funny little roundabout white wig  he was splendidly dressed in a lightblue silk coat a delicate little lace scarf was tied round his neck he had lace ruffles falling about his little ringed hands he had a pretty sword with a gold handle set with diamondsin fact he was the picture of a little dandy  the other lad had a broad scotch bonnet on and no wig beautiful silky yellow locks fell about his shoulders  he had laid his sword on the grass  he was dressed in tartan which ricardo had never seen before and he wore a kilt which was also new to ricardo who wondered at his bare legsfor he was wearing shoes with no stockings  in his hand he held a curious club with a long slim handle and a head made heavy with lead and defended with horn  with this he was aiming at a little white ball and suddenly he swung up the club and sent the ball out of sight in the air over several trees  prince ricardo stepped up to this boy took off his cap and said  i think i have the honour of addressing the prince of wales  prince charles started at the sight of a gentleman in long ridingboots girt with a broadsword which was not then generally worn and carrying a persian rug under his arm  that is what i am called sir he said by those who give me the title which is mine by right  may i inquire the reason which offers me the pleasure of this unexpected interview  oh im ricardo of pantouflia says dick  i had a letter from you this morning and i believe you wanted to see me  from pantouflia sir said prince charles why that is hundreds of leagues away  it is a good distance said dick but a mere step when you wear seven league boots like mine  my dear prince said charles throwing himself into his arms with rapture and kissing him in the italian fashion which dick did not half like you are indeed worthy of your reputation and these are the celebrated sevenleague boots  harry he cried to his brother come here at once and let me present you to his royal highness our illustrious ally prince ricardo of pantouflia  the duke of yorkprince ricardo of pantouflia  gentlemen know each other  the prince bowed in the most stately manner  i say said dick who was seldom at all up to the standard of royal conversation whats that game you were playing  its new to me  you sent the ball a tremendous long shot  the game is called golf and is the favourite pastime of my loyal scottish subjects said prince charles  for that reason that i may be able to share the amusements of my people whom i soon hope to lead to a glorious victory followed by a peaceful and prosperous reign i am acquiring a difficult art  im practising walking without stockings too to harden my feet he said in a more familiar tone of voice  i fancy there are plenty of long marches before me and i would not be a spears length behind the hardiest highlander  by jove  i respect you said dick with the greatest sincerity but i dont think with me on your side you will need to make many marches  it will all be plain sailing  pray explain your plan said prince charles  the task of conquering back the throne of my fathers is not so simple as you seem to suppose  ive done a good many difficult things said dick modestly  the conqueror of the magician gorgonzola and the giant who never knew when he had enough need not tell me that said prince charles with a courteous allusion to two of ricardos most prodigious adventures  oh  ive very little to be proud of really said dick blushing anyone could do as much with my fairy things of which no doubt you have heard  with a sword of sharpness and a cap of darkness and so forth you have a great pull over almost anything  and you really possess those talismans said the prince  certainly i do  you see how short a time i took in coming to your call from pantouflia  and has holy church asked the duke of york with anxiety given her sanction and her blessing to those instruments of an art usually in her wisdom forbidden  oh never mind holy church harry said prince charles  this is business  besides the english are protestants  i pray for their conversion daily said the duke of york  the end justifies the means you know answered prince charles  alls fair in love and war  i should think so said ricardo especially against those brutes of electors they give trouble at home sometimes  you too are plagued with an elector asked prince charles  an elector thousands of them answered dick who never could understand anything about politics  prince charles looked puzzled but requested dick to explain his great plan  they sat down on the grass and ricardo showed them how he meant to manage it just as he had told jaqueline  as he said nothing could be simpler  lets start at once he said and inducing prince charles to sit down on the magic carpet he cried  england  st jamess palace  but nothing happened  the carpet was not the right magic carpet but the one which king prigio had put in its place  get on  england i said cried dick  but there they remained under the chestnut tree sitting on the carpet above the flowery grass  but there they remained p99jpg  prince charles leaped to his feet his face like fire his eyes glowing  enough of this fooling sir he said  it is easy but cowardly to mock at an unfortunate prince  take your carpet and be off with you out of the gardens or your shoulders shall taste my club  there has been some mistake ricardo said the wrong carpet has been brought by accident or the carpet has lost its power  in this sacred city blessed by the presence of his holiness the pope and the relics of so many martyrs and saints magic may well cease to be potent said the duke of york  nonsense  you are an impostor sir  leave my presence cried prince charles lifting his golfclub  dick caught it out of his hand and broke across his knee as fine a driver as ever came from robertsons shop at st andrews  the quarrels of princes are not settled with clubs sir  draw and defend yourself he said kicking off his boots and standing in his socks on the grass  think of the horror of poor jaqueline who witnessed this terrible scene of passion from a fold in prince ricardos dress  what could the girl do to save the life of two princes the hopes of one nation and of a respectable minority in another  in a moment prince charless rapier was shining in the sunlight and he fell on guard in the most elegant attitude his left hand gracefully raised and curved  dick drew his sword but as suddenly threw it down again  hang it he exclaimed i cant hit you with this  this is the sword of sharpness it would cut through your steel and your neck at a touch  he paused and thought  let me beseech your royal highness he said to the duke of york who was in a terrible taking to lend your blade to a hand not less royal than your own  give him it hal said prince charles who was standing with the point of his sword on the ground and the blade bent  he seems to believe in his own nonsense  the duke yielded his sword dick took it made a nourish and rushed at prince charles  now ricardo had always neglected his fencing lessons  wheres the good of it he used to ask all that stamping and posturemaking and ha haing  the sword of sharpness is enough for me  but now he could not in honour use the sword of sharpness so on he came waving the rapier like a claymore and made a slice at prince charless head  the prince very much surprised parried in prime riposted and touched dick on the hand  at this moment the princess jaqueline did what she should have thought of sooner  she flew out of dicks coat and stung old king james on his royal nose  the king wakened nearly crushed the princess so dangerous is the practice of magic to the artist and then leaped up and saw dicks blade flying through the air glittering in the sun  the prince had disarmed him  hullo whats all this  a moi mes gardes cried the old king in french and english and then he ran up just in time to hear prince charles say  sir take your life  i cannot strike an unarmed man  a prince you may be but you have not learned the exercises of gentlemen  what is all this carluccio asked the old king  swords out brawling in my very presence blood drawn for dicks hand was bleeding a good deal  prince charles as briefly as possible explained the unusual nature of the circumstances  a king must hear both sides said king james  what reply have you sir to make to his royal highnesss statements  the carpet would not work sir said dick  it never happened before had i used my own sword and he explained its properties the prince of wales would not be alive to tell his story  i can say no more beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which i could not have foreseen a gentleman can only say that he is sorry  but wait he added i can at least prove that my confidence in some of my resources is not misplaced  bid me bring you somethinganythingfrom the ends of the earth and it shall be in your hands  i cant say fairer  king james reflected while prince ricardo was pulling on the sevenleague boots which he had kicked off to fight more freely and while the duke of york bandaged dicks hand with a kerchief  bring me said his majesty lord lovats snuffmull  where does he live said dick  at gortuleg in scotland answered king james  dick was out of sight before the words were fairly spoken and in ten minutes was back bearing a large ramshorn snuffbox with a big cairngorm set in the top and the frazer arms  most astonishing said king james  a miracle said the duke of york  you have entirely cleared your character said the king  your honour is without a stain though it is a pity about the carpet  your nobility in not using your magical sword under the greatest provocation reconciles me to this fresh blighting of my hopes  all my allies fail me said the poor king with a sigh you alone have failed with honour carluccio embrace the prince  they fell into each others arms  prince said dick you have taught me a lesson for which i shall not be ungrateful  with any blade a gentleman should be able to hold his own in fair fight  i shall no longer neglect my fencing lessons  with any blade said prince charles i shall be happy to find prince ricardo by my side in a stricken field  we shall not part till i have induced you to accept a sword which i can never hope to draw against another adversary so noble  in war my weapon is the claymore  here the prince offered to ricardo the rubystudded hilt of his rapier which had a beautiful white sharkskin sheath  you must accept it sir said king james the hilt holds the rubies of john sobieski  thank you prince said ricardo for the weapon which i shall learn to wield and i entreat you to honour me by receiving this fairy giftwhich you do not needa ring which makes all men faithful to the wearer  the prince of wales bowed and placed the talisman on his finger  ricardo then after a few words of courtesy on both parts picked up his useless carpet took his farewell of the royal party and with jaqueline still hidden under his collar returned at full speed but with a heavy heart to pantouflia where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon  ricardo never interfered in foreign affairs again but his ring proved very useful to prince charles as you may have read in history     chapter vi ricardos repentance   bottle of weapon salve p109jpg  the queen as it happened fortunately was lunching with one of the ladies of her court  ricardo did not come down to luncheon and jaqueline ate hers alone and very mournful she felt  the prince had certainly not come well out of the adventure  he had failed as all attempts to restore the stuarts always did he had been wounded though he had never received a scratch in any of his earlier exploits and if his honour was safe and his good intentions fully understood that was chiefly due to jaqueline and to the generosity of king james and prince charles  i wonder what hes doing she said to herself and at last she went up and knocked at ricardos door  go away he said i dont want to see anybody  who is it  its only mejaqueline  its only me p111jpg  go away  i want nobody  do let me in dear dick i have good news for you said the princess  what is it said ricardo unlocking the door  why do you bother a fellow so  he had been cryinghis hand obviously hurt him badly he looked and indeed he was very sulky  how did you get on in england dick asked the princess taking no notice of his bandaged hand  oh dont ask me said ricardo  ive not been to england at all  why what happened  everything that is horrid happened said dick and then unable to keep it any longer to himself he said ive failed to keep my promise ive been insulted ive been beaten by a fellow younger than myself and oh how my hand does hurt and ive got such a headache  and what am i to say to my mother when she asks why my arm is in a sling and what will my father say  im quite broken down and desperate  i think ill run away to sea and indeed he looked very wild and miserable  tell me how it all happened dick said the princess im sure its not so bad as you make out  perhaps i can help you  how can a girl help a man cried dick angrily and poor jaqueline remembering how she had helped him at the risk of her own life when king james nearly crushed her in the shape of a mosquito turned her head away and cried silently  im a beast said dick  i beg your pardon jack dear  you are always a trump i will say but i dont see what you can do  then he told her all the story which of course she knew perfectly well already except the part played by the mosquito of which he could not be aware  i was sure it was not so bad as you made it out dick she said  you see the old king who is not very wise but is a perfectly honourable gentleman gave you the highest praise  she thought of lecturing him a little about disobeying his father but it did not seem a good opportunity  besides jaqueline had been lectured herself lately and had not enjoyed it  what am i to say to my mother dick repeated  we must think of something to say said jaqueline  i cant tell my mother anything but the truth ricardo went on  heres my hand how it does sting and she must find out  i think i can cure it said jaqueline  didnt you say prince charles gave you his own sword  yes there it is but what has that to do with it  everything in the world to do with it my dear dick  how lucky it is that he gave it to you  and she ran to her own room and brought a beautiful golden casket which contained her medicines  taking out a small phial marked in letters of emerald  weapon salve  the princess drew the bright sword extracted a little of the ointment from the phial and spread it on a soft silk handkerchief  what are you going to do with the sword asked ricardo  polish it a little said jaqueline smiling and she began gently to rub with the salve the point of the rapier  as she did so ricardos arm ceased to hurt and the look of pain passed from his mouth  why i feel quite better he said  i can use my hand as well as ever  then he took off the stained handkerchief and lo there was not even a mark where the wound had been  for this was the famous weapon salve which you may read about in sir kenelm digby and which the lady of branxholme used in the lay of the last minstrel  but the secret of making it has long been lost except in pantouflia  you are the best girl in the world jaqueline said ricardo  you may give me a kiss if you like and i wont call you jack or laugh at you for reading books any more  theres something in books after all  the princess did not take advantage of dicks permission but advised him to lie down and try to sleep  i say though he said what about my father  the king need never be told anything about it said jaqueline need he  oh that wont do  i tell my father everything but then i never had anything like this to tell him before  dont you think jaqueline you might break it to him  hes very fond of you  just tell him what i told you its every word of it true and he ought to know  he might see something about it in the mercure de france  this was the newspaper of the period  i dont think it will get into the papers said jaqueline smiling nobody could tell except the king and the princes and they have reasons for keeping it to themselves  i dont trust that younger one said dick moodily i dont care for that young man  anyway my father must be told and if you wont i must  well ill tell him said jaqueline  and now lie down till evening  after dinner in the conservatory jaqueline told king prigio all about it  his majesty was very much moved  what extraordinary bad luck that family has he thought  if i had not changed the rug the merest accident prince charles would have dined at st jamess tonight and king george in hanover  it was the very nearest thing  this meddling with practical affairs will never do he said aloud  dick has had a lesson sire said the princess  he says hell never mix himself up with politics again whatever happens  and he says he means to study all about them for he feels frightfully ignorant and above all he means to practise his fencing  these remarks were not part of the conversation between ricardo and jaqueline but she considered that dick meant all this and really he did  that is well as far as it goes said the king  but jaqueline about that mosquito for she had told him this part of the adventure  that was a very convenient mosquito though i dont know how dick was able to observe it from any distance  i see your hand in that my dear and i am glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the good fairy paribanou  jaqueline he added solemnly laying his hand on her head you have saved the honour of pantouflia which is dearer to me than life  without your help i tremble to think what might have occurred  the princess blushed very much and felt very happy  now run away to the queen my dear said his majesty i want to think things over  he did think them over and the more he thought the more he felt the inconvenience attending the possession of fairy things  an eclipse one day as nearly as possible a revolution soon after he said to himself  but for jaqueline ricardos conduct would have been blazed abroad england would have been irritated  it is true she cannot get at pantouflia very easily we have no seacoast and we are surrounded by friendly countries  but it would have been a ticklish and discreditable position  i must really speak to dick which he did next morning after breakfast  you have broken my rules ricardo he said  true there is no great harm done and you have confessed frankly but how am i to trust you any longer  ill give you my sacred word of honour father that ill never meddle with politics again or start on an expedition without telling you  i have had enough of it  and ill turn over a new leaf  ive learned to be ashamed of my ignorance and ive sent for francalanza and ill fence every day and read like anything  very good said the king  i believe you mean what you say  now go to your fencing lesson  but i say father cried ricardo was it not strange about the magic carpet  i told you not to trust to these things said the king  some enchanter may have deprived it of its power it may be worn out someone may have substituted a common persian rug anything may happen  you must learn to depend on yourself  now be off with you im busy  and remember you dont stir without my permission  the prince ran off and presently the sounds of stamping feet and un deux doublez degagez vite contre de carte and so forth might be heard over a great part of the royal establishment     chapter vii prince ricardo and an old enemy   the yellow dwarf p123jpg  there is one brute i wish i could get upsides with said ricardo at breakfast one morning his mouth full of sardine  really ricardo your language is most unprincely said his august father i am always noticing it  you mean i suppose that there is one enemy of the human race whom you wish to abolish  what is the name of the doomed foe  well he is the greatest villain in history said ricardo  you must have read about him sir the yellow dwarf  yes i have certainly studied what is told us about him said the king he is no favourite of mine  he is the only one if you notice sir of all the scoundrels about whom our ancestors inform us who escaped the doom which he richly merited at the sword of a good knight  you may here remark that since dick took to his studies he could speak when he chose like a printed book which was by no means the case before  if you remember sir he polished offi mean he slewthe king of the golden mines and the beautiful though frivolous princess frutilla  all that the friendly mermaid could do for them was to turn them into a pair of beautiful trees which intertwine their branches  not much use in that sir  and nothing was done to the scoundrel  he may be going on still and with your leave ill go and try a swordthrust with him francalanza says im improving uncommon  youll take the usual sword of sharpness said his majesty  what sir to a dwarf  not i indeed a common small sword is good enough to settle him  they say he is very cunning of fence said the king and besides i have heard something of a diamond sword that he stole from the king of the golden mines  very likely he has lost it or sold it the shabby little miscreant however ill risk it  and now i must make my preparations  the king did not ask what they were as a rule they were simple  but being in the shop of the optician that day standing with his back to the door he heard dick come in and order a pair of rosecoloured spectacles with which he was at once provided  the people of pantouflia were accustomed to wear them saying that they improved the complexions of ladies whom they met and added cheerfulness to things in general  just plain rosecoloured glass herr spex said dick im not short sighted  the boy is beginning to show some sense said the king to himself knowing the nature and the difficulties of the expedition  ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a dandie dinmont terrier named pepper and the king who understood the motive of this precaution silently approved  the lad has come to some purpose and forethought the king said and he gladly advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles eggs which can rarely be got quite fresh  when jaqueline had made the crocodiles eggs with milletseed and sugarcandy into a cake for the dwarfs lions ricardo announced that his preparations were complete  not to be the mere slave of custom he made this expedition on horseback and the only magical thing he took with him was the cap of darkness the one which would not work but he did not know that and this he put in his pocket for future use  with plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches and cold mincedcollop sandwiches he pricked forth into the wilderness making for the country inhabited by the yellow dwarf  the princess was glad he was riding for she privately accompanied him in the disguise of a wasp and a wasp of course could not have kept up with him in his sevenleague boots  hang that wops said prince ricardo several times buffeting it with his pockethandkerchief when it buzzed in his ear and round his horses head  hang that wops said prince ricardo p129jpg  meanwhile king prigio had taken his precautions which were perfectly simple  when he thought ricardo was getting near the place the king put on his wishing cap sat down before the magic crystal ball and kept his eye on the proceedings being ready to wish the right thing to help ricardo at the right moment  he left the window wide open smoked his cigar and seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct of a promising son  the prince rode and rode sometimes taking up pepper on his saddle passing through forests sleeping at lonely inns fording rivers till one day he saw that the air was becoming yellow  he knew that this showed the neighbourhood of jaunia or daunia the country of the yellow dwarf  he therefore drew bridle placed his rosecoloured spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse for the yellow light of jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly  as he pricked on his horse stumbled and nearly came on its nose  the prince noticed that a steel chain had been drawn across the road  what caitiff has dared he exclaimed when his hat was knocked off by a wellaimed orange from a neighbouring orangetree and a vulgar voice squeaked  hi blinkers  there was the yellow dwarf an odious little figure sitting sucking an orange in the tree swinging his wooden shoes and grinning all over his wrinkled face  well young blinkers said the dwarf what are you doing on my grounds  youre a prince by your look  yah down with kings  im a man of the people  youre a dwarf of the worst description thats what you are said ricardo and let me catch you and ill flog the life out of you with my ridingwhip  the very face of the dwarf even seen through rosecoloured spectacles made him nearly ill  yes when you can catch me said the dwarf but thats not today nor yet tomorrow  what are you doing here  are you an ambassador maybe come to propose a match for me  im not proud ill hear you  they say theres a rather welllooking wench in your parts the princess jaqueline  mention that ladys name you villain cried dick and ill cut down your orangetree and he wished he had brought the sword of sharpness for you cannot prod down a tree with the point of a rapier  fancy her yourself said the dwarf showing his yellow teeth with a detestable grin while ricardo turned quite white with anger and not knowing how to deal with this insufferable little monster  im a widower i am said the dwarf though im out of mourning for he wore a dirty claycoloured yellow jacket  my illustrious consort the princess frutilla did not behave very nice and i had to avenge my honour in fact im open to any offers however humble  going at an alarming sacrifice  come to my box and he pointed to a filthy clay cottage all surrounded by thistles nettles and black boggy water and ill talk over your proposals  hold your impudent tongue said dick  the princess frutilla was an injured saint and as for the lady whom i shall not name in your polluting presence i am her knight and i defy you to deadly combat  we may imagine how glad the princess was when disguised as a wasp she heard dick say he was her knight not that in fact he had thought of it before  oh youre for a fight are you sneered the dwarf  i might tell you to hit one of your own weight but im not afraid of six of you  yah mammys brat  look here young blinkers i dont want to hurt you  just turn old dobbins head and trot back to your mammy queen rosalind at pantouflia  does she know youre out  ill be into you pretty quick said ricardo  but why do i bandy words with a miserable peasant  and dont get much the best of them either said the dwarf provokingly  but ill fight if you will have it  the prince leaped from his horse leaving pepper on the saddlebow  no sooner had he touched the ground than the dwarf shouted  hi to him billy to him daniel at him good lions at him and with an awful roar two lions rushed from a neighbouring potatopatch and made for ricardo  these were not ordinary lions history avers each having two heads each being eight feet high with four rows of teeth their skins as hard as nails and bright red like morocco 135  the prince did not lose his presence of mind hastily he threw the cake of crocodiles eggs milletseed and sugarcandy to the lions  this is a dainty which lions can never resist and running greedily at it with four tremendous snaps they got hold of each other by their jaws and their eight rows of teeth were locked fast in a grim and deadly struggle for existence  the dwarf took in the affair at a glance  cursed be he who taught you this he cried and then whistled in a shrill and vulgar manner on his very dirty fingers  at his call rushed up an enormous spanish cat ready saddled and bridled and darting fire from its eyes  to leap on its back while ricardo sprang on his own steed was to the active dwarf the work of a moment  then clapping spurs to its sides his spurs grew naturally on his bare heels horrible to relate like a cocks spurs and taking his cat by the head the dwarf forced it to leap on to ricardos saddle  the diamond sword which slew the king of the golden minesthat invincible sword which hews iron like a reedwas up and flashing in the air  at this very moment king prigio seeing in the magic globe all that passed and despairing of ricardos life was just about to wish the dwarf at jericho when through the open window with a tremendous whirr came a huge vulture and knocked the kings wishing cap off  wishing was now of no use  this odious fowl was the fairy of the desert the dwarfs trusted ally in every sort of mischief  the vulture flew instantly out of the window and ah with what awful anxiety the king again turned his eyes on the crystal ball only a parents heart can know  should he see ricardo bleeding at the feet of the abominable dwarf  the king scarcely dared to look never before had he known the nature of fear  however look he did and saw the dwarf uncatted and pepper the gallant dandie dinmont with his teeth in the throat of the monstrous spanish cat  no sooner had he seen the cat leap on his masters saddlebow than pepper true to the instinct of his race sprang at its neck just behind the headthe usual placeand with an awful and despairing mew the cat peter was its name gave up its life  the dwarf was on his feet in a moment waving the diamond sword which lighted up the whole scene and yelling taunts  pepper was flying at his heels and with great agility was keeping out of the way of the invincible blade  ah screamed the dwarf as pepper got him by the ankle  call off your dog you coward and come down off your horse and fight fair  at this moment bleeding yellow blood dusty mad with pain the dwarf was a sight to strike terror into the boldest  dick sprang from his saddle but so terrific was the appearance of his adversary and so dazzling was the sheen of the diamond sword that he put his hand in his pocket drew out as he supposed the sham cap of darkness and placed it on his head  yah whos your hatter screamed the infuriated dwarf  i see you and he disengaged feinted in carte and made a lunge in seconde at dick which no mortal blade could have parried  the prince thanks to his excellent training just succeeded in stepping aside but the dwarf recovered with astonishing quickness  coward lache poltroon runaway he hissed through his clenched teeth and was about to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal when the princess jaqueline in her shape as a wasp stung him fiercely on the wrist  with an oath so awful that we dare not set it down the dwarf dropped the diamond sword sucked his injured limb and began hopping about with pain  in a moment prince ricardos foot was on the blade of the diamond sword which he passed thrice through the body of the yellow dwarf  squirming fearfully the little monster expired his last look a defiance his latest word an insult  yah  giglamps  prince ricardo wiped the diamond blade clean from its yellow stains  the fight with the yellow dwarf p141jpg  princess frutilla is avenged he cried  then pensively looking at his fallen foe peace to his ashes he said he died in harness  turning at the word he observed that the two lions were stiff and dead locked in each others gory jaws  at that moment king prigio looking in the crystal ball gave a great sigh of relief  alls well that ends well he said lighting a fresh cigar for he had allowed the other to go out in his excitement but it was a fight  i am not satisfied his majesty went on reflecting with this plan of changing the magical articles  the first time was of no great importance and i could not know that the boy would start on an expedition without giving me warning  but in todays affair he owes his safety entirely to himself and pepper for he had not seen the wasp the fairy of the desert quite baffled me it was terrible  i shall restore the right fairy things tonight  as to the fairy of the desert he said forgetting that his wishing cap was on i wish she were dead  a hollow groan and the sound of a heavy body falling interrupted the king  he looked all about the room but saw nothing  he was alone  she must have been in the room invisible said the king and of course she has died in that condition  but i must find her body  the king groped about everywhere like a blind man and at last discovered the dead body of the wicked fairy lying on the sofa  he could not see it of course but he felt it with his hands  this is very awkward he remarked  i cannot ring for the servants and make them take her away  there is only one plan  so he wished she were in her family pyramid in the egyptian desert and in a second the sofa was unoccupied  a very dangerous and revengeful enemy is now removed from ricardos path in life said his majesty and went to dress for dinner  meanwhile ricardo was riding gaily home  the yellow light of jaunia had vanished and pure blue sky broke overhead as soon as the dauntless dwarf had drawn his latest breath  the poor trembling people of the country came out of their huts and accompanied dick cheering and throwing roses which had been yellow roses but blushed red as soon as the dwarf expired  they attended him to the frontiers of pantouflia singing his praises which ricardo had the new and inestimable pleasure of knowing to be deserved  it was sharp work he said to himself but much more exciting and glorious than the usual business  on his return dick did not fail to mention the wasp and again the king felt how great was his debt to jaqueline  but they did not think it well to trouble the good queen with the dangers dick had encountered     chapter viii the giant who does not know when he has had enough 146   the enormous letter p146jpg  one morning the post brought a truly enormous letter for dick  it was as broad as a tablecloth and the address was written in letters as long as a hoopstick  i seem to know that hand said ricardo but i thought the fingers which held the pen had long been cold in death  he opened with his sword the enormous letter which was couched in the following terms     the giant as does not know when he has had enuf presents his    compliments to prince ricardo and i having recovered from the    effects of our little recent rally will be happy to meet you in the    old place for a returnmatch  i not being handy with the pen the    giant hopes you will excuse mistakes and bad writing  dick simply gazed with amazement  if ever i thought an enemy was killed and done for it was that giant said he  why i made mere mincecollops of him  however he could not refuse a challenge not to speak of his duty to rid the world of so greedy and odious a tyrant  dick therefore took the usual things which the king had secretly restored but first he tried themputting on the cap of darkness before the glass in which he could not see himself  on second thoughts he considered it unfair to take the cap  all the other articles were in working order  jaqueline on this occasion followed him in the disguise of a crow flying overhead  on reaching the caverna huge tunnel in the rockwhere the giant lived ricardo blew a blast on the horn which hung outside and in obedience to a written notice knocked also with a mace provided by the giant for that purpose  presently he heard heavy footsteps sounding along the cavern and the giant came out  he was above the common height for giants and his whole face and body were seamed over with little red lines crossing each other like tartan  these were marks of encounters in which he had been cut to bits and come together again for this was his peculiarity which made him so dangerous  if you cut off his head he went on just as before only without it and so about everything else  by dint of magic he could put his head on again just as if it had been his hat if you gave him time enough  on the last occasion of their meeting ricardo had left him in a painfully scattered condition and thought he was done for but now except that a bird had flown away with the little finger of his left hand and one of his ears the giant was as comfortable as anyone could be in his situation  mornin sir he said to dick touching his forehead with his hand glad to see you looking so well  no bad feeling i hope on either side  none on mine certainly said ricardo holding out his hand which the giant took and shook but duty is duty and giants must go  the modern world has no room for them  thats hearty said the giant i like a fellow of your kind  now shall we toss for corners  all right said dick calling heads and winning  he took the corner with the sun on his back and in the giants face  to it they went the giant aiming a blow with his club that would have felled an elephant  dick dodged and cut off the giants feet at the ankles  first blood for the prince said the giant coming up smiling  half minute time  he occupied the halfminute in placing the feet neatly beside each other as if they had been a pair of boots  round iithe giant sparring for wind ricardo cuts him in two at the waist  the giant folded his legs up neatly like a pair of trousers and laid them down on a rock  he had now some difficulty in getting rapidly over the ground and stood mainly on the defensive and on his waist  round iiidick bisects the giant  both sides now attack him on either hand and the feet kick him severely  no kicking said dick  nonsense all fair in war said the giant  but do not let us pursue this sanguinary encounter in all its horrible details  let us also rememberotherwise the scene would be too painful for an elegant mind to contemplate with entertainmentthat the giant was in excellent training and thought no more of a few wounds than you do of a crack on the leg from a cricketball  he well deserved the title given him by the fancy of the giant who does not know when he has had enough        the contest was over dick was resting on a rock  the lists were strewn with interesting but imperfect fragments of the giant when a set of double teeth of enormous size flew up out of the ground and caught ricardo by the throat  in vain he strove to separate the teeth when the crow stooping from the heavens became the princess jaqueline and changed dick into a wrena tiny bird so small that he easily flew out of the jaws of the giant and winged his way to a tree whence he watched the scene  but the poor princess jaqueline  to perform the feat of changing dick into a bird she had of course according to all the laws of magic to resume her own natural form  there she stood a beautiful trembling maiden her hands crossed on her bosom entirely at the mercy of the giant  no sooner had dick escaped than the monster began to collect himself and before jaqueline could muster strength to run away or summon to her aid the lessons of the fairy paribanou the giant who never knew when he had enough was himself again  a boy might have climbed up a tree for giants are no treeclimbers any more than the grizzly bear but jaqueline could not climb  she merely stood pale and trembling  she had saved dick but at an enormous sacrifice for the sword and the seven league boots were lying on the trampled grass  he had not brought the cap of darkness and in the shape of a wren of course he could not carry away the other articles  dick was rescued that was all and the princess jaqueline had sacrificed herself to her love for him  the giant picked himself up and pulled himself together as we said and then approached jaqueline in a very civil way for a person of his breeding head in hand  let me introduce myself he said and mentioned his name and titles may i ask what you are doing here and how you came  let me introduce myself he said p154jpg  poor jaqueline threw herself at his feet and murmured a short and not very intelligible account of herself  i dont understand said the giant replacing his head on his shoulders  what to do with you im sure i dont know  please dont eat me did you say  why what do you take me for  im not in that line at all low i call it  jaqueline was somewhat comforted at these words dropped out of the giants lips from a considerable height  but they call you the giant who does not know when he has had enough said jaqueline  and proud of the title not enough of fighting  of punishment i am a glutton or so my friends are pleased to say  a brace of oxen a drove of sheep or two are enough for me the giant went on complacently but forgetting to mention that the sheep and the oxen were the property of other people  where am i to put you till your friends come and pay your ransom the giant asked again and stared at jaqueline in a perplexed way  i cant take you home with me that is out of the question  i have a little woman of my own and shes not very fond of other ladies especially she would like to poison them that have good looks  now jaqueline saw that the giant big as he was courageous too was afraid of his wife  ill tell you what ill do ill hand you over to a neighbour of mine who is a bachelor  a bachelor giant would that be quite proper said jaqueline trying to humour him  hes not a giant bless you hes a queer fellow it is not easy to say what he is  hes the earthquaker him as shakes the earth now and then and brings the houses about peoples ears  jaqueline fairly screamed at hearing this awful news  hush be quiet do said the giant  youll bring out my little woman and she is not easy to satisfy with explanations when she finds me conversing with a lady unbeknown to her  the earthquaker wont do you any harm its only for safe keeping ill put you with him  why he dont waken not once in fifty years  hes quite the dormouse  turns on his bed now and then and things upstairs get upset more or less but as a rule a child could play with him  come on  then taking jaqueline up on one hand on which she sat as if on a chair he crossed a few ranges of mountains in as many strides  in front was one tall blue hill with a flattened peak and as they drew near the princess felt a curious kind of wind coming round her and round her  you have heard of whirlpools in water well this was just like a whirlpool of air  even the giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it then he tossed jaqueline up and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her as if on a tide of water always round and round in narrowing circles till she was sucked down into the hollow hill  even as she went she seemed to remember the hill as if she had dreamed about it and the shape and colour of the country  but presently she sank softly on to a couch in a beautifullylighted rocky hall  all around her the floor was of white and red marble but on one side it seemed to end in black nothing  jaqueline after a few moments recovered her senses fully and changing herself into an eagle tried to fly up and out  but as soon as she was in the funnel the whirlpool of air always sucking down and down was too strong for her wings  she was a prisoner in this great gleaming hall ending in black nothingness  so she resumed her usual form and walking to the edge of the darkness found that it was not empty air but something black soft and strongsomething living  it had no form or shape or none that she could make out but it pulsed with a heart jaqueline placed her foot on this curious thing when a voice came like thunder heard through a featherbed  not near time to get up yet and then there was a snore and the great hall rocked like a ship at sea  it was the earthquaker  the habits of this monstrous animal are very little known as of course he never comes above ground or at least very seldom when he makes tracks like a dry riverbed across country  we are certain that there are earthquakers otherwise how can we account for earthquakes  but how to tackle an earthquaker how to get at him and what to do with him when you have got at him are questions which might puzzle even king prigio  it was not easy to have the better of an enchantress like jaqueline and a prince like ricardo  in no ordinary circumstances could they have been baffled and defeated but now it must be admitted that they were in a very trying and alarming situation especially the princess  the worst of it was that as jaqueline sat and thought and thought she began to remember that she was back in her own country  the hills were those she used to see from her fathers palace windows when she was a child  and she remembered with horror that once a year her people used to send a beautiful girl to the earthquaker by way of keeping him quiet as you shall hear presently  and now she heard light footsteps and a sound of weeping and lo a great troop of pretty girls passed sweeping in and out of the halls in a kind of procession and looking unhappy and lost  jaqueline ran to them  where am i who are you she cried in the language of her own country which came back to her on a sudden  we are nurses of the earthquaker they said  our duty is to sing him asleep and every year he must have a new song and every year a new maiden must be sent down from earth with a new sleepy song she has learned from the priests of manoa the city of the sun  are you the new singer  no im not said jaqueline  i dont know the priests of manoa i dont know any new sleepy song  i only want to find the way out  there is no way or we should have found it said one of the maidens and if you are the wrong girl by the day after tomorrow they must send the right one otherwise the earthquaker will waken and shake the world and destroy manoa the city of the sun  then they all wept softly in the stillness  can we get anything to eat here asked poor jaqueline at last  she was beginning to be very hungry and however alarmed she might be she felt that dinner would not be unwelcome  the tallest of the maidens clapped her hands and immediately a long table was spread by unseen sprites with meringues and cold chicken and several sorts of delicious ices  we shall desert jaqueline who was rather less alarmed when she found that she was not to be starved at all events and return to prince ricardo whom we left fluttering about as a little goldencrested wren he followed the giant and jaqueline into the whirlpool of air as far as he dared and when he saw her vanish down the cone of the hill he flew straight back to pantouflia     chapter ix prigio has an idea   ricardo and semiramis p165jpg  a weary and wayworn little bird was prince ricardo when he fluttered into the royal study window in the palace of pantouflia  the king was out at a council meeting knowing that ricardo had the right things all in good order he was not in the least anxious about him  the king was out but semiramis was insemiramis the great grey cat sitting on a big book on the top of the library steps  now semiramis was very fond of birds and no sooner did ricardo enter and flutter on to a table than semiramis gathered herself together and made one fell spring at him  she just caught his tail feather  in all his adventures the prince had never been in greater danger  he escaped but no more and went flying round the ceiling looking for a safe place  finally he perched on a chandelier that hung from the roof  here he was safe and so weary was he that he put his head under his wing and fell fast asleep  he was awakened by the return of the king who threw himself on a sofa and exclaimed  oh that prime minister his dulness is as heavy as lead much heavier in fact  then his majesty lit a cigar and took up a volume he certainly was a sad bookworm  dick now began to fly about the room brushing the kings face and trying to attract his notice  poor little thing said his majesty  and dick alighted and nestled in his breast  on seeing this semiramis began to growl as cats do when they are angry and slowly approached his majesty  get out semiramis said the king and lifting her by the neck he put her out of the room and shut the door at which she remained scratching and mewing  dick now crept out of the royal waistcoat flew to the kings ear twittered pointed out of the window with one claw and lying down on his back pretended to be dead  then he got up again twittered afresh pointed to the wishing cap and finally convinced the king that this was no common fowl  an enchanted prince or princess said prigio such as i have often read of  who can it be  not jaqueline she could change herself back in a moment  by the way where is jaqueline  he rang the bell and asked the servant to look for the princess  semiramis tried to come in but was caught and shut up downstairs  after doing this the man replied that her royal highness had not been in the palace all day  the king rushed to the crystal ball looked all the world over but no princess  he became very nervous and at that moment dick lighted on the crystal ball and put his claw on the very hill where jaqueline had disappeared  then he cocked his little eye at the king  nay she is somewhere in the unknown centre of south america said his majesty somewhere behind mount roraima where nobody has ever been  i must look into this  then he put on the wishing cap and wished that the bird would assume his natural shape if he was under enchantment as there seemed too good reason to believe  instantly dick stood before him  instantly dick stood before him p170jpg  ricardo cried the king in horror and in this disguise  where have you been  what have you done with jaqueline  where are the sevenleague boots  where is the sword of sharpness  speak  get up for dick was kneeling and weeping bitterly at the royal feet  all lost said dick  poor jaqueline she was the best girl and the prettiest and the kindest  and the earthquakers got her and the giants got the other things dick ended crying bitterly  calm yourself ricardo said his majesty very pale but calm and determined  here take a glass of port and explain how all this happened  dick drank the wine and then he told his miserable story  you may well sob  why didnt you use the cap of darkness  mere conceit  but there is no use in crying over spilt milk  the thing is to rescue jaqueline  and what are we to say to your mother  thats the worst of it all said dick  mother will break her heart  i must see her at once said the king and break it to her  this was a terrible task but the queen had such just confidence in her prigio that she soon dried her tears remarking that heaven would not desert jaqueline and that the king would find a way out of the trouble  his majesty retired to his study put his head in his hands and thought and thought  the thing is of course he said to destroy the earthquaker before he wakens but how  what can kill such a monster  prodding him with the sword would only stir him up and make him more vicious  and i know of no other beast we can set against him as i did with the firebeast and the icebeast when i was young  oh for an idea  then his mind somehow went back to the council and the ponderous stupidity of the prime minister  heavier than lead said the king  by george  i have a plan  if i could get to the place where they keep the stupidity i could carry away enough of it to flatten out the earthquaker  then he remembered how in an old italian poem he had read about all the strange lumberroom of odd things which is kept in the moon  that is the advantage of reading knowledge is power and you mostly get knowledge that is really worth having out of good old books which people do not usually read  if the stupidity is kept in stock up in the moon and comes from there falling naturally down on the earth in small quantities i might obtain enough for my purpose thought king prigio  buthow to get to the moon  there are difficulties about that  but difficulties only sharpened the ingenuity of this admirable king  the other fellow had a flying horse said he  by the other fellow king prigio meant an italian knight astolfo who in old times visited the moon and there found and brought back the common sense of his friend orlando as you may read in the poem of ariosto  now reasoned king prigio if there is a flying horse at all he is in the stables of the king of delhi  i must look into this  taking the magic spyglass the king surveyed the world from china to peru and sure enough there was the famous flying horse in the kings stable at delhi  hastily the king thrust his feet into the shoes of swiftnessso hastily indeed that as the poet says he madly crammed a lefthand foot into a righthand shoe  but this many people think is a sign of good luck so he put the shoes on the proper feet and in a few minutes was in the presence of the great mogul  the monarch received him with some surprise but with stately kindness and listened to prigio while he explained what he wanted  i am only too happy to assist so adventurous a prince remarked the great mogul  this is like old times  every horse in my stable is at your service but as you say only the flying horse is of any use to you in this expedition  he clapped his hands the grand vizier appeared and the king gave orders to have the flying horse saddled at once  he then presented king prigio with a large diamond and came down into the courtyard to see him mount  hes very fresh said the groom who held the bridle has not been out of the stable for three hundred years  prigio sprang into the saddle among the salaams of the dusky multitude and all the ladies of the seraglio waved their scented handkerchiefs out of the windows  the king as he had been instructed turned a knob of gold in the saddle of the flying horse then kissed his hand to the ladies and giving the steed his head cried in excellent persian  to the moon  up flew the horse with an easy action and the kings head nearly swam with the swiftness of the flight  soon the earth below him was no bigger than a top spinning on its own axis see geography books for this and as night fell earth was only a great red moon  king prigio on the flying horse p178jpg  through the dark rode king prigio into the silver dawn of the moon  all now became clear and silvery the coasts of the moon came into sight with white seas breaking on them and at last the king reached the silver walls and the gate of opal  before the gate stood two beautiful ladies one was fair with yellow locks the colour of the harvest moon  she had a crown of a golden snake and white waterlilies and her dress now shone white now red now golden and in her hand was the golden pitcher that sheds the dew and a golden wand  the other lady was as dark as nightdark eyes dark hair her crown was of poppies  she held the ebony wand of sleep  her dress was of the deepest blue sown with stars the king knew that they were the maidens of the bright and the dark side of the moonof the side you see and of the side that no one has ever seen except king prigio  he stopped the flying horse by turning the other knob in the saddle alighted and bowed very low to each of the ladies  daring mortal what make you here they asked  and then the king told them about jaqueline and the earthquaker and how he needed a great weight of stupidity to flatten him out with  the ladies heard him in silence and then they said  follow us and they flew lightly beside the flying horse till they had crossed all the bright side of the moon above the silver palaces and silver seas and reached the summit of the mountains of the moon which separate the bright from the dark side  here i may go no further said the bright lady and beyond as you see all is darkness and heavy sleep  then she touched prigio with her golden wand with twisted serpents and he became luminous light raying out from him and the dark lady too shone like silver in the night and on they flew over black rocks and black rivers till they reached a huge mountain like a mountain of coal many thousand feet high for its head was lost in the blackness of darkness  the dark moonlady struck the rock with her ebony wand and said open and the cliffs opened like a door and they were within the mountain  here said the dark lady is the storehouse of all the stupidity hence it descends in showers like stardust on the earth whenever this mountain which is a volcano is in eruption  only a little of the stupidity reaches the earth and that only in invisible dust yet you know how weighty it is even in that form  indeed madam said the king no one knows it better than i do  then make your choice of the best sort of stupidity for your purpose said the dark lady  and in the light which flowed from their bodies king prigio looked round at the various kinds of solid stupidity  there it all lay in massesthe stupidity of bad sermons of ignorant reviewers of bad poems of bad speeches of dreary novels of foolish statesmen of ignorant mobs of fine ladies of idle naughty boys and girls and the king examined them all and all were very very heavy  but when he came to the stupidity of the learnedof dull blind writers on shakspeare and homer and the biblethen king prigio saw that he had found the sort he wanted and that a very little of it would go a long way  he never could have got it on the saddle of the flying horse if the dark lady had not touched it with her ebony wand and made it light to carry till it was wanted for his purpose  when he needed it for use he was to utter a certain spell which she taught him and then the lump would recover its natural weight so he easily put a great block on his saddlebow and he and the dark lady flew back till they reached the crest of the mountains of the moon there she touched him with her ebony wand and the silver light which the bright lady had shed on him died from his face and his body and he became like other men  you see your way said the dark lady pointing to the bright moon of earth shining far off in the heavens  then he knelt down and thanked her and she murmured strange words of blessing which he did not understand but her face was grave and kind and he thought of queen rosalind his wife  then he jumped on the flying horse galloped down and down till he reached his palace gate called for ricardo set him behind him on the saddle and away they rode above land and wide seas till they saw the crest of the hollow hill where jaqueline was with the earthquaker beyond it they marked the glittering spires and towers of manoa the city of the sun and thither said king prigio who had been explaining how matters stood to ricardo we must ride for i believe they stand in great need of our assistance  had we not better go to jaqueline first sir said ricardo  no said the king i think mine is the best plan  manoa whose golden spires and pinnacles are shining below us is the city of the sun which sir walter raleigh and the spaniards could never find so that men have doubted of its existence  we are needed there to judge by that angry crowd in the marketplace  how they howl     chapter x the end   man with rock p186jpg  it was on a strange sight that the king and ricardo looked down from the flying horse  beneath them lay the city of manoa filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow of the mountains  here were palaces all carved over with faces of men and beasts and with twisted patterns of serpents  the city walls were built of huge square stones and among the groves towered pyramids on which the people did service to their gods  from every temple top came the roar of beaten drums great drums of serpentskin  but in the centre of the chief square of the town was gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets of gold and glittering dresses of feathers  among them ran about priests with hideous masks crying them on to besiege and break down the royal palace  from the battlements of the palace the kings guardsmen were firing arrows and throwing spears  the mob shot arrows back some of them tipped with lighted straw to burn the palace down  but in the very centre of the square was a clear space of ground on which fell the shadow of a tall column of red stone all carved with serpents and faces of gods  beside it stood a figure horrible to see a man clothed in serpent skins whose face was the grinning face of a skull but the skull was shining black and red in patches and a long white beard flowed from beneath it  this man mounted on a kind of altar of red stone waved his hand and yelled and seemed to point to the shadow of the column which fell across the square  the people were so furious and so eager that they did not at first notice king prigio as he slowly descended  but at last the eyes within the skull looked up and saw him and then the man gave a great cry rent his glittering dress of serpentskin and held up his hands  then all the multitude looked up and seeing the flying horse let their weapons fall and the man of the skull tore it from his face and knelt before king prigio with his head in the dust  thou hast come oh pachacamac as is foretold in the prophecy of the cord of the venerable knots  thou hast come but behold the shadow of the stone  thou art too late oh lord of the earth and the sea  then he pointed to the shadow which naturally was growing shorter as the sun drew near midday  he spoke in the language of the ancient incas of peru which of course prigio knew very well and he also knew that pachacamac was the god of that people  i have come prigio said with presence of mind as it has been prophesied of old  riding on a beast that flies said the old priest even as the oracle declared  glory to pachacamac even though we die today  in what can i help my people said prigio  thou knowest why should we instruct thee  thou knowest that on midsummerday every year before the shadow shrinks back to the base of the huaca 190 of manoa we must offer a maiden to lull the earthquaker with a new song  lo now the shadow shrinks to the foot of the huaca and the maid is not offered  for the lot fell on the daughter of thy servant the inca and he refuses to give her up  one daughter of his he says has been sacrificed to the sacred birds the cunturs the birds were found slain on the hilltop no man knows how but the maiden vanished  why it must have been jaqueline  i killed the birds said ricardo in pantouflian  silence not a word said the king sternly  and what makes you bear arms against the inca he asked the old man  we would slay him and her answered the priest for when the shadow shrinks to the foot of the stone the sun will shine straight down into the hollow hill of the earthquaker and he will waken and destroy manoa and the temples of the sun  then wherefore would you slay them when you must all perish  the people oh pachacamac would have revenge before they die  oh folly of men said the king solemnly then he cried lead me to the inca this day you shall not perish  is it not predicted in the cord of the venerable knots that i shall slay this monster  hasten oh pachacamac for the shadow shortens said the priest  lead me to the inca answered prigio  at this the people arose with a great shout for they too had been kneeling and sending a flag of truce before king prigio the priest led him into the palace  the ground was strewn with bodies of the slain and through them prigio rode slowly into the courtyard where the inca was sitting in the dust weeping and throwing ashes on his long hair and his golden raiment  the king bade the priest remain without the palace gates then dismounted and advancing to the inca raised him and embraced him  i come a king to a king he said  my cousin take courage your sorrows are ended  if i do not slay the earthquaker sacrifice me to your gods  the prophecy is fulfilled said the inca and wept for joy  yet thou must hasten for it draws near to noon  then prigio went up to the golden battlements and saying no word waved his hand  in a moment the square was empty for the people rushed to give thanks in the temples  wait my coming my cousin said prigio to the inca i shall bring you back the daughter that was lost when i have slain your enemy  the inca would have knelt at his feet but the king raised him and bade him prepare such a feast as had never been seen in manoa  the lost are found today he said be you ready to welcome them  then mounting the flying horse with dick beside him he rose towards the peak of the hill where the earthquaker had his home  already the ground was beginning to tremble the earthquaker was stirring in his sleep for the maiden of the new song had not been sent to him and the year ended at noon and then he would rise and ruin manoa  the sun was approaching midday and prigio put spurs to the flying horse  ten minutes more and the sun would look straight down the crater of the hollow hill and the earthquaker would arouse himself when the light and the heat fell on his body  already the light of the sun shone slanting halfway down the hollow cone as the whirlpool of air caught the flying horse and drew him swiftly down and down to the shadowy halls  there knelt and wept the nurses of the earthquaker on the marble floor but jaqueline stood a little apart very pale but not weeping  ricardo had leaped off before the horse touched the ground and rushed to jaqueline and embraced her in his arms and oh how glad she was to see him so that she quite forgot her danger and laughed for joy  oh you have come you have come i knew you would come she cried  then king prigio advanced the mighty weight in his hand to the verge of the dreadful gulf of the earthquaker  the dim walls grew radiant a long slant arm of yellow light touched the black body of the earthquaker and a thrill went through him and shook the world so that far away the bells rang in pantouflia  a moment more and he would waken in his strength and once awake he would shatter the city walls and ruin manoa even now a great mass of rock fell from the roof deep down in the secret caves and broke into flying fragments and all the echoes roared and rang  king prigio stood with the mighty mass poised in his hands  die he cried and he uttered the words of power the magic spell that the dark moon lady had taught him  then all its invincible natural weight came into the mass which the king held and down it shot full on the body of the earthquaker and where that had been was nothing but a vast abyss silent empty and blank and bottomless  far far below thousands of miles below in the very centre of the earth lay the dead earthquaker crushed flat as a sheet of paper and the sun of midsummerday shone straight down on the dreadful chasm and could not waken him any more for ever  the king drew a long breath  stupidity has saved the world he said and with only strength to draw back one step from the abyss he fell down hiding his face in his hands  but jaquelines arms were round his neck and the maidens brought him water from an icecold spring and soon king prigio was himself again and ready for anything  but afterwards he used to say that the moment when the earthquaker stirred was the most dreadful in his life  now in manoa where all the firm foundations of the city had trembled once when the sun just touched the earthquaker the people seeing that the shadow of the sacred column had crept to its foot and yet manoa stood firm again and the temple of the sun was not overthrown raised such a cry that it echoed even through the halls within the hollow hill  who shall describe the joy of the maidens and how often jaqueline and ricardo kissed each other  you have saved me she cried to the king throwing her arms round him again  you have saved manoa  and you have saved the hope of pantouflia not once or twice said his majesty grandly  and he told dick how much he had owed to jaqueline in the fight with the yellow dwarf and the fight with the giant for he did not think it necessary to mention the affair at rome  then dick kissed jaqueline again and all the maidens kissed each other and they quite cried for gladness  but we keep his majesty the inca waiting said prigio  punctuality is the courtesy of kings  you ladies will excuse me i am sure if i remove first from the dungeon her whom we call the princess jaqueline  the inca her father has a claim on us to this preference  then placing jaqueline on the saddle and leaving dick to comfort the other young ladies who were still rather nervous the king flew off to manoa for the wind of course died with the death of the earthquaker  i cannot tell you the delight of all manoa and of the inca when they saw the flying horse returning and recognised their longlost princess who rushed into the arms of her father  they beat the serpent drums for they had no bells on the tops of the temples  they went quite mad with delight enemies kissed in the streets and all the parents without exception allowed all the young people who happened to be in love to be married that very day  then prigio brought back all the maidens one after the other and dick last and he fell at the incas feet and requested leave to marry jaqueline  but before that could be done king prigio mounted on the palace balcony made a long but very lucid speech to the assembled people  he began by explaining that he was not their god pachacamac but king of a powerful country of which they had never heard before as they lived very much withdrawn in an unknown region of the world  then he pointed out in the most considerate manner that their religion was not all he could wish otherwise they would never sacrifice young ladies to wild birds and earthquakers  he next sketched out the merits of his own creed that of the lutheran church and the inca straightway observed that he proposed to establish it in manoa at once  some objection was raised by the old priest in the skull mask but when the inca promised to make him an archbishop and to continue all his revenues the priest admitted that he was perfectly satisfied and the general public cheered and waved their hats with emotion  it was arranged that the inca with his other daughters should visit pantouflia immediately both because he could not bear to leave jaqueline and also because there were a few points on which he felt that he still needed information  the government was left in the hands of the archbishop who began at once by burning his skull mask you may see one like it in the british museum in the mexican room and by letting loose all the birds and beasts which the manoans used to worship  so all the young people were married in the golden temple of the sun and all the earthquakers nurses who were under thirty were wedded to the young men who had been fond of them before they were sent into the hollow hill  these young men had never cared for any one else  everybody wore bridal favours all the unengaged young ladies acted as bridesmaids and such a throwing of rice and old shoes has very seldom been witnessed  as for the happy royal pair with their fathers and the other princess who did not happen to be engaged back they flew to pantouflia  and there was queen rosalind waiting at the palace gates and crying and laughing with pleasure when she heard that the wish of her heart was fulfilled and jaqueline was to be her daughter  and as for the earthquaker said her majesty i never was really anxious in the least for i knew no beast in the world was a match for you my dear  so just to make everything orderly and correct ricardo and jaqueline were married over again in the cathedral of pantouflia  the marriage presents came in afterwards of course and among them what do you think  why the sevenleague boots and the sword of sharpness with a very polite note of extraordinary size     the giant who does not know when he has had enough presents his    hearty congratulations to the royal pair and begs to lay at their    feet the sevenleague boots they not fitting me and the sword which    prince ricardo left in the giants keeping recently  the giant hopes    no bad blood and i am     yours very faithfully    the g c  pshis little woman sends her congratulations  so you see the giant was not such a bad sort of fellow after all and prince ricardo always admitted that he never met a foe more gallant and goodhumoured  with such a clever wife ricardo easily passed all his examinations and his little son prince prigio named after his august grandfather never had to cry mamma mamma fathers plucked again  so they lived happily in a happy country occasionally visiting manoa and as they possessed the magical water o life from the fountain of lions i do not believe that any of them ever died at all but that prigio is still king of pantouflia  no need such kings should ever die  the coach p204jpg  printing office of the publisher     footnotes   21  you can buy these glasses now from the psychical society at halfa
