97684546	the end of the tether   by joseph conrad     i  for a long time after the course of the steamer sofala had been altered for the land the low swampy coast had retained its appearance of a mere smudge of darkness beyond a belt of glitter the sunrays seemed to fall violently upon the calm seaseemed to shatter themselves upon an adamantine surface into sparkling dust into a dazzling vapor of light that blinded the eye and wearied the brain with its unsteady brightness  captain whalley did not look at it when his serang approaching the roomy cane armchair which he filled capably had informed him in a low voice that the course was to be altered he had risen at once and had remained on his feet face forward while the head of his ship swung through a quarter of a circle he had not uttered a single word not even the word to steady the helm it was the serang an elderly alert little malay with a very dark skin who murmured the order to the helmsman and then slowly captain whalley sat down again in the armchair on the bridge and fixed his eyes on the deck between his feet  he could not hope to see anything new upon this lane of the sea he had been on these coasts for the last three years from low cape to malantan the distance was fifty miles six hours steaming for the old ship with the tide or seven against then you steered straight for the land and byandby three palms would appear on the sky tall and slim and with their disheveled heads in a bunch as if in confidential criticism of the dark mangroves the sofala would be headed towards the somber strip of the coast which at a given moment as the ship closed with it obliquely would show several clean shining fracturesthe brimful estuary of a river then on through a brown liquid three parts water and one part black earth on and on between the low shores three parts black earth and one part brackish water the sofala would plow her way upstream as she had done once every month for these seven years or more long before he was aware of her existence long before he had ever thought of having anything to do with her and her invariable voyages the old ship ought to have known the road better than her men who had not been kept so long at it without a change better than the faithful serang whom he had brought over from his last ship to keep the captains watch better than he himself who had been her captain for the last three years only she could always be depended upon to make her courses her compasses were never out she was no trouble at all to take about as if her great age had given her knowledge wisdom and steadiness she made her landfalls to a degree of the bearing and almost to a minute of her allowed time at any moment as he sat on the bridge without looking up or lay sleepless in his bed simply by reckoning the days and the hours he could tell where he wasthe precise spot of the beat he knew it well too this monotonous hucksters round up and down the straits he knew its order and its sights and its people malacca to begin with in at daylight and out at dusk to cross over with a rigid phosphorescent wake this highway of the far east darkness and gleams on the water clear stars on a black sky perhaps the lights of a home steamer keeping her unswerving course in the middle or maybe the elusive shadow of a native craft with her mat sails flitting by silentlyand the low land on the other side in sight at daylight at noon the three palms of the next place of call up a sluggish river the only white man residing there was a retired young sailor with whom he had become friendly in the course of many voyages sixty miles farther on there was another place of call a deep bay with only a couple of houses on the beach and so on in and out picking up coastwise cargo here and there and finishing with a hundred miles steady steaming through the maze of an archipelago of small islands up to a large native town at the end of the beat there was a three days rest for the old ship before he started her again in inverse order seeing the same shores from another bearing hearing the same voices in the same places back again to the sofalas port of registry on the great highway to the east where he would take up a berth nearly opposite the big stone pile of the harbor office till it was time to start again on the old round of 1600 miles and thirty days not a very enterprising life this for captain whalley henry whalley otherwise daredevil harrywhalley of the condor a famous clipper in her day no not a very enterprising life for a man who had served famous firms who had sailed famous ships more than one or two of them his own who had made famous passages had been the pioneer of new routes and new trades who had steered across the unsurveyed tracts of the south seas and had seen the sun rise on uncharted islands fifty years at sea and forty out in the east a pretty thorough apprenticeship he used to remark smilingly had made him honorably known to a generation of shipowners and merchants in all the ports from bombay clear over to where the east merges into the west upon the coast of the two americas his fame remained writ not very large but plain enough on the admiralty charts was there not somewhere between australia and china a whalley island and a condor reef on that dangerous coral formation the celebrated clipper had hung stranded for three days her captain and crew throwing her cargo overboard with one hand and with the other as it were keeping off her a flotilla of savage warcanoes at that time neither the island nor the reef had any official existence later the officers of her majestys steam vessel fusilier dispatched to make a survey of the route recognized in the adoption of these two names the enterprise of the man and the solidity of the ship besides as anyone who cares may see the general directory vol ii p 410 begins the description of the malotu or whalley passage with the words this advantageous route first discovered in 1850 by captain whalley in the ship condor c and ends by recommending it warmly to sailing vessels leaving the china ports for the south in the months from december to april inclusive  this was the clearest gain he had out of life nothing could rob him of this kind of fame the piercing of the isthmus of suez like the breaking of a dam had let in upon the east a flood of new ships new men new methods of trade it had changed the face of the eastern seas and the very spirit of their life so that his early experiences meant nothing whatever to the new generation of seamen  in those bygone days he had handled many thousands of pounds of his employers money and of his own he had attended faithfully as by law a shipmaster is expected to do to the conflicting interests of owners charterers and underwriters he had never lost a ship or consented to a shady transaction and he had lasted well outlasting in the end the conditions that had gone to the making of his name he had buried his wife in the gulf of petchili had married off his daughter to the man of her unlucky choice and had lost more than an ample competence in the crash of the notorious travancore and deccan banking corporation whose downfall had shaken the east like an earthquake and he was sixtyfive years old   ii   his age sat lightly enough on him and of his ruin he was not ashamed he had not been alone to believe in the stability of the banking corporation men whose judgment in matters of finance was as expert as his seamanship had commended the prudence of his investments and had themselves lost much money in the great failure the only difference between him and them was that he had lost his all and yet not his all there had remained to him from his lost fortune a very pretty little bark fair maid which he had bought to occupy his leisure of a retired sailorto play with as he expressed it himself  he had formally declared himself tired of the sea the year preceding his daughters marriage but after the young couple had gone to settle in melbourne he found out that he could not make himself happy on shore he was too much of a merchant seacaptain for mere yachting to satisfy him he wanted the illusion of affairs and his acquisition of the fair maid preserved the continuity of his life he introduced her to his acquaintances in various ports as my last command when he grew too old to be trusted with a ship he would lay her up and go ashore to be buried leaving directions in his will to have the bark towed out and scuttled decently in deep water on the day of the funeral his daughter would not grudge him the satisfaction of knowing that no stranger would handle his last command after him with the fortune he was able to leave her the value of a 500ton bark was neither here nor there all this would be said with a jocular twinkle in his eye the vigorous old man had too much vitality for the sentimentalism of regret and a little wistfully withal because he was at home in life taking a genuine pleasure in its feelings and its possessions in the dignity of his reputation and his wealth in his love for his daughter and in his satisfaction with the shipthe plaything of his lonely leisure  he had the cabin arranged in accordance with his simple ideal of comfort at sea a big bookcase he was a great reader occupied one side of his stateroom the portrait of his late wife a flat bituminous oilpainting representing the profile and one long black ringlet of a young woman faced his bedplace three chronometers ticked him to sleep and greeted him on waking with the tiny competition of their beats he rose at five every day the officer of the morning watch drinking his early cup of coffee aft by the wheel would hear through the wide orifice of the copper ventilators all the splashings blowings and splutterings of his captains toilet these noises would be followed by a sustained deep murmur of the lords prayer recited in a loud earnest voice five minutes afterwards the head and shoulders of captain whalley emerged out of the companionhatchway invariably he paused for a while on the stairs looking all round at the horizon upwards at the trim of the sails inhaling deep draughts of the fresh air only then he would step out on the poop acknowledging the hand raised to the peak of the cap with a majestic and benign good morning to you he walked the deck till eight scrupulously sometimes not above twice a year he had to use a thick cudgellike stick on account of a stiffness in the hipa slight touch of rheumatism he supposed otherwise he knew nothing of the ills of the flesh at the ringing of the breakfast bell he went below to feed his canaries wind up the chronometers and take the head of the table from there he had before his eyes the big carbon photographs of his daughter her husband and two fatlegged babies his grandchildrenset in black frames into the maplewood bulkheads of the cuddy after breakfast he dusted the glass over these portraits himself with a cloth and brushed the oil painting of his wife with a plumate kept suspended from a small brass hook by the side of the heavy gold frame then with the door of his stateroom shut he would sit down on the couch under the portrait to read a chapter out of a thick pocket bibleher bible but on some days he only sat there for half an hour with his finger between the leaves and the closed book resting on his knees perhaps he had remembered suddenly how fond of boatsailing she used to be  she had been a real shipmate and a true woman too it was like an article of faith with him that there never had been and never could be a brighter cheerier home anywhere afloat or ashore than his home under the poopdeck of the condor with the big main cabin all white and gold garlanded as if for a perpetual festival with an unfading wreath she had decorated the center of every panel with a cluster of home flowers it took her a twelvemonth to go round the cuddy with this labor of love to him it had remained a marvel of painting the highest achievement of taste and skill and as to old swinburne his mate every time he came down to his meals he stood transfixed with admiration before the progress of the work you could almost smell these roses he declared sniffing the faint flavor of turpentine which at that time pervaded the saloon and as he confessed afterwards made him somewhat less hearty than usual in tackling his food but there was nothing of the sort to interfere with his enjoyment of her singing mrs whalley is a regular outandout nightingale sir he would pronounce with a judicial air after listening profoundly over the skylight to the very end of the piece in fine weather in the second dogwatch the two men could hear her trills and roulades going on to the accompaniment of the piano in the cabin on the very day they got engaged he had written to london for the instrument but they had been married for over a year before it reached them coming out round the cape the big case made part of the first direct general cargo landed in hongkong harboran event that to the men who walked the busy quays of today seemed as hazily remote as the dark ages of history but captain whalley could in a half hour of solitude live again all his life with its romance its idyl and its sorrow he had to close her eyes himself she went away from under the ensign like a sailors wife a sailor herself at heart he had read the service over her out of her own prayerbook without a break in his voice when he raised his eyes he could see old swinburne facing him with his cap pressed to his breast and his rugged weatherbeaten impassive face streaming with drops of water like a lump of chipped red granite in a shower it was all very well for that old seadog to cry he had to read on to the end but after the splash he did not remember much of what happened for the next few days an elderly sailor of the crew deft at needlework put together a mourning frock for the child out of one of her black skirts  he was not likely to forget but you cannot dam up life like a sluggish stream it will break out and flow over a mans troubles it will close upon a sorrow like the sea upon a dead body no matter how much love has gone to the bottom and the world is not bad people had been very kind to him especially mrs gardner the wife of the senior partner in gardner patteson  co the owners of the condor it was she who volunteered to look after the little one and in due course took her to england something of a journey in those days even by the overland mail route with her own girls to finish her education it was ten years before he saw her again  as a little child she had never been frightened of bad weather she would beg to be taken up on deck in the bosom of his oilskin coat to watch the big seas hurling themselves upon the condor the swirl and crash of the waves seemed to fill her small soul with a breathless delight a good boy spoiled he used to say of her in joke he had named her ivy because of the sound of the word and obscurely fascinated by a vague association of ideas she had twined herself tightly round his heart and he intended her to cling close to her father as to a tower of strength forgetting while she was little that in the nature of things she would probably elect to cling to someone else but he loved life well enough for even that event to give him a certain satisfaction apart from his more intimate feeling of loss  after he had purchased the fair maid to occupy his loneliness he hastened to accept a rather unprofitable freight to australia simply for the opportunity of seeing his daughter in her own home what made him dissatisfied there was not to see that she clung now to somebody else but that the prop she had selected seemed on closer examination a rather poor stickeven in the matter of health he disliked his soninlaws studied civility perhaps more than his method of handling the sum of money he had given ivy at her marriage but of his apprehensions he said nothing only on the day of his departure with the halldoor open already holding her hands and looking steadily into her eyes he had said you know my dear all i have is for you and the chicks mind you write to me openly she had answered him by an almost imperceptible movement of her head she resembled her mother in the color of her eyes and in characterand also in this that she understood him without many words  sure enough she had to write and some of these letters made captain whalley lift his white eyebrows for the rest he considered he was reaping the true reward of his life by being thus able to produce on demand whatever was needed he had not enjoyed himself so much in a way since his wife had died characteristically enough his soninlaws punctuality in failure caused him at a distance to feel a sort of kindness towards the man the fellow was so perpetually being jammed on a lee shore that to charge it all to his reckless navigation would be manifestly unfair no no he knew well what that meant it was bad luck his own had been simply marvelous but he had seen in his life too many good menseamen and othersgo under with the sheer weight of bad luck not to recognize the fatal signs for all that he was cogitating on the best way of tying up very strictly every penny he had to leave when with a preliminary rumble of rumors whose first sound reached him in shanghai as it happened the shock of the big failure came and after passing through the phases of stupor of incredulity of indignation he had to accept the fact that he had nothing to speak of to leave  upon that as if he had only waited for this catastrophe the unlucky man away there in melbourne gave up his unprofitable game and sat downin an invalids bathchair at that too he will never walk again wrote the wife for the first time in his life captain whalley was a bit staggered  the fair maid had to go to work in bitter earnest now it was no longer a matter of preserving alive the memory of daredevil harry whalley in the eastern seas or of keeping an old man in pocketmoney and clothes with perhaps a bill for a few hundred firstclass cigars thrown in at the end of the year he would have to buckleto and keep her going hard on a scant allowance of gilt for the gingerbread scrolls at her stem and stern  this necessity opened his eyes to the fundamental changes of the world of his past only the familiar names remained here and there but the things and the men as he had known them were gone the name of gardner patteson  co was still displayed on the walls of warehouses by the waterside on the brass plates and windowpanes in the business quarters of more than one eastern port but there was no longer a gardner or a patteson in the firm there was no longer for captain whalley an armchair and a welcome in the private office with a bit of business ready to be put in the way of an old friend for the sake of bygone services the husbands of the gardner girls sat behind the desks in that room where long after he had left the employ he had kept his right of entrance in the old mans time their ships now had yellow funnels with black tops and a timetable of appointed routes like a confounded service of tramways the winds of december and june were all one to them their captains excellent young men he doubted not were to be sure familiar with whalley island because of late years the government had established a white fixed light on the north end with a red danger sector over the condor reef but most of them would have been extremely surprised to hear that a fleshandblood whalley still existedan old man going about the world trying to pick up a cargo here and there for his little bark  and everywhere it was the same departed the men who would have nodded appreciatively at the mention of his name and would have thought themselves bound in honor to do something for daredevil harry whalley departed the opportunities which he would have known how to seize and gone with them the whitewinged flock of clippers that lived in the boisterous uncertain life of the winds skimming big fortunes out of the foam of the sea in a world that pared down the profits to an irreducible minimum in a world that was able to count its disengaged tonnage twice over every day and in which lean charters were snapped up by cable three months in advance there were no chances of fortune for an individual wandering haphazard with a little barkhardly indeed any room to exist  he found it more difficult from year to year he suffered greatly from the smallness of remittances he was able to send his daughter meantime he had given up good cigars and even in the matter of inferior cheroots limited himself to six a day he never told her of his difficulties and she never enlarged upon her struggle to live their confidence in each other needed no explanations and their perfect understanding endured without protestations of gratitude or regret he would have been shocked if she had taken it into her head to thank him in so many words but he found it perfectly natural that she should tell him she needed two hundred pounds  he had come in with the fair maid in ballast to look for a freight in the sofalas port of registry and her letter met him there its tenor was that it was no use mincing matters her only resource was in opening a boardinghouse for which the prospects she judged were good good enough at any rate to make her tell him frankly that with two hundred pounds she could make a start he had torn the envelope open hastily on deck where it was handed to him by the shipchandlers runner who had brought his mail at the moment of anchoring for the second time in his life he was appalled and remained stockstill at the cabin door with the paper trembling between his fingers open a boardinghouse two hundred pounds for a start the only resource and he did not know where to lay his hands on two hundred pence  all that night captain whalley walked the poop of his anchored ship as though he had been about to close with the land in thick weather and uncertain of his position after a run of many gray days without a sight of sun moon or stars the black night twinkled with the guiding lights of seamen and the steady straight lines of lights on shore and all around the fair maid the riding lights of ships cast trembling trails upon the water of the roadstead captain whalley saw not a gleam anywhere till the dawn broke and he found out that his clothing was soaked through with the heavy dew  his ship was awake he stopped short stroked his wet beard and descended the poop ladder backwards with tired feet at the sight of him the chief officer lounging about sleepily on the quarterdeck remained openmouthed in the middle of a great earlymorning yawn  good morning to you pronounced captain whalley solemnly passing into the cabin but he checked himself in the doorway and without looking back by the bye he said there should be an empty wooden case put away in the lazarette it has not been broken uphas it  the mate shut his mouth and then asked as if dazed what empty case sir  a big flat packingcase belonging to that painting in my room let it be taken up on deck and tell the carpenter to look it over i may want to use it before long  the chief officer did not stir a limb till he had heard the door of the captains stateroom slam within the cuddy then he beckoned aft the second mate with his forefinger to tell him that there was something in the wind  when the bell rang captain whalleys authoritative voice boomed out through a closed door sit down and dont wait for me and his impressed officers took their places exchanging looks and whispers across the table what no breakfast and after apparently knocking about all night on deck too clearly there was something in the wind in the skylight above their heads bowed earnestly over the plates three wire cages rocked and rattled to the restless jumping of the hungry canaries and they could detect the sounds of their old mans deliberate movements within his stateroom captain whalley was methodically winding up the chronometers dusting the portrait of his late wife getting a clean white shirt out of the drawers making himself ready in his punctilious unhurried manner to go ashore he could not have swallowed a single mouthful of food that morning he had made up his mind to sell the fair maid   iii   just at that time the japanese were casting far and wide for ships of european build and he had no difficulty in finding a purchaser a speculator who drove a hard bargain but paid cash down for the fair maid with a view to a profitable resale thus it came about that captain whalley found himself on a certain afternoon descending the steps of one of the most important postoffices of the east with a slip of bluish paper in his hand this was the receipt of a registered letter enclosing a draft for two hundred pounds and addressed to melbourne captain whalley pushed the paper into his waistcoatpocket took his stick from under his arm and walked down the street  it was a recently opened and untidy thoroughfare with rudimentary sidewalks and a soft layer of dust cushioning the whole width of the road one end touched the slummy street of chinese shops near the harbor the other drove straight on without houses for a couple of miles through patches of junglelike vegetation to the yard gates of the new consolidated docks company the crude frontages of the new government buildings alternated with the blank fencing of vacant plots and the view of the sky seemed to give an added spaciousness to the broad vista it was empty and shunned by natives after business hours as though they had expected to see one of the tigers from the neighborhood of the new waterworks on the hill coming at a loping canter down the middle to get a chinese shopkeeper for supper captain whalley was not dwarfed by the solitude of the grandly planned street he had too fine a presence for that he was only a lonely figure walking purposefully with a great white beard like a pilgrim and with a thick stick that resembled a weapon on one side the new courts of justice had a low and unadorned portico of squat columns half concealed by a few old trees left in the approach on the other the pavilion wings of the new colonial treasury came out to the line of the street but captain whalley who had now no ship and no home remembered in passing that on that very site when he first came out from england there had stood a fishing village a few mat huts erected on piles between a muddy tidal creek and a miry pathway that went writhing into a tangled wilderness without any docks or waterworks  no shipno home and his poor ivy away there had no home either a boardinghouse is no sort of home though it may get you a living his feelings were horribly rasped by the idea of the boardinghouse in his rank of life he had that truly aristocratic temperament characterized by a scorn of vulgar gentility and by prejudiced views as to the derogatory nature of certain occupations for his own part he had always preferred sailing merchant ships which is a straightforward occupation to buying and selling merchandise of which the essence is to get the better of somebody in a bargainan undignified trial of wits at best his father had been colonel whalley retired of the h e i companys service with very slender means besides his pension but with distinguished connections he could remember as a boy how frequently waiters at the inns country tradesmen and small people of that sort used to my lord the old warrior on the strength of his appearance  captain whalley himself he would have entered the navy if his father had not died before he was fourteen had something of a grand air which would have suited an old and glorious admiral but he became lost like a straw in the eddy of a brook amongst the swarm of brown and yellow humanity filling a thoroughfare that by contrast with the vast and empty avenue he had left seemed as narrow as a lane and absolutely riotous with life the walls of the houses were blue the shops of the chinamen yawned like cavernous lairs heaps of nondescript merchandise overflowed the gloom of the long range of arcades and the fiery serenity of sunset took the middle of the street from end to end with a glow like the reflection of a fire it fell on the bright colors and the dark faces of the barefooted crowd on the pallid yellow backs of the halfnaked jostling coolies on the accouterments of a tall sikh trooper with a parted beard and fierce mustaches on sentry before the gate of the police compound looming very big above the heads in a red haze of dust the tightly packed car of the cable tramway navigated cautiously up the human stream with the incessant blare of its horn in the manner of a steamer groping in a fog  captain whalley emerged like a diver on the other side and in the desert shade between the walls of closed warehouses removed his hat to cool his brow a certain disrepute attached to the calling of a landlady of a boardinghouse these women were said to be rapacious unscrupulous untruthful and though he contemned no class of his fellowcreaturesgod forbidthese were suspicions to which it was unseemly that a whalley should lay herself open he had not expostulated with her however he was confident she shared his feelings he was sorry for her he trusted her judgment he considered it a merciful dispensation that he could help her once morebut in his aristocratic heart of hearts he would have found it more easy to reconcile himself to the idea of her turning seamstress vaguely he remembered reading years ago a touching piece called the song of the shirt it was all very well making songs about poor women the granddaughter of colonel whalley the landlady of a boardinghouse pooh he replaced his hat dived into two pockets and stopping a moment to apply a flaring match to the end of a cheap cheroot blew an embittered cloud of smoke at a world that could hold such surprises  of one thing he was certainthat she was the own child of a clever mother now he had got over the wrench of parting with his ship he perceived clearly that such a step had been unavoidable perhaps he had been growing aware of it all along with an unconfessed knowledge but she far away there must have had an intuitive perception of it with the pluck to face that truth and the courage to speak outall the qualities which had made her mother a woman of such excellent counsel  it would have had to come to that in the end it was fortunate she had forced his hand in another year or two it would have been an utterly barren sale to keep the ship going he had been involving himself deeper every year he was defenseless before the insidious work of adversity to whose more open assaults he could present a firm front like a cliff that stands unmoved the open battering of the sea with a lofty ignorance of the treacherous backwash undermining its base as it was every liability satisfied her request answered and owing no man a penny there remained to him from the proceeds a sum of five hundred pounds put away safely in addition he had upon his person some forty odd dollarsenough to pay his hotel bill providing he did not linger too long in the modest bedroom where he had taken refuge  scantily furnished and with a waxed floor it opened into one of the sideverandas the straggling building of bricks as airy as a birdcage resounded with the incessant flapping of rattan screens worried by the wind between the whitewashed square pillars of the seafront the rooms were lofty a ripple of sunshine flowed over the ceilings and the periodical invasions of tourists from some passenger steamer in the harbor flitted through the windswept dusk of the apartments with the tumult of their unfamiliar voices and impermanent presences like relays of migratory shades condemned to speed headlong round the earth without leaving a trace the babble of their irruptions ebbed out as suddenly as it had arisen the draughty corridors and the long chairs of the verandas knew their sightseeing hurry or their prostrate repose no more and captain whalley substantial and dignified left wellnigh alone in the vast hotel by each lighthearted skurry felt more and more like a stranded tourist with no aim in view like a forlorn traveler without a home in the solitude of his room he smoked thoughtfully gazing at the two seachests which held all that he could call his own in this world a thick roll of charts in a sheath of sailcloth leaned in a corner the flat packingcase containing the portrait in oils and the three carbon photographs had been pushed under the bed he was tired of discussing terms of assisting at surveys of all the routine of the business what to the other parties was merely the sale of a ship was to him a momentous event involving a radically new view of existence he knew that after this ship there would be no other and the hopes of his youth the exercise of his abilities every feeling and achievement of his manhood had been indissolubly connected with ships he had served ships he had owned ships and even the years of his actual retirement from the sea had been made bearable by the idea that he had only to stretch out his hand full of money to get a ship he had been at liberty to feel as though he were the owner of all the ships in the world the selling of this one was weary work but when she passed from him at last when he signed the last receipt it was as though all the ships had gone out of the world together leaving him on the shore of inaccessible oceans with seven hundred pounds in his hands  striding firmly without haste along the quay captain whalley averted his glances from the familiar roadstead two generations of seamen born since his first day at sea stood between him and all these ships at the anchorage his own was sold and he had been asking himself what next  from the feeling of loneliness of inward emptinessand of loss too as if his very soul had been taken out of him forciblythere had sprung at first a desire to start right off and join his daughter here are the last pence he would say to her take them my dear and heres your old father you must take him too  his soul recoiled as if afraid of what lay hidden at the bottom of this impulse give up never when one is thoroughly weary all sorts of nonsense come into ones head a pretty gift it would have been for a poor womanthis seven hundred pounds with the incumbrance of a hale old fellow more than likely to last for years and years to come was he not as fit to die in harness as any of the youngsters in charge of these anchored ships out yonder he was as solid now as ever he had been but as to who would give him work to do that was another matter were he with his appearance and antecedents to go about looking for a juniors berth people he was afraid would not take him seriously or else if he succeeded in impressing them he would maybe obtain their pity which would be like stripping yourself naked to be kicked he was not anxious to give himself away for less than nothing he had no use for anybodys pity on the other hand a commandthe only thing he could try for with due regard for common decencywas not likely to be lying in wait for him at the corner of the next street commands dont go abegging nowadays ever since he had come ashore to carry out the business of the sale he had kept his ears open but had heard no hint of one being vacant in the port and even if there had been one his successful past itself stood in his way he had been his own employer too long the only credential he could produce was the testimony of his whole life what better recommendation could anyone require but vaguely he felt that the unique document would be looked upon as an archaic curiosity of the eastern waters a screed traced in obsolete wordsin a halfforgotten language   iv   revolving these thoughts he strolled on near the railings of the quay broadchested without a stoop as though his big shoulders had never felt the burden of the loads that must be carried between the cradle and the grave no single betraying fold or line of care disfigured the reposeful modeling of his face it was full and untanned and the upper part emerged massively quiet out of the downward flow of silvery hair with the striking delicacy of its clear complexion and the powerful width of the forehead the first cast of his glance fell on you candid and swift like a boys but because of the ragged snowy thatch of the eyebrows the affability of his attention acquired the character of a dark and searching scrutiny with age he had put on flesh a little had increased his girth like an old tree presenting no symptoms of decay and even the opulent lustrous ripple of white hairs upon his chest seemed an attribute of unquenchable vitality and vigor  once rather proud of his great bodily strength and even of his personal appearance conscious of his worth and firm in his rectitude there had remained to him like the heritage of departed prosperity the tranquil bearing of a man who had proved himself fit in every sort of way for the life of his choice he strode on squarely under the projecting brim of an ancient panama hat it had a low crown a crease through its whole diameter a narrow black ribbon imperishable and a little discolored this headgear made it easy to pick him out from afar on thronged wharves and in the busy streets he had never adopted the comparatively modern fashion of pipeclayed cork helmets he disliked the form and he hoped he could manage to keep a cool head to the end of his life without all these contrivances for hygienic ventilation his hair was cropped close his linen always of immaculate whiteness a suit of thin gray flannel worn threadbare but scrupulously brushed floated about his burly limbs adding to his bulk by the looseness of its cut the years had mellowed the goodhumored imperturbable audacity of his prime into a temper carelessly serene and the leisurely tapping of his ironshod stick accompanied his footfalls with a selfconfident sound on the flagstones it was impossible to connect such a fine presence and this unruffled aspect with the belittling troubles of poverty the mans whole existence appeared to pass before you facile and large in the freedom of means as ample as the clothing of his body  the irrational dread of having to break into his five hundred pounds for personal expenses in the hotel disturbed the steady poise of his mind there was no time to lose the bill was running up he nourished the hope that this five hundred would perhaps be the means if everything else failed of obtaining some work which keeping his body and soul together not a matter of great outlay would enable him to be of use to his daughter to his mind it was her own money which he employed as it were in backing her father and solely for her benefit once at work he would help her with the greater part of his earnings he was good for many years yet and this boardinghouse business he argued to himself whatever the prospects could not be much of a goldmine from the first start but what work he was ready to lay hold of anything in an honest way so that it came quickly to his hand because the five hundred pounds must be preserved intact for eventual use that was the great point with the entire five hundred one felt a substance at ones back but it seemed to him that should he let it dwindle to fourfifty or even foureighty all the efficiency would be gone out of the money as though there were some magic power in the round figure but what sort of work  confronted by that haunting question as by an uneasy ghost for whom he had no exorcising formula captain whalley stopped short on the apex of a small bridge spanning steeply the bed of a canalized creek with granite shores moored between the square blocks a seagoing malay prau floated half hidden under the arch of masonry with her spars lowered down without a sound of life on board and covered from stem to stern with a ridge of palmleaf mats he had left behind him the overheated pavements bordered by the stone frontages that like the sheer face of cliffs followed the sweep of the quays and an unconfined spaciousness of orderly and sylvan aspect opened before him its wide plots of rolled grass like pieces of green carpet smoothly pegged out its long ranges of trees lined up in colossal porticos of dark shafts roofed with a vault of branches  some of these avenues ended at the sea it was a terraced shore and beyond upon the level expanse profound and glistening like the gaze of a darkblue eye an oblique band of stippled purple lengthened itself indefinitely through the gap between a couple of verdant twin islets the masts and spars of a few ships far away hull down in the outer roads sprang straight from the water in a fine maze of rosy lines penciled on the clear shadow of the eastern board captain whalley gave them a long glance the ship once his own was anchored out there it was staggering to think that it was open to him no longer to take a boat at the jetty and get himself pulled off to her when the evening came to no ship perhaps never more before the sale was concluded and till the purchasemoney had been paid he had spent daily some time on board the fair maid the money had been paid this very morning and now all at once there was positively no ship that he could go on board of when he liked no ship that would need his presence in order to do her workto live it seemed an incredible state of affairs something too bizarre to last and the sea was full of craft of all sorts there was that prau lying so still swathed in her shroud of sewn palmleavesshe too had her indispensable man they lived through each other this malay he had never seen and this highsterned thing of no size that seemed to be resting after a long journey and of all the ships in sight near and far each was provided with a man the man without whom the finest ship is a dead thing a floating and purposeless log  after his one glance at the roadstead he went on since there was nothing to turn back for and the time must be got through somehow the avenues of big trees ran straight over the esplanade cutting each other at diverse angles columnar below and luxuriant above the interlaced boughs high up there seemed to slumber not a leaf stirred overhead and the reedy castiron lampposts in the middle of the road gilt like scepters diminished in a long perspective with their globes of white porcelain atop resembling a barbarous decoration of ostriches eggs displayed in a row the flaming sky kindled a tiny crimson spark upon the glistening surface of each glassy shell  with his chin sunk a little his hands behind his back and the end of his stick marking the gravel with a faint wavering line at his heels captain whalley reflected that if a ship without a man was like a body without a soul a sailor without a ship was of not much more account in this world than an aimless log adrift upon the sea the log might be sound enough by itself tough of fiber and hard to destroybut what of that and a sudden sense of irremediable idleness weighted his feet like a great fatigue  a succession of open carriages came bowling along the newly opened searoad you could see across the wide grassplots the discs of vibration made by the spokes the bright domes of the parasols swayed lightly outwards like fullblown blossoms on the rim of a vase and the quiet sheet of darkblue water crossed by a bar of purple made a background for the spinning wheels and the high action of the horses whilst the turbaned heads of the indian servants elevated above the line of the sea horizon glided rapidly on the paler blue of the sky in an open space near the little bridge each turnout trotted smartly in a wide curve away from the sunset then pulling up sharp entered the main alley in a long slowmoving file with the great red stillness of the sky at the back the trunks of mighty trees stood all touched with red on the same side the air seemed aflame under the high foliage the very ground under the hoofs of the horses was red the wheels turned solemnly one after another the sunshades drooped folding their colors like gorgeous flowers shutting their petals at the end of the day in the whole halfmile of human beings no voice uttered a distinct word only a faint thudding noise went on mingled with slight jingling sounds and the motionless heads and shoulders of men and women sitting in couples emerged stolidly above the lowered hoodsas if wooden but one carriage and pair coming late did not join the line  it fled along in a noiseless roll but on entering the avenue one of the dark bays snorted arching his neck and shying against the steeltipped pole a flake of foam fell from the bit upon the point of a satiny shoulder and the dusky face of the coachman leaned forward at once over the hands taking a fresh grip of the reins it was a long darkgreen landau having a dignified and buoyant motion between the sharply curved csprings and a sort of strictly official majesty in its supreme elegance it seemed more roomy than is usual its horses seemed slightly bigger the appointments a shade more perfect the servants perched somewhat higher on the box the dresses of three womentwo young and pretty and one handsome large of mature ageseemed to fill completely the shallow body of the carriage the fourth face was that of a man heavy lidded distinguished and sallow with a somber thick irongray imperial and mustaches which somehow had the air of solid appendages his excellency  the rapid motion of that one equipage made all the others appear utterly inferior blighted and reduced to crawl painfully at a snails pace the landau distanced the whole file in a sort of sustained rush the features of the occupant whirling out of sight left behind an impression of fixed stares and impassive vacancy and after it had vanished in full flight as it were notwithstanding the long line of vehicles hugging the curb at a walk the whole lofty vista of the avenue seemed to lie open and emptied of life in the enlarged impression of an august solitude  captain whalley had lifted his head to look and his mind disturbed in its meditation turned with wonder as mens minds will do to matters of no importance it struck him that it was to this port where he had just sold his last ship that he had come with the very first he had ever owned and with his head full of a plan for opening a new trade with a distant part of the archipelago the then governor had given him no end of encouragement no excellency hethis mr denhamthis governor with his jacket off a man who tended night and day so to speak the growing prosperity of the settlement with the selfforgetful devotion of a nurse for a child she loves a lone bachelor who lived as in a camp with the few servants and his three dogs in what was called then the government bungalow a lowroofed structure on the halfcleared slope of a hill with a new flagstaff in front and a police orderly on the veranda he remembered toiling up that hill under a heavy sun for his audience the unfurnished aspect of the cool shaded room the long table covered at one end with piles of papers and with two guns a brass telescope a small bottle of oil with a feather stuck in the neck at the otherand the flattering attention given to him by the man in power it was an undertaking full of risk he had come to expound but a twenty minutes talk in the government bungalow on the hill had made it go smoothly from the start and as he was retiring mr denham already seated before the papers called out after him next month the dido starts for a cruise that way and i shall request her captain officially to give you a look in and see how you get on the dido was one of the smart frigates on the china stationand fiveandthirty years make a big slice of time fiveandthirty years ago an enterprise like his had for the colony enough importance to be looked after by a queens ship a big slice of time individuals were of some account then men like himself men too like poor evans for instance with his red face his coalblack whiskers and his restless eyes who had set up the first patent slip for repairing small ships on the edge of the forest in a lonely bay three miles up the coast mr denham had encouraged that enterprise too and yet somehow poor evans had ended by dying at home deucedly hard up his son they said was squeezing oil out of cocoanuts for a living on some godforsaken islet of the indian ocean but it was from that patent slip in a lonely wooded bay that had sprung the workshops of the consolidated docks company with its three graving basins carved out of solid rock its wharves its jetties its electriclight plant its steampower houseswith its gigantic sheerlegs fit to lift the heaviest weight ever carried afloat and whose head could be seen like the top of a queer white monument peeping over bushy points of land and sandy promontories as you approached the new harbor from the west  there had been a time when men counted there were not so many carriages in the colony then though mr denham he fancied had a buggy and captain whalley seemed to be swept out of the great avenue by the swirl of a mental backwash he remembered muddy shores a harbor without quays the one solitary wooden pier but that was a public work jutting out crookedly the first coalsheds erected on monkey point that caught fire mysteriously and smoldered for days so that amazed ships came into a roadstead full of sulphurous smoke and the sun hung bloodred at midday he remembered the things the faces and something more besideslike the faint flavor of a cup quaffed to the bottom like a subtle sparkle of the air that was not to be found in the atmosphere of today  in this evocation swift and full of detail like a flash of magnesium light into the niches of a dark memorial hall captain whalley contemplated things once important the efforts of small men the growth of a great place but now robbed of all consequence by the greatness of accomplished facts by hopes greater still and they gave him for a moment such an almost physical grip upon time such a comprehension of our unchangeable feelings that he stopped short struck the ground with his stick and ejaculated mentally what the devil am i doing here he seemed lost in a sort of surprise but he heard his name called out in wheezy tones once twiceand turned on his heels slowly  he beheld then waddling towards him autocratically a man of an oldfashioned and gouty aspect with hair as white as his own but with shaved florid cheeks wearing a necktiealmost a neckclothwhose stiff ends projected far beyond his chin with round legs round arms a round body a round facegenerally producing the effect of his short figure having been distended by means of an airpump as much as the seams of his clothing would stand this was the masterattendant of the port a masterattendant is a superior sort of harbormaster a person out in the east of some consequence in his sphere a government official a magistrate for the waters of the port and possessed of vast but illdefined disciplinary authority over seamen of all classes this particular masterattendant was reported to consider it miserably inadequate on the ground that it did not include the power of life and death this was a jocular exaggeration captain eliott was fairly satisfied with his position and nursed no inconsiderable sense of such power as he had his conceited and tyrannical disposition did not allow him to let it dwindle in his hands for want of use the uproarious choleric frankness of his comments on peoples character and conduct caused him to be feared at bottom though in conversation many pretended not to mind him in the least others would only smile sourly at the mention of his name and there were even some who dared to pronounce him a meddlesome old ruffian but for almost all of them one of captain eliotts outbreaks was nearly as distasteful to face as a chance of annihilation   v   as soon as he had come up quite close he said mouthing in a growl  whats this i hear whalley is it true youre selling the fair maid  captain whalley looking away said the thing was donemoney had been paid that morning and the other expressed at once his approbation of such an extremely sensible proceeding he had got out of his trap to stretch his legs he explained on his way home to dinner sir frederick looked well at the end of his time didnt he  captain whalley could not say had only noticed the carriage going past  the masterattendant plunging his hands into the pockets of an alpaca jacket inappropriately short and tight for a man of his age and appearance strutted with a slight limp and with his head reaching only to the shoulder of captain whalley who walked easily staring straight before him they had been good comrades years ago almost intimates at the time when whalley commanded the renowned condor eliott had charge of the nearly as famous ringdove for the same owners and when the appointment of masterattendant was created whalley would have been the only other serious candidate but captain whalley then in the prime of life was resolved to serve no one but his own auspicious fortune far away tending his hot irons he was glad to hear the other had been successful there was a worldly suppleness in bluff ned eliott that would serve him well in that sort of official appointment and they were so dissimilar at bottom that as they came slowly to the end of the avenue before the cathedral it had never come into whalleys head that he might have been in that mans placeprovided for to the end of his days  the sacred edifice standing in solemn isolation amongst the converging avenues of enormous trees as if to put grave thoughts of heaven into the hours of ease presented a closed gothic portal to the light and glory of the west the glass of the rosace above the ogive glowed like fiery coal in the deep carvings of a wheel of stone the two men faced about  ill tell you what they ought to do next whalley growled captain eliott suddenly  well  they ought to send a real live lord out here when sir fredericks time is up eh  captain whalley perfunctorily did not see why a lord of the right sort should not do as well as anyone else but this was not the others point of view  no no place runs itself nothing can stop it now good enough for a lord he growled in short sentences look at the changes in our time we need a lord here now they have got a lord in bombay  he dined once or twice every year at the government housea manywindowed arcaded palace upon a hill laid out in roads and gardens and lately he had been taking about a duke in his masterattendants steamlaunch to visit the harbor improvements before that he had most obligingly gone out in person to pick out a good berth for the ducal yacht afterwards he had an invitation to lunch on board the duchess herself lunched with them a big woman with a red face complexion quite sunburnt he should think ruined very gracious manners they were going on to japan     he ejaculated these details for captain whalleys edification pausing to blow out his cheeks as if with a pentup sense of importance and repeatedly protruding his thick lips till the blunt crimson end of his nose seemed to dip into the milk of his mustache the place ran itself it was fit for any lord it gave no trouble except in its marine departmentin its marine department he repeated twice and after a heavy snort began to relate how the other day her majestys consulgeneral in french cochinchina had cabled to himin his official capacityasking for a qualified man to be sent over to take charge of a glasgow ship whose master had died in saigon  i sent word of it to the officers quarters in the sailors home he continued while the limp in his gait seemed to grow more accentuated with the increasing irritation of his voice places full of them twice as many men as there are berths going in the local trade all hungry for an easy job twice as manyandwhat dyou think whalley     he stopped short his hands clenched and thrust deeply downwards seemed ready to burst the pockets of his jacket a slight sigh escaped captain whalley  hey you would think they would be falling over each other not a bit of it frightened to go home nice and warm out here to lie about a veranda waiting for a job i sit and wait in my office nobody what did they suppose that i was going to sit there like a dummy with the consulgenerals cable before me not likely so i looked up a list of them i keep by me and sent word for hamiltonthe worst loafer of them alland just made him go threatened to instruct the steward of the sailors home to have him turned out neck and crop he did not think the berth was good enoughifyouplease ive your little records by me said i you came ashore here eighteen months ago and you havent done six months work since you are in debt for your board now at the home and i suppose you reckon the marine office will pay in the end eh so it shall but if you dont take this chance away you go to england assisted passage by the first homeward steamer that comes along you are no better than a pauper we dont want any white paupers here i scared him but look at the trouble all this gave me  you would not have had any trouble captain whalley said almost involuntarily if you had sent for me  captain eliott was immensely amused he shook with laughter as he walked but suddenly he stopped laughing a vague recollection had crossed his mind hadnt he heard it said at the time of the travancore and deccan smash that poor whalley had been cleaned out completely fellows hard up by heavens he thought and at once he cast a sidelong upward glance at his companion but captain whalley was smiling austerely straight before him with a carriage of the head inconceivable in a penniless manand he became reassured impossible could not have lost everything that ship had been only a hobby of his and the reflection that a man who had confessed to receiving that very morning a presumably large sum of money was not likely to spring upon him a demand for a small loan put him entirely at his ease again there had come a long pause in their talk however and not knowing how to begin again he growled out soberly we old fellows ought to take a rest now  the best thing for some of us would be to die at the oar captain whalley said negligently  come now arent you a bit tired by this time of the whole show muttered the other sullenly  are you  captain eliott was infernally tired he only hung on to his berth so long in order to get his pension on the highest scale before he went home it would be no better than poverty anyhow still it was the only thing between him and the workhouse and he had a family three girls as whalley knew he gave harry old boy to understand that these three girls were a source of the greatest anxiety and worry to him enough to drive a man distracted  why what have they been doing now asked captain whalley with a sort of amused absentmindedness  doing doing nothing thats just it lawntennis and silly novels from morning to night     if one of them at least had been a boy but all three and as illluck would have it there did not seem to be any decent young fellows left in the world when he looked around in the club he saw only a lot of conceited popinjays too selfish to think of making a good woman happy extreme indigence stared him in the face with all that crowd to keep at home he had cherished the idea of building himself a little house in the countryin surreyto end his days in but he was afraid it was out of the question    and his staring eyes rolled upwards with such a pathetic anxiety that captain whalley charitably nodded down at him restraining a sort of sickening desire to laugh  you must know what it is yourself harry girls are the very devil for worry and anxiety  ay but mine is doing well captain whalley pronounced slowly staring to the end of the avenue  the masterattendant was glad to hear this uncommonly glad he remembered her well a pretty girl she was  captain whalley stepping out carelessly assented as if in a dream  she was pretty  the procession of carriages was breaking up  one after another they left the file to go off at a trot animating the vast avenue with their scattered life and movement but soon the aspect of dignified solitude returned and took possession of the straight wide road a syce in white stood at the head of a burmah pony harnessed to a varnished twowheel cart and the whole thing waiting by the curb seemed no bigger than a childs toy forgotten under the soaring trees captain eliott waddled up to it and made as if to clamber in but refrained and keeping one hand resting easily on the shaft he changed the conversation from his pension his daughters and his poverty back again to the only other topic in the worldthe marine office the men and the ships of the port  he proceeded to give instances of what was expected of him and his thick voice drowsed in the still air like the obstinate droning of an enormous bumblebee captain whalley did not know what was the force or the weakness that prevented him from saying goodnight and walking away it was as though he had been too tired to make the effort how queer more queer than any of neds instances or was it that overpowering sense of idleness alone that made him stand there and listen to these stories nothing very real had ever troubled ned eliott and gradually he seemed to detect deep in as if wrapped up in the gross wheezy rumble something of the clear hearty voice of the young captain of the ringdove he wondered if he too had changed to the same extent and it seemed to him that the voice of his old chum had not changed so very muchthat the man was the same not a bad fellow the pleasant jolly ned eliott friendly well up to his businessand always a bit of a humbug he remembered how he used to amuse his poor wife she could read him like an open book when the condor and the ringdove happened to be in port together she would frequently ask him to bring captain eliott to dinner they had not met often since those old days not once in five years perhaps he regarded from under his white eyebrows this man he could not bring himself to take into his confidence at this juncture and the other went on with his intimate outpourings and as remote from his hearer as though he had been talking on a hilltop a mile away  he was in a bit of a quandary now as to the steamer sofala ultimately every hitch in the port came into his hands to undo they would miss him when he was gone in another eighteen months and most likely some retired naval officer had been pitchforked into the appointmenta man that would understand nothing and care less that steamer was a coasting craft having a steady trade connection as far north as tenasserim but the trouble was she could get no captain to take her on her regular trip nobody would go in her he really had no power of course to order a man to take a job it was all very well to stretch a point on the demand of a consulgeneral but     whats the matter with the ship captain whalley interrupted in measured tones  nothings the matter sound old steamer her owner has been in my office this afternoon tearing his hair  is he a white man asked whalley in an interested voice  he calls himself a white man answered the masterattendant scornfully but if so its just skindeep and no more i told him that to his face too  but who is he then  hes the chief engineer of her see that harry  i see captain whalley said thoughtfully the engineer i see  how the fellow came to be a shipowner at the same time was quite a tale he came out third in a home ship nearly fifteen years ago captain eliott remembered and got paid off after a bad sort of row both with his skipper and his chief anyway they seemed jolly glad to get rid of him at all costs clearly a mutinous sort of chap well he remained out here a perfect nuisance everlastingly shipped and unshipped unable to keep a berth very long pretty nigh went through every engineroom afloat belonging to the colony then suddenly what do you think happened harry  captain whalley who seemed lost in a mental effort as of doing a sum in his head gave a slight start he really couldnt imagine the masterattendants voice vibrated dully with hoarse emphasis the man actually had the luck to win the second prize in the manilla lottery all these engineers and officers of ships took tickets in that gamble it seemed to be a perfect mania with them all  everybody expected now that he would take himself off home with his money and go to the devil in his own way not at all the sofala judged too small and not quite modern enough for the sort of trade she was in could be got for a moderate price from her owners who had ordered a new steamer from europe he rushed in and bought her this man had never given any signs of that sort of mental intoxication the mere fact of getting hold of a large sum of money may producenot till he got a ship of his own but then he went off his balance all at once came bouncing into the marine office on some transfer business with his hat hanging over his left eye and switching a little cane in his hand and told each one of the clerks separately that nobody could put him out now it was his turn there was no one over him on earth and there never would be either he swaggered and strutted between the desks talking at the top of his voice and trembling like a leaf all the while so that the current business of the office was suspended for the time he was in there and everybody in the big room stood openmouthed looking at his antics afterwards he could be seen during the hottest hours of the day with his face as red as fire rushing along up and down the quays to look at his ship from different points of view he seemed inclined to stop every stranger he came across just to let them know that there would be no longer anyone over him he had bought a ship nobody on earth could put him out of his engineroom now  good bargain as she was the price of the sofala took up pretty near all the lotterymoney he had left himself no capital to work with that did not matter so much for these were the halcyon days of steam coasting trade before some of the home shipping firms had thought of establishing local fleets to feed their main lines these when once organized took the biggest slices out of that cake of course and byandby a squad of confounded german tramps turned up east of suez canal and swept up all the crumbs they prowled on the cheap to and fro along the coast and between the islands like a lot of sharks in the water ready to snap up anything you let drop and then the high old times were over for good for years the sofala had made no more he judged than a fair living captain eliott looked upon it as his duty in every way to assist an english ship to hold her own and it stood to reason that if for want of a captain the sofala began to miss her trips she would very soon lose her trade there was the quandary the man was too impracticable too much of a beggar on horseback from the first he explained seemed to grow worse as the time went on in the last three years hes run through eleven skippers he had tried every single man here outside of the regular lines i had warned him before that this would not do and now of course no one will look at the sofala i had one or two men up at my office and talked to them but as they said to me what was the good of taking the berth to lead a regular dogs life for a month and then get the sack at the end of the first trip the fellow of course told me it was all nonsense there has been a plot hatching for years against him and now it had come all the horrid sailors in the port had conspired to bring him to his knees because he was an engineer  captain eliott emitted a throaty chuckle  and the fact is that if he misses a couple more trips he need never trouble himself to start again he wont find any cargo in his old trade theres too much competition nowadays for people to keep their stuff lying about for a ship that does not turn up when shes expected its a bad lookout for him he swears he will shut himself on board and starve to death in his cabin rather than sell hereven if he could find a buyer and thats not likely in the least not even the japs would give her insured value for her it isnt like selling sailingships steamers do get out of date besides getting old  he must have laid by a good bit of money though observed captain whalley quietly  the harbormaster puffed out his purple cheeks to an amazing size  not a stiver harry notasinglestiver  he waited but as captain whalley stroking his beard slowly looked down on the ground without a word he tapped him on the forearm tiptoed and said in a hoarse whisper  the manilla lottery has been eating him up  he frowned a little nodding in tiny affirmative jerks they all were going in for it a third of the wages paid to ships officers in my port he snorted went to manilla it was a mania that fellow massy had been bitten by it like the rest of them from the first but after winning once he seemed to have persuaded himself he had only to try again to get another big prize he had taken dozens and scores of tickets for every drawing since what with this vice and his ignorance of affairs ever since he had improvidently bought that steamer he had been more or less short of money  this in captain eliotts opinion gave an opening for a sensible sailorman with a few pounds to step in and save that fool from the consequences of his folly it was his craze to quarrel with his captains he had had some really good men too who would have been too glad to stay if he would only let them but no he seemed to think he was no owner unless he was kicking somebody out in the morning and having a row with the new man in the evening what was wanted for him was a master with a couple of hundred or so to take an interest in the ship on proper conditions you dont discharge a man for no fault only because of the fun of telling him to pack up his traps and go ashore when you know that in that case you are bound to buy back his share on the other hand a fellow with an interest in the ship is not likely to throw up his job in a huff about a trifle he had told massy that he had said this wont do mr massy we are getting very sick of you here in the marine office what you must do now is to try whether you could get a sailor to join you as partner that seems to be the only way and that was sound advice harry  captain whalley leaning on his stick was perfectly still all over and his hand arrested in the act of stroking grasped his whole beard and what did the fellow say to that  the fellow had the audacity to fly out at the masterattendant he had received the advice in a most impudent manner i didnt come here to be laughed at he had shrieked i appeal to you as an englishman and a shipowner brought to the verge of ruin by an illegal conspiracy of your beggarly sailors and all you condescend to do for me is to tell me to go and get a partner    the fellow had presumed to stamp with rage on the floor of the private office where was he going to get a partner was he being taken for a fool not a single one of that contemptible lot ashore at the home had twopence in his pocket to bless himself with the very native curs in the bazaar knew that much    and its true enough harry rumbled captain eliott judicially they are much more likely one and all to owe money to the chinamen in denham road for the clothes on their backs well said i you make too much noise over it for my taste mr massy good morning he banged the door after him he dared to bang my door confound his cheek  the head of the marine department was out of breath with indignation then recollecting himself as it were ill end by being late to dinneryarning with you here    wife doesnt like it  he clambered ponderously into the trap leaned out sideways and only then wondered wheezily what on earth captain whalley could have been doing with himself of late they had had no sight of each other for years and years till the other day when he had seen him unexpectedly in the office  what on earth     captain whalley seemed to be smiling to himself in his white beard  the earth is big he said vaguely  the other as if to test the statement stared all round from his drivingseat the esplanade was very quiet only from afar from very far a long way from the seashore across the stretches of grass through the long ranges of trees came faintly the toottoottoot of the cable car beginning to roll before the empty peristyle of the public library on its threemile journey to the new harbor docks  doesnt seem to be so much room on it growled the masterattendant since these germans came along shouldering us at every turn it was not so in our time  he fell into deep thought breathing stertorously as though he had been taking a nap openeyed perhaps he too on his side had detected in the silent pilgrimlike figure standing there by the wheel like an arrested wayfarer the buried lineaments of the features belonging to the young captain of the condor good fellowharry whalleynever very talkative you never knew what he was up toa bit too offhand with people of consequence and apt to take a wrong view of a fellows actions fact was he had a too good opinion of himself he would have liked to tell him to get in and drive him home to dinner but one never knew wife would not like it  and its funny to think harry he went on in a big subdued drone that of all the people on it there seems only you and i left to remember this part of the world as it used to be     he was ready to indulge in the sweetness of a sentimental mood had it not struck him suddenly that captain whalley unstirring and without a word seemed to be awaiting somethingperhaps expecting    he gathered the reins at once and burst out in bluff hearty growls  ha my dear boy the men we have knownthe ships weve saileday and the things weve done     the pony plungedthe syce skipped out of the way captain whalley raised his arm  goodby   vi  the sun had set and when after drilling a deep hole with his stick he moved from that spot the night had massed its army of shadows under the trees they filled the eastern ends of the avenues as if only waiting the signal for a general advance upon the open spaces of the world they were gathering low between the deep stonefaced banks of the canal the malay prau halfconcealed under the arch of the bridge had not altered its position a quarter of an inch for a long time captain whalley stared down over the parapet till at last the floating immobility of that beshrouded thing seemed to grow upon him into something inexplicable and alarming the twilight abandoned the zenith its reflected gleams left the world below and the water of the canal seemed to turn into pitch captain whalley crossed it  the turning to the right which was his way to his hotel was only a very few steps farther he stopped again all the houses of the seafront were shut up the quayside was deserted but for one or two figures of natives walking in the distance and began to reckon the amount of his bill so many days in the hotel at so many dollars a day to count the days he used his fingers plunging one hand into his pocket he jingled a few silver coins all right for three days more and then unless something turned up he must break into the five hundredivys moneyinvested in her father it seemed to him that the first meal coming out of that reserve would choke himfor certain reason was of no use it was a matter of feeling his feelings had never played him false  he did not turn to the right he walked on as if there still had been a ship in the roadstead to which he could get himself pulled off in the evening far away beyond the houses on the slope of an indigo promontory closing the view of the quays the slim column of a factorychimney smoked quietly straight up into the clear air a chinaman curled down in the stern of one of the halfdozen sampans floating off the end of the jetty caught sight of a beckoning hand he jumped up rolled his pigtail round his head swiftly tucked in two rapid movements his wide dark trousers high up his yellow thighs and by a single noiseless finlike stir of the oars sheered the sampan alongside the steps with the ease and precision of a swimming fish  sofala articulated captain whalley from above and the chinaman a new emigrant probably stared upwards with a tense attention as if waiting to see the queer word fall visibly from the white mans lips sofala captain whalley repeated and suddenly his heart failed him he paused the shores the islets the high ground the low points were dark the horizon had grown somber and across the eastern sweep of the shore the white obelisk marking the landingplace of the telegraphcable stood like a pale ghost on the beach before the dark spread of uneven roofs intermingled with palms of the native town captain whalley began again  sofala savee sofala john  this time the chinaman made out that bizarre sound and grunted his assent uncouthly low down in his bare throat with the first yellow twinkle of a star that appeared like the head of a pin stabbed deep into the smooth pale shimmering fabric of the sky the edge of a keen chill seemed to cleave through the warm air of the earth at the moment of stepping into the sampan to go and try for the command of the sofala captain whalley shivered a little   when on his return he landed on the quay again venus like a choice jewel set low on the hem of the sky cast a faint gold trail behind him upon the roadstead as level as a floor made of one dark and polished stone the lofty vaults of the avenues were blackall black overheadand the porcelain globes on the lampposts resembled eggshaped pearls gigantic and luminous displayed in a row whose farther end seemed to sink in the distance down to the level of his knees he put his hands behind his back he would now consider calmly the discretion of it before saying the final word tomorrow his feet scrunched the gravel loudlythe discretion of it it would have been easier to appraise had there been a workable alternative the honesty of it was indubitable he meant well by the fellow and periodically his shadow leaped up intense by his side on the trunks of the trees to lengthen itself oblique and dim far over the grassrepeating his stride  the discretion of it was there a choice he seemed already to have lost something of himself to have given up to a hungry specter something of his truth and dignity in order to live but his life was necessary let poverty do its worst in exacting its toll of humiliation it was certain that ned eliott had rendered him without knowing it a service for which it would have been impossible to ask he hoped ned would not think there had been something underhand in his action he supposed that now when he heard of it he would understandor perhaps he would only think whalley an eccentric old fool what would have been the good of telling himany more than of blurting the whole tale to that man massy five hundred pounds ready to invest let him make the best of that let him wonder you want a captaini want a ship thats enough brrrr what a disagreeable impression that empty dark echoing steamer had made upon him     a laidup steamer was a dead thing and no mistake a sailingship somehow seems always ready to spring into life with the breath of the incorruptible heaven but a steamer thought captain whalley with her fires out without the warm whiffs from below meeting you on her decks without the hiss of steam the clangs of iron in her breastlies there as cold and still and pulseless as a corpse  in the solitude of the avenue all black above and lighted below captain whalley considering the discretion of his course met as it were incidentally the thought of death he pushed it aside with dislike and contempt he almost laughed at it and in the unquenchable vitality of his age only thought with a kind of exultation how little he needed to keep body and soul together not a bad investment for the poor woman this solid carcass of her father and for the restin case of anythingthe agreement should be clear the whole five hundred to be paid back to her integrally within three months integrally every penny he was not to lose any of her money whatever else had to goa little dignitysome of his selfrespect he had never before allowed anybody to remain under any sort of false impression as to himself well let that gofor her sake after all he had never said anything misleadingand captain whalley felt himself corrupt to the marrow of his bones he laughed a little with the intimate scorn of his worldly prudence clearly with a fellow of that sort and in the peculiar relation they were to stand to each other it would not have done to blurt out everything he did not like the fellow he did not like his spells of fawning loquacity and bursts of resentfulness in the enda poor devil he would not have liked to stand in his shoes men were not evil after all he did not like his sleek hair his queer way of standing at right angles with his nose in the air and glancing along his shoulder at you no on the whole men were not badthey were only silly or unhappy  captain whalley had finished considering the discretion of that stepand there was the whole long night before him in the full light his long beard would glisten like a silver breastplate covering his heart in the spaces between the lamps his burly figure passed less distinct loomed very big wandering and mysterious no there was not much real harm in men and all the time a shadow marched with him slanting on his left handwhich in the east is a presage of evil          can you make out the clump of palms yet serang asked captain whalley from his chair on the bridge of the sofala approaching the bar of batu beru  no tuan byandby see the old malay in a blue dungaree suit planted on his bony dark feet under the bridge awning put his hands behind his back and stared ahead out of the innumerable wrinkles at the corners of his eyes  captain whalley sat still without lifting his head to look for himself three yearsthirtysix times he had made these palms thirtysix times from the southward they would come into view at the proper time thank god the old ship made her courses and distances trip after trip as correct as clockwork at last he murmured again  in sight yet  the sun makes a very great glare tuan  watch well serang  ya tuan  a white man had ascended the ladder from the deck noiselessly and had listened quietly to this short colloquy then he stepped out on the bridge and began to walk from end to end holding up the long cherrywood stem of a pipe his black hair lay plastered in long lanky wisps across the bald summit of his head he had a furrowed brow a yellow complexion and a thick shapeless nose a scanty growth of whisker did not conceal the contour of his jaw his aspect was of brooding care and sucking at a curved black mouthpiece he presented such a heavy overhanging profile that even the serang could not help reflecting sometimes upon the extreme unloveliness of some white men  captain whalley seemed to brace himself up in his chair but gave no recognition whatever to his presence the other puffed jets of smoke then suddenly  i could never understand that new mania of yours of having this malay here for your shadow partner  captain whalley got up from the chair in all his imposing stature and walked across to the binnacle holding such an unswerving course that the other had to back away hurriedly and remained as if intimidated with the pipe trembling in his hand walk over me now he muttered in a sort of astounded and discomfited whisper then slowly and distinctly he said  iamnotdirt and then added defiantly as you seem to think  the serang jerked out  see the palms now tuan  captain whalley strode forward to the rail but his eyes instead of going straight to the point with the assured keen glance of a sailor wandered irresolutely in space as though he the discoverer of new routes had lost his way upon this narrow sea  another white man the mate came up on the bridge he was tall young lean with a mustache like a trooper and something malicious in the eye he took up a position beside the engineer captain whalley with his back to them inquired  whats on the log  eightyfive answered the mate quickly and nudged the engineer with his elbow  captain whalleys muscular hands squeezed the iron rail with an extraordinary force his eyes glared with an enormous effort he knitted his eyebrows the perspiration fell from under his hatand in a faint voice he murmured steady her serangwhen she is on the proper bearing  the silent malay stepped back waited a little and lifted his arm warningly to the helmsman the wheel revolved rapidly to meet the swing of the ship again the mate nudged the engineer but massy turned upon him  mr sterne he said violently let me tell youas a shipownerthat you are no better than a confounded fool   vii  sterne went down smirking and apparently not at all disconcerted but the engineer massy remained on the bridge moving about with uneasy selfassertion everybody on board was his inferioreveryone without exception he paid their wages and found them in their food they ate more of his bread and pocketed more of his money than they were worth and they had no care in the world while he alone had to meet all the difficulties of shipowning when he contemplated his position in all its menacing entirety it seemed to him that he had been for years the prey of a band of parasites and for years he had scowled at everybody connected with the sofala except perhaps at the chinese firemen who served to get her along their use was manifest they were an indispensable part of the machinery of which he was the master  when he passed along his decks he shouldered those he came across brutally but the malay deck hands had learned to dodge out of his way he had to bring himself to tolerate them because of the necessary manual labor of the ship which must be done he had to struggle and plan and scheme to keep the sofala afloatand what did he get for it not even enough respect they could not have given him enough of that if all their thoughts and all their actions had been directed to that end the vanity of possession the vainglory of power had passed away by this time and there remained only the material embarrassments the fear of losing that position which had turned out not worth having and an anxiety of thought which no abject subservience of men could repay  he walked up and down the bridge was his own after all he had paid for it and with the stem of the pipe in his hand he would stop short at times as if to listen with a profound and concentrated attention to the deadened beat of the engines his own engines and the slight grinding of the steering chains upon the continuous low wash of water alongside but for these sounds the ship might have been lying as still as if moored to a bank and as silent as if abandoned by every living soul only the coast the low coast of mud and mangroves with the three palms in a bunch at the back grew slowly more distinct in its long straight line without a single feature to arrest attention the native passengers of the sofala lay about on mats under the awnings the smoke of her funnel seemed the only sign of her life and connected with her gliding motion in a mysterious manner  captain whalley on his feet with a pair of binoculars in his hand and the little malay serang at his elbow like an old giant attended by a wizened pigmy was taking her over the shallow water of the bar  this submarine ridge of mud scoured by the stream out of the soft bottom of the river and heaped up far out on the hard bottom of the sea was difficult to get over the alluvial coast having no distinguishing marks the bearings of the crossingplace had to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland the guidance of a form flattened and uneven at the top like a grinder tooth and of another smooth saddlebacked summit had to be searched for within the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and float like a dry fiery mist filling the air ascending from the water shrouding the distances scorching to the eye in this veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coalblack with an opaque and motionless solidity thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon its outlines and shades of blue faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil and the openings of the estuary appeared shining white like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves  on the forepart of the bridge the giant and the pigmy muttered to each other frequently in quiet tones behind them massy stood sideways with an expression of disdain and suspense on his face his globular eyes were perfectly motionless and he seemed to have forgotten the long pipe he held in his hand  on the foredeck below the bridge steeply roofed with the white slopes of the awnings a young lascar seaman had clambered outside the rail he adjusted quickly a broad band of sail canvas under his armpits and throwing his chest against it leaned out far over the water the sleeves of his thin cotton shirt cut off close to the shoulder bared his brown arm of full rounded form and with a satiny skin like a womans he swung it rigidly with the rotary and menacing action of a slinger the 14lb weight hurtled circling in the air then suddenly flew ahead as far as the curve of the bow the wet thin line swished like scratched silk running through the dark fingers of the man and the plunge of the lead close to the ships side made a vanishing silvery scar upon the golden glitter then after an interval the voice of the young malay uplifted and longdrawn declared the depth of the water in his own language  tiga stengah he cried after each splash and pause gathering the line busily for another cast tiga stengah which means three fathom and a half for a mile or so from seaward there was a uniform depth of water right up to the bar halfthree halfthree halfthreeand his modulated cry returned leisurely and monotonous like the repeated call of a bird seemed to float away in sunshine and disappear in the spacious silence of the empty sea and of a lifeless shore lying open north and south east and west without the stir of a single cloudshadow or the whisper of any other voice  the ownerengineer of the sofala remained very still behind the two seamen of different race creed and color the european with the timedefying vigor of his old frame the little malay old too but slight and shrunken like a withered brown leaf blown by a chance wind under the mighty shadow of the other very busy looking forward at the land they had not a glance to spare and massy glaring at them from behind seemed to resent their attention to their duty like a personal slight upon himself  this was unreasonable but he had lived in his own world of unreasonable resentments for many years at last passing his moist palm over the rare lanky wisps of coarse hair on the top of his yellow head he began to talk slowly  a leadsman you want i suppose thats your correct mailboat style havent you enough judgment to tell where you are by looking at the land why before i had been a twelvemonth in the trade i was up to that trickand i am only an engineer i can point to you from here where the bar is and i could tell you besides that you are as likely as not to stick her in the mud in about five minutes from now only you would call it interfering i suppose and theres that written agreement of ours that says i mustnt interfere  his voice stopped captain whalley without relaxing the set severity of his features moved his lips to ask in a quick mumble  how near serang  very near now tuan the malay muttered rapidly  dead slow said the captain aloud in a firm tone  the serang snatched at the handle of the telegraph a gong clanged down below massy with a scornful snigger walked off and put his head down the engineroom skylight  you may expect some rare fooling with the engines jack he bellowed the space into which he stared was deep and full of gloom and the gray gleams of steel down there seemed cool after the intense glare of the sea around the ship the air however came up clammy and hot on his face a short hoot on which it would have been impossible to put any sort of interpretation came from the bottom cavernously this was the way in which the second engineer answered his chief  he was a middleaged man with an inattentive manner and apparently wrapped up in such a taciturn concern for his engines that he seemed to have lost the use of speech when addressed directly his only answer would be a grunt or a hoot according to the distance for all the years he had been in the sofala he had never been known to exchange as much as a frank goodmorning with any of his shipmates he did not seem aware that men came and went in the world he did not seem to see them at all indeed he never recognized his ship mates on shore at table the four white men of the sofala messed together he sat looking into his plate dispassionately but at the end of the meal would jump up and bolt down below as if a sudden thought had impelled him to rush and see whether somebody had not stolen the engines while he dined in port at the end of the trip he went ashore regularly but no one knew where he spent his evenings or in what manner the local coasting fleet had preserved a wild and incoherent tale of his infatuation for the wife of a sergeant in an irish infantry regiment the regiment however had done its turn of garrison duty there ages before and was gone somewhere to the other side of the earth out of mens knowledge twice or perhaps three times in the course of the year he would take too much to drink on these occasions he returned on board at an earlier hour than usual ran across the deck balancing himself with his spread arms like a tightrope walker and locking the door of his cabin he would converse and argue with himself the livelong night in an amazing variety of tones storm sneer and whine with an inexhaustible persistence massy in his berth next door raising himself on his elbow would discover that his second had remembered the name of every white man that had passed through the sofala for years and years back he remembered the names of men that had died that had gone home that had gone to america he remembered in his cups the names of men whose connection with the ship had been so short that massy had almost forgotten its circumstances and could barely recall their faces the inebriated voice on the other side of the bulkhead commented upon them all with an extraordinary and ingenious venom of scandalous inventions it seems they had all offended him in some way and in return he had found them all out he muttered darkly he laughed sardonically he crushed them one after another but of his chief massy he babbled with an envious and naive admiration clever scoundrel dont meet the likes of him every day just look at him ha great ship of his own wouldnt catch him going wrong no fearthe beast and massy after listening with a gratified smile to these artless tributes to his greatness would begin to shout thumping at the bulkhead with both fists  shut up you lunatic wont you let me go to sleep you fool  but a half smile of pride lingered on his lips outside the solitary lascar told off for night duty in harbor perhaps a youth fresh from a forest village would stand motionless in the shadows of the deck listening to the endless drunken gabble his heart would be thumping with breathless awe of white men the arbitrary and obstinate men who pursue inflexibly their incomprehensible purposesbeings with weird intonations in the voice moved by unaccountable feelings actuated by inscrutable motives    viii  for a while after his seconds answering hoot massy hung over the engineroom gloomily captain whalley who by the power of five hundred pounds had kept his command for three years might have been suspected of never having seen that coast before he seemed unable to put down his glasses as though they had been glued under his contracted eyebrows this settled frown gave to his face an air of invincible and just severity but his raised elbow trembled slightly and the perspiration poured from under his hat as if a second sun had suddenly blazed up at the zenith by the side of the ardent still globe already there in whose blinding white heat the earth whirled and shone like a mote of dust  from time to time still holding up his glasses he raised his other hand to wipe his streaming face the drops rolled down his cheeks fell like rain upon the white hairs of his beard and brusquely as if guided by an uncontrollable and anxious impulse his arm reached out to the stand of the engineroom telegraph  the gong clanged down below the balanced vibration of the deadslow speed ceased together with every sound and tremor in the ship as if the great stillness that reigned upon the coast had stolen in through her sides of iron and taken possession of her innermost recesses the illusion of perfect immobility seemed to fall upon her from the luminous blue dome without a stain arching over a flat sea without a stir the faint breeze she had made for herself expired as if all at once the air had become too thick to budge even the slight hiss of the water on her stem died out the narrow long hull carrying its way without a ripple seemed to approach the shoal water of the bar by stealth the plunge of the lead with the mournful mechanical cry of the lascar came at longer and longer intervals and the men on her bridge seemed to hold their breath the malay at the helm looked fixedly at the compass card the captain and the serang stared at the coast  massy had left the skylight and walking flatfooted had returned softly to the very spot on the bridge he had occupied before a slow lingering grin exposed his set of big white teeth they gleamed evenly in the shade of the awning like the keyboard of a piano in a dusky room  at last pretending to talk to himself in excessive astonishment he said not very loud  stop the engines now what next i wonder  he waited stooping from the shoulders his head bowed his glance oblique then raising his voice a shade  if i dared make an absurd remark i would say that you havent the stomach to     but a yelling spirit of excitement like some frantic soul wandering unsuspected in the vast stillness of the coast had seized upon the body of the lascar at the lead the languid monotony of his singsong changed to a swift sharp clamor the weight flew after a single whir the line whistled splash followed splash in haste the water had shoaled and the man instead of the drowsy tale of fathoms was calling out the soundings in feet  fifteen feet fifteen fifteen fourteen fourteen     captain whalley lowered the arm holding the glasses it descended slowly as if by its own weight no other part of his towering body stirred and the swift cries with their eager warning note passed him by as though he had been deaf  massy very still and turning an attentive ear had fastened his eyes upon the silvery closecropped back of the steady old head the ship herself seemed to be arrested but for the gradual decrease of depth under her keel  thirteen feet    thirteen twelve cried the leadsman anxiously below the bridge and suddenly the barefooted serang stepped away noiselessly to steal a glance over the side  narrow of shoulder in a suit of faded blue cotton an old gray felt hat rammed down on his head with a hollow in the nape of his dark neck and with his slender limbs he appeared from the back no bigger than a boy of fourteen there was a childlike impulsiveness in the curiosity with which he watched the spread of the voluminous yellowish convolutions rolling up from below to the surface of the blue water like massive clouds driving slowly upwards on the unfathomable sky he was not startled at the sight in the least it was not doubt but the certitude that the keel of the sofala must be stirring the mud now which made him peep over the side  his peering eyes set aslant in a face of the chinese type a little old face immovable as if carved in old brown oak had informed him long before that the ship was not headed at the bar properly paid off from the fair maid together with the rest of the crew after the completion of the sale he had hung in his faded blue suit and floppy gray hat about the doors of the harbor office till one day seeing captain whalley coming along to get a crew for the sofala he had put himself quietly in the way with his bare feet in the dust and an upward mute glance the eyes of his old commander had fallen on him favorablyit must have been an auspicious dayand in less than half an hour the white men in the ofiss had written his name on a document as serang of the fireship sofala since that time he had repeatedly looked at that estuary upon that coast from this bridge and from this side of the bar the record of the visual world fell through his eyes upon his unspeculating mind as on a sensitized plate through the lens of a camera his knowledge was absolute and precise nevertheless had he been asked his opinion and especially if questioned in the downright alarming manner of white men he would have displayed the hesitation of ignorance he was certain of his factsbut such a certitude counted for little against the doubt what answer would be pleasing fifty years ago in a jungle village and before he was a day old his father who died without ever seeing a white face had had his nativity cast by a man of skill and wisdom in astrology because in the arrangement of the stars may be read the last word of human destiny his destiny had been to thrive by the favor of various white men on the sea he had swept the decks of ships had tended their helms had minded their stores had risen at last to be a serang and his placid mind had remained as incapable of penetrating the simplest motives of those he served as they themselves were incapable of detecting through the crust of the earth the secret nature of its heart which may be fire or may be stone but he had no doubt whatever that the sofala was out of the proper track for crossing the bar at batu beru  it was a slight error the ship could not have been more than twice her own length too far to the northward and a white man at a loss for a cause since it was impossible to suspect captain whalley of blundering ignorance of want of skill or of neglect would have been inclined to doubt the testimony of his senses it was some such feeling that kept massy motionless with his teeth laid bare by an anxious grin not so the serang he was not troubled by any intellectual mistrust of his senses if his captain chose to stir the mud it was well he had known in his life white men indulge in outbreaks equally strange he was only genuinely interested to see what would come of it at last apparently satisfied he stepped back from the rail  he had made no sound captain whalley however seemed to have observed the movements of his serang holding his head rigidly he asked with a mere stir of his lips  going ahead still serang  still going a little tuan answered the malay then added casually she is over  the lead confirmed his words the depth of water increased at every cast and the soul of excitement departed suddenly from the lascar swung in the canvas belt over the sofalas side captain whalley ordered the lead in set the engines ahead without haste and averting his eyes from the coast directed the serang to keep a course for the middle of the entrance  massy brought the palm of his hand with a loud smack against his thigh  you grazed on the bar just look astern and see if you didnt look at the track she left you can see it plainly upon my soul i thought you would what made you do that what on earth made you do that i believe you are trying to scare me  he talked slowly as it were circumspectly keeping his prominent black eyes on his captain there was also a slight plaintive note in his rising choler for primarily it was the clear sense of a wrong suffered undeservedly that made him hate the man who for a beggarly five hundred pounds claimed a sixth part of the profits under the three years agreement whenever his resentment got the better of the awe the person of captain whalley inspired he would positively whimper with fury  you dont know what to invent to plague my life out of me i would not have thought that a man of your sort would condescend     he paused half hopefully half timidly whenever captain whalley made the slightest movement in the deckchair as though expecting to be conciliated by a soft speech or else rushed upon and hunted off the bridge  i am puzzled he went on again with the watchful unsmiling baring of his big teeth i dont know what to think i do believe you are trying to frighten me you very nearly planted her on the bar for at least twelve hours besides getting the engines choked with mud ships cant afford to lose twelve hours on a trip nowadaysas you ought to know very well and do know very well to be sure only     his slow volubility the sideways cranings of his neck the black glances out of the very corners of his eyes left captain whalley unmoved he looked at the deck with a severe frown massy waited for some little time then began to threaten plaintively  you think youve got me bound hand and foot in that agreement you think you can torment me in any way you please ah but remember it has another six weeks to run yet theres time for me to dismiss you before the three years are out you will do yet something that will give me the chance to dismiss you and make you wait a twelvemonth for your money before you can take yourself off and pull out your five hundred and leave me without a penny to get the new boilers for her you gloat over that ideadont you i do believe you sit here gloating its as if i had sold my soul for five hundred pounds to be everlastingly damned in the end     he paused without apparent exasperation then continued evenly     with the boilers worn out and the survey hanging over my head captain whalleycaptain whalley i say what do you do with your money you must have stacks of money somewherea man like you must it stands to reason i am not a fool you know captain whalleypartner  again he paused as though he had done for good he passed his tongue over his lips gave a backward glance at the serang conning the ship with quiet whispers and slight signs of the hand the wash of the propeller sent a swift ripple crested with dark froth upon a long flat spit of black slime the sofala had entered the river the trail she had stirred up over the bar was a mile astern of her now out of sight had disappeared utterly and the smooth empty sea along the coast was left behind in the glittering desolation of sunshine on each side of her low down the growth of somber twisted mangroves covered the semiliquid banks and massy continued in his old tone with an abrupt start as if his speech had been ground out of him like the tune of a musicbox by turning a handle  though if anybody ever got the best of me it is you i dont mind saying this ive said itthere what more can you want isnt that enough for your pride captain whalley you got over me from the first its all of a piece when i look back at it you allowed me to insert that clause about intemperance without saying anything only looking very sick when i made a point of it going in black on white how could i tell what was wrong about you theres generally something wrong somewhere and lo and behold when you come on board it turns out that youve been in the habit of drinking nothing but water for years and years  his dogmatic reproachful whine stopped he brooded profoundly after the manner of crafty and unintelligent men it seemed inconceivable that captain whalley should not laugh at the expression of disgust that overspread the heavy yellow countenance but captain whalley never raised his eyessitting in his armchair outraged dignified and motionless  much good it was to me massy remonstrated monotonously to insert a clause for dismissal for intemperance against a man who drinks nothing but water and you looked so upset too when i read my draft in the lawyers office that morning captain whalleyyou looked so crestfallen that i made sure i had gone home on your weak spot a shipowner cant be too careful as to the sort of skipper he gets you must have been laughing at me in your sleeve all the blessed time    eh what are you going to say  captain whalley had only shuffled his feet slightly a dull animosity became apparent in massys sideways stare  but recollect that there are other grounds of dismissal theres habitual carelessness amounting to incompetencetheres gross and persistent neglect of duty i am not quite as big a fool as you try to make me out to be you have been careless of lateleaving everything to that serang why ive seen you letting that old fool of a malay take bearings for you as if you were too big to attend to your work yourself and what do you call that silly touchandgo manner in which you took the ship over the bar just now you expect me to put up with that  leaning on his elbow against the ladder abaft the bridge sterne the mate tried to hear blinking the while from the distance at the second engineer who had come up for a moment and stood in the engineroom companion wiping his hands on a bunch of cotton waste he looked about with indifference to the right and left at the river banks slipping astern of the sofala steadily  massy turned full at the chair the character of his whine became again threatening  take care i may yet dismiss you and freeze to your money for a year i may     but before the silent rigid immobility of the man whose money had come in the nick of time to save him from utter ruin his voice died out in his throat  not that i want you to go he resumed after a silence and in an absurdly insinuating tone i want nothing better than to be friends and renew the agreement if you will consent to find another couple of hundred to help with the new boilers captain whalley ive told you before she must have new boilers you know it as well as i do have you thought this over  he waited the slender stem of the pipe with its bulky lump of a bowl at the end hung down from his thick lips it had gone out suddenly he took it from between his teeth and wrung his hands slightly  dont you believe me he thrust the pipe bowl into the pocket of his shiny black jacket  its like dealing with the devil he said why dont you speak at first you were so high and mighty with me i hardly dared to creep about my own deck now i cant get a word from you you dont seem to see me at all what does it mean upon my soul you terrify me with this deaf and dumb trick whats going on in that head of yours what are you plotting against me there so hard that you cant say a word you will never make me believe that youyoudont know where to lay your hands on a couple of hundred you have made me curse the day i was born     mr massy said captain whalley suddenly without stirring  the engineer started violently  if that is so i can only beg you to forgive me  starboard muttered the serang to the helmsman and the sofala began to swing round the bend into the second reach  ough massy shuddered you make my blood run cold what made you come here what made you come aboard that evening all of a sudden with your high talk and your moneytempting me i always wondered what was your motive you fastened yourself on me to have easy times and grow fat on my life blood i tell you was that it i believe you are the greatest miser in the world or else why     no i am only poor interrupted captain whalley stonily  steady murmured the serang massy turned away with his chin on his shoulder  i dont believe it he said in his dogmatic tone captain whalley made no movement there you sit like a gorged vultureexactly like a vulture  he embraced the middle of the reach and both the banks in one blank unseeing circular glance and left the bridge slowly   ix  on turning to descend massy perceived the head of sterne the mate loitering with his sly confident smile his red mustaches and blinking eyes at the foot of the ladder  sterne had been a junior in one of the larger shipping concerns before joining the sofala he had thrown up his berth he said on general principles the promotion in the employ was very slow he complained and he thought it was time for him to try and get on a bit in the world it seemed as though nobody would ever die or leave the firm they all stuck fast in their berths till they got mildewed he was tired of waiting and he feared that when a vacancy did occur the best servants were by no means sure of being treated fairly besides the captain he had to serve undercaptain provostwas an unaccountable sort of man and he fancied had taken a dislike to him for some reason or other for doing rather more than his bare duty as likely as not when he had done anything wrong he could take a talking to like a man but he expected to be treated like a man too and not to be addressed invariably as though he were a dog he had asked captain provost plump and plain to tell him where he was at fault and captain provost in a most scornful way had told him that he was a perfect officer and that if he disliked the way he was being spoken to there was the gangwayhe could take himself off ashore at once but everybody knew what sort of man captain provost was it was no use appealing to the office captain provost had too much influence in the employ all the same they had to give him a good character he made bold to say there was nothing in the world against him and as he had happened to hear that the mate of the sofala had been taken to the hospital that morning with a sunstroke he thought there would be no harm in seeing whether he would not do     he had come to captain whalley freshly shaved redfaced thinflanked throwing out his lean chest and had recited his little tale with an open and manly assurance now and then his eyelids quivered slightly his hand would steal up to the end of the flaming mustache his eyebrows were straight furry of a chestnut color and the directness of his frank gaze seemed to tremble on the verge of impudence captain whalley had engaged him temporarily then the other man having been ordered home by the doctors he had remained for the next trip and then the next he had now attained permanency and the performance of his duties was marked by an air of serious singleminded application directly he was spoken to he began to smile attentively with a great deference expressed in his whole attitude but there was in the rapid winking which went on all the time something quizzical as though he had possessed the secret of some universal joke cheating all creation and impenetrable to other mortals  grave and smiling he watched massy come down step by step when the chief engineer had reached the deck he swung about and they found themselves face to face matched as to height and utterly dissimilar they confronted each other as if there had been something between themsomething else than the bright strip of sunlight that falling through the wide lacing of two awnings cut crosswise the narrow planking of the deck and separated their feet as it were a stream something profound and subtle and incalculable like an unexpressed understanding a secret mistrust or some sort of fear  at last sterne blinking his deepset eyes and sticking forward his scraped cleancut chin as crimson as the rest of his face murmured  youve seen he grazed youve seen  massy contemptuous and without raising his yellow fleshy countenance replied in the same pitch  maybe but if it had been you we would have been stuck fast in the mud  pardon me mr massy i beg to deny it of course a shipowner may say what he jolly well pleases on his own deck thats all right but i beg to     get out of my way  the other had a slight start the impulse of suppressed indignation perhaps but held his ground massys downward glance wandered right and left as though the deck all round sterne had been bestrewn with eggs that must not be broken and he had looked irritably for places where he could set his feet in flight in the end he too did not move though there was plenty of room to pass on  i heard you say up there went on the mateand a very just remark it was toothat theres always something wrong     eavesdropping is whats wrong with you mr sterne  now if you would only listen to me for a moment mr massy sir i could     you are a sneak interrupted massy in a great hurry and even managed to get so far as to repeat a common sneak before the mate had broken in argumentatively  now sir what is it you want you want     i wanti want stammered massy infuriated and astonishedi want how do you know that i want anything how dare you    what do you mean    what are you afteryou     promotion sterne silenced him with a sort of candid bravado the engineers round soft cheeks quivered still but he said quietly enough  you are only worrying my head off and sterne met him with a confident little smile  a chap in business i know well up in the world he is now used to tell me that this was the proper way always push on to the front he would say keep yourself well before your boss interfere whenever you get a chance show him what you know worry him into seeing you that was his advice now i know no other boss than you here you are the owner and no one else counts for that much in my eyes see mr massy i want to get on i make no secret of it that i am one of the sort that means to get on these are the men to make use of sir you havent arrived at the top of the tree sir without finding that outi dare say  worry your boss in order to get on mumbled massy as if awestruck by the irreverent originality of the idea i shouldnt wonder if this was just what the blue anchor people kicked you out of the employ for is that what you call getting on you shall get on in the same way here if you arent carefuli can promise you  at this sterne hung his head thoughtful perplexed winking hard at the deck all his attempts to enter into confidential relations with his owner had led of late to nothing better than these dark threats of dismissal and a threat of dismissal would check him at once into a hesitating silence as though he were not sure that the proper time for defying it had come on this occasion he seemed to have lost his tongue for a moment and massy getting in motion heavily passed him by with an abortive attempt at shouldering sterne defeated it by stepping aside he turned then swiftly opening his mouth very wide as if to shout something after the engineer but seemed to think better of it  alwaysas he was ready to confesson the lookout for an opening to get on it had become an instinct with him to watch the conduct of his immediate superiors for something that one could lay hold of it was his belief that no skipper in the world would keep his command for a day if only the owners could be made to know this romantic and naive theory had led him into trouble more than once but he remained incorrigible and his character was so instinctively disloyal that whenever he joined a ship the intention of ousting his commander out of the berth and taking his place was always present at the back of his head as a matter of course it filled the leisure of his waking hours with the reveries of careful plans and compromising discoveriesthe dreams of his sleep with images of lucky turns and favorable accidents skippers had been known to sicken and die at sea than which nothing could be better to give a smart mate a chance of showing what hes made of they also would tumble overboard sometimes he had heard of one or two such cases others again    but as it were constitutionally he was faithful to the belief that the conduct of no single one of them would stand the test of careful watching by a man who knew whats what and who kept his eyes skinned pretty well all the time  after he had gained a permanent footing on board the sofala he allowed his perennial hope to rise high to begin with it was a great advantage to have an old man for captain the sort of man besides who in the nature of things was likely to give up the job before long from one cause or another sterne was greatly chagrined however to notice that he did not seem anyway near being past his work yet still these old men go to pieces all at once sometimes then there was the ownerengineer close at hand to be impressed by his zeal and steadiness sterne never for a moment doubted the obvious nature of his own merits he was really an excellent officer only nowadays professional merit alone does not take a man along fast enough a chap must have some push in him and must keep his wits at work too to help him forward he made up his mind to inherit the charge of this steamer if it was to be done at all not indeed estimating the command of the sofala as a very great catch but for the reason that out east especially to make a start is everything and one command leads to another  he began by promising himself to behave with great circumspection massys somber and fantastic humors intimidated him as being outside ones usual sea experience but he was quite intelligent enough to realize almost from the first that he was there in the presence of an exceptional situation his peculiar prying imagination penetrated it quickly the feeling that there was in it an element which eluded his grasp exasperated his impatience to get on and so one trip came to an end then another and he had begun his third before he saw an opening by which he could step in with any sort of effect it had all been very queer and very obscure something had been going on near him as if separated by a chasm from the common life and the working routine of the ship which was exactly like the life and the routine of any other coasting steamer of that class  then one day he made his discovery  it came to him after all these weeks of watchful observation and puzzled surmises suddenly like the longsought solution of a riddle that suggests itself to the mind in a flash not with the same authority however great heavens could it be that and after remaining thunderstruck for a few seconds he tried to shake it off with selfcontumely as though it had been the product of an unhealthy bias towards the incredible the inexplicable the unheardofthe mad  thisthe illuminating momenthad occurred the trip before on the return passage they had just left a place of call on the mainland called pangu they were steaming straight out of a bay to the east a massive headland closed the view with the tilted edges of the rocky strata showing through its ragged clothing of rank bushes and thorny creepers the wind had begun to sing in the rigging the sea along the coast green and as if swollen a little above the line of the horizon seemed to pour itself over time after time with a slow and thundering fall into the shadow of the leeward cape and across the wide opening the nearest of a group of small islands stood enveloped in the hazy yellow light of a breezy sunrise still farther out the hummocky tops of other islets peeped out motionless above the water of the channels between scoured tumultuously by the breeze  the usual track of the sofala both going and returning on every trip led her for a few miles along this reefinfested region she followed a broad lane of water dropping astern one after another these crumbs of the earths crust resembling a squadron of dismasted hulks run in disorder upon a foul ground of rocks and shoals some of these fragments of land appeared indeed no bigger than a stranded ship others quite flat lay awash like anchored rafts like ponderous black rafts of stone several heavily timbered and round at the base emerged in squat domes of deep green foliage that shuddered darkly all over to the flying touch of cloud shadows driven by the sudden gusts of the squally season the thunderstorms of the coast broke frequently over that cluster it turned then shadowy in its whole extent it turned more dark and as if more still in the play of fire as if more impenetrably silent in the peals of thunder its blurred shapes vanisheddissolving utterly at times in the thick rainto reappear clearcut and black in the stormy light against the gray sheet of the cloudscattered on the slaty round table of the sea unscathed by storms resisting the work of years unfretted by the strife of the world there it lay unchanged as on that day four hundred years ago when first beheld by western eyes from the deck of a highpooped caravel  it was one of these secluded spots that may be found on the busy sea as on land you come sometimes upon the clustered houses of a hamlet untouched by mens restlessness untouched by their need by their thought and as if forgotten by time itself the lives of uncounted generations had passed it by and the multitudes of seafowl urging their way from all the points of the horizon to sleep on the outer rocks of the group unrolled the converging evolutions of their flight in long somber streamers upon the glow of the sky the palpitating cloud of their wings soared and stooped over the pinnacles of the rocks over the rocks slender like spires squat like martello towers over the pyramidal heaps like fallen ruins over the lines of bald bowlders showing like a wall of stones battered to pieces and scorched by lightningwith the sleepy clear glimmer of water in every breach the noise of their continuous and violent screaming filled the air  this great noise would meet the sofala coming up from batu beru it would meet her on quiet evenings a pitiless and savage clamor enfeebled by distance the clamor of seabirds settling to rest and struggling for a footing at the end of the day no one noticed it especially on board it was the voice of their ships unerring landfall ending the steady stretch of a hundred miles she had made good her course she had run her distance till the punctual islets began to emerge one by one the points of rocks the hummocks of earth    and the cloud of birds hoveredthe restless cloud emitting a strident and cruel uproar the sound of the familiar scene the living part of the broken land beneath of the outspread sea and of the high sky without a flaw  but when the sofala happened to close with the land after sunset she would find everything very still there under the mantle of the night all would be still dumb almost invisiblebut for the blotting out of the low constellations occulted in turns behind the vague masses of the islets whose true outlines eluded the eye amongst the dark spaces of the heaven and the ships three lights resembling three starsthe red and the green with the white aboveher three lights like three companion stars wandering on the earth held their unswerving course for the passage at the southern end of the group sometimes there were human eyes open to watch them come nearer traveling smoothly in the somber void the eyes of a naked fisherman in his canoe floating over a reef he thought drowsily ha the fireship that once in every moon goes in and comes out of pangu bay more he did not know of her and just as he had detected the faint rhythm of the propeller beating the calm water a mile and a half away the time would come for the sofala to alter her course the lights would swing off him their triple beamand disappear  a few miserable halfnaked families a sort of outcast tribe of longhaired lean and wildeyed people strove for their living in this lonely wilderness of islets lying like an abandoned outwork of the land at the gates of the bay within the knots and loops of the rocks the water rested more transparent than crystal under their crooked and leaky canoes scooped out of the trunk of a tree the forms of the bottom undulated slightly to the dip of a paddle and the men seemed to hang in the air they seemed to hang inclosed within the fibers of a dark sodden log fishing patiently in a strange unsteady pellucid green air above the shoals  their bodies stalked brown and emaciated as if dried up in the sunshine their lives ran out silently the homes where they were born went to rest and diedflimsy sheds of rushes and coarse grass eked out with a few ragged matswere hidden out of sight from the open sea no glow of their household fires ever kindled for a seaman a red spark upon the blind night of the group and the calms of the coast the flaming long calms of the equator the unbreathing concentrated calms like the deep introspection of a passionate nature brooded awfully for days and weeks together over the unchangeable inheritance of their children till at last the stones hot like live embers scorched the naked sole till the water clung warm and sickly and as if thickened about the legs of lean men with girded loins wading thighdeep in the pale blaze of the shallows and it would happen now and then that the sofala through some delay in one of the ports of call would heave in sight making for pangu bay as late as noonday  only a blurring cloud at first the thin mist of her smoke would arise mysteriously from an empty point on the clear line of sea and sky the taciturn fishermen within the reefs would extend their lean arms towards the offing and the brown figures stooping on the tiny beaches the brown figures of men women and children grubbing in the sand in search of turtles eggs would rise up crooked elbow aloft and hand over the eyes to watch this monthly apparition glide straight on swerve offand go by their ears caught the panting of that ship their eyes followed her till she passed between the two capes of the mainland going at full speed as though she hoped to make her way unchecked into the very bosom of the earth  on such days the luminous sea would give no sign of the dangers lurking on both sides of her path everything remained still crushed by the overwhelming power of the light and the whole group opaque in the sunshinethe rocks resembling pinnacles the rocks resembling spires the rocks resembling ruins the forms of islets resembling beehives resembling molehills the islets recalling the shapes of haystacks the contours of ivyclad towerswould stand reflected together upside down in the unwrinkled water like carved toys of ebony disposed on the silvered plateglass of a mirror  the first touch of blowing weather would envelop the whole at once in the spume of the windward breakers as if in a sudden cloudlike burst of steam and the clear water seemed fairly to boil in all the passages the provoked sea outlined exactly in a design of angry foam the wide base of the group the submerged level of broken waste and refuse left over from the building of the coast near by projecting its dangerous spurs all awash far into the channel and bristling with wicked long spits often a mile long with deadly spits made of froth and stones  and even nothing more than a brisk breezeas on that morning the voyage before when the sofala left pangu bay early and mr sternes discovery was to blossom out like a flower of incredible and evil aspect from the tiny seed of instinctive suspicioneven such a breeze had enough strength to tear the placid mask from the face of the sea to sterne gazing with indifference it had been like a revelation to behold for the first time the dangers marked by the hissing livid patches on the water as distinctly as on the engraved paper of a chart it came into his mind that this was the sort of day most favorable for a stranger attempting the passage a clear day just windy enough for the sea to break on every ledge buoying as it were the channel plainly to the sight whereas during a calm you had nothing to depend on but the compass and the practiced judgment of your eye and yet the successive captains of the sofala had had to take her through at night more than once nowadays you could not afford to throw away six or seven hours of a steamers time that you couldnt but then use is everything and with proper care    the channel was broad and safe enough the main point was to hit upon the entrance correctly in the darkfor if a man got himself involved in that stretch of broken water over yonder he would never get out with a whole shipif he ever got out at all  this was sternes last train of thought independent of the great discovery he had just seen to the securing of the anchor and had remained forward idling away a moment or two the captain was in charge on the bridge with a slight yawn he had turned away from his survey of the sea and had leaned his shoulders against the fish davit  these properly speaking were the very last moments of ease he was to know on board the sofala all the instants that came after were to be pregnant with purpose and intolerable with perplexity no more idle random thoughts the discovery would put them on the rack till sometimes he wished to goodness he had been fool enough not to make it at all and yet if his chance to get on rested on the discovery of something wrong he could not have hoped for a greater stroke of luck   x  the knowledge was too disturbing really there was something wrong with a vengeance and the moral certitude of it was at first simply frightful to contemplate sterne had been looking aft in a mood so idle that for once he was thinking no harm of anyone his captain on the bridge presented himself naturally to his sight how insignificant how casual was the thought that had started the train of discoverylike an accidental spark that suffices to ignite the charge of a tremendous mine  caught under by the breeze the awnings of the foredeck bellied upwards and collapsed slowly and above their heavy flapping the gray stuff of captain whalleys roomy coat fluttered incessantly around his arms and trunk he faced the wind in full light with his great silvery beard blown forcibly against his chest the eyebrows overhung heavily the shadows whence his glance appeared to be staring ahead piercingly sterne could just detect the twin gleam of the whites shifting under the shaggy arches of the brow at short range these eyes for all the mans affable manner seemed to look you through and through sterne never could defend himself from that feeling when he had occasion to speak with his captain he did not like it what a big heavy man he appeared up there with that little shrimp of a serang in close attendanceas was usual in this extraordinary steamer confounded absurd custom that he resented it surely the old fellow could have looked after his ship without that loafing native at his elbow sterne wriggled his shoulders with disgust what was it indolence or what  that old skipper must have been growing lazy for years they all grew lazy out east here sterne was very conscious of his own unimpaired activity they got slack all over but he towered very erect on the bridge and quite low by his side as you see a small child looking over the edge of a table the battered soft hat and the brown face of the serang peeped over the white canvas screen of the rail  no doubt the malay was standing back nearer to the wheel but the great disparity of size in close association amused sterne like the observation of a bizarre fact in nature they were as queer fish out of the sea as any in it  he saw captain whalley turn his head quickly to speak to his serang the wind whipped the whole white mass of the beard sideways he would be directing the chap to look at the compass for him or what not of course too much trouble to step over and see for himself sternes scorn for that bodily indolence which overtakes white men in the east increased on reflection some of them would be utterly lost if they hadnt all these natives at their beck and call they grew perfectly shameless about it too he was not of that sort thank god it wasnt in him to make himself dependent for his work on any shriveledup little malay like that as if one could ever trust a silly native for anything in the world but that fine old man thought differently it seems there they were together never far apart a pair of them recalling to the mind an old whale attended by a little pilotfish  the fancifulness of the comparison made him smile a whale with an inseparable pilotfish thats what the old man looked like for it could not be said he looked like a shark though mr massy had called him that very name but mr massy did not mind what he said in his savage fits sterne smiled to himselfand gradually the ideas evoked by the sound by the imagined shape of the word pilotfish the ideas of aid of guidance needed and received came uppermost in his mind the word pilot awakened the idea of trust of dependence the idea of welcome cleareyed help brought to the seaman groping for the land in the dark groping blindly in fogs feeling their way in the thick weather of the gales that filling the air with a salt mist blown up from the sea contract the range of sight on all sides to a shrunken horizon that seems within reach of the hand  a pilot sees better than a stranger because his local knowledge like a sharper vision completes the shapes of things hurriedly glimpsed penetrates the veils of mist spread over the land by the storms of the sea defines with certitude the outlines of a coast lying under the pall of fog the forms of landmarks half buried in a starless night as in a shallow grave he recognizes because he already knows it is not to his farreaching eye but to his more extensive knowledge that the pilot looks for certitude for this certitude of the ships position on which may depend a mans good fame and the peace of his conscience the justification of the trust deposited in his hands with his own life too which is seldom wholly his to throw away and the humble lives of others rooted in distant affections perhaps and made as weighty as the lives of kings by the burden of the awaiting mystery the pilots knowledge brings relief and certitude to the commander of a ship the serang however in his fanciful suggestion of a pilotfish attending a whale could not in any way be credited with a superior knowledge why should he have it these two men had come on that run togetherthe white and the brownon the same day and of course a white man would learn more in a week than the best native would in a month he was made to stick to the skipper as though he were of some useas the pilotfish they say is to the whale but howit was very markedhow a pilotfisha pilota    but if not superior knowledge then     sternes discovery was made it was repugnant to his imagination shocking to his ideas of honesty shocking to his conception of mankind this enormity affected ones outlook on what was possible in this world it was as if for instance the sun had turned blue throwing a new and sinister light on men and nature really in the first moment he had felt sickish as though he had got a blow below the belt for a second the very color of the sea seemed changedappeared queer to his wandering eye and he had a passing unsteady sensation in all his limbs as though the earth had started turning the other way  a very natural incredulity succeeding this sense of upheaval brought a measure of relief he had gasped it was over but afterwards during all that day sudden paroxysms of wonder would come over him in the midst of his occupations he would stop and shake his head the revolt of his incredulity had passed away almost as quick as the first emotion of discovery and for the next twentyfour hours he had no sleep that would never do at mealtimes he took the foot of the table set up for the white men on the bridge he could not help losing himself in a fascinated contemplation of captain whalley opposite he watched the deliberate upward movements of the arm the old man put his food to his lips as though he never expected to find any taste in his daily bread as though he did not know anything about it he fed himself like a somnambulist its an awful sight thought sterne and he watched the long period of mournful silent immobility with a big brown hand lying loosely closed by the side of the plate till he noticed the two engineers to the right and left looking at him in astonishment he would close his mouth in a hurry then and lowering his eyes wink rapidly at his plate it was awful to see the old chap sitting there it was even awful to think that with three words he could blow him up skyhigh all he had to do was to raise his voice and pronounce a single short sentence and yet that simple act seemed as impossible to attempt as moving the sun out of its place in the sky the old chap could eat in his terrific mechanical way but sterne from mental excitement could notnot that evening at any rate  he had had ample time since to get accustomed to the strain of the mealhours he would never have believed it but then use is everything only the very potency of his success prevented anything resembling elation he felt like a man who in his legitimate search for a loaded gun to help him on his way through the world chances to come upon a torpedoupon a live torpedo with a shattering charge in its head and a pressure of many atmospheres in its tail it is the sort of weapon to make its possessor careworn and nervous he had no mind to be blown up himself and he could not get rid of the notion that the explosion was bound to damage him too in some way  this vague apprehension had restrained him at first he was able now to eat and sleep with that fearful weapon by his side with the conviction of its power always in mind it had not been arrived at by any reflective process but once the idea had entered his head the conviction had followed overwhelmingly in a multitude of observed little facts to which before he had given only a languid attention the abrupt and faltering intonations of the deep voice the taciturnity put on like an armor the deliberate as if guarded movements the long immobilities as if the man he watched had been afraid to disturb the very air every familiar gesture every word uttered in his hearing every sigh overheard had acquired a special significance a confirmatory import  every day that passed over the sofala appeared to sterne simply crammed full with proofswith incontrovertible proofs at night when off duty he would steal out of his cabin in pyjamas for more proofs and stand a full hour perhaps on his bare feet below the bridge as absolutely motionless as the awning stanchion in its deck socket near by on the stretches of easy navigation it is not usual for a coasting captain to remain on deck all the time of his watch the serang keeps it for him as a matter of custom in open water on a straight course he is usually trusted to look after the ship by himself but this old man seemed incapable of remaining quietly down below no doubt he could not sleep and no wonder this was also a proof suddenly in the silence of the ship panting upon the still dark sea sterne would hear a low voice above him exclaiming nervously  serang  tuan  you are watching the compass well  yes i am watching tuan  the ship is making her course  she is tuan very straight  it is well and remember serang that the order is that you are to mind the helmsmen and keep a lookout with care the same as if i were not on deck  then when the serang had made his answer the low tones on the bridge would cease and everything round sterne seemed to become more still and more profoundly silent slightly chilled and with his back aching a little from long immobility he would steal away to his room on the port side of the deck he had long since parted with the last vestige of incredulity of the original emotions set into a tumult by the discovery some trace of the first awe alone remained not the awe of the man himselfhe could blow him up skyhigh with six wordsrather it was an awestruck indignation at the reckless perversity of avarice what else could it be at the mad and somber resolution that for the sake of a few dollars more seemed to set at naught the common rule of conscience and pretended to struggle against the very decree of providence  you could not find another man like this one in the whole round worldthank god there was something devilishly dauntless in the character of such a deception which made you pause  other considerations occurring to his prudence had kept him tonguetied from day to day it seemed to him now that it would yet have been easier to speak out in the first hour of discovery he almost regretted not having made a row at once but then the very monstrosity of the disclosure    why he could hardly face it himself let alone pointing it out to somebody else moreover with a desperado of that sort one never knew the object was not to get him out that was as well as done already but to step into his place bizarre as the thought seemed he might have shown fight a fellow up to working such a fraud would have enough cheek for anything a fellow that as it were stood up against god almighty himself he was a horrid marvelthats what he was he was perfectly capable of brazening out the affair scandalously till he got him sterne kicked out of the ship and everlastingly damaged his prospects in this part of the east yet if you want to get on something must be risked at times sterne thought he had been unduly timid of taking action in the past and what was worse it had come to this that in the present he did not seem to know what action to take  massys savage moroseness was too disconcerting it was an incalculable factor of the situation you could not tell what there was behind that insulting ferocity how could one trust such a temper it did not put sterne in bodily fear for himself but it frightened him exceedingly as to his prospects  though of course inclined to credit himself with exceptional powers of observation he had by now lived too long with his discovery he had gone on looking at nothing else till at last one day it occurred to him that the thing was so obvious that no one could miss seeing it there were four white men in all on board the sofala jack the second engineer was too dull to notice anything that took place out of his engineroom remained massythe ownerthe interested personnearly going mad with worry sterne had heard and seen more than enough on board to know what ailed him but his exasperation seemed to make him deaf to cautious overtures if he had only known it there was the very thing he wanted but how could you bargain with a man of that sort it was like going into a tigers den with a piece of raw meat in your hand he was as likely as not to rend you for your pains in fact he was always threatening to do that very thing and the urgency of the case combined with the impossibility of handling it with safety made sterne in his watches below toss and mutter openeyed in his bunk for hours as though he had been burning with fever  occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects he did not want to be left behind by some swift catastrophe massy being on the bridge the old man had to brace himself up and make a show he supposed but it was getting very bad with him very bad indeed now even massy had been emboldened to find fault this time sterne listening at the foot of the ladder had heard the others whimpering and artless denunciations luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this however small blame to him it took a clever man to hit upon the cause nevertheless it was high time to do something the old mans game could not be kept up for many days more  i may yet lose my life at this foolinglet alone my chance sterne mumbled angrily to himself after the stooping back of the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight yes no doubthe thought but to blurt out his knowledge would not advance his prospects on the contrary it would blast them utterly as likely as not he dreaded another failure he had a vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in this part of the world inexplicably enough for he had done nothing to them envy he supposed people were always down on a clever chap who made no bones about his determination to get on to do your duty and count on the gratitude of that brute massy would be sheer folly he was a bad lot unmanly a vicious man bad bad a brute a brute without a spark of anything human about him without so much as simple curiosity even or else surely he would have responded in some way to all these hints he had been given    such insensibility was almost mysterious massys state of exasperation seemed to sterne to have made him stupid beyond the ordinary silliness of shipowners  sterne meditating on the embarrassments of that stupidity forgot himself completely his stony unwinking stare was fixed on the planks of the deck  the slight quiver agitating the whole fabric of the ship was more perceptible in the silent river shaded and still like a forest path the sofala gliding with an even motion had passed beyond the coastbelt of mud and mangroves the shores rose higher in firm sloping banks and the forest of big trees came down to the brink where the earth had been crumbled by the floods it showed a steep brown cut denuding a mass of roots intertwined as if wrestling underground and in the air the interlaced boughs bound and loaded with creepers carried on the struggle for life mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves with here and there the shape of an enormous dark pillar soaring or a ragged opening as if torn by the flight of a cannonball disclosing the impenetrable gloom within the secular inviolable shade of the virgin forest the thump of the engines reverberated regularly like the strokes of a metronome beating the measure of the vast silence the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the river and the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied down behind the ship spread a thin dusky veil over the somber water which checked by the floodtide seemed to lie stagnant in the whole straight length of the reaches  sternes body as if rooted on the spot trembled slightly from top to toe with the internal vibration of the ship from under his feet came sometimes a sudden clang of iron the noisy burst of a shout below to the right the leaves of the treetops caught the rays of the low sun and seemed to shine with a golden green light of their own shimmering around the highest boughs which stood out black against a smooth blue sky that seemed to droop over the bed of the river like the roof of a tent the passengers for batu beru kneeling on the planks were engaged in rolling their bedding of mats busily they tied up bundles they snapped the locks of wooden chests a pockmarked peddler of small wares threw his head back to drain into his throat the last drops out of an earthenware bottle before putting it away in a roll of blankets knots of traveling traders standing about the deck conversed in low tones the followers of a small rajah from down the coast broadfaced simple young fellows in white drawers and round white cotton caps with their colored sarongs twisted across their bronze shoulders squatted on their hams on the hatch chewing betel with bright red mouths as if they had been tasting blood their spears lying piled up together within the circle of their bare toes resembled a casual bundle of dry bamboos a thin livid chinaman with a bulky package wrapped up in leaves already thrust under his arm gazed ahead eagerly a wandering kling rubbed his teeth with a bit of wood pouring over the side a bright stream of water out of his lips the fat rajah dozed in a shabby deckchairand at the turn of every bend the two walls of leaves reappeared running parallel along the banks with their impenetrable solidity fading at the top to a vaporous mistiness of countless slender twigs growing free of young delicate branches shooting from the topmost limbs of hoary trunks of feathery heads of climbers like delicate silver sprays standing up without a quiver there was not a sign of a clearing anywhere not a trace of human habitation except when in one place on the bare end of a low point under an isolated group of slender treeferns the jagged tangled remnants of an old hut on piles appeared with that peculiar aspect of ruined bamboo walls that look as if smashed with a club farther on half hidden under the drooping bushes a canoe containing a man and a woman together with a dozen green cocoanuts in a heap rocked helplessly after the sofala had passed like a navigating contrivance of venturesome insects of traveling ants while two glassy folds of water streaming away from each bow of the steamer across the whole width of the river ran with her up stream smoothly fretting their outer ends into a brown whispering tumble of froth against the miry foot of each bank  i must thought sterne bring that brute massy to his bearings its getting too absurd in the end heres the old man up there buried in his chairhe may just as well be in his grave for all the use hell ever be in the worldand the serangs in charge because thats what he is in charge in the place thats mine by rights i must bring that savage brute to his bearings ill do it at once too     when the mate made an abrupt start a little brown halfnaked boy with large black eyes and the string of a written charm round his neck became panicstruck at once he dropped the banana he had been munching and ran to the knee of a grave dark arab in flowing robes sitting like a biblical figure incongruously on a yellow tin trunk corded with a rope of twisted rattan the father unmoved put out his hand to pat the little shaven poll protectingly   xi  sterne crossed the deck upon the track of the chief engineer jack the second retreating backwards down the engineroom ladder and still wiping his hands treated him to an incomprehensible grin of white teeth out of his grimy hard face massy was nowhere to be seen he must have gone straight into his berth sterne scratched at the door softly then putting his lips to the rose of the ventilator said  i must speak to you mr massy just give me a minute or two  i am busy go away from my door  but pray mr massy     you go away dyou hear take yourself off altogetherto the other end of the shipquite away    the voice inside dropped low to the devil  sterne paused then very quietly  its rather pressing when do you think you will be at liberty sir  the answer to this was an exasperated never and at once sterne with a very firm expression of face turned the handle  mr massys staterooma narrow oneberth cabinsmelt strongly of soap and presented to view a swept dusted unadorned neatness not so much bare as barren not so much severe as starved and lacking in humanity like the ward of a public hospital or rather owing to the small size like the clean retreat of a desperately poor but exemplary person not a single photograph frame ornamented the bulkheads not a single article of clothing not as much as a spare cap hung from the brass hooks all the inside was painted in one plain tint of pale blue two big seachests in sailcloth covers and with iron padlocks fitted exactly in the space under the bunk one glance was enough to embrace all the strip of scrubbed planks within the four unconcealed corners the absence of the usual settee was striking the teakwood top of the washingstand seemed hermetically closed and so was the lid of the writingdesk which protruded from the partition at the foot of the bedplace containing a mattress as thin as a pancake under a threadbare blanket with a faded red stripe and a folded mosquitonet against the nights spent in harbor there was not a scrap of paper anywhere in sight no boots on the floor no litter of any sort not a speck of dust anywhere no traces of pipeash even which in a heavy smoker was morally revolting like a manifestation of extreme hypocrisy and the bottom of the old wooden armchair the only seat there polished with much use shone as if its shabbiness had been waxed the screen of leaves on the bank passing as if unrolled endlessly in the round opening of the port sent a wavering network of light and shade into the place  sterne holding the door open with one hand had thrust in his head and shoulders at this amazing intrusion massy who was doing absolutely nothing jumped up speechless  dont call names murmured sterne hurriedly i wont be called names i think of nothing but your good mr massy  a pause as of extreme astonishment followed they both seemed to have lost their tongues then the mate went on with a discreet glibness  you simply couldnt conceive whats going on on board your ship it wouldnt enter your head for a moment you are too goodtootoo upright mr massy to suspect anybody of such a    its enough to make your hair stand on end  he watched for the effect massy seemed dazed uncomprehending he only passed the palm of his hand on the coalblack wisps plastered across the top of his head in a tone suddenly changed to confidential audacity sterne hastened on  remember that theres only six weeks left to run    the other was looking at him stonily    so anyhow you shall require a captain for the ship before long  then only as if that suggestion had scarified his flesh in the manner of redhot iron massy gave a start and seemed ready to shriek he contained himself by a great effort  require a captain he repeated with scathing slowness who requires a captain you dare to tell me that i need any of you humbugging sailors to run my ship you and your likes have been fattening on me for years it would have hurt me less to throw my money overboard pampered useless ffffrauds the old ship knows as much as the best of you he snapped his teeth audibly and growled through them the silly law requires a captain  sterne had taken heart of grace meantime  and the silly insurance people too as well he said lightly but never mind that what i want to ask is why shouldnt i do sir i dont say but you could take a steamer about the world as well as any of us sailors i dont pretend to tell you that it is a very great trick    he emitted a short hollow guffaw familiarly    i didnt make the lawbut there it is and i am an active young fellow i quite hold with your ideas i know your ways by this time mr massy i wouldnt try to give myself airs like thatthater lazy specimen of an old man up there  he put a marked emphasis on the last sentence to lead massy away from the track in case    but he did not doubt of now holding his success the chief engineer seemed nonplused like a slow man invited to catch hold of a whirligig of some sort  what you want sir is a chap with no nonsense about him who would be content to be your sailingmaster quite right too well i am fit for the work as much as that serang because thats what it amounts to do you know sir that a dam malay like a monkey is in charge of your shipand no one else just listen to his feet pitpatting above us on the bridgereal officer in charge hes taking her up the river while the great man is wallowing in the chairperhaps asleep and if he is that would not make it much worse eithertake my word for it  he tried to thrust himself farther in massy with lowered forehead one hand grasping the back of the armchair did not budge  you think sir that the man has got you tight in his agreement    massy raised a heavy snarling face at this    well sir one cant help hearing of it on board its no secret and it has been the talk on shore for years fellows have been making bets about it no sir its you who have got him at your mercy you will say that you cant dismiss him for indolence difficult to prove in court and so on why yes but if you say the word sir i can tell you something about his indolence that will give you the clear right to fire him out on the spot and put me in charge for the rest of this very tripyes sir before we leave batu beruand make him pay a dollar a day for his keep till we get back if you like now what do you think of that come sir say the word its really well worth your while and i am quite ready to take your bare word a definite statement from you would be as good as a bond  his eyes began to shine he insisted a simple statementand he thought to himself that he would manage somehow to stick in his berth as long as it suited him he would make himself indispensable the ship had a bad name in her port it would be easy to scare the fellows off massy would have to keep him  a definite statement from me would be enough massy repeated slowly  yes sir it would sterne stuck out his chin cheerily and blinked at close quarters with that unconscious impudence which had the power to enrage massy beyond anything  the engineer spoke very distinctly  listen well to me then mr sterne i wouldntdye heari wouldnt promise you the value of two pence for anything you can tell me  he struck sternes arm away with a smart blow and catching hold of the handle pulled the door to the terrific slam darkened the cabin instantaneously to his eye as if after the flash of an explosion at once he dropped into the chair oh no you dont he whispered faintly  the ship had in that place to shave the bank so close that the gigantic wall of leaves came gliding like a shutter against the port the darkness of the primeval forest seemed to flow into that bare cabin with the odor of rotting leaves of sodden soilthe strong muddy smell of the living earth steaming uncovered after the passing of a deluge the bushes swished loudly alongside above there was a series of crackling sounds with a sharp rain of small broken branches falling on the bridge a creeper with a great rustle snapped on the head of a boat davit and a long luxuriant green twig actually whipped in and out of the open port leaving behind a few torn leaves that remained suddenly at rest on mr massys blanket then the ship sheering out in the stream the light began to return but did not augment beyond a subdued clearness for the sun was very low already and the river wending its sinuous course through a multitude of secular trees as if at the bottom of a precipitous gorge had been already invaded by a deepening gloomthe swift precursor of the night  oh no you dont murmured the engineer again his lips trembled almost imperceptibly his hands too a little and to calm himself he opened the writingdesk spread out a sheet of thin grayish paper covered with a mass of printed figures and began to scan them attentively for the twentieth time this trip at least  with his elbows propped his head between his hands he seemed to lose himself in the study of an abstruse problem in mathematics it was the list of the winning numbers from the last drawing of the great lottery which had been the one inspiring fact of so many years of his existence the conception of a life deprived of that periodical sheet of paper had slipped away from him entirely as another man according to his nature would not have been able to conceive a world without fresh air without activity or without affection a great pile of flimsy sheets had been growing for years in his desk while the sofala driven by the faithful jack wore out her boilers in tramping up and down the straits from cape to cape from river to river from bay to bay accumulating by that hard labor of an overworked starved ship the blackened mass of these documents massy kept them under lock and key like a treasure there was in them as in the experience of life the fascination of hope the excitement of a halfpenetrated mystery the longing of a halfsatisfied desire  for days together on a trip he would shut himself up in his berth with them the thump of the toiling engines pulsated in his ear and he would weary his brain poring over the rows of disconnected figures bewildering by their senseless sequence resembling the hazards of destiny itself he nourished a conviction that there must be some logic lurking somewhere in the results of chance he thought he had seen its very form his head swam his limbs ached he puffed at his pipe mechanically a contemplative stupor would soothe the fretfulness of his temper like the passive bodily quietude procured by a drug while the intellect remains tensely on the stretch nine nine aught four two he made a note the next winning number of the great prize was fortyseven thousand and five these numbers of course would have to be avoided in the future when writing to manilla for the tickets he mumbled pencil in hand    and five hm    hm he wetted his finger the papers rustled ha but whats this three years ago in the september drawing it was number nine aught four two that took the first prize most remarkable there was a hint there of a definite rule he was afraid of missing some recondite principle in the overwhelming wealth of his material what could it be and for half an hour he would remain dead still bent low over the desk without twitching a muscle at his back the whole berth would be thick with a heavy body of smoke as if a bomb had burst in there unnoticed unheard  at last he would lock up the desk with the decision of unshaken confidence jump and go out he would walk swiftly back and forth on that part of the foredeck which was kept clear of the lumber and of the bodies of the native passengers they were a great nuisance but they were also a source of profit that could not be disdained he needed every penny of profit the sofala could make little enough it was in all conscience the incertitude of chance gave him no concern since he had somehow arrived at the conviction that in the course of years every number was bound to have his winning turn it was simply a matter of time and of taking as many tickets as he could afford for every drawing he generally took rather more all the earnings of the ship went that way and also the wages he allowed himself as chief engineer it was the wages he paid to others that he begrudged with a reasoned and at the same time a passionate regret he scowled at the lascars with their deck brooms at the quartermasters rubbing the brass rails with greasy rags he was eager to shake his fist and roar abuse in bad malay at the poor carpentera timid sickly opiumfuddled chinaman in loose blue drawers for all costume who invariably dropped his tools and fled below with streaming tail and shaking all over before the fury of that devil but it was when he raised up his eyes to the bridge where one of these sailor frauds was always planted by law in charge of his ship that he felt almost dizzy with rage he abominated them all it was an old feud from the time he first went to sea an unlicked cub with a great opinion of himself in the engineroom the slights that had been put upon him the persecutions he had suffered at the hands of skippersof absolute nobodies in a steamship after all and now that he had risen to be a shipowner they were still a plague to him he had absolutely to pay away precious money to the conceited useless loafersas if a fully qualified engineerwho was the owner as wellwere not fit to be trusted with the whole charge of a ship well he made it pretty warm for them but it was a poor consolation he had come in time to hate the ship too for the repairs she required for the coalbills he had to pay for the poor beggarly freights she earned he would clench his hand as he walked and hit the rail a sudden blow viciously as though she could be made to feel pain and yet he could not do without er he needed her he must hang on to her tooth and nail to keep his head above water till the expected flood of fortune came sweeping up and landed him safely on the high shore of his ambition  it was now to do nothing nothing whatever and have plenty of money to do it on he had tasted of power the highest form of it his limited experience was aware ofthe power of shipowning what a deception vanity of vanities he wondered at his folly he had thrown away the substance for the shadow of the gratification of wealth he did not know enough to excite his imagination with any visions of luxury how could hethe child of a drunken boilermakergoing straight from the workshop into the engineroom of a northcountry collier but the notion of the absolute idleness of wealth he could very well conceive he reveled in it to forget his present troubles he imagined himself walking about the streets of hull he knew their gutters well as a boy with his pockets full of sovereigns he would buy himself a house his married sisters their husbands his old workshop chums would render him infinite homage there would be nothing to think of his word would be law he had been out of work for a long time before he won his prize and he remembered how carlo mariani commonly known as paunchy charley the maltese hotelkeeper at the slummy end of denham street had cringed joyfully before him in the evening when the news had come poor charley though he made his living by ministering to various abject vices gave credit for their food to many a piece of white wreckage he was naively overjoyed at the idea of his old bills being paid and he reckoned confidently on a spell of festivities in the cavernous grogshop downstairs massy remembered the curious respectful looks of the trashy white men in the place his heart had swelled within him massy had left charleys infamous den directly he had realized the possibilities open to him and with his nose in the air afterwards the memory of these adulations was a great sadness  this was the true power of moneyand no trouble with it nor any thinking required either he thought with difficulty and felt vividly to his blunt brain the problems offered by any ordered scheme of life seemed in their cruel toughness to have been put in his way by the obvious malevolence of men as a shipowner everyone had conspired to make him a nobody how could he have been such a fool as to purchase that accursed ship he had been abominably swindled there was no end to this swindling and as the difficulties of his improvident ambition gathered thicker round him he really came to hate everybody he had ever come in contact with a temper naturally irritable and an amazing sensitiveness to the claims of his own personality had ended by making of life for him a sort of infernoa place where his lost soul had been given up to the torment of savage brooding  but he had never hated anyone so much as that old man who had turned up one evening to save him from an utter disasterfrom the conspiracy of the wretched sailors he seemed to have fallen on board from the sky his footsteps echoed on the empty steamer and the strange deeptoned voice on deck repeating interrogatively the words mr massy mr massy there had been startling like a wonder and coming up from the depths of the cold engineroom where he had been pottering dismally with a candle amongst the enormous shadows thrown on all sides by the skeleton limbs of machinery massy had been struck dumb by astonishment in the presence of that imposing old man with a beard like a silver plate towering in the dusk rendered lurid by the expiring flames of sunset  want to see me on business what business i am doing no business cant you see that this ship is laid up massy had turned at bay before the pursuing irony of his disaster afterwards he could not believe his ears what was that old fellow getting at things dont happen that way it was a dream he would presently wake up and find the man vanished like a shape of mist the gravity the dignity the firm and courteous tone of that athletic old stranger impressed massy he was almost afraid but it was no dream five hundred pounds are no dream at once he became suspicious what did it mean of course it was an offer to catch hold of for dear life but what could there be behind  before they had parted after appointing a meeting in a solicitors office early on the morrow massy was asking himself what is his motive he spent the night in hammering out the clauses of the agreementa unique instrument of its sort whose tenor got bruited abroad somehow and became the talk and wonder of the port  massys object had been to secure for himself as many ways as possible of getting rid of his partner without being called upon at once to pay back his share captain whalleys efforts were directed to making the money secure was it not ivys moneya part of her fortune whose only other asset was the timedefying body of her old father sure of his forbearance in the strength of his love for her he accepted with stately serenity massys stupidly cunning paragraphs against his incompetence his dishonesty his drunkenness for the sake of other stringent stipulations at the end of three years he was at liberty to withdraw from the partnership taking his money with him provision was made for forming a fund to pay him off but if he left the sofala before the term from whatever cause barring death massy was to have a whole year for paying illness the lawyer had suggested a young man fresh from europe and not overburdened with business who was rather amused massy began to whine unctuously how could he be expected     let that go captain whalley had said with a superb confidence in his body acts of god he added in the midst of life we are in death but he trusted his maker with a still greater fearlessnesshis maker who knew his thoughts his human affections and his motives his creator knew what use he was making of his healthhow much he wanted it    i trust my first illness will be my last ive never been ill that i can remember he had remarked let it go  but at this early stage he had already awakened massys hostility by refusing to make it six hundred instead of five i cannot do that was all he had said simply but with so much decision that massy desisted at once from pressing the point but had thought to himself cant old curmudgeon wont he must have lots of money but he would like to get hold of a soft berth and the sixth part of my profits for nothing if he only could  and during these years massys dislike grew under the restraint of something resembling fear the simplicity of that man appeared dangerous of late he had changed however had appeared less formidable and with a lessened vigor of life as though he had received a secret wound but still he remained incomprehensible in his simplicity fearlessness and rectitude and when massy learned that he meant to leave him at the end of the time to leave him confronted with the problem of boilers his dislike blazed up secretly into hate  it had made him so cleareyed that for a long time now mr sterne could have told him nothing he did not know he had much ado in trying to terrorize that mean sneak into silence he wanted to deal alone with the situation andincredible as it might have appeared to mr sternehe had not yet given up the desire and the hope of inducing that hated old man to stay why there was nothing else to do unless he were to abandon his chances of fortune but now suddenly since the crossing of the bar at batu beru things seemed to be coming rapidly to a point it disquieted him so much that the study of the winning numbers failed to soothe his agitation and the twilight in the cabin deepened very somber  he put the list away muttering once more oh no my boy you dont not if i know it he did not mean the blinking eavesdropping humbug to force his action he took his head again into his hands his immobility confined in the darkness of this shutup little place seemed to make him a thing apart infinitely removed from the stir and the sounds of the deck  he heard them the passengers were beginning to jabber excitedly somebody dragged a heavy box past his door he heard captain whalleys voice above  stations mr sterne and the answer from somewhere on deck forward  ay ay sir  we shall moor head up stream this time the ebb has made  head up stream sir  you will see to it mr sterne  the answer was covered by the autocratic clang on the engineroom gong the propeller went on beating slowly one two three one two threewith pauses as if hesitating on the turn the gong clanged time after time and the water churned this way and that by the blades was making a great noisy commotion alongside mr massy did not move a shorelight on the other bank a quarter of a mile across the river drifted no bigger than a tiny star passing slowly athwart the circle of the port voices from mr van wyks jetty answered the hails from the ship ropes were thrown and missed and thrown again the swaying flame of a torch carried in a large sampan coming to fetch away in state the rajah from down the coast cast a sudden ruddy glare into his cabin over his very person mr massy did not move after a few last ponderous turns the engines stopped and the prolonged clanging of the gong signified that the captain had done with them a great number of boats and canoes of all sizes boarded the offside of the sofala then after a time the tumult of splashing of cries of shuffling feet of packages dropped with a thump the noise of the native passengers going away subsided slowly on the shore a voice cultivated slightly authoritative spoke very close alongside  brought any mail for me this time  yes mr van wyk this was from sterne answering over the rail in a tone of respectful cordiality shall i bring it up to you  but the voice asked again  wheres the captain  still on the bridge i believe he hasnt left his chair shall i     the voice interrupted negligently  i will come on board  mr van wyk sterne suddenly broke out with an eager effort will you do me the favor     the mate walked away quickly towards the gangway a silence fell mr massy in the dark did not move  he did not move even when he heard slow shuffling footsteps pass his cabin lazily he contented himself to bellow out through the closed door  youjack  the footsteps came back without haste the door handle rattled and the second engineer appeared in the opening shadowy in the sheen of the skylight at his back with his face apparently as black as the rest of his figure  we have been very long coming up this time mr massy growled without changing his attitude  what do you expect with half the boiler tubes plugged up for leaks the second defended himself loquaciously  none of your lip said massy  none of your rotten boilersi say retorted his faithful subordinate without animation huskily go down there and carry a head of steam on them yourselfif you dare i dont  you arent worth your salt then massy said the other made a faint noise which resembled a laugh but might have been a snarl  better go slow than stop the ship altogether he admonished his admired superior mr massy moved at last he turned in his chair and grinding his teeth  dam you and the ship i wish she were at the bottom of the sea then you would have to starve  the trusty second engineer closed the door gently  massy listened instead of passing on to the bathroom where he should have gone to clean himself the second entered his cabin which was next door mr massy jumped up and waited suddenly he heard the lock snap in there he rushed out and gave a violent kick to the door  i believe you are locking yourself up to get drunk he shouted  a muffled answer came after a while  my own time  if you take to boozing on the trip ill fire you out massy cried  an obstinate silence followed that threat massy moved away perplexed on the bank two figures appeared approaching the gangway he heard a voice tinged with contempt  i would rather doubt your word but i shall certainly speak to him of this  the other voice sternes said with a sort of regretful formality  thanks thats all i want i must do my duty  mr massy was surprised a short dapper figure leaped lightly on the deck and nearly bounded into him where he stood beyond the circle of light from the gangway lamp when it had passed towards the bridge after exchanging a hurried good evening massy said surlily to sterne who followed with slow steps  what is it youre making up to mr van wyk for now  far from it mr massy i am not good enough for mr van wyk neither are you sir in his opinion i am afraid captain whalley is it seems hes gone to ask him to dine up at the house this evening  then he murmured to himself darkly  i hope he will like it   xii  mr van wyk the white man of batu beru an exnaval officer who for reasons best known to himself had thrown away the promise of a brilliant career to become the pioneer of tobaccoplanting on that remote part of the coast had learned to like captain whalley the appearance of the new skipper had attracted his attention nothing more unlike all the diverse types he had seen succeeding each other on the bridge of the sofala could be imagined  at that time batu beru was not what it has become since the center of a prosperous tobaccogrowing district a tropically suburbanlooking little settlement of bungalows in one long street shaded with two rows of trees embowered by the flowering and trim luxuriance of the gardens with a threemilelong carriageroad for the afternoon drives and a firstclass resident with a fat cheery wife to lead the society of married estatemanagers and unmarried young fellows in the service of the big companies  all this prosperity was not yet and mr van wyk prospered alone on the left bank on his deep clearing carved out of the forest which came down above and below to the waters edge his lonely bungalow faced across the river the houses of the sultan a restless and melancholy old ruler who had done with love and war for whom life no longer held any savor except of evil forebodings and time never had any value he was afraid of death and hoped he would die before the white men were ready to take his country from him he crossed the river frequently with never less than ten boats crammed full of people in the wistful hope of extracting some information on the subject from his own white man there was a certain chair on the veranda he always took the dignitaries of the court squatted on the rugs and skins between the furniture the inferior people remained below on the grass plot between the house and the river in rows three or four deep all along the front not seldom the visit began at daybreak mr van wyk tolerated these inroads he would nod out of his bedroom window toothbrush or razor in hand or pass through the throng of courtiers in his bathing robe he appeared and disappeared humming a tune polished his nails with attention rubbed his shaved face with eaudecologne drank his early tea went out to see his coolies at work returned looked through some papers on his desk read a page or two in a book or sat before his cottage piano leaning back on the stool his arms extended fingers on the keys his body swaying slightly from side to side when absolutely forced to speak he gave evasive vaguely soothing answers out of pure compassion the same feeling perhaps made him so lavishly hospitable with the aerated drinks that more than once he left himself without sodawater for a whole week that old man had granted him as much land as he cared to have cleared it was neither more nor less than a fortune  whether it was fortune or seclusion from his kind that mr van wyk sought he could not have pitched upon a better place even the mailboats of the subsidized company calling on the veriest clusters of palmthatched hovels along the coast steamed past the mouth of batu beru river far away in the offing the contract was old perhaps in a few years time when it had expired batu beru would be included in the service meantime all mr van wyks mail was addressed to malacca whence his agent sent it across once a month by the sofala it followed that whenever massy had run short of money through taking too many lottery tickets or got into a difficulty about a skipper mr van wyk was deprived of his letter and newspapers in so far he had a personal interest in the fortunes of the sofala though he considered himself a hermit and for no passing whim evidently since he had stood eight years of it already he liked to know what went on in the world  handy on the veranda upon a walnut etagere it had come last year by the sofalaeverything came by the sofala there lay piled up under bronze weights a pile of the times weekly edition the large sheets of the rotterdam courant the graphic in its worldwide green wrappers an illustrated dutch publication without a cover the numbers of a german magazine with covers of the bismarck malade color there were also parcels of new musicthough the piano it had come years ago by the sofala in the damp atmosphere of the forests was generally out of tune it was vexing to be cut off from everything for sixty days at a stretch sometimes without any means of knowing what was the matter and when the sofala reappeared mr van wyk would descend the steps of the veranda and stroll over the grass plot in front of his house down to the waterside with a frown on his white brow  youve been laid up after an accident i presume  he addressed the bridge but before anybody could answer massy was sure to have already scrambled ashore over the rail and pushed in squeezing the palms of his hands together bowing his sleek head as if gummed all over the top with black threads and tapes and he would be so enraged at the necessity of having to offer such an explanation that his moaning would be positively pitiful while all the time he tried to compose his big lips into a smile  no mr van wyk you would not believe it i couldnt get one of those wretches to take the ship out not a single one of the lazy beasts could be induced and the law you know mr van wyk     he moaned at great length apologetically the words conspiracy plot envy came out prominently whined with greater energy mr van wyk examining with a faint grimace his polished fingernails would say hm very unfortunate and turn his back on him  fastidious clever slightly skeptical accustomed to the best society he had held a muchenvied shore appointment at the ministry of marine for a year preceding his retreat from his profession and from europe he possessed a latent warmth of feeling and a capacity for sympathy which were concealed by a sort of haughty arbitrary indifference of manner arising from his early training and by a something an enemy might have called foppish in his aspectlike a distorted echo of past elegance he managed to keep an almost military discipline amongst the coolies of the estate he had dragged into the light of day out of the tangle and shadows of the jungle and the white shirt he put on every evening with its stiff glossy front and high collar looked as if he had meant to preserve the decent ceremony of eveningdress but had wound a thick crimson sash above his hips as a concession to the wilderness once his adversary now his vanquished companion  moreover it was a hygienic precaution worn wide open in front a short jacket of some airy silken stuff floated from his shoulders his fluffy fair hair thin at the top curled slightly at the sides a carefully arranged mustache an ungarnished forehead the gleam of low patent shoes peeping under the wide bottom of trowsers cut straight from the same stuff as the gossamer coat completed a figure recalling with its sash a pirate chief of romance and at the same time the elegance of a slightly bald dandy indulging in seclusion a taste for unorthodox costume  it was his evening getup the proper time for the sofala to arrive at batu beru was an hour before sunset and he looked picturesque and somehow quite correct too walking at the waters edge on the background of grass slope crowned with a low long bungalow with an immensely steep roof of palm thatch and clad to the eaves in flowering creepers while the sofala was being made fast he strolled in the shade of the few trees left near the landingplace waiting till he could go on board her white men were not of his kind the old sultan though his wistful invasions were a nuisance was really much more acceptable to his fastidious taste but still they were white the periodical visits of the ship made a break in the wellfilled sameness of the days without disturbing his privacy moreover they were necessary from a business point of view and through a strain of preciseness in his nature he was irritated when she failed to appear at the appointed time  the cause of the irregularity was too absurd and massy in his opinion was a contemptible idiot the first time the sofala reappeared under the new agreement swinging out of the bend below after he had almost given up all hope of ever seeing her again he felt so angry that he did not go down at once to the landingplace his servants had come running to him with the news and he had dragged a chair close against the front rail of the veranda spread his elbows out rested his chin on his hands and went on glaring at her fixedly while she was being made fast opposite his house he could make out easily all the white faces on board who on earth was that kind of patriarch they had got there on the bridge now  at last he sprang up and walked down the gravel path it was a fact that the very gravel for his paths had been imported by the sofala exasperated out of his quiet superciliousness without looking at anyone right or left he accosted massy straightway in so determined a manner that the engineer taken aback began to stammer unintelligibly nothing could be heard but the words mr van wyk    indeed mr van wyk    for the future mr van wykand by the suffusion of blood massys vast bilious face acquired an unnatural orange tint out of which the disconcerted coalblack eyes shone in an extraordinary manner  nonsense i am tired of this i wonder you have the impudence to come alongside my jetty as if i had it made for your convenience alone  massy tried to protest earnestly mr van wyk was very angry he had a good mind to ask that german firmthose people in malaccawhat was their nameboats with green funnels they would be only too glad of the opening to put one of their small steamers on the run yes schnitzler jacob schnitzler would in a moment yes he had decided to write without delay  in his agitation massy caught up his falling pipe  you dont mean it sir he shrieked  you shouldnt mismanage your business in this ridiculous manner  mr van wyk turned on his heel the other three whites on the bridge had not stirred during the scene massy walked hastily from side to side puffed out his cheeks suffocated  stuck up dutchman  and he moaned out feverishly a long tale of griefs the efforts he had made for all these years to please that man this was the return you got for it eh pretty write to schnitzlerlet in the greenfunnel boatsget an old hamburg jew to ruin him no really he could laugh    he laughed sobbingly    ha ha ha and make him carry the letter in his own ship presumably  he stumbled across a grating and swore he would not hesitate to fling the dutchmans correspondence overboardthe whole confounded bundle he had never never made any charge for that accommodation but captain whalley his new partner would not let him probably besides it would be only putting off the evil day for his own part he would make a hole in the water rather than look on tamely at the green funnels overrunning his trade  he raved aloud the china boys hung back with the dishes at the foot of the ladder he yelled from the bridge down at the deck arent we going to have any chow this evening at all then turned violently to captain whalley who waited grave and patient at the head of the table smoothing his beard in silence now and then with a forbearing gesture  you dont seem to care what happens to me dont you see that this affects your interests as much as mine its no joking matter  he took the foot of the table growling between his teeth  unless you have a few thousands put away somewhere i havent  mr van wyk dined in his thoroughly litup bungalow putting a point of splendor in the night of his clearing above the dark bank of the river afterwards he sat down to his piano and in a pause he became aware of slow footsteps passing on the path along the front a plank or two creaked under a heavy tread he swung half round on the musicstool listening with his fingertips at rest on the keyboard his little terrier barked violently backing in from the veranda a deep voice apologized gravely for this intrusion he walked out quickly  at the head of the steps the patriarchal figure who was the new captain of the sofala apparently he had seen a round dozen of them but not one of that sort towered without advancing the little dog barked unceasingly till a flick of mr van wyks handkerchief made him spring aside into silence captain whalley opening the matter was met by a punctiliously polite but determined opposition  they carried on their discussion standing where they had come face to face mr van wyk observed his visitor with attention then at last as if forced out of his reserve  i am surprised that you should intercede for such a confounded fool  this outbreak was almost complimentary as if its meaning had been that such a man as you should intercede captain whalley let it pass by without flinching one would have thought he had heard nothing he simply went on to state that he was personally interested in putting things straight between them personally     but mr van wyk really carried away by his disgust with massy became very incisive  indeedif i am to be frank with youhis whole character does not seem to me particularly estimable or trustworthy     captain whalley always straight seemed to grow an inch taller and broader as if the girth of his chest had suddenly expanded under his beard  my dear sir you dont think i came here to discuss a man with whom i ami amhmclosely associated  a sort of solemn silence lasted for a moment he was not used to asking favors but the importance he attached to this affair had made him willing to try    mr van wyk favorably impressed and suddenly mollified by a desire to laugh interrupted  thats all right if you make it a personal matter but you can do no less than sit down and smoke a cigar with me  a slight pause then captain whalley stepped forward heavily as to the regularity of the service for the future he made himself responsible for it and his name was whalleyperhaps to a sailor he was speaking to a sailor was he not not altogether unfamiliar there was a lighthouse now on an island maybe mr van wyk himself     oh yes oh indeed mr van wyk caught on at once he indicated a chair how very interesting for his own part he had seen some service in the last acheen war but had never been so far east whalley island of course now that was very interesting what changes his guest must have seen since  i can look further back evenon a whole halfcentury  captain whalley expanded a bit the flavor of a good cigar it was a weakness had gone straight to his heart also the civility of that young man there was something in that accidental contact of which he had been starved in his years of struggle  the front wall retreating made a square recess furnished like a room a lamp with a milky glass shade suspended below the slope of the high roof at the end of a slender brass chain threw a bright round of light upon a little table bearing an open book and an ivory paperknife and in the translucent shadows beyond other tables could be seen a number of easychairs of various shapes with a great profusion of skin rugs strewn on the teakwood planking all over the veranda the flowering creepers scented the air their foliage clipped out between the uprights made as if several frames of thick unstirring leaves reflecting the lamplight in a green glow through the opening at his elbow captain whalley could see the gangway lantern of the sofala burning dim by the shore the shadowy masses of the town beyond the open lustrous darkness of the river and as if hung along the straight edge of the projecting eaves a narrow black strip of the night sky full of starsresplendent the famous cigar in hand he had a moment of complacency  a trifle somebody must lead the way i just showed that the thing could be done but you men brought up to the use of steam cannot conceive the vast importance of my bit of venturesomeness to the eastern trade of the time why that new route reduced the average time of a southern passage by eleven days for more than half the year eleven days its on record but the remarkable thingspeaking to a sailori should say was     he talked well without egotism professionally the powerful voice produced without effort filled the bungalow even into the empty rooms with a deep and limpid resonance seemed to make a stillness outside and mr van wyk was surprised by the serene quality of its tone like the perfection of manly gentleness nursing one small foot in a silk sock and a patent leather shoe on his knee he was immensely entertained it was as if nobody could talk like this now and the overshadowed eyes the flowing white beard the big frame the serenity the whole temper of the man were an amazing survival from the prehistoric times of the world coming up to him out of the sea  captain whalley had been also the pioneer of the early trade in the gulf of petchili he even found occasion to mention that he had buried his dear wife there sixandtwenty years ago mr van wyk impassive could not help speculating in his mind swiftly as to the sort of woman that would mate with such a man did they make an adventurous and wellmatched pair no very possible she had been small frail no doubt very feminineor most likely commonplace with domestic instincts utterly insignificant but captain whalley was no garrulous bore and shaking his head as if to dissipate the momentary gloom that had settled on his handsome old face he alluded conversationally to mr van wyks solitude  mr van wyk affirmed that sometimes he had more company than he wanted he mentioned smilingly some of the peculiarities of his intercourse with my sultan he made his visits in force those people damaged his grass plot in front it was not easy to obtain some approach to a lawn in the tropics and the other day had broken down some rare bushes he had planted over there and captain whalley remembered immediately that in fortyseven the then sultan this mans grandfather had been notorious as a great protector of the piratical fleets of praus from farther east they had a safe refuge in the river at batu beru he financed more especially a balinini chief called haji daman captain whalley nodding significantly his bushy white eyebrows had very good reason to know something of that the world had progressed since that time  mr van wyk demurred with unexpected acrimony progressed in what he wanted to know  why in knowledge of truth in decency in justice in orderin honesty too since men harmed each other mostly from ignorance it was captain whalley concluded quaintly more pleasant to live in  mr van wyk whimsically would not admit that mr massy for instance was more pleasant naturally than the balinini pirates  the river had not gained much by the change they were in their way every bit as honest massy was less ferocious than haji daman no doubt but     and what about you my good sir captain whalley laughed a deep soft laugh you are an improvement surely  he continued in a vein of pleasantry a good cigar was better than a knock on the headthe sort of welcome he would have found on this river forty or fifty years ago then leaning forward slightly he became earnestly serious it seems as if outside their own seagypsy tribes these rovers had hated all mankind with an incomprehensible bloodthirsty hatred meantime their depredations had been stopped and what was the consequence the new generation was orderly peaceable settled in prosperous villages he could speak from personal knowledge and even the few survivors of that timeold men nowhad changed so much that it would have been unkind to remember against them that they had ever slit a throat in their lives he had one especially in his minds eye a dignified venerable headman of a certain large coast village about sixty miles souwest of tampasuk it did ones heart good to see himto hear that man speak he might have been a ferocious savage once what men wanted was to be checked by superior intelligence by superior knowledge by superior force tooyes by force held in trust from god and sanctified by its use in accordance with his declared will captain whalley believed a disposition for good existed in every man even if the world were not a very happy place as a whole in the wisdom of men he had not so much confidence the disposition had to be helped up pretty sharply sometimes he admitted they might be silly wrongheaded unhappy but naturally evilno there was at bottom a complete harmlessness at least     is there mr van wyk snapped acrimoniously  captain whalley laughed at the interjection in the good humor of large tolerating certitude he could look back at half a century he pointed out the smoke oozed placidly through the white hairs hiding his kindly lips  at all events he resumed after a pause i am glad that theyve had no time to do you much harm as yet  this allusion to his comparative youthfulness did not offend mr van wyk who got up and wriggled his shoulders with an enigmatic halfsmile they walked out together amicably into the starry night towards the riverside their footsteps resounded unequally on the dark path at the shore end of the gangway the lantern hung low to the handrail threw a vivid light on the white legs and the big black feet of mr massy waiting about anxiously from the waist upwards he remained shadowy with a row of buttons gleaming up to the vague outline of his chin  you may thank captain whalley for this mr van wyk said curtly to him before turning away  the lamps on the veranda flung three long squares of light between the uprights far over the grass a bat flitted before his face like a circling flake of velvety blackness along the jasmine hedge the night air seemed heavy with the fall of perfumed dew flowerbeds bordered the path the clipped bushes uprose in dark rounded clumps here and there before the house the dense foliage of creepers filtered the sheen of the lamplight within in a soft glow all along the front and everything near and far stood still in a great immobility in a great sweetness  mr van wyk a few years before he had had occasion to imagine himself treated more badly than anybody alive had ever been by a woman felt for captain whalleys optimistic views the disdain of a man who had once been credulous himself his disgust with the world the woman for a time had filled it for him completely had taken the form of activity in retirement because though capable of great depth of feeling he was energetic and essentially practical but there was in that uncommon old sailor drifting on the outskirts of his busy solitude something that fascinated his skepticism his very simplicity amusing enough was like a delicate refinement of an upright character the striking dignity of manner could be nothing else in a man reduced to such a humble position but the expression of something essentially noble in the character with all his trust in mankind he was no fool the serenity of his temper at the end of so many years since it could not obviously have been appeased by success wore an air of profound wisdom mr van wyk was amused at it sometimes even the very physical traits of the old captain of the sofala his powerful frame his reposeful mien his intelligent handsome face the big limbs the benign courtesy the touch of rugged severity in the shaggy eyebrows made up a seductive personality mr van wyk disliked littleness of every kind but there was nothing small about that man and in the exemplary regularity of many trips an intimacy had grown up between them a warm feeling at bottom under a kindly stateliness of forms agreeable to his fastidiousness  they kept their respective opinions on all worldly matters his other convictions captain whalley never intruded the difference of their ages was like another bond between them once when twitted with the uncharitableness of his youth mr van wyk running his eye over the vast proportions of his interlocutor retorted in friendly banter  oh youll come to my way of thinking yet youll have plenty of time dont call yourself old you look good for a round hundred  but he could not help his stinging incisiveness and though moderating it by an almost affectionate smile he added  and by then you will probably consent to die from sheer disgust  captain whalley smiling too shook his head god forbid  he thought that perhaps on the whole he deserved something better than to die in such sentiments the time of course would have to come and he trusted to his maker to provide a manner of going out of which he need not be ashamed for the rest he hoped he would live to a hundred if need be other men had been known it would be no miracle he expected no miracles  the pronounced argumentative tone caused mr van wyk to raise his head and look at him steadily captain whalley was gazing fixedly with a rapt expression as though he had seen his creators favorable decree written in mysterious characters on the wall he kept perfectly motionless for a few seconds then got his vast bulk on to his feet so impetuously that mr van wyk was startled  he struck first a heavy blow on his inflated chest and throwing out horizontally a big arm that remained steady extended in the air like the limb of a tree on a windless day  not a pain or an ache there can you see this shake in the least  his voice was low in an awing confident contrast with the headlong emphasis of his movements he sat down abruptly  this isnt to boast of it you know i am nothing he said in his effortless strong voice that seemed to come out as naturally as a river flows he picked up the stump of the cigar he had laid aside and added peacefully with a slight nod as it happens my life is necessary it isnt my own it isntgod knows  he did not say much for the rest of the evening but several times mr van wyk detected a faint smile of assurance flitting under the heavy mustache  later on captain whalley would now and then consent to dine at the house he could even be induced to drink a glass of wine dont think i am afraid of it my good sir he explained there was a very good reason why i should give it up  on another occasion leaning back at ease he remarked you have treated me mostmost humanely my dear mr van wyk from the very first  youll admit there was some merit mr van wyk hinted slyly an associate of that excellent massy    well well my dear captain i wont say a word against him  it would be no use your saying anything against him captain whalley affirmed a little moodily as ive told you before my lifemy work is necessary not for myself alone i cant choose    he paused turned the glass before him right round    i have an only childa daughter  the ample downward sweep of his arm over the table seemed to suggest a small girl at a vast distance i hope to see her once more before i die meantime its enough to know that she has me sound and solid thank god you cant understand how one feels bone of my bone flesh of my flesh the very image of my poor wife well she     again he paused then pronounced stoically the words she has a hard struggle  and his head fell on his breast his eyebrows remained knitted as by an effort of meditation but generally his mind seemed steeped in the serenity of boundless trust in a higher power mr van wyk wondered sometimes how much of it was due to the splendid vitality of the man to the bodily vigor which seems to impart something of its force to the soul but he had learned to like him very much   xiii  this was the reason why mr sternes confidential communication delivered hurriedly on the shore alongside the dark silent ship had disturbed his equanimity it was the most incomprehensible and unexpected thing that could happen and the perturbation of his spirit was so great that forgetting all about his letters he ran rapidly up the bridge ladder  the portable table was being put together for dinner to the left of the wheel by two pigtailed boys who as usual snarled at each other over the job while another a doleful burly very yellow chinaman resembling mr massy waited apathetically with the cloth over his arm and a pile of thick dinnerplates against his chest a common cabin lamp with its globe missing brought up from below had been hooked to the wooden framework of the awning the sidescreens had been lowered all round captain whalley filling the depths of the wickerchair seemed to sit benumbed in a canvas tent crudely lighted and used for the storing of nautical objects a shabby steeringwheel a battered brass binnacle on a stout mahogany stand two dingy lifebuoys an old cork fender lying in a corner dilapidated decklockers with loops of thin rope instead of doorhandles  he shook off the appearance of numbness to return mr van wyks unusually brisk greeting but relapsed directly afterwards to accept a pressing invitation to dinner up at the house cost him another very visible physical effort mr van wyk perplexed folded his arms and leaning back against the rail with his little black shiny feet well out examined him covertly  ive noticed of late that you are not quite yourself old friend  he put an affectionate gentleness into the last two words the real intimacy of their intercourse had never been so vividly expressed before  tut tut tut  the wickerchair creaked heavily  irritable commented mr van wyk to himself and aloud ill expect to see you in half an hour then he said negligently moving off  in half an hour captain whalleys rigid silvery head repeated behind him as if out of a trance  amidships below two voices close against the engineroom could be heard answering each otherone angry and slow the other alert  i tell you the beast has locked himself in to get drunk  cant help it now mr massy after all a man has a right to shut himself up in his cabin in his own time  not to get drunk  i heard him swear that the worry with the boilers was enough to drive any man to drink sterne said maliciously  massy hissed out something about bursting the door in mr van wyk to avoid them crossed in the dark to the other side of the deserted deck the planking of the little wharf rattled faintly under his hasty feet  mr van wyk mr van wyk  he walked on somebody was running on the path youve forgotten to get your mail  sterne holding a bundle of papers in his hand caught up with him  oh thanks  but as the other continued at his elbow mr van wyk stopped short the overhanging eaves descending low upon the lighted front of the bungalow threw their black straightedged shadow into the great body of the night on that side everything was very still a tinkle of cutlery and a slight jingle of glasses were heard mr van wyks servants were laying the table for two on the veranda  im afraid you give me no credit whatever for my good intentions in the matter ive spoken to you about said sterne  i simply dont understand you  captain whalley is a very audacious man but he will understand that his game is up thats all that anybody need ever know of it from me believe me i am very considerate in this but duty is duty i dont want to make a fuss all i ask you as his friend is to tell him from me that the games up that will be sufficient  mr van wyk felt a loathsome dismay at this queer privilege of friendship he would not demean himself by asking for the slightest explanation to drive the other away with contumely he did not think prudentas yet at any rate so much assurance staggered him who could tell what there could be in it he thought his regard for captain whalley had the tenacity of a disinterested sentiment and his practical instinct coming to his aid he concealed his scorn  i gather then that this is something grave  very grave sterne assented solemnly delighted at having produced an effect at last he was ready to add some effusive protestations of regret at the unavoidable necessity but mr van wyk cut him shortvery civilly however  once on the veranda mr van wyk put his hands in his pockets and straddling his legs stared down at a black panther skin lying on the floor before a rockingchair it looks as if the fellow had not the pluck to play his own precious game openly he thought  this was true enough in the face of massys last rebuff sterne dared not declare his knowledge his object was simply to get charge of the steamer and keep it for some time massy would never forgive him for forcing himself on but if captain whalley left the ship of his own accord the command would devolve upon him for the rest of the trip so he hit upon the brilliant idea of scaring the old man away a vague menace a mere hint would be enough in such a brazen case and with a strange admixture of compassion he thought that batu beru was a very good place for throwing up the sponge the skipper could go ashore quietly and stay with that dutchman of his werent these two as thick as thieves together and on reflection he seemed to see that there was a way to work the whole thing through that great friend of the old mans this was another brilliant idea he had an inborn preference for circuitous methods in this particular case he desired to remain in the background as much as possible to avoid exasperating massy needlessly no fuss let it all happen naturally  mr van wyk all through the dinner was conscious of a sense of isolation that invades sometimes the closeness of human intercourse captain whalley failed lamentably and obviously in his attempts to eat something he seemed overcome by a strange absentmindedness his hand would hover irresolutely as if left without guidance by a preoccupied mind mr van wyk had heard him coming up from a long way off in the profound stillness of the riverside and had noticed the irresolute character of the footfalls the toe of his boot had struck the bottom stair as though he had come along mooning with his head in the air right up to the steps of the veranda had the captain of the sofala been another sort of man he would have suspected the work of age there but one glance at him was enough timeafter indeed marking him for its ownhad given him up to his usefulness in which his simple faith would see a proof of divine mercy how could i contrive to warn him mr van wyk wondered as if captain whalley had been miles and miles away out of sight and earshot of all evil he was sickened by an immense disgust of sterne to even mention his threat to a man like whalley would be positively indecent there was something more vile and insulting in its hint than in a definite charge of crimethe debasing taint of blackmailing what could anyone bring against him he asked himself this was a limpid personality and for what object the power that man trusted had thought fit to leave him nothing on earth that envy could lay hold of except a bare crust of bread  wont you try some of this he asked pushing a dish slightly suddenly it seemed to mr van wyk that sterne might possibly be coveting the command of the sofala his cynicism was quite startled by what looked like a proof that no man may count himself safe from his kind unless in the very abyss of misery an intrigue of that sort was hardly worth troubling about he judged but still with such a fool as massy to deal with whalley ought to and must be warned  at this moment captain whalley bolt upright the deep cavities of the eyes overhung by a bushy frown and one large brown hand resting on each side of his empty plate spoke across the tablecloth abruptlymr van wyk youve always treated me with the most humane consideration  my dear captain you make too much of a simple fact that i am not a savage mr van wyk utterly revolted by the thought of sternes obscure attempt raised his voice incisively as if the mate had been hiding somewhere within earshot any consideration i have been able to show was no more than the rightful due of a character ive learned to regard by this time with an esteem that nothing can shake  a slight ring of glass made him lift his eyes from the slice of pineapple he was cutting into small pieces on his plate in changing his position captain whalley had contrived to upset an empty tumbler  without looking that way leaning sideways on his elbow his other hand shading his brow he groped shakily for it then desisted van wyk stared blankly as if something momentous had happened all at once he did not know why he should feel so startled but he forgot sterne utterly for the moment  why whats the matter  and captain whalley halfaverted in a deadened agitated voice muttered  esteem  and i may add something more mr van wyk very steadyeyed pronounced slowly  hold enough captain whalley did not change his attitude or raise his voice say no more i can make you no return i am too poor even for that now your esteem is worth having you are not a man that would stoop to deceive the poorest sort of devil on earth or make a ship unseaworthy every time he takes her to sea  mr van wyk leaning forward his face gone pink all over with the starched tablenapkin over his knees was inclined to mistrust his senses his power of comprehension the sanity of his guest  where why in the name of godwhats this what ship i dont understand who     then in the name of god it is i a ships unseaworthy when her captain cant see i am going blind  mr van wyk made a slight movement and sat very still afterwards for a few seconds then with the thought of sternes the games up he ducked under the table to pick up the napkin which had slipped off his knees this was the game that was up and at the same time the muffled voice of captain whalley passed over him  ive deceived them all nobody knows  he emerged flushed to the eyes captain whalley motionless under the full blaze of the lamp shaded his face with his hand  and you had that courage  call it by what name you like but you are a humane manaagentleman mr van wyk you may have asked me what i had done with my conscience  he seemed to muse profoundly silent very still in his mournful pose  i began to tamper with it in my pride you begin to see a lot of things when you are going blind i could not be frank with an old chum even i was not frank with massyno not altogether i knew he took me for a wealthy sailor fool and i let him i wanted to keep up my importancebecause there was poor ivy away theremy daughter what did i want to trade on his misery for i did trade on itfor her and now what mercy could i expect from him he would trade on mine if he knew it he would hunt the old fraud out and stick to the money for a year ivys money and i havent kept a penny for myself how am i going to live for a year a year in a year there will be no sun in the sky for her father  his deep voice came out awfully veiled as though he had been overwhelmed by the earth of a landslide and talking to you of the thoughts that haunt the dead in their graves a cold shudder ran down mr van wyks back  and how long is it since you have    he began  it was a long time before i could bring myself to believe in thisthis visitation captain whalley spoke with gloomy patience from under his hand  he had not thought he had deserved it he had begun by deceiving himself from day to day from week to week he had the serang at hand therean old servant it came on gradually and when he could no longer deceive himself     his voice died out almost  rather than give her up i set myself to deceive you all  its incredible whispered mr van wyk captain whalleys appalling murmur flowed on  not even the sign of gods anger could make me forget her how could i forsake my child feeling my vigor all the timethe blood warm within me warm as yours it seems to me that like the blinded samson i would find the strength to shake down a temple upon my head shes a struggling womanmy own child that we used to pray over together my poor wife and i do you remember that day i as well as told you that i believed god would let me live to a hundred for her sake what sin is there in loving your child do you see it i was ready for her sake to live for ever i half believed i would ive been praying for death since ha presumptuous manyou wanted to live     a tremendous shuddering upheaval of that big frame shaken by a gasping sob set the glasses jingling all over the table seemed to make the whole house tremble to the rooftree and mr van wyk whose feeling of outraged love had been translated into a form of struggle with nature understood very well that for that man whose whole life had been conditioned by action there could exist no other expression for all the emotions that to voluntarily cease venturing doing enduring for his childs sake would have been exactly like plucking his warm love for her out of his living heart something too monstrous too impossible even to conceive  captain whalley had not changed his attitude that seemed to express something of shame sorrow and defiance  i have even deceived you if it had not been for that word esteem these are not the words for me i would have lied to you havent i lied to you werent you going to trust your property on board this very trip  i have a floating yearly policy mr van wyk said almost unwittingly and was amazed at the sudden cropping up of a commercial detail  the ship is unseaworthy i tell you the policy would be invalid if it were known     we shall share the guilt then  nothing could make mine less said captain whalley  he had not dared to consult a doctor the man would have perhaps asked who he was what he was doing massy might have heard something he had lived on without any help human or divine the very prayers stuck in his throat what was there to pray for and death seemed as far as ever once he got into his cabin he dared not come out again when he sat down he dared not get up he dared not raise his eyes to anybodys face he felt reluctant to look upon the sea or up to the sky the world was fading before his great fear of giving himself away the old ship was his last friend he was not afraid of her he knew every inch of her deck but at her too he hardly dared to look for fear of finding he could see less than the day before a great incertitude enveloped him the horizon was gone the sky mingled darkly with the sea who was this figure standing over yonder what was this thing lying down there and a frightful doubt of the reality of what he could see made even the remnant of sight that remained to him an added torment a pitfall always open for his miserable pretense he was afraid to stumble inexcusably over somethingto say a fatal yes or no to a question the hand of god was upon him but it could not tear him away from his child and as if in a nightmare of humiliation every featureless man seemed an enemy  he let his hand fall heavily on the table mr van wyk arms down chin on breast with a gleam of white teeth pressing on the lower lip meditated on sternes the games up  the serang of course does not know  nobody said captain whalley with assurance  ah yes nobody very well can you keep it up to the end of the trip that is the last under the agreement with massy  captain whalley got up and stood erect very stately with the great white beard lying like a silver breastplate over the awful secret of his heart yes that was the only hope there was for him of ever seeing her again of securing the money the last he could do for her before he crept away somewhereuseless a burden a reproach to himself his voice faltered  think of it never see her any more the only human being besides myself now on earth that can remember my wife shes just like her mother lucky the poor woman is where there are no tears shed over those they loved on earth and that remain to pray not to be led into temptationbecause i suppose the blessed know the secret of grace in gods dealings with his created children  he swayed a little said with austere dignity  i dont i know only the child he has given me  and he began to walk mr van wyk jumping up saw the full meaning of the rigid head the hesitating feet the vaguely extended hand his heart was beating fast he moved a chair aside and instinctively advanced as if to offer his arm but captain whalley passed him by making for the stairs quite straight  he could not see me at all out of his line van wyk thought with a sort of awe then going to the head of the stairs he asked a little tremulously  what is it likelike a mistlike     captain whalley halfway down stopped and turned round undismayed to answer  it is as if the light were ebbing out of the world have you ever watched the ebbing sea on an open stretch of sands withdrawing farther and farther away from you it is like thisonly there will be no flood to follow never it is as if the sun were growing smaller the stars going out one by one there cant be many left that i can see by this but i havent had the courage to look of late    he must have been able to make out mr van wyk because he checked him by an authoritative gesture and a stoical  i can get about alone yet  it was as if he had taken his line and would accept no help from men after having been cast out like a presumptuous titan from his heaven mr van wyk arrested seemed to count the footsteps right out of earshot he walked between the tables tapping smartly with his heels took up a paperknife dropped it after a vague glance along the blade then happening upon the piano struck a few chords again and again vigorously standing up before the keyboard with an attentive poise of the head like a pianotuner closing it he pivoted on his heels brusquely avoided the little terrier sleeping trustfully on crossed forepaws came upon the stairs next and as though he had lost his balance on the top step ran down headlong out of the house his servants beginning to clear the table heard him mutter to himself evil words no doubt down there and then after a pause go away with a strolling gait in the direction of the wharf  the bulwarks of the sofala lying alongside the bank made a low black wall on the undulating contour of the shore two masts and a funnel uprose from behind it with a great rake as if about to fall a solid square elevation in the middle bore the ghostly shapes of white boats the curves of davits lines of rail and stanchions all confused and mingling darkly everywhere but low down amidships a single lighted port stared out on the night perfectly round like a small full moon whose yellow beam caught a patch of wet mud the edge of trodden grass two turns of heavy cable wound round the foot of a thick wooden post in the ground  mr van wyk peering alongside heard a muzzy boastful voice apparently jeering at a person called prendergast it mouthed abuse thickly choked then pronounced very distinctly the word murphy and chuckled glass tinkled tremulously all these sounds came from the lighted port mr van wyk hesitated stooped it was impossible to look through unless he went down into the mud  sterne he said half aloud  the drunken voice within said gladly  sterneof course look at him blink look at him sterne whalley massy massy whalley sterne but massys the best you cant come over him he would just love to see you starve  mr van wyk moved away made out farther forward a shadowy head stuck out from under the awnings as if on the watch and spoke quietly in malay is the mate asleep  no here at your service  in a moment sterne appeared walking as noiselessly as a cat on the wharf  its so jolly dark and i had no idea you would be down tonight  whats this horrible raving asked mr van wyk as if to explain the cause of a shudder than ran over him audibly  jacks broken out on a drunk thats our second its his way he will be right enough by tomorrow afternoon only mr massy will keep on worrying up and down the deck we had better get away  he muttered suggestively of a talk up at the house he had long desired to effect an entrance there but mr van wyk nonchalantly demurred it would not he feared be quite prudent perhaps and the opaque black shadow under one of the two big trees left at the landingplace swallowed them up impenetrably dense by the side of the wide river that seemed to spin into threads of glitter the light of a few big stars dropped here and there upon its outspread and flowing stillness  the situation is grave beyond doubt mr van wyk said ghostlike in their white clothes they could not distinguish each others features and their feet made no sound on the soft earth a sort of purring was heard mr sterne felt gratified by such a beginning  i thought mr van wyk a gentleman of your sort would see at once how awkwardly i was situated  yes very obviously his health is bad perhaps hes breaking up i see and he himself is well awarei assume i am speaking to a man of sensehe is well aware that his legs are giving out  his legsah mr sterne was disconcerted and then turned sulky you may call it his legs if you like what i want to know is whether he intends to clear out quietly thats a good one too his legs pooh  why yes only look at the way he walks mr van wyk took him up in a perfectly cool and undoubting tone the question however is whether your sense of duty does not carry you too far from your true interest after all i too could do something to serve you you know who i am  everybody along the straits has heard of you sir  mr van wyk presumed that this meant something favorable sterne had a soft laugh at this pleasantry he should think so to the opening statement that the partnership agreement was to expire at the end of this very trip he gave an attentive assent he was aware one heard of nothing else on board all the blessed day long as to massy it was no secret that he was in a jolly deep hole with these wornout boilers he would have to borrow somewhere a couple of hundred first of all to pay off the captain and then he would have to raise money on mortgage upon the ship for the new boilersthat is if he could find a lender at all at best it meant loss of time a break in the trade short earnings for the yearand there was always the danger of having his connection filched away from him by the germans it was whispered about that he had already tried two firms neither would have anything to do with him ship too old and the man too well known in the place    mr sternes final rapid winking remained buried in the deep darkness sibilating with his whispers  supposing then he got the loan mr van wyk resumed in a deliberate undertone on your own showing hes more than likely to get a mortgagees man thrust upon him as captain for my part i know that i would make that very stipulation myself if i had to find the money and as a matter of fact i am thinking of doing so it would be worth my while in many ways do you see how this would bear on the case under discussion  thank you sir i am sure you couldnt get anybody that would care more for your interests  well it suits my interest that captain whalley should finish his time i shall probably take a passage with you down the straits if that can be done ill be on the spot when all these changes take place and in a position to look after your interests  mr van wyk i want nothing better i am sure i am infinitely     i take it then that this may be done without any trouble  well sir what risk there is cant be helped but speaking to you as my employer now the thing is more safe than it looks if anybody had told me of it i wouldnt have believed it but i have been looking on myself that old serang has been trained up to the game theres nothing the matter with hishislimbs sir hes got used to doing things himself in a remarkable way and let me tell you sir that captain whalley poor man is by no means useless fact let me explain to you sir he stiffens up that old monkey of a malay who knows well enough what to do why he must have kept captains watches in all sorts of country ships off and on for the last fiveandtwenty years these natives sir as long as they have a white man close at the back will go on doing the right thing most surprisingly welleven if left quite to themselves only the white man must be of the sort to put starch into them and the captain is just the one for that why sir he has drilled him so well that now he needs hardly speak at all i have seen that little wrinkled ape made to take the ship out of pangu bay on a blowy morning and on all through the islands take her out firstrate sir dodging under the old mans elbow and in such quiet style that you could not have told for the life of you which of the two was doing the work up there thats where our poor friend would be still of use to the ship even ififhe could no longer lift a foot sir provided the serang does not know that theres anything wrong  he doesnt  naturally not quite beyond his apprehension they arent capable of finding out anything about us sir  you seem to be a shrewd man said mr van wyk in a choked mutter as though he were feeling sick  youll find me a good enough servant sir  mr sterne hoped now for a handshake at least but unexpectedly with a whats this better not to be seen together mr van wyks white shape wavered and instantly seemed to melt away in the black air under the roof of boughs the mate was startled yes there was that faint thumping clatter  he stole out silently from under the shade the lighted porthole shone from afar his head swam with the intoxication of sudden success what a thing it was to have a gentleman to deal with he crept aboard and there was something weird in the shadowy stretch of empty decks echoing with shouts and blows proceeding from a darker part amidships mr massy was raging before the door of the berth the drunken voice within flowed on undisturbed in the violent racket of kicks  shut up put your light out and turn in you confounded swilling pigyou dyou hear me you beast  the kicking stopped and in the pause the muzzy oracular voice announced from within  ah massy nowthats another thing massys deep  whos that aft there you sterne hell drink himself into a fit of horrors the chief engineer appeared vague and big at the corner of the engineroom  he will be good enough for duty tomorrow i would let him be mr massy  sterne slipped away into his berth and at once had to sit down his head swam with exultation he got into his bunk as if in a dream a feeling of profound peace of pacific joy came over him on deck all was quiet  mr massy with his ear against the door of jacks cabin listened critically to a deep stertorous breathing within this was a deaddrunk sleep the bout was over tranquilized on that score he too went in and with slow wriggles got out of his old tweed jacket it was a garment with many pockets which he used to put on at odd times of the day being subject to sudden chilly fits and when he felt warmed he would take it off and hang it about anywhere all over the ship it would be seen swinging on belayingpins thrown over the heads of winches suspended on peoples very doorhandles for that matter was he not the owner but his favorite place was a hook on a wooden awning stanchion on the bridge almost against the binnacle he had even in the early days more than one tussle on that point with captain whalley who desired the bridge to be kept tidy he had been overawed then of late though he had been able to defy his partner with impunity captain whalley never seemed to notice anything now as to the malays in their awe of that scowling man not one of the crew would dream of laying a hand on the thing no matter where or what it swung from  with an unexpectedness which made mr massy jump and drop the coat at his feet there came from the next berth the crash and thud of a headlong jingling clattering fall the faithful jack must have dropped to sleep suddenly as he sat at his revels and now had gone over chair and all breaking as it seemed by the sound every single glass and bottle in the place after the terrific smash all was still for a time in there as though he had killed himself outright on the spot mr massy held his breath at last a sleepy uneasy groaning sigh was exhaled slowly on the other side of the bulkhead  i hope to goodness hes too drunk to wake up now muttered mr massy  the sound of a softly knowing laugh nearly drove him to despair he swore violently under his breath the fool would keep him awake all night now for certain he cursed his luck he wanted to forget his maddening troubles in sleep sometimes he could detect no movements without apparently making the slightest attempt to get up jack went on sniggering to himself where he lay then began to speak where he had left off as it were  massy i love the dirty rascal he would like to see his poor old jack starvebut just you look where he has climbed to    he hiccoughed in a superior leisurely manner    shipowning it with the best a lottery ticket you want ha ha i will give you lottery tickets my boy let the old ship sink and the old chum starvethats right he dont go wrongmassy dont not he hes a geniusthat man is thats the way to win your money ship and chum must go  the silly fool has taken it to heart muttered massy to himself and listening with a softened expression of face for any slight sign of returning drowsiness he was discouraged profoundly by a burst of laughter full of joyful irony  would like to see her at the bottom of the sea oh you clever clever devil wish her sunk eh i should think you would my boy the damned old thing and all your troubles with her rake in the insurance money turn your back on your old chumalls wellgentleman again  a grim stillness had come over massys face only his big black eyes rolled uneasily the raving fool and yet it was all true yes lottery tickets too all true what beginning again he wished he wouldnt     but it was even so the imaginative drunkard on the other side of the bulkhead shook off the deathlike stillness that after his last words had fallen on the dark ship moored to a silent shore  dont you dare to say anything against george massy esquire when hes tired of waiting he will do away with her look out down she goeschum and all hell know how to     the voice hesitated weary dreamy lost as if dying away in a vast open space     find a trick that will work hes up to itnever fear     he must have been very drunk for at last the heavy sleep gripped him with the suddenness of a magic spell and the last word lengthened itself into an interminable noisy indrawn snore and then even the snoring stopped and all was still  but it seemed as though mr massy had suddenly come to doubt the efficacy of sleep as against a mans troubles or perhaps he had found the relief he needed in the stillness of a calm contemplation that may contain the vivid thoughts of wealth of a stroke of luck of long idleness and may bring before you the imagined form of every desire for turning about and throwing his arms over the edge of his bunk he stood there with his feet on his favorite old coat looking out through the round port into the night over the river sometimes a breath of wind would enter and touch his face a cool breath charged with the damp fresh feel from a vast body of water a glimmer here and there was all he could see of it and once he might after all suppose he had dozed off since there appeared before his vision unexpectedly and connected with no dream a row of flaming and gigantic figuresthree naught seven one twomaking up a number such as you may see on a lottery ticket and then all at once the port was no longer black it was pearly gray framing a shore crowded with houses thatched roof beyond thatched roof walls of mats and bamboo gables of carved teak timber rows of dwellings raised on a forest of piles lined the steely band of the river brimful and still with the tide at the turn this was batu beruand the day had come  mr massy shook himself put on the tweed coat and shivering nervously as if from some great shock made a note of the number a fortunate rare hint that yes but to pursue fortune one wanted moneyready cash  then he went out and prepared to descend into the engineroom several small jobs had to be seen to and jack was lying dead drunk on the floor of his cabin with the door locked at that his gorge rose at the thought of work ay but if you wanted to do nothing you had to get first a good bit of money a ship wont save you he cursed the sofala true all true he was tired of waiting for some chance that would rid him at last of that ship that had turned out a curse on his life   xiv  the deep interminable hoot of the steamwhistle had in its grave vibrating note something intolerable which sent a slight shudder down mr van wyks back it was the early afternoon the sofala was leaving batu beru for pangu the next place of call she swung in the stream scantily attended by a few canoes and gliding on the broad river became lost to view from the van wyk bungalow  its owner had not gone this time to see her off generally he came down to the wharf exchanged a few words with the bridge while she cast off and waved his hand to captain whalley at the last moment this day he did not even go as far as the balustrade of the veranda he couldnt see me if i did he said to himself i wonder whether he can make out the house at all and this thought somehow made him feel more alone than he had ever felt for all these years what was it six or seven seven a long time  he sat on the veranda with a closed book on his knee and as it were looked out upon his solitude as if the fact of captain whalleys blindness had opened his eyes to his own there were many sorts of heartaches and troubles and there was no place where they could not find a man out and he felt ashamed as though he had for six years behaved like a peevish boy  his thought followed the sofala on her way on the spur of the moment he had acted impulsively turning to the thing most pressing and what else could he have done later on he should see it seemed necessary that he should come out into the world for a time at least he had moneysomething could be arranged he would grudge no time no trouble no loss of his solitude it weighed on him nowand captain whalley appeared to him as he had sat shading his eyes as if being deceived in the trust of his faith he were beyond all the good and evil that can be wrought by the hands of men  mr van wyks thoughts followed the sofala down the river winding about through the belt of the coast forest between the buttressed shafts of the big trees through the mangrove strip and over the bar the ship crossed it easily in broad daylight piloted as it happened by mr sterne who took the watch from four to six and then went below to hug himself with delight at the prospect of being virtually employed by a rich manlike mr van wyk he could not see how any hitch could occur now he did not seem able to get over the feeling of being fixed up at last from six to eight in the course of duty the serang looked alone after the ship she had a clear road before her now till about three in the morning when she would close with the pangu group at eight mr sterne came out cheerily to take charge again till midnight at ten he was still chirruping and humming to himself on the bridge and about that time mr van wyks thought abandoned the sofala mr van wyk had fallen asleep at last  massy blocking the engineroom companion jerked himself into his tweed jacket surlily while the second waited with a scowl  oh you came out you sot well what have you got to say for yourself  he had been in charge of the engines till then a somber fury darkened his mind a hot anger against the ship against the facts of life against the men for their cheating against himself toobecause of an inward tremor of his heart  an incomprehensible growl answered him  what cant you open your mouth now you yelp out your infernal rot loud enough when you are drunk what do you mean by abusing people in that wayyou old useless boozer you  cant help it dont remember anything about it you shouldnt listen  you dare to tell me what do you mean by going on a drunk like this  dont ask me sick of the dam boilersyou would be sick of life  i wish you were dead then youve made me sick of you dont you remember the uproar you made last night you miserable old soaker  no i dont dont want to drink is drink  i wonder what prevents me from kicking you out what do you want here  relieve you youve been long enough down there george  dont you george meyou tippling old rascal you if i were to die tomorrow you would starve remember that say mr massy  mr massy repeated the other stolidly  disheveled with dull bloodshot eyes a snuffy grimy shirt greasy trowsers naked feet thrust into ragged slippers he bolted in head down directly massy had made way for him  the chief engineer looked around the deck was empty as far as the taffrail all the native passengers had left in batu beru this time and no others had joined the dial of the patent log tinkled periodically in the dark at the end of the ship it was a dead calm and under the clouded sky through the still air that seemed to cling warm with a seaweed smell to her slim hull on a sea of somber gray and unwrinkled the ship moved on an even keel as if floating detached in empty space but mr massy slapped his forehead tottered a little caught hold of a belayingpin at the foot of the mast  i shall go mad he muttered walking across the deck unsteadily a shovel was scraping loose coal down belowa firedoor clanged sterne on the bridge began whistling a new tune  captain whalley sitting on the couch awake and fully dressed heard the door of his cabin open he did not move in the least waiting to recognize the voice with an appalling strain of prudence  a bulkhead lamp blazed on the white paint the crimson plush the brown varnish of mahogany tops the white wood packingcase under the bedplace had remained unopened for three years now as though captain whalley had felt that after the fair maid was gone there could be no abidingplace on earth for his affections his hands rested on his knees his handsome head with big eyebrows presented a rigid profile to the doorway the expected voice spoke out at last  once more then what am i to call you  ha massy again the weariness of it crushed his heartand the pain of shame was almost more than he could bear without crying out  well is it to be partner still  you dont know what you ask  i know what i want     massy stepped in and closed the door     and i am going to have a try for it with you once more  his whine was half persuasive half menacing  for its no manner of use to tell me that you are poor you dont spend anything on yourself thats true enough but theres another name for that you think you are going to have what you want out of me for three years and then cast me off without hearing what i think of you you think i would have submitted to your airs if i had known you had only a beggarly five hundred pounds in the world you ought to have told me  perhaps said captain whalley bowing his head and yet it has saved you    massy laughed scornfully    i have told you often enough since  and i dont believe you now when i think how i let you lord it over my ship do you remember how you used to bullyrag me about my coat and your bridge it was in his way his bridge and i wont be a party to thisand i couldnt think of doing that honest man and now it all comes out i am poor and i cant i have only this five hundred in the world  he contemplated the immobility of captain whalley that seemed to present an inconquerable obstacle in his path his face took a mournful cast  you are a hard man  enough said captain whalley turning upon him you shall get nothing from me because i have nothing of mine to give away now  tell that to the marines  mr massy going out looked back once then the door closed and captain whalley alone sat as still as before he had nothing of his owneven his past of honor of truth of just pride was gone all his spotless life had fallen into the abyss he had said his last goodby to it but what belonged to her that he meant to save only a little money he would take it to her in his own handsthis last gift of a man that had lasted too long and an immense and fierce impulse the very passion of paternity flamed up with all the unquenched vigor of his worthless life in a desire to see her face  just across the deck massy had gone straight to his cabin struck a light and hunted up the note of the dreamed number whose figures had flamed up also with the fierceness of another passion he must contrive somehow not to miss a drawing that number meant something but what expedient could he contrive to keep himself going  wretched miser he mumbled  if mr sterne could at no time have told him anything new about his partner he could have told mr sterne that another use could be made of a mans affliction than just to kick him out and thus defer the term of a difficult payment for a year to keep the secret of the affliction and induce him to stay was a better move if without means he would be anxious to remain and that settled the question of refunding him his share he did not know exactly how much captain whalley was disabled but if it so happened that he put the ship ashore somewhere for good and all it was not the owners faultwas it he was not obliged to know that there was anything wrong but probably nobody would raise such a point and the ship was fully insured he had had enough selfrestraint to pay up the premiums but this was not all he could not believe captain whalley to be so confoundedly destitute as not to have some more money put away somewhere if he massy could get hold of it that would pay for the boilers and everything went on as before and if she got lost in the end so much the better he hated her he loathed the troubles that took his mind off the chances of fortune he wished her at the bottom of the sea and the insurance money in his pocket and as baffled he left captain whalleys cabin he enveloped in the same hatred the ship with the wornout boilers and the man with the dimmed eyes  and our conduct after all is so much a matter of outside suggestion that had it not been for his jacks drunken gabble he would have there and then had it out with this miserable man who would neither help nor stay nor yet lose the ship the old fraud he longed to kick him out but he restrained himself time enough for thatwhen he liked there was a fearful new thought put into his head wasnt he up to it after all how that beast jack had raved find a safe trick to get rid of her well jack was not so far wrong a very clever trick had occurred to him aye but what of the risk  a feeling of pridethe pride of superiority to common prejudicescrept into his breast made his heart beat fast his mouth turn dry not everybody would dare but he was massy and he was up to it  six bells were struck on deck eleven he drank a glass of water and sat down for ten minutes or so to calm himself then he got out of his chest a small bullseye lantern of his own and lit it  almost opposite his berth across the narrow passage under the bridge there was in the iron deckstructure covering the stokehold fiddle and the boilerspace a storeroom with iron sides iron roof ironplated floor too on account of the heat below all sorts of rubbish was shot there it had a mound of scrapiron in a corner rows of empty oilcans sacks of cottonwaste with a heap of charcoal a deckforge fragments of an old hencoop winchcovers all in rags remnants of lamps and a brown felt hat discarded by a man dead now of a fever on the brazil coast who had been once mate of the sofala had remained for years jammed forcibly behind a length of burst copper pipe flung at some time or other out of the engineroom a complete and imperious blackness pervaded that capharnaum of forgotten things a small shaft of light from mr massys bullseye fell slanting right through it  his coat was unbuttoned he shot the bolt of the door there was no other opening and squatting before the scrapheap began to pack his pockets with pieces of iron he packed them carefully as if the rusty nuts the broken bolts the links of cargo chain had been so much gold he had that one chance to carry away he packed his sidepockets till they bulged the breast pocket the pockets inside he turned over the pieces some he rejected a small mist of powdered rust began to rise about his busy hands mr massy knew something of the scientific basis of his clever trick if you want to deflect the magnetic needle of a ships compass soft iron is the best likewise many small pieces in the pockets of a jacket would have more effect than a few large ones because in that way you obtain a greater amount of surface for weight in your iron and its surface that tells  he slipped out swiftlytwo strides sufficedand in his cabin he perceived that his hands were all redred with rust it disconcerted him as though he had found them covered with blood he looked himself over hastily why his trowsers too he had been rubbing his rusty palms on his legs  he tore off the waistband button in his haste brushed his coat washed his hands then the air of guilt left him and he sat down to wait  he sat bolt upright and weighted with iron in his chair he had a hard lumpy bulk against each hip felt the scrappy iron in his pockets touch his ribs at every breath the downward drag of all these pounds hanging upon his shoulders he looked very dull too sitting idle there and his yellow face with motionless black eyes had something passive and sad in its quietness  when he heard eight bells struck above his head he rose and made ready to go out his movements seemed aimless his lower lip had dropped a little his eyes roamed about the cabin and the tremendous tension of his will had robbed them of every vestige of intelligence  with the last stroke of the bell the serang appeared noiselessly on the bridge to relieve the mate sterne overflowed with good nature since he had nothing more to desire  got your eyes well open yet serang its middling dark ill wait till you get your sight properly  the old malay murmured looked up with his worn eyes sidled away into the light of the binnacle and crossing his hands behind his back fixed his eyes on the compasscard  youll have to keep a good lookout ahead for land about halfpast three its fairly clear though you have looked in on the captain as you came alongeh he knows the time well then i am off  at the foot of the ladder he stood aside for the captain he watched him go up with an even certain tread and remained thoughtful for a moment its funny he said to himself but you can never tell whether that man has seen you or not he might have heard me breathe this time  he was a wonderful man when all was said and done they said he had had a name in his day mr sterne could well believe it and he concluded serenely that captain whalley must be able to see people more or less as himself just now for instancebut not being certain of anybody had to keep up that unnoticing silence of manner for fear of giving himself away mr sterne was a shrewd guesser  this necessity of every moment brought home to captain whalleys heart the humiliation of his falsehood he had drifted into it from paternal love from incredulity from boundless trust in divine justice meted out to mens feelings on this earth he would give his poor ivy the benefit of another months work perhaps the affliction was only temporary surely god would not rob his child of his power to help and cast him naked into a night without end he had caught at every hope and when the evidence of his misfortune was stronger than hope he tried not to believe the manifest thing  in vain in the steadily darkening universe a sinister clearness fell upon his ideas in the illuminating moments of suffering he saw life men all things the whole earth with all her burden of created nature as he had never seen them before  sometimes he was seized with a sudden vertigo and an overwhelming terror and then the image of his daughter appeared her too he had never seen so clearly before was it possible that he should ever be unable to do anything whatever for her nothing and not see her any more never  why the punishment was too great for a little presumption for a little pride and at last he came to cling to his deception with a fierce determination to carry it out to the end to save her money intact and behold her once more with his own eyes afterwardswhat the idea of suicide was revolting to the vigor of his manhood he had prayed for death till the prayers had stuck in his throat all the days of his life he had prayed for daily bread and not to be led into temptation in a childlike humility of spirit did words mean anything whence did the gift of speech come the violent beating of his heart reverberated in his headseemed to shake his brain to pieces  he sat down heavily in the deckchair to keep the pretense of his watch the night was dark all the nights were dark now  serang he said half aloud  ada tuan i am here  there are clouds on the sky  there are tuan  let her be steered straight north  she is going north tuan  the serang stepped back captain whalley recognized massys footfalls on the bridge  the engineer walked over to port and returned passing behind the chair several times captain whalley detected an unusual character as of prudent care in this prowling the near presence of that man brought with it always a recrudescence of moral suffering for captain whalley it was not remorse after all he had done nothing but good to the poor devil there was also a sense of dangerthe necessity of a greater care  massy stopped and said  so you still say you must go  i must indeed  and you couldnt at least leave the money for a term of years  impossible  cant trust it with me without your care eh  captain whalley remained silent massy sighed deeply over the back of the chair  it would just do to save me he said in a tremulous voice  ive saved you once  the chief engineer took off his coat with careful movements and proceeded to feel for the brass hook screwed into the wooden stanchion for this purpose he placed himself right in front of the binnacle thus hiding completely the compasscard from the quartermaster at the wheel tuan the lascar at last murmured softly meaning to let the white man know that he could not see to steer  mr massy had accomplished his purpose the coat was hanging from the nail within six inches of the binnacle and directly he had stepped aside the quartermaster a middleaged pockmarked sumatra malay almost as dark as a negro perceived with amazement that in that short time in this smooth water with no wind at all the ship had gone swinging far out of her course he had never known her get away like this before with a slight grunt of astonishment he turned the wheel hastily to bring her head back north which was the course the grinding of the steeringchains the chiding murmurs of the serang who had come over to the wheel made a slight stir which attracted captain whalleys anxious attention he said take better care then everything settled to the usual quiet on the bridge mr massy had disappeared  but the iron in the pockets of the coat had done its work and the sofala heading north by the compass made untrue by this simple device was no longer making a safe course for pangu bay  the hiss of water parted by her stem the throb of her engines all the sounds of her faithful and laborious life went on uninterrupted in the great calm of the sea joining on all sides the motionless layer of cloud over the sky a gentle stillness as vast as the world seemed to wait upon her path enveloping her lovingly in a supreme caress mr massy thought there could be no better night for an arranged shipwreck  run up high and dry on one of the reefs east of panguwait for daylighthole in the bottomout boatspangu bay same evening thats about it as soon as she touched he would hasten on the bridge get hold of the coat nobody would notice in the dark and shake it upsidedown over the side or even fling it into the sea a detail who could guess coat been seen hanging there from that hook hundreds of times nevertheless when he sat down on the lower step of the bridgeladder his knees knocked together a little the waiting part was the worst of it at times he would begin to pant quickly as though he had been running and then breathe largely swelling with the intimate sense of a mastered fate now and then he would hear the shuffle of the serangs bare feet up there quiet low voices would exchange a few words and lapse almost at once into silence     tell me directly you see any land serang  yes tuan not yet  no not yet captain whalley would agree  the ship had been the best friend of his decline he had sent all the money he had made by and in the sofala to his daughter his thought lingered on the name how often he and his wife had talked over the cot of the child in the big sterncabin of the condor she would grow up she would marry she would love them they would live near her and look at her happinessit would go on without end well his wife was dead to the child he had given all he had to give he wished he could come near her see her see her face once live in the sound of her voice that could make the darkness of the living grave ready for him supportable he had been starved of love too long he imagined her tenderness  the serang had been peering forward and now and then glancing at the chair he fidgeted restlessly and suddenly burst out close to captain whalley  tuan do you see anything of the land  the alarmed voice brought captain whalley to his feet at once he see and at the question the curse of his blindness seemed to fall on him with a hundredfold force  whats the time he cried  halfpast three tuan  we are close you must see look i say look  mr massy awakened by the sudden sound of talking from a short doze on the lowest step wondered why he was there ah a faintness came over him it is one thing to sow the seed of an accident and another to see the monstrous fruit hanging over your head ready to fall in the sound of agitated voices  theres no danger he muttered thickly  the horror of incertitude had seized upon captain whalley the miserable mistrust of men of thingsof the very earth he had steered that very course thirtysix times by the same compassif anything was certain in this world it was its absolute unerring correctness then what had happened did the serang lie why lie why was he going blind too  is there a mist look low on the water low down i say  tuan theres no mist see for yourself  captain whalley steadied the trembling of his limbs by an effort should he stop the engines at once and give himself away a gust of irresolution swayed all sorts of bizarre notions in his mind the unusual had come and he was not fit to deal with it in this passage of inexpressible anguish he saw her facethe face of a young girlwith an amazing strength of illusion no he must not give himself away after having gone so far for her sake you steered the course you made it speak the truth  ya tuan on the course now look  captain whalley strode to the binnacle which to him made such a dim spot of light in an infinity of shapeless shadow by bending his face right down to the glass he had been able before     having to stoop so low he put out instinctively his arm to where he knew there was a stanchion to steady himself against his hand closed on something that was not wood but cloth the slight pull adding to the weight the loop broke and mr massys coat falling struck the deck heavily with a dull thump accompanied by a lot of clicks  whats this  captain whalley fell on his knees with groping hands extended in a frank gesture of blindness they trembled these hands feeling for the truth he saw it iron near the compass wrong course wreck her his ship oh no not that  jump and stop her he roared out in a voice not his own  he ran himselfhands forward a blind man and while the clanging of the gong echoed still all over the ship she seemed to butt full tilt into the side of a mountain  it was low water along the north side of the strait mr massy had not reckoned on that instead of running aground for half her length the sofala butted the sheer ridge of a stone reef which would have been awash at high water this made the shock absolutely terrific everybody in the ship that was standing was thrown down headlong the shaken rigging made a great rattling to the very trucks all the lights went out several chainguys snapping clattered against the funnel there were crashes pings of parted wirerope splintering sounds loud cracks the masthead lamp flew over the bows and all the doors about the deck began to bang heavily then after having hit she rebounded hit the second time the very same spot like a batteringram this completed the havoc the funnel with all the guys gone fell over with a hollow sound of thunder smashing the wheel to bits crushing the frame of the awnings breaking the lockers filling the bridge with a mass of splinters sticks and broken wood captain whalley picked himself up and stood kneedeep in wreckage torn bleeding knowing the nature of the danger he had escaped mostly by the sound and holding mr massys coat in his arms  by this time sterne he had been flung out of his bunk had set the engines astern they worked for a few turns then a voice bawled out get out of the damned engineroom jackand they stopped but the ship had gone clear of the reef and lay still with a heavy cloud of steam issuing from the broken deckpipes and vanishing in wispy shapes into the night notwithstanding the suddenness of the disaster there was no shouting as if the very violence of the shock had halfstunned the shadowy lot of people swaying here and there about her decks the voice of the serang pronounced distinctly above the confused murmurs  eight fathom he had heaved the lead  mr sterne cried out next in a strained pitch  where the devil has she got to where are we  captain whalley replied in a calm bass  amongst the reefs to the eastward  you know it sir then she will never get out again  she will be sunk in five minutes boats sterne even one will save you all in this calm  the chinaman stokers went in a disorderly rush for the port boats nobody tried to check them the malays after a moment of confusion became quiet and mr sterne showed a good countenance captain whalley had not moved his thoughts were darker than this night in which he had lost his first ship  he made me lose a ship  another tall figure standing before him amongst the litter of the smash on the bridge whispered insanely  say nothing of it  massy stumbled closer captain whalley heard the chattering of his teeth  i have the coat  throw it down and come along urged the chattering voice bbbbboat  you will get fifteen years for this  mr massy had lost his voice his speech was a mere dry rustling in his throat  have mercy  had you any when you made me lose my ship mr massy you shall get fifteen years for this  i wanted money money my own money i will give you some money take half of it you love money yourself  theres a justice     massy made an awful effort and in a strange half choked utterance  you blind devil its you that drove me to it  captain whalley hugging the coat to his breast made no sound the light had ebbed for ever from the worldlet everything go but this man should not escape scotfree  sternes voice commanded  lower away  the blocks rattled  now then he cried over with you this way you jack here mr massy mr massy captain quick sir lets get  i shall go to prison for trying to cheat the insurance but youll get exposed you honest man who has been cheating me you are poor arent you youve nothing but the five hundred pounds well you have nothing at all now the ships lost and the insurance wont be paid  captain whalley did not move true ivys money gone in this wreck again he had a flash of insight he was indeed at the end of his tether  urgent voices cried out together alongside massy did not seem able to tear himself away from the bridge he chattered and hissed despairingly  give it up to me give it up  no said captain whalley i could not give it up you had better go dont wait man if you want to live shes settling down by the head fast no i shall keep it but i shall stay on board  massy did not seem to understand but the love of life awakened suddenly drove him away from the bridge  captain whalley laid the coat down and stumbled amongst the heaps of wreckage to the side  is mr massy in with you he called out into the night  sterne from the boat shouted  yes weve got him come along sir its madness to stay longer  captain whalley felt along the rail carefully and without a word cast off the painter they were expecting him still down there they were waiting till a voice suddenly exclaimed  we are adrift shove off  captain whalley leap    pull up a little    leap you can swim  in that old heart in that vigorous body there was that nothing should be wanting a horror of death that apparently could not be overcome by the horror of blindness but after all for ivy he had carried his point walking in his darkness to the very verge of a crime god had not listened to his prayers the light had finished ebbing out of the world not a glimmer it was a dark waste but it was unseemly that a whalley who had gone so far to carry a point should continue to live he must pay the price  leap as far as you can sir we will pick you up  they did not hear him answer but their shouting seemed to remind him of something he groped his way back and sought for mr massys coat he could swim indeed people sucked down by the whirlpool of a sinking ship do come up sometimes to the surface and it was unseemly that a whalley who had made up his mind to die should be beguiled by chance into a struggle he would put all these pieces of iron into his own pockets  they looking from the boat saw the sofala a black mass upon a black sea lying still at an appalling cant no sound came from her then with a great bizarre shuffling noise as if the boilers had broken through the bulkheads and with a faint muffled detonation where the ship had been there appeared for a moment something standing upright and narrow like a rock out of the sea then that too disappeared   when the sofala failed to come back to batu beru at the proper time mr van wyk understood at once that he would never see her any more but he did not know what had happened till some months afterwards when in a native craft lent him by his sultan he had made his way to the sofalas port of registry where already her existence and the official inquiry into her loss was beginning to be forgotten  it had not been a very remarkable or interesting case except for the fact that the captain had gone down with his sinking ship it was the only life lost and mr van wyk would not have been able to learn any details had it not been for sterne whom he met one day on the quay near the bridge over the creek almost on the very spot where captain whalley to preserve his daughters five hundred pounds intact had turned to get a sampan which would take him on board the sofala  from afar mr van wyk saw sterne blink straight at him and raise his hand to his hat they drew into the shade of a building it was a bank and the mate related how the boat with the crew got into pangu bay about six hours after the accident and how they had lived for a fortnight in a state of destitution before they found an opportunity to get away from that beastly place the inquiry had exonerated everybody from all blame the loss of the ship was put down to an unusual set of the current indeed it could not have been anything else there was no other way to account for the ship being set seven miles to the eastward of her position during the middle watch  a piece of bad luck for me sir  sterne passed his tongue on his lips and glanced aside i lost the advantage of being employed by you sir i can never be sorry enough but here it is one mans poison another mans meat this could not have been handier for mr massy if he had arranged that shipwreck himself the most timely total loss ive ever heard of  what became of that massy asked mr van wyk  he sir ha ha he would keep on telling me that he meant to buy another ship but as soon as he had the money in his pocket he cleared out for manilla by mailboat early in the morning i gave him chase right aboard and he told me then he was going to make his fortune dead sure in manilla i could go to the devil for all he cared and yet he as good as promised to give me the command if i didnt talk too much  you never said anything    mr van wyk began  not i sir why should i i mean to get on but the dead arent in my way said sterne his eyelids were beating rapidly then drooped for an instant besides sir it would have been an awkward business you made me hold my tongue just a bit too long  do you know how it was that captain whalley remained on board did he really refuse to leave come now or was it perhaps an accidental     nothing sterne interrupted with energy i tell you i yelled for him to leap overboard he simply must have cast off the painter of the boat himself we all yelled to himthat is jack and i he wouldnt even answer us the ship was as silent as a grave to the last then the boilers fetched away and down she went accident not it the game was up sir i tell you  this was all that sterne had to say  mr van wyk had been of course made the guest of the club for a fortnight and it was there that he met the lawyer in whose office had been signed the agreement between massy and captain whalley  extraordinary old man he said he came into my office from nowhere in particular as you may say with his five hundred pounds to place and that engineer fellow following him anxiously and now he is gone out a little inexplicably just as he came i could never understand him quite there was no mystery at all about that massy eh i wonder whether whalley refused to leave the ship it would have been foolish he was blameless as the court found  mr van wyk had known him well he said and he could not believe in suicide such an act would not have been in character with what he knew of the man  it is my opinion too the lawyer agreed the general theory was that the captain had remained too long on board trying to save something of importance perhaps the chart which would clear him or else something of value in his cabin the painter of the boat had come adrift of itself it was supposed however strange to say some little time before that voyage poor whalley had called in his office and had left with him a sealed envelope addressed to his daughter to be forwarded to her in case of his death still it was nothing very unusual especially in a man of his age mr van wyk shook his head captain whalley looked good for a hundred years  perfectly true assented the lawyer the old fellow looked as though he had come into the world fullgrown and with that long beard i could never somehow imagine him either younger or olderdont you know there was a sense of physical power about that man too and perhaps that was the secret of that something peculiar in his person which struck everybody who came in contact with him he looked indestructible by any ordinary means that put an end to the rest of us his deliberate stately courtesy of manner was full of significance it was as though he were certain of having plenty of time for everything yes there was something indestructible about him and the way he talked sometimes you might have thought he believed it himself when he called on me last with that letter he wanted me to take charge of he was not depressed at all perhaps a shade more deliberate in his talk and manner not depressed in the least had he a presentiment i wonder perhaps still it seems a miserable end for such a striking figure  oh yes it was a miserable end mr van wyk said with so much fervor that the lawyer looked up at him curiously and afterwards after parting with him he remarked to an acquaintance  queer person that dutch tobaccoplanter from batu beru know anything of him  heaps of money answered the bank manager i hear hes going home by the next mail to form a company to take over his estates another tobacco district thrown open hes wise i think these good times wont last for ever  in the southern hemisphere captain whalleys daughter had no presentiment of evil when she opened the envelope addressed to her in the lawyers handwriting she had received it in the afternoon all the boarders had gone out her boys were at school her husband sat upstairs in his big armchair with a book thinfaced wrapped up in rugs to the waist the house was still and the grayness of a cloudy day lay against the panes of three lofty windows  in a shabby diningroom where a faint cold smell of dishes lingered all the year round sitting at the end of a long table surrounded by many chairs pushed in with their backs close against the edge of the perpetually laid tablecloth she read the opening sentence most profound regretpainful dutyyour father is no morein accordance with his instructionsfatal casualtyconsolationno blame attached to his memory     her face was thin her temples a little sunk under the smooth bands of black hair her lips remained resolutely compressed while her dark eyes grew larger till at last with a low cry she stood up and instantly stooped to pick up another envelope which had slipped off her knees on to the floor  she tore it open snatched out the inclosure     my dearest child it said i am writing this while i am able yet to write legibly i am trying hard to save for you all the money that is left i have only kept it to serve you better it is yours it shall not be lost it shall not be touched theres five hundred pounds of what i have earned i have kept nothing back till now for the future if i live i must keep back somea littleto bring me to you i must come to you i must see you once more  it is hard to believe that you will ever look on these lines god seems to have forgotten me i want to see youand yet death would be a greater favor if you ever read these words i charge you to begin by thanking a god merciful at last for i shall be dead then and it will be well my dear i am at the end of my tether  the next paragraph began with the words my sight is going     she read no more that day the hand holding up the paper to her eyes fell slowly and her slender figure in a plain black dress walked rigidly to the window her eyes were dry no cry of sorrow or whisper of thanks went up to heaven from her lips life had been too hard for all the efforts of his love it had silenced her emotions but for the first time in all these years its sting had departed the carking care of poverty the meanness of a hard struggle for bread even the image of her husband and of her children seemed to glide away from her into the gray twilight it was her fathers face alone that she saw as though he had come to see her always quiet and big as she had seen him last but with something more august and tender in his aspect  she slipped his folded letter between the two buttons of her plain black bodice and leaning her forehead against a windowpane remained there till dusk perfectly motionless giving him all the time she could spare gone was it possible my god was it possible the blow had come softened by the spaces of the earth by the years of absence there had been whole days when she had not thought of him at allhad no time but she had loved him she felt she had loved him after all
