19902663	the  trueborn englishman  a  satire   statuimus pacem et securitatem et concordiam judicum et justiciam inter anglos et normannos francos et britanes walliæ et cornubiæ pictos et scotos albaniæ similiter inter francos et insulanos provincias et patrias quæ pertinent ad coronam nostram et inter omnes nobis subjectos firmiter et inviolabiliter observare  charta regis gullielmi conquisitoris de pacis publica cap i     contents   an explanatory preface  preface  the introduction  the trueborn englishman  part i  part ii  britannia  his fine speech c  the conclusion     an  explanatory preface   it is not that i see any reason to alter my opinion in any thing i have writ which occasions this epistle but i find it necessary for the satisfaction of some persons of honour as well as wit to pass a short explication upon it and tell the world what i mean or rather what i do not mean in some things wherein i find i am liable to be misunderstood  i confess myself something surprisd to hear that i am taxed with bewraying my own nest and abusing our nation by discovering the meanness of our original in order to make the english contemptible abroad and at home in which i think they are mistaken for why should not our neighbours be as good as we to derive from and i must add that had we been an unmixd nation i am of opinion it had been to our disadvantage for to go no farther we have three nations about us as clear from mixtures of blood as any in the world and i know not which of them i could wish ourselves to be like i mean the scots the welsh and the irish and if i were to write a reverse to the satire i would examine all the nations of europe and prove that those nations which are most mixd are the best and have least of barbarism and brutality among them and abundance of reasons might be given for it too long to bring into a preface  but i give this hint to let the world know that i am far from thinking tis a satire upon the english nation to tell them they are derived from all the nations under heaven that is from several nations nor is it meant to undervalue the original of the english for we see no reason to like them worse being the relicts of romans danes saxons and normans than we should have done if they had remaind britons that is than if they had been all welshmen  but the intent of the satire is pointed at the vanity of those who talk of their antiquity and value themselves upon their pedigree their ancient families and being trueborn whereas tis impossible we should be trueborn and if we could should have lost by the bargain  these sort of people who call themselves trueborn and tell long stories of their families and like a nobleman of venice think a foreigner ought not to walk on the same side of the street with them are ownd to be meant in this satire what they would infer from their long original i know not nor is it easy to make out whether they are the better or the worse for their ancestors our english nation may value themselves for their wit wealth and courage and i believe few nations will dispute it with them but for long originals and ancient trueborn families of english i would advise them to wave the discourse a true englishman is one that deserves a character and i have nowhere lessened him that i know of but as for a trueborn englishman i confess i do not understand him  from hence i only infer that an englishman of all men ought not to despise foreigners as such and i think the inference is just since what they are today we were yesterday and tomorrow they will be like us if foreigners misbehave in their several stations and employments i have nothing to do with that the laws are open to punish them equally with natives and let them have no favour  but when i see the town full of lampoons and invectives against dutchmen only because they are foreigners and the king reproached and insulted by insolent pedants and balladmaking poets for employing foreigners and for being a foreigner himself i confess myself moved by it to remind our nation of their own original thereby to let them see what a banter is put upon ourselves in it since speaking of englishmen ab origine we are really all foreigners ourselves  i could go on to prove it is also impolitic in us to discourage foreigners since it is easy to make it appear that the multitudes of foreign nations who have taken sanctuary here have been the greatest additions to the wealth and strength of the nation the essential whereof is the number of its inhabitants nor would this nation ever have arrived to the degree of wealth and glory it now boasts of if the addition of foreign nations both as to manufactures and arms had not been helpful to it this is so plain that he who is ignorant of it is too dull to be talked with  the satire therefore i must allow to be just till i am otherwise convinced because nothing can be more ridiculous than to hear our people boast of that antiquity which if it had been true would have left us in so much worse a condition than we are in now whereas we ought rather to boast among our neighbours that we are part of themselves of the same original as they but bettered by our climate and like our language and manufactures derived from them and improved by us to a perfection greater than they can pretend to  this we might have valued ourselves upon without vanity but to disown our descent from them talk big of our ancient families and long originals and stand at a distance from foreigners like the enthusiast in religion with a stand off i am more holy than thou this is a thing so ridiculous in a nation derived from foreigners as we are that i could not but attack them as i have done  and whereas i am threatened to be called to a public account for this freedom and the publisher of this has been newspapered into gaol already for it tho i see nothing in it for which the government can be displeased yet if at the same time those people who with an unlimited arrogance in print every day affront the king prescribe the parliament and lampoon the government may be either punished or restrained i am content to stand and fall by the public justice of my native country which i am not sensible i have anywhere injured  nor would i be misunderstood concerning the clergy with whom if i have taken any license more than becomes a satire i question not but those gentlemen who are men of letters are also men of so much candor as to allow me a loose at the crimes of the guilty without thinking the whole profession lashed who are innocent i profess to have very mean thoughts of those gentlemen who have deserted their own principles and exposed even their morals as well as loyality but not at all to think it affects any but such as are concerned in the fact  nor would i be misrepresented as to the ingratitude of the english to the king and his friends as if i meant the english as a nation are so the contrary is so apparent that i would hope it should not be suggested of me and therefore when i have brought in britannia speaking of the king i suppose her to be the representative or mouth of the nation as a body but if i say we are full of such who daily affront the king and abuse his friends who print scurrilous pamphlets virulent lampoons and reproachful public banters against both the kings person and his government i say nothing but what is too true and that the satire is directed at such i freely own and cannot say but i should think it very hard to be censured for this satire while such remain unquestioned and tacitly approved that i can mean none but such is plain from these few lines page 453 transcribers note this reference is to a page number in the 1855 reprint edition       ye heavens regard almighty jove look down      and view thy injured monarch on the throne      on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take      who sought his aid and then his part forsake  if i have fallen rudely upon our vices i hope none but the vicious will be angry as for writing for interest i disown it i have neither place nor pension nor prospect nor seek none nor will have none if matter of fact justifies the truth of the crimes the satire is just as to the poetic liberties i hope the crime is pardonable i am content to be stoned provided none will attack me but the innocent  if my countrymen would take the hint and grow better natured from my illnatured poem as some call it i would say this of it that though it is far from the best satire that ever was wrote it would do the most good that ever satire did  and yet i am ready to ask pardon of some gentlemen too who though they are englishmen have good nature enough to see themselves reproved and can hear it these are gentlemen in a true sense that can bare to be told of their faux pas and not abuse the reprover to such i must say this is no satire they are exceptions to the general rule and i value my performance from their generous approbation more than i can from any opinion i have of its worth  the hasty errors of my verse i made my excuse for before and since the time i have been upon it has been but little and my leisure less i have all along strove rather to make the thoughts explicit than the poem correct however i have mended some faults in this edition and the rest must be placed to my account  as to answers banters true english billingsgate i expect them till nobody will buy and then the shop will be shut had i wrote it for the gain of the press i should have been concerned at its being printed again and again by pirates as they call them and paragraphmen but would they but do it justice and print it true according to the copy they are welcome to sell it for a penny if they please  the pence indeed is the end of their works i will engage if nobody will buy nobody will write and not a patriot poet of them all now will in defence of his native country which i have abused they say print an answer to it and give it about for gods sake     preface   the end of satire is reformation and the author though he doubt the work of conversion is at a general stop has put his hand in the plough i expect a storm of ill language from the fury of the town and especially from those whose english talent it is to rail and without being taken for a conjuror i may venture to foretel that i shall be cavilled at about my mean style rough verse and incorrect language things i indeed might have taken more care in but the book is printed and though i see some faults it is too late to mend them and this is all i think needful to say to them  possibly somebody may take me for a dutchman in which they are mistaken but i am one that would be glad to see englishmen behave themselves better to strangers and to governors also that one might not be reproached in foreign countries for belonging to a nation that wants manners  i assure you gentlemen strangers use us better abroad and we can give no reason but our illnature for the contrary here  methinks an englishman who is so proud of being called a good fellow should be civil and it cannot be denied but we are in many cases and particularly to strangers the most churlish people alive  as to vices who can dispute our intemperance while an honest drunken fellow is a character in a mans praise all our reformations are banters and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform themselves by way of example then and not till then they may be expected to punish others without blushing  as to our ingratitude i desire to be understood of that particular people who pretending to be protestants have all along endeavoured to reduce the liberties and religion of this nation into the hands of king james and his popish powers together with such who enjoy the peace and protection of the present government and yet abuse and affront the king who procured it and openly profess their uneasiness under him these by whatsoever names or titles they are dignified or distinguished are the people aimed at nor do i disown but that it is so much the temper of an englishman to abuse his benefactor that i could be glad to see it rectified  they who think i have been guilty of any error in exposing the crimes of my own countrymen to themselves may among many honest instances of the like nature find the same thing in mr cowley in his imitation of the second olympic ode of pindar his words are these       but in this thankless world the givers      are envied even by the receivers      tis now the cheap and frugal fashion      rather to hide than pay an obligation      nay tis much worse than so      it now an artifice doth grow      wrongs and outrages they do      lest men should think we owe     the introduction   speak satire for theres none can tell like thee whether tis folly pride or knavery that makes this discontented land appear less happy now in times of peace than war why civil feuds disturb the nation more than all our bloody wars have done before    fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place and men are always honest in disgrace the court preferments make men knaves in course but they which woud be in them woud be worse tis not at foreigners that we repine woud foreigners their perquisites resign the grand contentions plainly to be seen to get some men put out and some put in for this our senators make long harangues and florid ministers whet their polishd tongues statesmen are always sick of one disease and a good pension gives them present ease thats the specific makes them all content with any king and any government good patriots at court abuses rail and all the nations grievances bewail but when the sovreign balsams once applyd the zealot never fails to change his side and when he must the golden key resign the railing spirit comes about again    who shall this bubbld nation disabuse while they their own felicities refuse who at the wars have made such mighty pother and now are falling out with one another with needless fears the jealous nations fill and always have been savd against their will who fifty millions sterling have disbursd to be with peace and too much plenty cursd who their old monarch eagerly undo and yet uneasily obey the new search satire search a deep incision make the poisons strong the antidotes too weak tis pointed truth must manage this dispute and downright english englishmen confute    whet thy just anger at the nations pride and with keen phrase repel the vicious tide to englishmen their own beginnings show and ask them why they slight their neighbours so go back to elder times and ages past and nations into long oblivion cast to elder britains youthful days retire and there for trueborn englishmen inquire britannia freely will disown the name and hardly knows herself from whence they came wonders that they of all men should pretend to birth and blood and for a name contend go back to causes where our follies dwell and fetch the dark original from

be so oft subdued by sevral crowds of wandering thieves oerrun often unpeopled and as oft undone while evry nation that her powers reduced their languages and manners introduced from whose mixd relics our compounded breed by spurious generation does succeed making a race uncertain and uneven derived from all the nations under heaven    the romans first with julius cæsar came including all the nations of that name gauls greek and lombards and by computation auxiliaries or slaves of evry nation with hengist saxons danes with sweno came in search of plunder not in search of fame scots picts and irish from th hibernian shore and conqring william brought the normans oer    all these their barbrous offspring left behind the dregs of armies they of all mankind blended with britons who before were here of whom the welch ha blest the character    from this amphibious illborn mob began that vain illnatured thing an englishman the customs sirnames languages and manners of all these nations are their own explainers whose relics are so lasting and so strong theyve left a shiboleth upon our tongue by which with easy search you may distinguish your roman saxon danish norman english    the great invading norman let us know what conquerors in aftertimes might do to every musqueteer he brought to town he gave the lands which never were his own when first the english crown he did obtain he did not send his dutchmen home again no reassumptions in his reign were known davenant might there ha let his book alone no parliament his army could disband he raised no money for he paid in land he gave his legions their eternal station and made them all freeholders of the nation he cantond out the country to his men and every soldier was a denizen the rascals thus enrichd he called them lords to please their upstart pride with newmade words and doomsday book his tyranny records    and here begins the ancient pedigree that so exalts our poor nobility tis that from some french trooper they derive who with the norman bastard did arrive the trophies of the families appear some show the sword the bow and some the spear which their great ancestor forsooth did wear these in the heralds register remain their noble mean extraction to explain yet who the hero was no man can tell whether a drummer or a colonel the silent record blushes to reveal their undescended dark original    but grant the best how came the change to pass a trueborn englishman of norman race a turkish horse can show more history to prove his welldescended family conquest as by the moderns tis expressd may give a title to the lands possessd but that the longest sword should be so civil to make a frenchman english thats the devil    these are the heroes that despise the dutch and rail at newcome foreigners so much forgetting that themselves are all derived from the most scoundrel race that ever lived a horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones who ransackd kingdoms and dispeopled towns the pict and painted briton treachrous scot by hunger theft and rapine hither brought norwegian pirates buccaneering danes whose redhaird offspring everywhere remains who joind with norman french compound the breed from whence your trueborn englishmen proceed    and lest by length of time it be pretended the climate may this modern breed have mended wise providence to keep us where we are mixes us daily with exceeding care we have been europes sink the jakes where she voids all her offal outcast progeny from our fifth henrys time the strolling bands of banishd fugitives from neighbring lands have here a certain sanctuary found the eternal refuge of the vagabond where in but half a common age of time borrowing new blood and manners from the clime proudly they learn all mankind to contemn and all their race are trueborn englishmen    dutch walloons flemmings irishmen and scots vaudois and valtolins and hugonots in good queen besss charitable reign supplied us with three hundred thousand men religiongod we thank theesent them hither priests protestants the devil and all together of all professions and of evry trade all that were persecuted or afraid whether for debt or other crimes they fled david at hackelah was still their head    the offspring of this miscellaneous crowd had not their new plantations long enjoyd but they grew englishmen and raised their votes at foreign shoals of interloping scots the royal branch from pictland did succeed with troops of scots and scabs from north of tweed the seven first years of his pacific reign made him and half his nation englishmen scots from the northern frozen banks of tay with packs and plods came whigging all away thick as the locusts which in egypt swarmd with pride and hungry hopes completely armd with native truth diseases and no money plunderd our canaan of the milk and honey here they grew quickly lords and gentlemen and all their race are trueborn englishmen    the civil wars the common purgative which always use to make the nation thrive made way for all that strolling congregation which throngd in pious charless restoration the royal refugee our breed restores with foreign courtiers and with foreign whores and carefully repeopled us again throughout his lazy long lascivious reign with such a blest and trueborn english fry as much illustrates our nobility a gratitude which will so black appear as future ages must abhor to bear when they look back on all that crimson flood which streamd in lindseys and caernarvons blood bold strafford cambridge capel lucas lisle who crownd in death his fathers funral pile the loss of whom in order to supply with trueborn english nobility six bastard dukes survive his luscious reign the labours of italian castlemain french portsmouth tabby scott and cambrian besides the numrous bright and virgin throng whose female glories shade them from my song this offspring if our age they multiply may half the house with english peers supply there with true english pride they may contemn schomberg and portland newmade noblemen    french cooks scotch pedlars and italian whores were all made lords or lords progenitors beggars and bastards by this new creation much multiplied the peerage of the nation who will be all ere one short age runs oer as trueborn lords as those we had before    then to recruit the commons he prepares and heal the latent breaches of the wars the pious purpose better to advance he invites the banishd protestants of france hither for gods sake and their own they fled some for religion came and some for bread two hundred thousand pair of wooden shoes who god be thankd had nothing left to lose to heavens great praise did for religion fly to make us starve our poor in charity in evry port they plant their fruitful train to get a race of trueborn englishmen whose children will when riper years they see be as illnatured and as proud as we call themselves english foreigners despise be surly like us all and just as wise    thus from a mixture of all kinds began that heterogeneous thing an englishman in eager rapes and furious lust begot betwixt a painted briton and a scot whose gendring offspring quickly learnd to bow and yoke their heifers to the roman plough from whence a mongrel halfbred race there came with neither name nor nation speech or fame in whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran infused betwixt a saxon and a dane while their rank daughters to their parents just received all nations with promiscuous lust this nauseous brood directly did contain the wellextracted blood of englishmen    which medley cantond in a heptarchy a rhapsody of nations to supply among themselves maintaind eternal wars and still the ladies loved the conquerors    the western angles all the rest subdued a bloody nation barbarous and rude who by the tenure of the sword possessd one part of britain and subdued the rest and as great things denominate the small the conquering part gave title to the whole the scot pict briton roman dane submit and with the english saxon all unite and these the mixture have so close pursued the very name and memorys subdued no roman now no briton does remain wales strove to separate but strove in vain the silent nations undistinguishd fall and englishmans the common name for all fate jumbled them together god knows how whateer they were theyre trueborn english now    the wonder which remains is at our pride to value that which all wise men deride for englishmen to boast of generation cancels their knowledge and lampoons the nation a trueborn englishmans a contradiction in speech an irony in fact a fiction a banter made to be a test of fools which those that use it justly ridicules a metaphor intended to express a man akin to all the universe    for as the scots as learned men have said throughout the world their wandring seed have spread so openhanded england tis believed has all the gleanings of the world received    some think of england twas our saviour meant the gospel should to all the world be sent since when the blessed sound did hither reach they to all nations might be said to preach    tis well that virtue gives nobility else god knows where had we our gentry since scarce one family is left alive which does not from some foreigner derive of sixty thousand english gentlemen whose names and arms in registers remain we challenge all our heralds to declare ten families which english saxons are    france justly boasts the ancient noble line of bourbon montmorency and lorraine the germans too their house of austria show and holland their invincible nassau lines which in heraldry were ancient grown before the name of englishman was known even scotland too her elder glory shows her gordons hamiltons and her monros douglas mackays and grahams names well known long before ancient england knew her own    but england modern to the last degree borrows or makes her own nobility and yet she boldly boasts of pedigree repines that foreigners are put upon her and talks of her antiquity and honour her sackvills savils cecils delamers mohuns montagues duras and veeres not one have english names yet all are english peers your houblons papillons and lethuliers pass now for trueborn english knights and squires and make good senatemembers or lordmayors wealth howsoever got in england makes lords of mechanics gentlemen of rakes antiquity and birth are needless here tis impudence and money makes a peer    innumerable city knights we know from bluecoat hospitals and bridewell flow draymen and porters fill the city chair and footboys magisterial purple wear fate has but very small distinction set betwixt the counter and the coronet tarpaulin lords pages of high renown rise up by poor mens valour not their own great families of yesterday we show and lords whose parents were the lord knows who   part ii  the breeds described now satire if you can their temper show for manners make the man fierce as the briton as the roman brave and less inclined to conquer than to save eager to fight and lavish of their blood and equally of fear and forecast void the pict has made them sour the dane morose false from the scot and from the norman worse what honesty they have the saxon gave them and that now they grow old begins to leave them the climate makes them terrible and bold and english beef their courage does uphold no danger can their daring spirit dull always provided when their bellys full    in close intrigues their facultys but weak for genrally whateer they know they speak and often their own councils undermine by their infirmity and not design from whence the learned say it does proceed that english treason never can succeed for theyre so openhearted you may know their own most secret thoughts and others too    the labring poor in spite of double pay are saucy mutinous and beggarly so lavish of their money and their time that want of forecast is the nations crime good drunken company is their delight and what they get by day they spend by night dull thinking seldom does their heads engage but drink their youth away and hurry on old age empty of all good husbandry and sense and void of manners most when void of pence their strong aversion to behaviours such they always talk too little or too much so dull they never take the pains to think and seldom are good natured but in drink    in english ale their dear enjoyment lies for which they starve themselves and families an englishman will fairly drink as much as will maintain two families of dutch subjecting all their labours to the pots the greatest artists are the greatest sots the country poor do by example live the gentry lead them and the clergy drive what may we not from such examples hope the landlord is their god the priest their pope a drunken clergy and a swearing bench has given the reformation such a drench as wise men think there is some cause to doubt will purge good manners and religion out    nor do the poor alone their liquor prize the sages join in this great sacrifice the learned men who study aristotle correct him with an explanation bottle praise epicurus rather than lysander and aristippus more than alexander the doctors too their galen here resign and generally prescribe specific wine the graduates studys grown an easy task while for the urinal they toss the flask the surgeons art grows plainer every hour and wines the balm which into wounds they pour    poets long since parnassus have forsaken and say the ancient bards were all mistaken apollos lately abdicate and fled and good king bacchus reigneth in his stead he does the chaos of the head refine and atom thoughts jump into words by wine the inspirations of a finer nature as wine must needs excel parnassus water    statesmen their weighty politics refine and soldiers raise their courages by wine cecilia gives her choristers their choice and lets them all drink wine to clear the voice    some think the clergy first found out the way and wines the only spirit by which they pray but others less profane than so agree it clears the lungs and helps the memory and therefore all of them divinely think instead of study tis as well to drink    and here i would be very glad to know whether our asgilites may drink or no the enlightening fumes of wine would certainly assist them much when they begin to fly or if a fiery chariot should appear inflamed by wine theyd have the less to fear    even the gods themselves as mortals say were they on earth would be as drunk as they nectar would be no more celestial drink theyd all take wine to teach them how to think but english drunkards gods and men outdo drink their estates away and senses too colons in debt and if his friend should fail to help him out must die at last in jail his wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles to pay his trifles off and rid him of his troubles but colon like a trueborn englishman drunk all the money out in bright champaign and colon does in custody remain drunkness has been the darling of the realm eer since a drunken pilot had the helm    in their religion theyre so uneven that each man goes his own byway to heaven tenacious of mistakes to that degree that evry man pursues it seprately and fancies none can find the way but he so shy of one another they are grown as if they strove to get to heaven alone rigid and zealous positive and grave and evry grace but charity they have this makes them so illnatured and uncivil that all men think an englishman the devil    surly to strangers froward to their friend submit to love with a reluctant mind resolved to be ungrateful and unkind if by necessity reduced to ask the giver has the difficultest task for whats bestowd they awkwardly receive and always take less freely than they give the obligation is their highest grief they never love where they accept relief so sullen in their sorrows that tis known theyll rather die than their afflictions own and if relieved it is too often true that theyll abuse their benefactors too for in distress their haughty stomachs such they hate to see themselves obliged too much seldom contented often in the wrong hard to be pleased at all and never long    if your mistakes there ill opinion gain no merit can their favour reobtain and if theyre not vindictive in their fury tis their inconstant temper does secure ye their brains so cool their passion seldom burns for alls condensed before the flame returns the fermentations of so weak a matter the humid damps the flame and runs it all to water so though the inclination may be strong theyre pleased by fits and never angry long    then if goodnature show some slender proof they never think they have reward enough but like our modern quakers of the town expect your manners and return you none    friendship th abstracted union of the mind which all men seek but very few can find of all the nations in the universe none can talk ont more or understand it less for if it does their property annoy their property their friendship will destroy as you discourse them you shall hear them tell all things in which they think they do excel no panegyric needs their praise record an englishman neer wants his own good word his first discourses genrally appear prologued with his own wondrous character when to illustrate his own good name he never fails his neighbour to defame and yet he really designs no wrong his malice goes no further than his tongue but pleased to tattle he delights to rail to satisfy the letchry of a tale his own dear praises close the ample speech tells you how wise he is that is how rich for wealth is wisdom he thats rich is wise and all men learned poverty despise his generosity comes next and then concludes that hes a trueborn englishman and they tis known are generous and free forgetting and forgiving injury which may be true thus rightly understood forgiving ill turns and forgetting good    cheerful in labour when theyve undertook it but out of humour when theyre out of pocket but if their belly and their pockets full they may be phlegmatic but never dull and if a bottle does their brains refine it makes their wit as sparkling as their wine    as for the general vices which we find theyre guilty of in common with mankind satire forbear and silently endure we must conceal the crimes we cannot cure nor shall my verse the brighter sex defame for english beauty will preserve her name beyond dispute agreeable and fair and modester than other nations are for where the vice prevails the great temptation is want of money more than inclination in general this only is allowd theyre something noisy and a little proud    an englishman is gentlest in command obedience is a stranger in the land hardly subjected to the magistrate for englishmen do all subjection hate humblest when rich but peevish when theyre poor and think whateer they have they merit more    the meanest english plowman studies law and keeps thereby the magistrates in awe will boldly tell them what they ought to do and sometimes punish their omissions too    their liberty and propertys so dear they scorn their laws or governors to fear so bugbeard with the name of slavery they cant submit to their own liberty restraint from ill is freedom to the wise but englishmen do all restraint despise slaves to the liquor drudges to the pots the mob are statesmen and their statesmen sots    their governors they count such dangrous things that tis their custom to affront their kings so jealous of the power their kings possessd they suffer neither power nor kings to rest the bad with force they eagerly subdue the good with constant clamours they pursue and did king jesus reign theyd murmur too a discontented nation and by far harder to rule in times of peace than war easily set together by the ears and full of causeless jealousies and fears apt to revolt and willing to rebel and never are contented when theyre well no government could ever please them long could tie their hands or rectify their tongue in this to ancient israel well compared eternal murmurs are among them heard    it was but lately that they were oppressd their rights invaded and their laws suppressd when nicely tender of their liberty lord what a noise they made of slavery in daily tumults showd their discontent lampoond their king and mockd his government and if in arms they did not first appear twas want of force and not for want of fear in humbler tone than english used to do at foreign hands for foreign aid they sue    william the great successor of nassau their prayers heard and their oppressions saw he saw and saved them god and him they praised to this their thanks to that their trophies raised but glutted with their own felicities they soon their new deliverer despise say all their prayers back their joy disown unsing their thanks and pull their trophies down their harps of praise are on the willows hung for englishmen are neer contented long    the reverend clergy too and whod ha thought that they who had such nonresistance taught should eer to arms against their prince be brought who up to heavn did regal power advance subjecting english laws to modes of france twisting religion so with loyalty as one could never live and tother die and yet no sooner did their prince design their glebes and perquisites to undermine but all their passive doctrines laid aside the clergy their own principles denied unpreachd their nonresisting cant and prayd to heavn for help and to the dutch for aid the church chimed all her doctrines back again and pulpitchampions did the cause maintain flew in the face of all their former zeal and nonresistance did at once repeal    the rabbis say it would be too prolix to tie religion up to politics the churches safety is suprema lex and so by a new figure of their own their former doctrines all at once disown as laws post facto in the parliament in urgent cases have attained assent but are as dangerous precedents laid by made lawful only by necessity    the revrend fathers then in arms appear and men of god became the men of war the nation fired by them to arms apply assault their antichristian monarchy to their due channel all our laws restore and made things what they should have been before but when they came to fill the vacant throne and the pale priests lookd back on what theyd done how england liberty began to thrive and church of england loyality outlive how all their persecuting days were done and their delivrer placed upon the throne the priests as priests are wont to do turnd tail theyre englishmen and nature will prevail now they deplore their ruins they have made and murmur for the master they betrayd excuse those crimes they could not make him mend and suffer for the cause they cant defend pretend theyd not have carried things so high and protomartyrs make for popery    had the prince done as they designd the thing high set the clergy up to rule the king taken a donative for coming hither and so have left their king and them together we had say they been now a happy nation no doubt we had seen a blessed reformation for wise men say tis as dangerous a thing a ruling priesthood as a priestrid king and of all plagues with which mankind are curst ecclesiastic tyrannys the worst    if all our former grievances were feignd king james has been abused and we trepannd bugbeard with popery and power despotic tyrannic government and leagues exotic the revolutions a fanatic plot williams a tyrant king james was not a factious army and a poisond nation unjustly forced king jamess abdication    but if he did the subjects rights invade then he was punishd only not betrayed and punishing of kings is no such crime but englishmen have done it many a time    when kings the sword of justice first lay down they are no kings though they possess the crown titles are shadows crowns are empty things the good of subjects is the end of kings to guide in war and to protect in peace where tyrants once commence the kings do cease for arbitrary powers so strange a thing it makes the tyrant and unmakes the king if kings by foreign priests and armies reign and lawless power against their oaths maintain then subjects must have reason to complain if oaths must bind us when our kings do ill to call in foreign aid is to rebel by force to circumscribe our lawful prince is wilful treason in the largest sense and they who once rebel must certainly their god and king and former oaths defy if ye allow no maladministration could cancel the allegiance of the nation let all our learned sons of levi try this ecclesiastic riddle to untie how they could make a step to call the prince and yet pretend the oath and innocence    by th first address they made beyond the seas theyre perjurd in the most intense degrees and without scruple for the time to come may swear to all the kings in christendom nay truly did our kings consider all theyd never let the clergy swear at all their politic allegiance theyd refuse for whores and priests do never want excuse    but if the mutual contract was dissolved the doubts explaind the difficulty solved that kings when they descend to tyranny dissolve the bond and leave the subject free the governments ungirt when justice dies and constitutions are nonentities the nations all a mob theres no such thing as lords or commons parliament or king a great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies till laws revive and mutual contract ties a chaos free to choose for their own share what case of government they please to wear if to a king they do the reins commit all men are bound in conscience to submit but then the king must by his oath assent to postulatas of the government which if he breaks he cuts off the entail and power retreats to its original    this doctrine has the sanction of assent from natures universal parliament the voice of nations and the course of things allow that laws superior are to kings none but delinquents would have justice cease knaves rail at laws as soldiers rail at peace for justice is the end of government as reason is the test of argument no man was ever yet so void of sense as to debate the right of selfdefence a principle so grafted in the mind with nature born and does like nature bind twisted with reason and with nature too as neither one nor tother can undo    nor can this right be less when national reason which governs one should govern all whateer the dialect of courts may tell he that his right demands can neer rebel which right if tis by governors denied may be procured by force or foreign aid for tyrannys a nations term of grief as folks cry fire to hasten in relief and when the hated word is heard about all men should come to help the people out    thus england groand britannias voice was heard and great nassau to rescue her appeard calld by the universal voice of fate god and the peoples legal magistrate ye heavens regard almighty jove look down and view thy injured monarch on the throne on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take who sought his aid and then his part forsake witness ye powers it was our call alone which now our pride makes us ashamed to own britannias troubles fetchd him from afar to court the dreadful casualties of war but where requital never can be made acknowledgments a tribute seldom paid    he dwelt in bright marias circling arms defended by the magic of her charms from foreign fears and from domestic harms ambition found no fuel for her fire he had what god could give or man desire till pity roused him from his soft repose his life to unseen hazards to expose till pity moved him in our cause to appear pity that word which now we hate to hear but english gratitude is always such to hate the hand that does oblige too much    britannias cries gave birth to his intent and hardly gaind his unforeseen assent his boding thoughts foretold him he should find the people fickle selfish and unkind which thought did to his royal heart appear more dreadful than the dangers of the war for nothing grates a generous mind so soon as base returns for hearty service done    satire be silent awfully prepare britannias song and williams praise to hear stand by and let her cheerfully rehearse her grateful vows in her immortal verse loud fames eternal trumpet let her sound listen ye distant poles and endless round may the strong blast the welcome news convey as far as sound can reach or spirit fly to neighbring worlds if such there be relate our heroes fame for theirs to imitate to distant worlds of spirits let her rehearse for spirits without the helps of voice converse may angels hear the gladsome news on high mixd with their everlasting symphony and hell itself stand in surprise to know whether it be the fatal blast or no   britannia    the fame of virtue tis for which i sound and heroes with immortal triumphs crownd fame built on solid virtue swifter flies than morning light can spread the eastern skies the gathring air returns the doubling sound and loud repeating thunders force it round echoes return from caverns of the deep old chaos dreams ont in eternal sleep time hands it forward to its latest urn from whence it never never shall return nothing is heard so far or lasts so long tis heard by evry ear and spoke by every tongue    my hero with the sails of honour furld rises like the great genius of the world by fate and fame wisely prepared to be the soul of war and life of victory he spreads the wings of virtue on the throne and evry wind of glory fans them on immortal trophies dwell upon his brow fresh as the garlands he has won but now    by different steps the high ascent he gains and differently that high ascent maintains princes for pride and lust of rule make war and struggle for the name of conqueror some fight for fame and some for victory he fights to save and conquers to set free    then seek no phrase his titles to conceal and hide with words what actions must reveal no parallel from hebrew stories take of godlike kings my similies to make no borrowed names conceal my living theme but names and things directly i proclaim his honest merit does his glory raise whom that exalts let no man fear to praise of such a subject no man need be shy virtues above the reach of flattery he needs no character but his own fame nor any flattering titles but his own name    williams the name thats spoke by every tongue williams the darling subject of my song listen ye virgins to the charming sound and in eternal dances hand it round your early offerings to this altar bring make him at once a lover and a king may he submit to none but to your arms nor ever be subdued but by your charms may your soft thoughts for him be all sublime and evry tender vow be made for him may he be first in evry morning thought and heavn neer hear a prayer where hes left out may every omen every boding dream be fortunate by mentioning his name may this one charm infernal powers affright and guard you from the terror of the night may evry cheerful glass as it goes down to williams health be cordials to your own let evry song be chorust with his name and music pay her tribute to his fame let evry poet tune his artful verse and in immortal strains his deeds rehearse and may apollo never more inspire the disobedient bard with his seraphic fire may all my sons their grateful homage pay his praises sing and for his safety pray    satire return to our unthankful isle secured by heavens regards and williams toil to both ungrateful and to both untrue rebels to god and to good nature too    if eer this nation be distressd again to whomsoeer they cry theyll cry in vain to heavn they cannot have the face to look or if they should it would but heavn provoke to hope for help from man would be too much mankind would always tell em of the dutch how they came here our freedoms to maintain were paid and cursed and hurried home again how by their aid we first dissolved our fears and then our helpers damnd for foreigners tis not our english temper to do better for englishmen think evry one their debtor    tis worth observing that we neer complaind of foreigners nor of the wealth we gaind till all their services were at an end wise men affirm it is the english way never to grumble till they come to pay and then they always think their tempers such the work too little and the pay too much    as frighted patients when they want a cure bid any price and any pain endure but when the doctors remedies appear the cures too easy and the price too dear great portland near was banterd when he strove for us his masters kindest thoughts to move we neer lampoond his conduct when employd king jamess secret councils to divide then we caressd him as the only man who could the doubtful oracle explain the only hushai able to repel the dark designs of our achitophel compared his masters courage to his sense the ablest statesman and the bravest prince on his wise conduct we depended much and liked him neer the worse for being dutch nor was he valued more than he deserved freely he ventured faithfully he served in all king williams dangers he has shared in englands quarrels always he appeard the revolution first and then the boyne in both his counsels and his conduct shine his martial valour flanders will confess and france regrets his managing the peace faithful to englands interest and her king the greatest reason of our murmuring ten years in english service he appeard and gaind his masters and the worlds regard but tis not englands custom to reward the wars are over england needs him not now hes a dutchman and the lord knows what    schonbergh the ablest soldier of his age with great nassau did in our cause engage both joind for englands rescue and defence the greatest captain and the greatest prince with what applause his stories did we tell stories which europes volumes largely swell we counted him an army in our aid where he commanded no man was afraid his actions with a constant conquest shine from villa vitiosa to the rhine france flanders germany his fame confess and all the world was fond of him but us our turn first served we grudged him the command witness the grateful temper of the land     we blame the king that he relies too much on strangers germans hugonots and dutch and seldom does his great affairs of state to english counsellors communicate the fact might very well be answerd thus he had so often been betrayd by us he must have been a madman to rely on english gentlemens fidelity for laying other argument aside this thought might mortify our english pride that foreigners have faithfully obeyd him and none but englishmen have eer betrayd him they have our ships and merchants bought and sold and barterd english blood for foreign gold first to the french they sold our turkey fleet and injured talmarsh next at cameret the king himself is shelterd from their snares not by his merits but the crown he wears experience tells us tis the english way their benefactors always to betray     and lest examples should be too remote a modern magistrate of famous note shall give you his own history by rote ill make it out deny it he that can his worship is a trueborn englishman by all the latitude that empty word by modern acceptations understood the parish books his great descent record and now he hopes ere long to be a lord and truly as things go it would be pity but such as he bore office in the city while robbry for burntoffering he brings and gives to god what he has stole from kings great monuments of charity he raises and good st magnus whistles out his praises to city jails he grants a jubilee and hires huzzas from his own mobile    lately he wore the golden chain and gown with which equippd he thus harangued the town   his fine speech c    with clouted iron shoes and sheepskin breeches more rags than manners and more dirt than riches from driving cows and calves to leyton market while of my greatness there appeard no spark yet behold i come to let you see the pride with which exalted beggars always ride     born to the needful labours of the plough the cartwhip graced me as the chain does now nature and fate in doubt what course to take whether i should a lord or ploughboy make kindly at last resolvd they would promote me and first a knave and then a knight they vote me what fate appointed nature did prepare and furnishd me with an exceeding care to fit me for what they designd to have me and every gift but honesty they gave me    and thus equippd to this proud town i came in quest of bread and not in quest of fame blind to my future fate an humble boy free from the guilt and glory i enjoy the hopes which my ambition entertaind where in the name of footboy all containd the greatest heights from small beginnings rise the gods were great on earth before they reachd the skies    backwell the generous temper of whose mind was always to be bountiful inclind whether by his ill fate or fancy led first took me up and furnishd me with bread the little services he put me to seemd labours rather than were truly so but always my advancement he designd for twas his very nature to be kind large was his soul his temper ever free the best of masters and of men to me and i who was before decreed by fate to be made infamous as well as great with an obsequious diligence obeyd him till trusted with his all and then betrayd him    all his past kindnesses i trampled on ruind his fortunes to erect my own so vipers in the bosom bred begin to hiss at that hand first which took them in with eager treachry i his fall pursud and my first trophies were ingratitude    ingratitudes the worst of human guilt the basest action mankind can commit which like the sin against the holy ghost has least of honour and of guilt the most distinguished from all other crimes by this that tis a crime which no man will confess that sin alone which should not be forgivn on earth altho perhaps it may in heaven    thus my first benefactor i oerthrew and how shoud i be to a second true the public trust came next into my care and i to use them scurvily prepare my needy sovreign lord i playd upon and lent him many a thousand of his own for which great interest i took care to charge and so my illgot wealth became so large    my predecessor judas was a fool fitter to have been whipt and sent to school than sell a saviour had i been at hand his master had not been so cheap trepannd i would have made the eager jews have found for thirty pieces thirty thousand pound    my cousin ziba of immortal fame ziba and i shall never want a name firstborn of treason nobly did advance his masters fall for his inheritance by whose keen arts old david first began to break his sacred oath to jonathan the good old king tis thought was very loth to break his word and therefore broke his oath zibas a traitor of some quality yet ziba might have been informd by me had i been there he neer had been content with half th estate nor half the government    in our late revolution twas thought strange that i of all mankind should like the change but they who wonderd at it never knew that in it i did my old game pursue nor had they heard of twenty thousand pound which neer was lost yet never could be found    thus all things in their turn to sale i bring god and my master first and then the king till by successful villanies made bold i thought to turn the nation into gold and so to forgery my hand i bent not doubting i could gull the government but there was ruffld by the parliament and if i scaped th unhappy tree to climb twas want of law and not for want of crime    but my old frienda who printed in my face a needful competence of english brass having more business yet for me to do and loth to lose his trusty servant so managed the matter with such art and skill as savd his hero and threw out the bill    and now im gracd with unexpected honours for which ill certainly abuse the donors knighted and made a tribune of the people whose laws and properties im like to keep well the custos rotulorum of the city and captain of the guards of their banditti surrounded by my catchpoles i declare against the needy debtor open war i hang poor thieves for stealing of your pelf and suffer none to rob you but myself    the king commanded me to help reform ye and how ill dot miss  shall inform ye i keep the best seraglio in the nation and hope in time to bring it into fashion no brimstone whore need fear the lash from me that part ill leave to brother jefferey our gallants need not go abroad to rome ill keep a whoring jubilee at home whorings the darling of my inclination ant i a magistrate for reformation for this my praise is sung by evry bard for which bridewell woud be a just reward in print my panegyric fills the street and hired gaolbirds their huzzas repeat some charities contrivd to make a show have taught the needy rabble to do so whose empty noise is a mechanic fame since for sir beelzebub theyd do the same  footnote a the devil   the conclusion    then let us boast of ancestors no more or deeds of heroes done in days of yore in latent records of the ages past behind the rear of time in long oblivion placd for if our virtues must in lines descend the merit with the families would end and intermixtures would most fatal grow for vice would be hereditary too the tainted blood would of necessity involuntary wickedness convey    vice like illnature for an age or two may seem a generation to pursue but virtue seldom does regard the breed fools do the wise and wise men fools succeed    what ist to us what ancestors we had if good what better or what worse if bad examples are for imitation set yet all men follow virtue with regret    could but our ancestors retrieve their fate and see their offspring thus degenerate how we contend for birth and names unknown and build on their past actions not our own theyd cancel records and their tombs deface and openly disown the vile degenerate race for fame of families is all a cheat its personal virtue only makes us great   the end
