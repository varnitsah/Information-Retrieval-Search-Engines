the night mail   at nine oclock of a gusty winter night i stood on the lower stages of one of the g p o outward mail towers my purpose was a run to quebec in postal packet 162 or such other as may be appointed and the postmastergeneral himself countersigned the order this talisman opened all doors even those in the despatchingcaisson at the foot of the tower where they were delivering the sorted continental mail the bags lay packed close as herrings in the long gray underbodies which our g p o still calls coaches five such coaches were filled as i watched and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting packets three hundred feet nearer the stars  from the despatchingcaisson i was conducted by a courteous and wonderfully learned officialmr l l geary second despatcher of the western routeto the captains room this wakes an echo of old romance where the mail captains come on for their turn of duty he introduces me to the captain of 162captain purnall and his relief captain hodgson the one is small and dark the other large and red but each has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and aëronauts you can see it in the pictures of our racing professionals from l v rautsch to little ada warrleighthat fathomless abstraction of eyes habitually turned through naked space  on the noticeboard in the captains room the pulsing arrows of some twenty indicators register degree by geographical degree the progress of as many homewardbound packets the word cape rises across the face of a dial a gong strikes the south african midweekly mail is in at the highgate receiving towers that is all it reminds one comically of the traitorous little bell which in pigeonfanciers lofts notifies the return of a homer  time for us to be on the move says captain purnall and we are shot up by the passengerlift to the top of the despatchtowers our coach will lock on when it is filled and the clerks are aboard  no 162 waits for us in slip e of the topmost stage the great curve of her back shines frostily under the lights and some minute alteration of trim makes her rock a little in her holdingdown slips  captain purnall frowns and dives inside hissing softly 162 comes to rest as level as a rule from her north atlantic winter nosecap worn bright as diamond with boring through uncounted leagues of hail snow and ice to the inset of her three builtout propellershafts is some two hundred and forty feet her extreme diameter carried well forward is thirtyseven contrast this with the nine hundred by ninetyfive of any crack liner and you will realize the power that must drive a hull through all weathers at more than the emergencyspeed of the cyclonic  the eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping haircrack of the bowruddermagniacs rudder that assured us the dominion of the unstable air and left its inventor penniless and halfblind it is calculated to castellis gullwing curve raise a few feet of that all but invisible plate threeeighths of an inch and she will yaw five miles to port or starboard ere she is under control again give her full helm and she returns on her track like a whiplash cant the whole forwarda touch on the wheel will sufficeand she sweeps at your good direction up or down open the complete circle and she presents to the air a mushroomhead that will bring her up all standing within a half mile  yes says captain hodgson answering my thought castelli thought hed discovered the secret of controlling aëroplanes when hed only found out how to steer dirigible balloons magniac invented his rudder to help warboats ram each other and war went out of fashion and magniac he went out of his mind because he said he couldnt serve his country any more i wonder if any of us ever know what were really doing  if you want to see the coach locked youd better go aboard its due now says mr geary i enter through the door amidships there is nothing here for display the inner skin of the gastanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges liners and yachts disguise their tanks with decoration but the g p o serves them raw under a lick of gray official paint the inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern but the bowbulkhead is recessed for the liftshunting apparatus as the stern is pierced for the shafttunnels the engineroom lies almost amidships forward of it extending to the turn of the bow tanks is an aperturea bottomless hatch at presentinto which our coach will be locked one looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the despatchingcaisson whence voices boom upward the light below is obscured to a sound of thunder as our coach rises on its guides it enlarges rapidly from a postagestamp to a playingcard to a punt and last a pontoon the two clerks its crew do not even look up as it comes into place the quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks while both captains and mr geary satisfy themselves that the coach is locked home a clerk passes the waybill over the hatchcoaming captain purnall thumbmarks and passes it to mr geary receipt has been given and taken pleasant run says mr geary and disappears through the door which a foothigh pneumatic compressor locks after him  aah sighs the compressor released our holdingdown clips part with a tang we are clear  captain hodgson opens the great colloid underbodyporthole through which i watch millionlighted london slide eastward as the gale gets hold of us the first of the low winter clouds cuts off the wellknown view and darkens middlesex on the south edge of it i can see a postal packets light ploughing through the white fleece for an instant she gleams like a star ere she drops toward the highgate receiving towers the bombay mail says captain hodgson and looks at his watch shes forty minutes late  whats our level i ask  four thousand arent you coming up on the bridge  the bridge let us ever bless the g p o as a repository of ancientest tradition is represented by a view of captain hodgsons legs where he stands on the control platform that runs thwartships overhead the bow colloid is unshuttered and captain purnall one hand on the wheel is feeling for a fair slant the dial shows 4300 feet  its steep tonight he mutters as tier on tier of cloud drops under we generally pick up an easterly draught below three thousand at this time o the year i hate slathering through fluff  so does van cutsem look at him huntin for a slant says captain hodgson a foglight breaks cloud a hundred fathoms below the antwerp night mail makes her signal and rises between two racing clouds far to port her flanks bloodred in the glare of sheerness double light the gale will have us over the north sea in half an hour but captain purnall lets her go composedlynosing to every point of the compass as she rises  five thousandsix six thousand eight hundredthe dipdial reads ere we find the easterly drift heralded by a flurry of snow at the thousandfathom level captain purnall rings up the engines and keys down the governor on the switch before him there is no sense in urging machinery when Æolus himself gives you good knots for nothing we are away in earnest nowour nose notched home on our chosen star at this level the lower clouds are laid out all neatly combed by the dry fingers of the east below that again is the strong westerly blow through which we rose overhead a film of southerly drifting mist draws a theatrical gauze across the firmament the moonlight turns the lower strata to silver without a stain except where our shadow underruns us bristol and cardiff double lights those statelily inclined beams over severnmouth are dead ahead of us for we keep the southern winter route coventry central the pivot of the english system stabs upward once in ten seconds its spear of diamond light to the north and a point or two off our starboard bow the leek the great cloudbreaker of saint davids head swings its unmistakable green beam twentyfive degrees each way there must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather but it does not affect the leek  our planets overlighted if anything says captain purnall at the wheel as cardiffbristol slides under i remember the old days of common white verticals that ud show two or three thousand feet up in a mist if you knew where to look for em in really fluffy weather they might as well have been under your hat one could get lost coming home then an have some fun now its like driving down piccadilly  he points to the pillars of light where the cloudbreakers bore through the cloudfloor we see nothing of englands outlines only a white pavement pierced in all directions by these manholes of variously coloured fireholy islands white and redst bees interrupted white and so on as far as the eye can reach blessed be sargent ahrens and the dubois brothers who invented the cloudbreakers of the world whereby we travel in security  are you going to lift for the shamrock asks captain hodgson cork light green fixed enlarges as we rush to it captain purnall nods there is heavy traffic hereaboutsthe cloudbank beneath us is streaked with running fissures of flame where the atlantic boats are hurrying londonward just clear of the fluff mailpackets are supposed under the conference rules to have the fivethousandfoot lanes to themselves but the foreigner in a hurry is apt to take liberties with english air no 162 lifts to a longdrawn wail of the breeze in the foreflange of the rudder and we make valencia white green white at a safe 7000 feet dipping our beam to an incoming washington packet  there is no cloud on the atlantic and faint streaks of cream round dingle bay show where the driven seas hammer the coast a big s a t a liner société anonyme des transports aëriens is diving and lifting half a mile below us in search of some break in the solid west wind lower still lies a disabled dane she is telling the liner all about it in international our general communication dial has caught her talk and begins to eavesdrop captain hodgson makes a motion to shut it off but checks himself perhaps youd like to listen he says  argol of st thomas the dane whimpers report owners three starboard shaft collarbearings fused can make flores as we are but impossible further shall we buy spares at fayal  the liner acknowledges and recommends inverting the bearings the argol answers that she has already done so without effect and begins to relieve her mind about cheap german enamels for collarbearings the frenchman assents cordially cries courage mon ami and switches off  their lights sink under the curve of the ocean  thats one of lundt  bleamerss boats says captain hodgson serves em right for putting german compos in their thrustblocks she wont be in fayal tonight by the way wouldnt you like to look round the engineroom  i have been waiting eagerly for this invitation and i follow captain hodgson from the controlplatform stooping low to avoid the bulge of the tanks we know that fleurys gas can lift anything as the worldfamous trials of 89 showed but its almost indefinite powers of expansion necessitate vast tank room even in this thin air the liftshunts are busy taking out onethird of its normal lift and still 162 must be checked by an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our flight would become a climb to the stars captain purnall prefers an overlifted to an underlifted ship but no two captains trim ship alike when i take the bridge says captain hodgson youll see me shunt forty per cent of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper rudder with a swoop upwards instead of a swoop downwards as you say either way will do its only habit watch our dipdial tim fetches her down once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing  so is it shown on the dipdial for five or six minutes the arrow creeps from 6700 to 7300 there is the faint szgee of the rudder and back slides the arrow to 6500 on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots  in heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well says captain hodgson and unclipping the jointed bar which divides the engineroom from the bare deck he leads me on to the floor  here we find fleurys paradox of the bulkheaded vacuumwhich we accept now without thoughtliterally in full blast the three engines are h t  t assistedvacuo fleury turbines running from 3000 to the limitthat is to say up to the point when the blades make the air bellcut out a vacuum for themselves precisely as overdriven marine propellers used to do 162s limit is low on account of the small size of her nine screws which though handier than the old colloid thelussons bell sooner the midships engine generally used as a reinforce is not running so the port and starboard turbine vacuumchambers draw direct into the returnmains  the turbines whistle reflectively from the lowarched expansiontanks on either side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbinechests and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a powersaw behind is its own pressure held in leash or spurred on by the liftshunts before it the vacuum where fleurys ray dances in violetgreen bands and whirled turbillions of flame the jointed utubes of the vacuumchamber are pressuretempered colloid no glass would endure the strain for an instant and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the ray intently it is the very heart of the machinea mystery to this day even fleury who begat it and unlike magniac died a multimillionaire could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the utube can in the fractional fraction of a second strike the furious blast of gas into a chill grayishgreen liquid that drains you can hear it trickle from the far end of the vacuum through the eductionpipes and the mains back to the bilges here it returns to its gaseous one had almost written sagacious state and climbs to work afresh bilgetank upper tank dorsaltank expansionchamber vacuum mainreturn as a liquid and bilgetank once more is the ordained cycle fleurys ray sees to that and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to fleurys ray if a speck of oil if even the natural grease of the human finger touch the hooded terminals fleurys ray will wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again this means half a days work for all hands and an expense of one hundred and seventyodd pounds to the g p o for radiumsalts and such trifles  now look at our thrustcollars you wont find much german compo there fulljewelled you see says captain hodgson as the engineer shunts open the top of a cap our shaftbearings are c m c commercial minerals company stones ground with as much care as the lens of a telescope they cost £37 apiece so far we have not arrived at their term of life these bearings came from no 97 which took them over from the old dominion of light which had them out of the wreck of the perseus aëroplane in the years when men still flew linen kites over thorium engines  they are a shining reproof to all lowgrade german ruby enamels socalled boort facings and the dangerous and unsatisfactory alumina compounds which please dividendhunting owners and turn skippers crazy  the ruddergear and the gas liftshunt seated side by side under the engineroom dials are the only machines in visible motion the former sighs from time to time as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch the latter cased and guarded like the utube aft exhibits another fleury ray but inverted and more green than violet its function is to shunt the lift out of the gas and this it will do without watching that is all a tiny pumprod wheezing and whining to itself beside a sputtering green lamp a hundred and fifty feet aft down the flattopped tunnel of the tanks a violet light restless and irresolute between the two three whitepainted turbinetrunks like eelbaskets laid on their side accentuate the empty perspectives you can hear the trickle of the liquefied gas flowing from the vacuum into the bilgetanks and the soft gluckglock of gaslocks closing as captain purnall brings 162 down by the head the hum of the turbines and the boom of the air on our skin is no more than a cottonwool wrapping to the universal stillness and we are running an eighteensecond mile  i peer from the fore end of the engineroom over the hatchcoamings into the coach the mailclerks are sorting the winnipeg calgary and medicine hat bags but there is a pack of cards ready on the table  suddenly a bell thrills the engineers run to the turbinevalves and stand by but the spectacled slave of the ray in the utube never lifts his head he must watch where he is we are hardbraked and going astern there is language from the controlplatform  tims sparking badly about something says the unruffled captain hodgson lets look  captain purnall is not the suave man we left half an hour since but the embodied authority of the g p o ahead of us floats an ancient aluminumpatched twinscrew tramp of the dingiest with no more right to the 5000 foot lane than has a horsecart to a modern town she carries an obsolete barbette conningtowera sixfoot affair with railed platform forwardand our warning beam plays on the top of it as a policemans lantern flashes on the area sneak like a sneakthief too emerges a shockheaded navigator in his shirtsleeves captain purnall wrenches open the colloid to talk with him man to man there are times when science does not satisfy  what under the stars are you doing here you skyscraping chimneysweep he shouts as we two drift side by side do you know this is a maillane you call yourself a sailor sir you aint fit to peddle toy balloons to an esquimaux your name and number report and get down and be  ive been blown up once the shockheaded man cries hoarsely as a dog barking i dont care two flips of a contact for anything you can do postey  dont you sir but ill make you care ill have you towed stern first to disko and broke up you cant recover insurance if youre broke for obstruction do you understand that  then the stranger bellows look at my propellers theres been a wulliwa down under that has knocked us into umbrellaframes weve been blown up about forty thousand feet were all one conjurors watch inside my mates arms broke my engineers heads cut open my ray went out when the engines smashed and  and  for pitys sake give me my height captain we doubt were dropping  six thousand eight hundred can you hold it captain purnall overlooks all insults and leans half out of the colloid staring and snuffing the stranger leaks pungently  we ought to blow into st johns with luck were trying to plug the foretank now but shes simply whistling it away her captain wails  shes sinking like a log says captain purnall in an undertone call up the banks mark boat george our dipdial shows that we keeping abreast the tramp have dropped five hundred feet the last few minutes  captain purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing through the night twizzling spokes of light across infinity  thatll fetch something he says while captain hodgson watches the general communicator he has called up the north banks mark boat a few hundred miles west and is reporting the case  ill stand by you captain purnall roars to the lone figure on the conningtower  is it as bad as that comes the answer she isnt insured shes mine  might have guessed as much mutters hodgson owners risk is the worst risk of all  cant i fetch st johnsnot even with this breeze the voice quavers  stand by to abandon ship havent you any lift in you fore or aft  nothing but the midship tanks and theyre none too tight you see my ray gave out and he coughs in the reek of the escaping gas  you poor devil this does not reach our friend what does the mark boat say george  wants to know if theres any danger to traffic says shes in a bit of weather herself and cant quit station ive turned in a general call so even if they dont see our beam some ones bound to helpor else we must shall i clear our slings hold on here we are a planet liner too shell be up in a tick  tell her to have her slings ready cries his brother captain there wont be much time to spare tie up your mate he roars to the tramp  my mates all right its my engineer hes gone crazy  shunt the lift out of him with a spanner hurry  but i can make st johns if youll stand by  youll make the deep wet atlantic in twenty minutes youre less than fiftyeight hundred now get your papers  a planet liner east bound heaves up in a superb spiral and takes the air of us humming her underbody colloid is open and her transporterslings hang down like tentacles we shut off our beam as she adjusts herselfsteering to a hairover the tramps conningtower the mate comes up his arm strapped to his side and stumbles into the cradle a man with a ghastly scarlet head follows shouting that he must go back and build up his ray the mate assures him that he will find a nice new ray all ready in the liners engineroom the bandaged head goes up wagging excitedly a youth and a woman follow the liner cheers hollowly above us and we see the passengers faces at the saloon colloid  thats a good girl whats the fool waiting for now says captain purnall  the skipper comes up still appealing to us to stand by and see him fetch st johns he dives below and returnsat which we little human beings in the void cheer louder than everwith the ships kitten up fly the liners hissing slings her underbody crashes home and she hurtles away again the dial shows less than 3000 feet  the mark boat signals we must attend to the derelict now whistling her death song as she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags  keep our beam on her and send out a general warning says captain purnall following her down  there is no need not a liner in air but knows the meaning of that vertical beam and gives us and our quarry a wide berth  but shell drown in the water wont she i ask  not always is his answer ive known a derelict upend and sift her engines out of herself and flicker round the lower lanes for three weeks on her forward tanks only well run no risks pith her george and look sharp theres weather ahead  captain hodgson opens the underbody colloid swings the heavy pithingiron out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a settee and at two hundred feet releases the catch we hear the whir of the crescentshaped arms opening as they descend the derelicts forehead is punched in starred across and rent diagonally she falls stern first our beam upon her slides like a lost soul down that pitiless ladder of light and the atlantic takes her  illustration slides like a lost soul down that pitiless ladder of light and the atlantic takes her  a filthy business says hodgson i wonder what it must have been like in the old days  the thought had crossed my mind too what if that wavering carcass had been filled with internationalspeaking men of all the internationalities each one of them taught that is the horror of it that after death he would very possibly go forever to unspeakable torment  and not half a century since we one knows now that we are only our fathers reenlarged upon the earth we i say ripped and rammed and pithed to admiration  here tim from the controlplatform shouts that we are to get into our inflators and to bring him his at once  we hurry into the heavy rubber suitsand the engineers are already dressedand inflate at the airpump taps g p o inflators are thrice as thick as a racing mans flickers and chafe abominably under the armpits george takes the wheel until tim has blown himself up to the extreme of rotundity if you kicked him off the c p to the deck he would bounce back but it is 162 that will do the kicking  the mark boats madstark ravin crazy he snorts returning to command she says theres a bad blowout ahead and wants me to pull over to greenland ill see her pithed first we wasted an hour and a quarter over that dead duck down under and now im expected to go rubbin my back all round the pole what does she think a postal packets made of gummed silk tell her were coming on straight george  george buckles him into the frame and switches on the direct control now under tims left toe lies the portengine accelerator under his left heel the reverse and so with the other foot the liftshunt stops stand out on the rim of the steeringwheel where the fingers of his left hand can play on them at his right hand is the midships engine lever ready to be thrown into gear at a moments notice he leans forward in his belt eyes glued to the colloid and one ear cocked toward the general communicator henceforth he is the strength and direction of 162 through whatever may befall  the banks mark boat is reeling out pages of a b c directions to the traffic at large we are to secure all loose objects hood up our fleury rays and on no account to attempt to clear snow from our conningtowers till the weather abates underpowered craft we are told can ascend to the limit of their lift mailpackets to look out for them accordingly the lower lanes westward are pitting very badly with frequent blowouts vortices laterals etc  still the clear dark holds up unblemished the only warning is the electric skintension i feel as though i were a lacemakers pillow and an irritability which the gibbering of the general communicator increases almost to hysteria  we have made eight thousand feet since we pithed the tramp and our turbines are giving us an honest two hundred and ten knots  very far to the west an elongated blur of red low down shows us the north banks mark boat there are specks of fire round her rising and fallingbewildered planets about an unstable sunhelpless shipping hanging on to her light for companys sake no wonder she could not quit station  she warns us to look out for the backwash of the bad vortex in which her beam shows it she is even now reeling  the pits of gloom about us begin to fill with very faintly luminous filmswreathing and uneasy shapes one forms itself into a globe of pale flame that waits shivering with eagerness till we sweep by it leaps monstrously across the blackness alights on the precise tip of our nose pirouettes there an instant and swings off our roaring bow sinks as though that light were leadsinks and recovers to lurch and stumble again beneath the next blowout tims fingers on the liftshunt strike chords of numbers147246753 and so on for he is running by his tanks only lifting or lowering her against the uneasy air all three engines are at work for the sooner we have skated over this thin ice the better higher we dare not go the whole upper vault is charged with pale krypton vapours which our skin friction may excite to unholy manifestations between the upper and the lower levels5000 and 7000 hints the mark boatwe may perhaps bolt through if our bow clothes itself in blue flame and falls like a sword no human skill can keep pace with the changing tensions a vortex has us by the beak and we dive down a twothousandfoot slant at an angle the dipdial and my bouncing body record it of thirtyfive our turbines scream shrilly the propellers cannot bite on the thin air tim shunts the lift out of five tanks at once and by sheer weight drives her bulletwise through the maelstrom till she cushions with a jar on an upgust three thousand feet below  now weve done it says george in my ear our skinfriction that last slide has played old harry with the tensions look out for laterals tim shell want some holding  ive got her is the answer come up old woman  she comes up nobly but the laterals buffet her left and right like the pinions of angry angels she is jolted off her course in four ways at once and cuffed into place again only to be swung aside and dropped into a new chaos we are never without a corposant grinning on our bows or rolling head over heels from nose to midships and to the crackle of electricity around and within us is added once or twice the rattle of hailhail that will never fall on any sea slow we must or we may break our back pitchpoling  airs a perfectly elastic fluid roars george above the tumult about as elastic as a head sea off the fastnet aint it  illustration the storm  he is less than just to the good element if one intrudes on the heavens when they are balancing their voltaccounts if one disturbs the high gods marketrates by hurling steel hulls at ninety knots across tremblingly adjusted electric tensions one must not complain of any rudeness in the reception tim met it with an unmoved countenance one corner of his under lip caught up on a tooth his eyes fleeting into the blackness twenty miles ahead and the fierce sparks flying from his knuckles at every turn of the hand now and again he shook his head to clear the sweat trickling from his eyebrows and it was then that george watching his chance would slide down the liferail and swab his face quickly with a big red handkerchief i never imagined that a human being could so continuously labour and so collectedly think as did tim through that hells half hour when the flurry was at its worst we were dragged hither and yon by warm or frozen suctions belched up on the tops of wulliwas spun down by vortices and clubbed aside by laterals under a dizzying rush of stars in the company of a drunken moon i heard the rushing click of the midshipenginelever sliding in and out the low growl of the liftshunts and louder than the yelling winds without the scream of the bowrudder gouging into any lull that promised hold for an instant at last we began to claw up on a cant bowrudder and portpropeller together only the nicest balancing of tanks saved us from spinning like the riflebullet of the old days  weve got to hitch to windward of that mark boat somehow george cried  theres no windward i protested feebly where i swung shackled to a stanchion how can there be  he laughedas we pitched into a thousand foot blowoutthat red man laughed beneath his inflated hood  look he said we must clear those refugees with a high lift  the mark boat was below and a little to the souwest of us fluctuating in the centre of her distraught galaxy the air was thick with moving lights at every level i take it most of them were trying to lie head to wind but not being hydras they failed an undertanked moghrabi boat had risen to the limit of her lift and finding no improvement had dropped a couple of thousand there she met a superb wulliwa and was blown up spinning like a dead leaf instead of shutting off she went astern and naturally rebounded as from a wall almost into the mark boat whose language our g c took it in was humanly simple  if theyd only ride it out quietly it ud be better said george in a calm as we climbed like a bat above them all but some skippers will navigate without enough lift what does that tadboat think she is doing tim  playin kiss in the ring was tims unmoved reply a transasiatic direct liner had found a smooth and butted into it full power but there was a vortex at the tail of that smooth so the t a d was flipped out like a pea from off a fingernail braking madly as she fled down and all but overending  now i hope shes satisfied said tim im glad im not a mark boat do i want help the c g dial had caught his ear george you may tell that gentleman with my lovelove remember georgethat i do not want help who is the officious sardinetin  a rimouski drogher on the lookout for a tow  very kind of the rimouski drogher this postal packet isnt being towed at present  those droghers will go anywhere on a chance of salvage george explained we call em kittiwakes  a longbeaked bright steel ninetyfooter floated at ease for one instant within hail of us her slings coiled ready for rescues and a single hand in her open tower he was smoking surrendered to the insurrection of the airs through which we tore our way he lay in absolute peace i saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his boat dropped it seemed like a stone in a well  we had just cleared the mark boat and her disorderly neighbours when the storm ended as suddenly as it had begun a shootingstar to northward filled the sky with the green blink of a meteorite dissipating itself in our atmosphere  said george that may iron out all the tensions even as he spoke the conflicting winds came to rest the levels filled the laterals died out in long easy swells the airways were smoothed before us in less than three minutes the covey round the mark boat had shipped their powerlights and whirred away upon their businesses  whats happened i gasped the nervestorm within and the volttingle without had passed my inflators weighed like lead  god he knows said captain george soberly that old shootingstars skinfriction has discharged the different levels ive seen it happen before phew what a relief  we dropped from ten to six thousand and got rid of our clammy suits tim shut off and stepped out of the frame the mark boat was coming up behind us he opened the colloid in that heavenly stillness and mopped his face  hello williams he cried a degree or two out o station aint you  may be was the answer from the mark boat ive had some company this evening  so i noticed wasnt that quite a little draught  i warned you why didnt you pull out round by disko the eastbound packets have  me not till im running a polar consumptives sanatorium boat i was squinting through a colloid before you were out of your cradle my son  id be the last man to deny it the captain of the mark boat replies softly the way you handled her just nowim a pretty fair judge of traffic in a voltflurryit was a thousand revolutions beyond anything even ive ever seen  tims back supples visibly to this oiling captain george on the c p winks and points to the portrait of a singularly attractive maiden pinned up on tims telescopebracket above the steeringwheel  i see wholly and entirely do i see  there is some talk overhead of coming round to tea on friday a brief report of the derelicts fate and tim volunteers as he descends for an a b c man young williams is less of a hightension fool than some were you thinking of taking her on george then ill just have a look round that portthrustseems to me its a trifle warmand well jog along  the mark boat hums off joyously and hangs herself up in her appointed eyrie here she will stay a shutterless observatory a lifeboat station a salvage tug a court of ultimate appealcummeteorological bureau for three hundred miles in all directions till wednesday next when her relief slides across the stars to take her buffeted place her black hull double conningtower and everready slings represent all that remains to the planet of that odd old word authority she is responsible only to the aërial board of controlthe a b c of which tim speaks so flippantly but that semielected seminominated body of a few score persons of both sexes controls this planet transportation is civilization our motto runs theoretically we do what we please so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies practically the a b c confirms or annuls all international arrangements and to judge from its last report finds our tolerant humorous lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden of private administration on its shoulders  i discuss this with tim sipping maté on the c p while george fans her along over the white blur of the banks in beautiful upward curves of fifty miles each the dipdial translates them on the tape in flowing freehand  tim gathers up a skein of it and surveys the last few feet which record 162s path through the voltflurry  i havent had a feverchart like this to show up in five years he says ruefully  a postal packets dipdial records every yard of every run the tapes then go to the a b c which collates and makes composite photographs of them for the instruction of captains tim studies his irrevocable past shaking his head  hello heres a fifteenhundredfoot drop at eightyfive degrees we must have been standing on our heads then george  you dont say so george answers i fancied i noticed it at the time  george may not have captain purnalls catlike swiftness but he is all an artist to the tips of the broad fingers that play on the shuntstops the delicious flightcurves come away on the tape with never a waver the mark boats vertical spindle of light lies down to eastward setting in the face of the following stars westward where no planet should rise the triple verticals of trinity bay we keep still to the southern route make a lowlifting haze we seem the only thing at rest under all the heavens floating at ease till the earths revolution shall turn up our landingtowers  and minute by minute our silent clock gives us a sixteensecond mile  some fine night says tim well be even with that clocks master  hes coming now says george over his shoulder im chasing the night west  the stars ahead dim no more than if a film of mist had been drawn under unobserved but the deep airboom on our skin changes to a joyful shout  the dawngust says tim itll go on to meet the sun look look theres the dark being crammed back over our bow come to the aftercolloid ill show you something  the engineroom is hot and stuffy the clerks in the coach are asleep and the slave of the ray is near to follow them tim slides open the aft colloid and reveals the curve of the worldthe oceans deepest purpleedged with fuming and intolerable gold then the sun rises and through the colloid strikes out our lamps tim scowls in his face  squirrels in a cage he mutters thats all we are squirrels in a cage hes going twice as fast as us just you wait a few years my shining friend and well take steps that will amaze you well joshua you  yes that is our dream to turn all earth into the vale of ajalon at our pleasure so far we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length in these latitudes but some dayeven on the equatorwe shall hold the sun level in his full stride  now we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic a big submersible breaks water suddenly another and another follow with a swash and a suck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures the deepsea freighters are rising to lung up after the long night and the leisurely ocean is all patterned with peacocks eyes of foam  well lung up too says tim and when we return to the c p george shuts off the colloids are opened and the fresh air sweeps her out there is no hurry the old contracts they will be revised at the end of the year allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind her in ten so we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which pushes us along at a languid twenty  to enjoy life and tobacco begin both on a sunny morning half a mile or so above the dappled atlantic cloudbelts and after a voltflurry which has cleared and tempered your nerves while we discussed the thickening traffic with the superiority that comes of having a high level reserved to ourselves we heard and i for the first time the morning hymn on a hospital boat  she was cloaked by a skein of ravelled fluff beneath us and we caught the chant before she rose into the sunlight oh ye winds of god sang the unseen voices bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him forever  we slid off our caps and joined in when our shadow fell across her great open platforms they looked up and stretched out their hands neighbourly while they sang we could see the doctors and the nurses and the whitebuttonlike faces of the cotpatients she passed slowly beneath us heading northward her hull wet with the dews of the night all ablaze in the sunshine so took she the shadow of a cloud and vanished her song continuing oh ye holy and humble men of heart bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him forever  shes a public lunger or she wouldnt have been singing the benedicite and shes a greenlander or she wouldnt have snowblinds over her colloids said george at last shell be bound for frederikshavn or one of the glacier sanatoriums for a month if she was an accident ward shed be hung up at the eightthousandfoot level yesconsumptives  funny how the new things are the old things ive read in books tim answered that savages used to haul their sick and wounded up to the tops of hills because microbes were fewer there we hoist em into sterilized air for a while same idea how much do the doctors say weve added to the average life of a man  thirty years says george with a twinkle in his eye are we going to spend em all up here tim  flap along then flap along whos hindering the senior captain laughed as we went in  we held a good lift to clear the coastwise and continental shipping and we had need of it though our route is in no sense a populated one there is a steady trickle of traffic this way along we met hudson bay furriers out of the great preserve hurrying to make their departure from bonavista with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets we overcrossed keewatin liners small and cramped but their captains who see no land between trepassy and blanco know what gold they bring back from west africa transasiatic directs we met soberly ringing the world round the fiftieth meridian at an honest seventy knots and whitepainted ackroyd  hunt fruiters out of the south fled beneath us their ventilated hulls whistling like chinese kites their market is in the north among the northern sanatoria where you can smell their grapefruit and bananas across the cold snows argentine beef boats we sighted too of enormous capacity and unlovely outline they too feed the northern health stations in icebound ports where submersibles dare not rise  yellowbellied oreflats and ungava petroltanks punted down leisurely out of the north like strings of unfrightened wild duck it does not pay to fly minerals and oil a mile farther than is necessary but the risks of transhipping to submersibles in the icepack off nain or hebron are so great that these heavy freighters fly down to halifax direct and scent the air as they go they are the biggest tramps aloft except the athabasca graintubs but these last now that the wheat is moved are busy over the worlds shoulder timberlifting in siberia  we held to the st lawrence it is astonishing how the old waterways still pull us children of the air and followed his broad line of black between its drifting ice blocks all down the park that the wisdom of our fathersbut every one knows the quebec run  we dropped to the heights receiving towers twenty minutes ahead of time and there hung at ease till the yokohama intermediate packet could pull out and give us our proper slip it was curious to watch the action of the holdingdown clips all along the frosty river front as the boats cleared or came to rest a big hamburger was leaving pont levis and her crew unshipping the platform railings began to sing elsinorethe oldest of our chanteys you know it of course     mother rugens teahouse on the baltic      forty couple waltzing on the floor    and

ninety knot an hour to the skaw    mother rugens teahouse on the baltic      and a dance with ella sweyn at elsinore  the clips parted with a gesture of indignant dismissal as though quebec glittering under her snows were casting out these light and unworthy lovers our signal came from the heights tim turned and floated up but surely then it was with passionate appeal that the great tower arms flung openor did i think so because on the upper staging a little hooded figure also opened her arms wide towards her father                                       in ten seconds the coach with its clerks clashed down to the receivingcaisson the hostlers displaced the engineers at the idle turbines and tim prouder of this than all introduced me to the maiden of the photograph on the shelf and by

highlevel sleet   the northern weather so far shows no sign of improvement from all quarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the higher levels racingplanes and digs alike have suffered severelythe former from unequal deposits of halffrozen slush on their vans and only those who have held up a badly balanced plane in a cross wind know what that means and the latter from loaded bows and snowcased bodies as a consequence the northern and northwestern upper levels have been practically abandoned and the high fliers have returned to the ignoble security of the three five and six hundred foot levels but there remain a few undaunted sunhunters who in spite of frozen stays and icejammed connectingrods still haunt the blue empyrean   batboat racing  the scandals of the past few years have at last moved the yachting world to concerted action in regard to bat boat racing  we have been treated to the spectacle of what are practically keeled racingplanes driven a clear five foot or more above the water and only eased down to touch their socalled native element as they near the line judges and starters have been conveniently blind to this absurdity but the public demonstration off st catherines light at the autumn regattas has borne ample if tardy fruit in future the bat is to be a boat and the longunheeded demand of the true sportsman for no daylight under midkeel in smooth water is in a fair way to be conceded the new rule severely restricts plane area and lift alike the gas compartments are permitted both fore and aft as in the old type but the waterballast central tank is rendered obligatory these things work if not for perfection at least for the evolution of a sane and wholesome waterborne cruiser the type of rudder is unaffected by the new rules so we may expect to see the longdavidson make the patent on which has just expired come largely into use henceforward though the strain on the sternpost in turning at speeds over forty miles

least two hours and naturally produced violent electric derangements my compasses of course were thrown out my bow was struck twice and i received two brisk shocks from the lower platformrail on remonstrating i was told that these professors were engaged in scientific experiments the extent of their scientific knowledge may be judged by the fact that they expected to produce i give their own words a little blue sky if they went on long enough this in the heart of the doldrums at 450 feet i have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place it can be found at the 2000 level for practically twelve months out of the year but i submit with all deference to the educational needs of transylvania that skylarking in the centre of a maintravelled road where at the best of times electricity literally drips off ones stanchions and screw blades is unnecessary when my friends had finished the road was seared and blown and pitted with unequal pressurelayers spirals vortices and

reviews     reviews   the life of xavier lavalle  reviewed by réné talland École aëronautique paris  ten years ago lavalle that imperturbable dreamer of the heavens as lazareff hailed him gathered together the fruits of a lifetimes labour and gave it with welljustified contempt to a world bound hand and foot to baralds theory of vertices and compensating electric nodes they shall see he wrotein that immortal postscript to the heart of the cyclonethe laws whose existence they derided written in fire beneath them  but even here he continues there is no finality better a thousand times my conclusions should be discredited than that my dead name should lie across the threshold of the temple of sciencea bar to further inquiry  so died lavallea prince of the powers of the air and even at his funeral céllier jested at him who had gone to discover the secrets of the aurora borealis  if i choose thus to be banal it is only to remind you that célliers theories are today as exploded as the ludicrous deductions of the spanish school in the place of their fugitive and warring dreams we have definitely lavalles law of the cyclone which he surprised in darkness and cold at the foot of the overarching throne of the aurora borealis it is there that i intent on my own investigations have passed and repassed a hundred times the worn leonine face white as the snow beneath him furrowed with wrinkles like the seams and gashes upon the north cape the nervous hand integrally a part of the mechanism of his flighter and above all the wonderful lambent eyes turned to the zenith  master i would cry as i moved respectfully beneath him what is it you seek today and always the answer clear and without doubt from above the old secret my son  the immense egotism of youth forced me on my own path but cry of the human always had i knownif i had knowni would many times have bartered my poor laurels for the privilege such as tinsley and herrera possess of having aided him in his monumental researches  it is to the filial piety of victor lavalle that we owe the two volumes consecrated to the groundlife of his father so full of the holy intimacies of the domestic hearth once returned from the abysms of the utter north to that little house upon the outskirts of meudon it was not the philosopher the daring observer the man of iron energy that imposed himself on his family but a fat and even plaintive jester a farceur incarnate and kindly the coequal of his children and it must be written not seldom the comic despair of madame lavalle who as she writes five years after the marriage to her venerable mother found in this unequalled intellect whose name i bear the abandon of a large and very untidy boy here is her letter  xavier returned from i do not know where at midnight absorbed in calculations on the eternal question of his aurorala belle aurore whom i begin to hate instead of anchoringi had set out the guidelight above our roof so he had but to descend and fasten the planehe wandered profoundly distracted above the town with his anchor down figure to yourself dear mother it is the roof of the mayors house that the grapnel first engages that i do not regret for the mayors wife and i are not sympathetic but when xavier uproots my pet araucaria and bears it across the garden into the conservatory i protest at the top of my voice little victor in his nightclothes runs to the window enormously amused at the parabolic flight without reason for it is too dark to see the grapnel of my prized tree the mayor of meudon thunders at our door in the name of the law demanding i suppose my husbands head here is the conversation through the megaphonexavier is two hundred feet above us  mons lavalle descend and make reparation for outrage of domicile descend

one then all meudon attended in the streets and my xavier after a long time comprehending what he had done excused himself in a thousand apologies at last the reconciliation was effected in our house over a supper at two in the morningjulie in a wonderful costume of compromises and i have her and the mayor pacified in beds in the blue room  and on the next day while the mayor rebuilds his roof her xavier departs anew for the aurora borealis there to commence his lifes work m victor lavalle tells us of that historic collision en plane on the flank of hecla between herrera then a pillar of the spanish school and the man destined to confute his theories and lead him intellectually captive even through the years the immense laugh of lavalle as he sustains the spaniards wrecked plane and cries courage i shall not fall till i have found truth and i hold you fast rings like the call of trumpets this is that lavalle whom the world immersed in speculations of immediate gain did not know nor suspectthe lavalle whom they adjudged to the last a pedant and a theorist  the human as apart from the scientific side developed in his own volumes of his epochmaking discoveries is marked with a simplicity clarity and good sense beyond praise i would specially refer such as doubt the sustaining influence of ancestral faith upon character and will to the eleventh and nineteenth chapters in which are contained the opening and consummation of the tellurionical records extending over nine years of their tremendous significance be sure that the modest house at meudon knew as little as that the records would one day be the worlds standard in all official meteorology it was enough for them that their xavierthis son this father this husbandascended periodically to commune with powers it might be angelic beyond their comprehension and that they united daily in prayers for his safety  pray for me he says upon the eve of each of his excursions and returning with an equal simplicity he renders thanks after supper in the little room where he kept his barometers  to the last lavalle was a catholic of the old school acceptinghe who had looked into the very heart of the lightningsthe dogmas of papal infallibility of absolution of confessionof relics great and small marvellousenviable contradiction  the completion of the tellurionical records closed what lavalle himself was pleased to call the theoretical side of his labourslabours from which the youngest and least impressionable planeur might well have shrunk he had traced through cold and heat across the deeps of the oceans
