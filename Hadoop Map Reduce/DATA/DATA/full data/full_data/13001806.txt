13001806	doctor therne  by h rider haggard    dedicated  in all sincerity  but without permission  to the  members of the jenner society      authors note  some months since the leaders of the government dismayed their supporters and astonished the world by a sudden surrender to the clamour of the antivaccinationists in the space of a single evening with a marvellous versatility they threw to the agitators the ascertained results of generations of the medical faculty the report of a royal commission what are understood to be their own convictions and the president of the local government board after one ineffectual fight the house of lords answered to the whip and under the guise of a graceful concession the health of the country was given without appeal into the hand of the conscientious objector  in his perplexity it has occurred to an observer of these eventsas a person who in other lands has seen and learned something of the ravages of smallpox among the unvaccinatedto try to forecast their natural and in the view of many their almost certain end hence these pages from the life history of the pitiable but unfortunate dr therne absit omen may the prophecy be falsified but on the other hand it may not some who are very competent to judge say that it will not that on the contrary this strange paralysis of the most powerful ministry of the generation must result hereafter in much terror and in the sacrifice of innocent lives        it need hardly be explained that dr therne himself is a      character convenient to the dramatic purpose of the story      and in no way intended to be taken as a type of anti      vaccinationist medical men who are the author believes as      conscientious in principle as they are select in number  the importance of the issue to those helpless children from whom the state has thus withdrawn its shield is this writers excuse for inviting the public to interest itself in a medical tale as for the moral each reader can fashion it to his fancy      doctor therne    chapter i  the diligence  james therne is not my real name for why should i publish it to the world a year or two ago it was famousor infamousenough but in that time many things have happened there has been a war a continental revolution two scandals of worldwide celebrity one moral and the other financial and to come to events that interest me particularly as a doctor an epidemic of asiatic plague in italy and france and stranger still an outbreak of the mediaeval grain sickness which is believed to have carried off 20000 people in russia and german poland consequent i have no doubt upon the wet season and poor rye harvest in those countries  these occurrences and others are more than enough to turn the public mind from the recollection of the appalling smallpox epidemic that passed over england last autumn two years of which the first fury broke upon the city of dunchester my native place that for many years i had the honour to represent in parliament the population of dunchester it is true is smaller by over five thousand souls and many of those who survive are not so goodlooking as they were but the gap is easily filled and pockmarks are not hereditary also such a horror will never happen again for now the law of compulsory vaccination is strong enough only the dead have cause of complaint those who were cut off from the world and despatched hotfoot whither we see not myself i am certain of nothing i know too much about the brain and body to have much faith in the soul and i pray to god that i may be right ah there it comes in if a god why not the rest and who shall say there is no god somehow it seems to me that more than once in my life i have seen his finger  yet i pray that i am right for if i am wrong what a welcome awaits me yonder when grief and chloral and that slight weakness of the heart have done their work  yesfive thousand of them or more in dunchester alone and making every allowance i suppose that in this one city there were very many of theseyoung people mostlywho owed their deaths to me since it was my persuasion my eloquent arguments working upon the minds of their prejudiced and credulous elders that surely if indirectly brought their doom upon them a doctor is not infallible he may make mistakes quite so and if a mistake of his should kill a few thousands why that is the act of god or of fate working through his blindness but if it does not happen to have been a mistake if for instance all those dead should they still live in any place or shape could say to me james therne you are the murderer of our bodies since for your own ends you taught us that which you knew not to be the truth  how then i ask solet them say it if they will let all that great cloud of witnesses compass me about lads and maidens children and infants whose bones cumber the churchyards yonder in dunchester i defy them for it is done and cannot be undone yet in their company are two whose eyes i dread to meet jane my daughter whose life was sacrificed through me and ernest merchison her lover who went to seek her in the tomb  they would not reproach me now i know for she was too sweet and loved me too well with all my faults and if he proved pitiless in the first torment of his loss merchison was a good and honest man who understanding my remorse and misery forgave me before he died still i dread to meet them who if that old fable be true and they live read me for what i am yet why should i fear for all this they knew before they died and knowing could forgive surely it is with another vengeance that i must reckon  well after her mothers death my daughter was the only being whom i ever truly loved and no future mental hell that the imagination can invent would have power to make me suffer more because of her than i have always suffered since the grave closed over herthe virgin martyr sacrificed on the altar of a false prophet and a coward    i come of a family of doctors my grandfather thomas therne whose name still lives in medicine was a doctor in the neighbourhood of dunchester and my father succeeded to his practice and nothing else for the old gentleman had lived beyond his means shortly after my fathers marriage he sold this practice and removed into dunchester where he soon acquired a considerable reputation as a surgeon and prospered until not long after my birth just as a brilliant career seemed to be opening itself to him death closed his book for ever in attending a case of smallpox about four months before i was born he contracted the disease but the attack was not considered serious and he recovered from it quickly it would seem however that it left some constitutional weakness for a year later he was found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs and was ordered to a warmer climate  selling his dunchester practice for what it would fetch to his assistant dr bell my father came to madeirawhither i scarcely know why i have also drifted now that all is over for mefor here he hoped to be able to earn a living by doctoring the english visitors this however he could not do since the climate proved no match for his disease though he lingered for nearly two years during which time he spent all the money that he had when he died there was scarcely enough left to pay for his funeral in the little churchyard yonder that i can see from the windows of this quinta where he lies exactly i do not know as no record was kept and the wooden cross the only monument that my mother could afford to set over him has long ago rotted away  some charitable english people helped my mother to return to england where we went to live with her mother who existed on a pension of about 120 pounds a year in a fishingvillage near brighton here i grew up getting my educationa very good one by the wayat a cheap day school my mothers wish was that i should become a sailor like her own father who had been a captain in the navy but the necessary money was not forthcoming to put me into the royal navy and my liking for the sea was not strong enough to take me into the merchant service  from the beginning i wished to be a doctor like my father and grandfather before me for i knew that i was clever and i knew also that successful doctors make a great deal of money ground down as i had been by poverty from babyhood already at nineteen years of age i desired money above everything on earth i saw then and subsequent experience has only confirmed my views that the world as it has become under the pressure of high civilisation is a world for the rich leaving material comforts and advantages out of the question what ambition can a man satisfy without money take the successful politicians for instance and it will be found that almost every one of them is rich this country is too full there is scant room for the individual only intellectual titans can force their heads above the crowd and as a rule they have not even then the money to take them higher if i had my life over againand it is my advice to all young men of ability and ambitioni would leave the old country and settle in america or in one of the great colonies there where the conditions are more elastic and the competition is not so cruel a hardworking man of talent does not need to be endowed with fortune to enable him to rise to the top of the tree  well my desire was to be accomplished for as it chanced a younger brother of my father who during his lifetime had never taken any notice of me died and left me 750 pounds seven hundred and fifty pounds to me at that time it was colossal wealth for it enabled us to rent some rooms in london where i entered myself as a medical student at university college  there is no need for me to dwell upon my college career but if any one were to take the trouble to consult the old records he would find that it was sufficiently brilliant i worked hard and i had a natural perhaps an hereditary liking for the work medicine always fascinated me i think it the greatest of the sciences and from the beginning i was determined that i would be among the greatest of its masters  at four and twenty having finished my curriculum with high honoursi was gold medallist of my year in both medicine and surgeryi became housesurgeon to one of the london hospitals after my term of office was over i remained at the hospital for another year for i wished to make a practical study of my profession in all its branches before starting a private practice at the end of this time my mother died while still comparatively young she had never really recovered from the loss of my father and though it was long about it sorrow sapped her strength at last her loss was a shock to me although in fact we had few tastes in common to divert my mind and also because i was somewhat run down and really needed a change i asked a friend of mine who was a director of a great steamship line running to the west indies and mexico to give me a trip out offering my medicine services in return for the passage this he agreed to do with pleasure moreover matters were so arranged that i could stop in mexico for three months and rejoin the vessel on her next homeward trip  after a very pleasant voyage i reached vera cruz it is a quaint and in some ways a pretty place with its tall coollooking houses and narrow streets not unlike funchal only more tropical whenever i think of it however the first memories that leap to my mind are those of the stench of the open drains and of the scavenger carts going their rounds with the zaphilotes or vultures actually sitting upon them as it happened those carts were very necessary then for a yellow fever epidemic was raging in the place having nothing particular to do i stopped there for three weeks to study it working in the hospitals with the local doctors for i felt no fear of yellow feveronly one contagious disease terrifies me and with that i was soon destined to make acquaintance  at length i arranged to start for the city of mexico to which in those days the journey from vera cruz was performed by diligence as the railway as not yet finished at that time mexico was a wild country wars and revolutions innumerable together with a certain natural leaning that way had reduced a considerable proportion of its inhabitants to the road where they earned a precarious livingnot by mending it but by robbing and occasionally cutting the throats of any travellers whom they could catch  the track from vera cruz to mexico city runs persistently uphill indeed i think the one place is 7000 feet above the level of the other first there is the hot zone where the women by the wayside sell you pineapples and cocoanuts then the temperate zone where they offer you oranges and bananas then the cold country in which you are expected to drink a filthy liquid extracted from aloes called pulque that in taste and appearance resembles soapy water  it was somewhere in the temperate zone that we passed a town consisting of fifteen adobe or mud houses and seventeen churches the excessive religious equipment of this city is accounted for by an almost inaccessible mountain stronghold in the neighbourhood this stronghold for generations had been occupied by brigands and it was the timehonoured custom of each chieftain of the band when he retired on a hardearned competence to expiate any regrettable incidents in his career by building a church in the town dedicated to his patron saint and to the memory of those whose souls he had helped to paradise this pious and picturesque if somewhat mediaeval custom has now come to an end as i understand that the mexican government caused the stronghold to be stormed a good many years ago and put its occupants to the number of several hundreds to the sword  we were eight in the coach which was drawn by as many mulesfour merchants two priests myself and the lady who afterwards became my wife she was a blueeyed and fairhaired american from new york her name i soon discovered was emma becker and her father who was dead had been a lawyer we made friends at once and before we had jolted ten miles on our journey i learned her story it seemed that she was an orphan with a very small fortune and only one near relative an aunt who had married a mexican named gomez the owner of a fine range or hacienda situated on the border of the highlands about eighty miles from the city of mexico on the death of her father being like most american girls adventurous and independent miss becker had accepted an invitation from her aunt gomez and her husband to come and live with them a while now quite alone and unescorted she was on her way to mexico city where she expected to be met by some friends of her uncle  we started from vera cruz about midday and slept or rather passed the night at a filthy inn alive with every sort of insect pest two hours before dawn we were bundled into the diligencia and slowly dragged up a mountain road so steep that notwithstanding the blows and oaths of the drivers the mules had to stop every few hundred yards to rest i remember that at last i fell asleep my head reposing on the shoulder of a very fat priest who snored tempestuously then awoke to pray then snored again it was the voice of miss becker who sat opposite to me that wakened me  forgive me for disturbing you dr therne she said but you really must look and she pointed through the window of the coach  following her hand i saw a sight which no one who has witnessed it can ever forget the sun rising on the mighty peak of orizaba the star mountain as the old aztecs named it eighteen thousand feet above our heads towered the great volcano its foot clothed with forests its cone dusted with snow the green flanks of the peak and the country beneath them were still wrapped in shadow but on its white and lofty crest already the lights of dawn were burning never have i seen anything more beautiful than this soaring mountain top flaming like some giant torch over a world of darkness indeed the unearthly grandeur of the sight amazed and half paralysed my mind  a lantern swung from the roof of the coach and turning my eyes from the mountain in its light i saw the face of my travelling companion andfell in love with it i had seen it before without any such idea entering my mind then it had been to me only the face of a rather piquante and pretty girl but with this strange and inconvenient result the sight of the dawn breaking upon orizaba seemed to have worked some change in me at least if only for an instant it had pierced the barrier that day by day we build within us to protect ourselves from the attack of the impulses of nature  in that moment at any rate there was a look upon this girls countenance and a light shining in her eyes which overcame my caution and swept me out of myself for i think that she too was under the shadow of the glory which broke upon the crest of orizaba in vain did i try to save myself and to struggle back to commonsense since hitherto the prospect of domestic love had played no part in my scheme of life it was useless so i gave it up and our eyes met  neither of us said anything but from that time forward we knew that we did not wish to be parted any more  after a while to relieve a tension of mind which neither of us cared to reveal we drifted into desultory and indifferent conversation in the course of our talk emma told me that her aunt had written to her that if she could leave the coach at orizaba she would be within fifty miles of the hacienda of la concepcion whereas when she reached mexico city she would still be eighty miles from it her aunt had added however that this was not practicable at present why she did not say and that she must go on to mexico where some friends would take charge of her until her uncle was able to fetch her  presently emma seemed to fall asleep at least she shut her eyes but i could not sleep and sat there listening to the snores of the fat priest and the strange interminable oaths of the drivers as they thrashed the mules opposite to me tied to the roof of the coach immediately above emmas head was a cheap lookingglass provided i suppose for the convenience of passengers when making the toilette of travel in it i could see myself reflected so having nothing better to do in view of contingencies which of a sudden had become possible i amused myself by taking count of my personal appearance on the whole in those days it was not unsatisfactory in build i was tall and slight with thin nervous hands my colouring and hair were dark and i had soft and rather large brown eyes the best part of my face was my forehead which was ample and the worst my mouth which was somewhat weak i do not think however that any one would have guessed by looking at me as i then appeared at the age of seven and twenty that i was an exceedingly hardworking man with extraordinary powers of observation and a really retentive memory  at any rate i am sure that it was not these qualities which recommended me to emma becker nor whatever we may have felt under the influences of orizaba was it any spiritual affinity doctors i fear are not great believers in spiritual affinities they know that such emotions can be accounted for in other ways probably emma was attracted to me because i was dark and i to her because she was fair orizaba and opportunity merely brought out and accentuated these quite natural preferences  by now the day had broken and looking out of the window i could see that we were travelling along the side of a mountain above us the slope was gentle and clothed with subtropical trees while below it became a veritable precipice in some places absolutely sheer for the road was cut upon a sort of rocky ledge although owing to the vast billows of mist that filled it nothing could be seen of the gulf beneath  i was reflecting i remember that this would be an ill path to drive with a drunken coachman when suddenly i saw the offfront mule stumble unaccountably and as it fell heard a shot fired close at hand next instant also i saw the driver and his companion spring from the box and with a yell of terror plunge over the edge of the cliff apparently into the depths below then from the narrow compass of that coach arose a perfect pandemonium of sounds with an under cry of a single word brigands brigands  the merchants shouted supplicated their saints and swore as with trembling hands they tried to conceal loose valuables in their boots and hats one of the priests too literally howled in his terror but the other a man of more dignity only bowed his head and murmured a prayer by this time also the mules had tied themselves into a knot and were threatening to overturn the coach to prevent which our captors before meddling with us cut the animals loose with their machetes or swords and drove them over the brink of the abyss where like the drivers they vanished then a duskyfaced ruffian with a scar on his cheek came to the door of the diligence and bowing politely beckoned to us to come out as there were at least a dozen of them and resistance was useless even if our companions could have found the courage to fight we obeyed and were placed before the brigands in a line our backs being set to the edge of the gulf i was last but one in the line and beyond me stood emma becker whose hand i held  then the tragedy began several of the villains seized the first merchant and stopping his cries and protestations with a blow in the mouth stripped him to the shirt abstracting notes and gold and everything else of value that they could find in various portions of his attire where he had hidden them and principally i remember from the lining of his vest when they had done with him they dragged him away and bundled him roughly into the diligence  next to this merchant stood the two priests of the first of these the brigands asked a question to which with some hesitation the priestthat man who had shown so much terrorreplied in the affirmative whereon his companion looked at him contemptuously and muttered a spanish phrase which means man without shame of him also the same question was asked in answer to which he shook his head whereon he was conducted though without violence or being searched to the coach and shut into it with the plundered merchant then the thieves went to work with the next victim  dr therne whispered emma becker you have a pistol do you not  i nodded my head  will you lend it me you understand  yes i answered i understand but i hope that things are not so bad as that  they are she answered with a quiver in her voice i have heard about these mexican brigands with the exception of that priest and myself they will put all of you into the coach and push it over the precipice  at her words my heart stood still and a palpable mist gathered before my eyes when it cleared away my brain seemed to awake to an abnormal activity as though the knowledge that unless it was used to good effect now it would never be used again were spurring it to action rapidly i reviewed the situation and considered every possible method of escape at first i could think of none then suddenly i remembered that the driver and his companion who no doubt knew every inch of the road had leaped from the coach apparently over the edge of the precipice this i felt sure they would not have done had they been going to certain death since they would have preferred to take their chance of mercy at the hands of the brigands moreover these gentry themselves had driven the mules into the abyss whither those wise animals would never have gone unless there was some foothold for them  i looked behind me but could discover nothing for as is common in mexico at the hour of dawn the gulf was absolutely filled with dense vapours then i made up my mind that i would risk it and began to shuffle slowly backwards already i was near the edge when i remembered emma becker and paused to reflect if i took her with me it would considerably lessen my chances of escape and at any rate her life was not threatened but i had not given her the pistol and at that moment even in my panic there rose before me a vision of her face as i had seen it in the lamplight when she looked up at the glory shining on the crest of orizaba  had it not been for this vision i think it possible that i might have left her i wish to gloze over nothing i did not make my own nature and in these pages i describe it as it was and is without palliation or excuse i know that this is not the fashion in autobiographies no one has done it since the time of pepys who did not write for publication and for that very reason my record has its value i am physically and perhaps morally also timidthat is although i have faced it boldly enough upon occasion as the reader will learn in the course of my history i fear the thought of death and especially of cruel and violent death such as was near to me at that moment so much did i fear it then that the mere fact that an acquaintance was in danger and distress would scarcely have sufficed to cause me to sacrifice or at least to greatly complicate my own chances of escape in order to promote hers simply because that acquaintance was of the other sex but emma had touched a new chord in my nature and i felt whether i liked it or not that whatever i could do for myself i must do for her also so i shuffled forward again  listen i whispered i have been to look and i do not believe that the cliff is very steep just here will you try it with me  of course she answered i had as soon die of a broken neck as in any other way  we must watch our chance then or they will see us run and shoot wait till i give you the signal  she nodded her head and we waited  at length while the fourth and last merchant who stood next to me was being dealt with just as in our despair we were about to throw ourselves into the gulf before them all fortune gave us our opportunity this unhappy man having probably some inkling of the doom which awaited him broke suddenly from the hands of his captors and ran at full speed down the road after him they went pellmell every thief of them except one who remainedfortunately for us upon its farther sideon guard by the door of the diligence in which four people three merchants and a priest were now imprisoned with laughs and shouts they hunted their wretched quarry firing shots as they ran till at length one of them overtook the man and cut him down with his machete  dont look but come i whispered to my companion  in another instant we were at the edge of the cliff and a foot or so below us was spread the dense impenetrable blanket of mist i stopped and hesitated for the next step might be my last  we cant be worse off so god help us said emma and without waiting for me to lead her she swung herself over the edge  to my intense relief i heard her alight within a few feet and followed immediately now i was at her side and now we were scrambling and slipping down the precipitous and rocky slope as swiftly as the dense wet fog would let us i believe that our escape was quite unnoticed the guard was watching the murder of the merchant or if he saw us he did not venture to leave the carriage door and the priest who had accepted some offer which was made to him probably that his life would be spared if he consented to give absolution to the murderers was kneeling on the ground his face hidden in his hands  as we went the mist grew thinner and we could see that we were travelling down a steep spur of the precipice which to our left was quite sheer and that at the foot of it was a wide plain thickly but not densely covered with trees in ten minutes we were at the bottom and as we could neither see nor hear any sign of pursuers we paused for an instant to rest  not five yards from us the cliff was broken away and so straight that a cat could not have climbed it  we chose our place well i said pointing upwards  no emma answered we did not choose it was chosen for us  as she spoke a muffled and terrifying sound of agony reached us from above and then in the layers of vapour that still stretched between us and the sky we perceived something huge rushing swiftly down it appeared it drew near it struck and fell to pieces like a shattered glass we ran to look and there before us were the fragments of the diligence and among them the mangled corpses of five of our fellowtravellers  this was the fate that we had escaped    oh for gods sake come away moaned emma and sick with horror we turned and ran or rather reeled into the shelter of the trees upon the plain    chapter ii  the hacienda  what are those said emma presently pointing to some animals that were half hidden by a clump of wild bananas i looked and saw that they were two of the mules which the brigands had cut loose from the diligence there could be no mistake about this for the harness still hung to them  can you ride i asked  she nodded her head then we set to work having caught the mules without difficulty i took off their superfluous harness and put her on the back of one of them mounting the other myself there was no time to lose and we both of us knew it just as we were starting i heard a voice behind me calling senor drawing the pistol from my pocket i swung round to find myself confronted by a mexican  no shoot senor he said in broken english for this man had served upon an american ship me driver antonio my mate go down there and he pointed to the precipice he dead me not hurt you run from bad men me run too for presently they come look where you go  to mexico i answered  no get mexico senor bad men watch road and kill you with machete so and he made a sweep with his knife adding they not want you live tell soldiers  listen said emma do you know the hacienda concepcion by the town of san jose  yes senora know it well the hacienda of senor gomez bring you there tomorrow  then show the way i said and we started towards the hills  all that day we travelled over mountains as fast as the mules could carry us antonio trotting by our side at sundown having seen nothing more of the brigands who i suppose took it for granted that we were dead or were too idle to follow us far we reached an indian hut where we contrived to buy some wretched food consisting of black frijole beans and tortilla cakes that night we slept in a kind of hovel made of open poles with a roof of faggots through which the water dropped on us for it rained persistently for several hours to be more accurate emma slept for my nerves were too shattered by the recollection of our adventure with the brigands to allow me to close my eyes  i could not rid my mind of the vision of that coach broken like an eggshell and of those shattered shapes within it that this very morning had been men full of life and plans but who tonight werewhat nor was it easy to forget that but for the merest chance i might have been one of their company wherever it was gathered now to a man with a constitutional objection to every form of violence and at any rate in those days no desire to search out the secrets of death before his time the thought was horrible  leaving the shelter at dawn i found antonio and the indian who owned the hut conversing together in the reeking mist with their serapes thrown across their mouths which few mexicans leave uncovered until after the sun is up inflammation of the lungs is the disease they dread more than any other and the thin night air engenders it  what is it antonio i asked are the brigands after us  no senor hope brigands not come now this senor say much sick san jose  i answered that i was very sorry to hear it but that i meant to go on indeed i think that it was only terror of the brigands coupled with the promise of a considerable reward which persuaded him to do so though owing to my ignorance of spanish and his very slight knowledge of english precisely what he feared i could not discover in the end we started and towards evening antonio pointed out to us the hacienda of concepcion a large white building standing on a hill which overshadowed san jose a straggling little place halftown halfvillage with a population of about 3000 inhabitants  just as riding along the rough cobblepaved road we reached the entrance to the town i heard shouts and turning saw two mounted men with rifles in their hands apparently calling to us to come back taking it for granted that these were the brigands following us up although as i afterwards discovered they were in fact rurales or cavalrypolice despite the remonstrances of antonio i urged the jaded mules forward at a gallop thereupon the rurales who had pulled up at a spot marked by a white stone turned and rode away  we were now passing down the central street of the town which i noticed seemed very deserted as we drew near to the plaza or market square we met a cart drawn by two mules and led by a man who had a serape wrapped about his nose and mouth as though it were still the hour before the dawn over the contents of this cart a black cloth was thrown beneath which were outlined shapes that suggestedbut no it could not be only why did antonio cross himself and mutter muerte or some such word  now we were in the plaza this plaza where in happier times the band would play for all mexicans are musical and the population of san jose was wont to traffic in the day and enjoy itself at night was bordered by an arched colonnade in its centre stood a basin of water flowing from a stone fountain of quaint and charming design  look at all those people sleeping said emma as we passed five or six forms that very small and quiet lay each under a blanket beneath one of the arches why there are a lot more just lying down over there what funny folk to go to bed in public in the afternoon and she pointed to a number of men women and children who seemed to be getting up throwing themselves down and turning round and round upon mattresses and beds of leaves in the shadow of the arcade which we approached  presently we were within three paces of this arcade and as we rode up an aged hag drew a blanket from one of the prostrate forms revealing a young woman over whom she proceeded to pour water that she had drawn from a fountain one glance was enough for me the poor creatures face was shapeless with confluent smallpox and her body a sight which i will not describe i who was a doctor could not be mistaken although as it chanced i had never seen a case of smallpox before the truth is that although i have no fear of any other human ailment smallpox has always terrified me  for this i am not to blame the fear is a part of my nature instilled into it doubtless by the shock which my mother received before my birth when she learned that her husband had been attacked by this horrible sickness so great and vivid was my dread that i refused a very good appointment at a smallpox hospital and although i had several opportunities of attending these cases i declined to undertake them and on this account suffered somewhat in reputation among those who knew the facts indeed my natural abhorrence went even further as to this day it is only with something of an effort that i can bring myself to inspect the vesicles caused by vaccination whether this is because of their similarity to those of smallpox or owing to the natural association which exists between them i cannot tell that it is real enough however may be judged by the fact that terrified as i was at smallpox and convinced as i have always been of the prophylactic power of vaccination i could never force myselfuntil an occasion to be told ofto submit to it in infancy no doubt i was vaccinated for the operation has left a small and very faint cicatrix on my arm but infantile vaccination if unrepeated is but a feeble protection in later life  unconsciously i pulled upon the bridle and the tired mule stopped malignant smallpox i muttered and that fool is trying to treat it with cold water        readers of prescott may remember that when this terrible      disease was first introduced by a negro slave of navaez and      killed out millions of the population of mexico the      unfortunate aztecs tried to treat it with cold water oddly      enough when some years ago the writer was travelling in a      part of mexico where smallpox was prevalent it came to his      notice that this system is still followed among the indians      as they allege with good results  the old woman looked up and saw me si senor inglese she said with a ghastly smile viruela viruela and she went on gabbling something which i could not understand  she say broke in antonio nearly quarter people dead and plenty sick  for heavens sake let us get out of this i said to emma who seated on the other mule was staring horrorstruck at the sight  oh she said you are a doctor cant you help the poor things  what and leave you to shift for yourself  never mind me dr therne i can go on to the hacienda or if you like i will stay too i am not afraid i was revaccinated last year  dont be foolish i answered roughly i could not dream of exposing you to such risks also it is impossible for me to do any good here alone and without medicines come on at once and seizing her mule by the bridle i led it along the road that ran through the town towards the hacienda on the height above  ten minutes later we were riding in the great courtyard the place seemed strangely lifeless and silent indeed the plaintive mewing of a cat was the only sound to be heard presently however a dog appeared out of an open doorway it was a large animal of the mastiff breed such as might have been expected to bark and become aggressive to strangers but this it did not do indeed it ran forward and greeted us affectionately we dismounted and knocked at the double door but no one answered finally we entered and the truth became clear to usthe hacienda was deserted a little burial ground attached to the chapel told us why for in it were several freshlymade graves evidently of peons or other servants and in an enclosure where lay interred some departed members of the gomez family another unsodded mound we discovered afterwards that it was that of the senor gomez emmas uncle by marriage  the footsteps of smallpox i said pointing to the graves we must go on  emma was too overcome to object for she believed that it was her aunt who slept beneath that mound so once more we mounted the weary mules but we did not get far within half a mile of the hacienda we were met by two armed rurales who told us plainly that if we attempted to go further they would shoot  then we understood we had penetrated a smallpox cordon and must stop in it until forty days after the last traces of the disease had vanished this in a wild part of mexico where at that time vaccination was but little practised and medical assistance almost entirely lacking would not be until half or more of the unprotected population was dead and many of the remainder were blinded deafened or disfigured  back we crept to the deserted hacienda and there in this hideous nest of smallpox we took up our quarters choosing out of the many in the great pile sleeping rooms that had evidently not been used for months or years food we did not lack for sheep and goats were straying about untended while in the garden we found fruit and vegetables in plenty and in the pantries flour and other stores  at first emma was dazed and crushed by fatigue and emotion but she recovered her spirits after a nights sleep and on learning from antonio who was told it by some peon that it was not her aunt that the smallpox had killed but her uncle by marriage whom she had never seen having no fear of the disease indeed she became quite resigned and calm for the strangeness and novelty of the position absorbed and interested her also to my alarm it excited her philanthropic instincts her great idea being to turn the hacienda into a convalescent smallpox hospital of which she was to be the nurse and i the doctor indeed she refused to abandon this mad scheme until i pointed out that in the event of any of our patients dying most probably we should both be murdered for wizards with the evil eye as a matter of fact without medicine or assistance we could have done little or nothing  oh what a pestilence was that of which for three weeks or so we were the daily witnesses for from the flat roof of the hacienda we could see straight on to the plaza of the little town and when at night we could not see still we could hear the wails of the dying and bereaved the eternal clang of the church bells rung to scare away the demon of disease and the midnight masses chanted by the priests that grew faint and fainter as their brotherhood dwindled until at last they ceased and so it went on in the tainted stricken place until the living were not enough to bury the dead or to do more than carry food and water to the sick  it would seem that about twelve years before a philanthropic american enthusiast armed with a letter of recommendation from whoever at that date was president of mexico and escorted by a small guard descended upon san jose to vaccinate it for a few days all went well for the enthusiast was a good doctor who understood how to treat ophthalmia and to operate for squint both of which complaints were prevalent in san jose then his first vaccination patients developed vesicles and the trouble began the end of the matter was that the local priests a very ignorant class of men interfered declaring that smallpox was a trial sent from heaven which it was impious to combat and that in any case vaccination was the worse disease of the two  as the viruela had scarcely visited san jose within the memory of man and the vesicles looked alarming the population true children of the church agreed with their pastors and from purely religious motives hooted and stoned the philanthropic americano and his guard out of the district now they and their innocent children were reaping the fruits of the piety of these conscientious objectors  after the first fortnight this existence in an atmosphere of disease became absolutely terrible to me not an hour of the day passed that i did not imagine some symptom of smallpox and every morning when we met at breakfast i glanced at emma with anxiety the shadow of the thing lay deep upon my nerves and i knew well that if i stopped there much longer i should fall a victim to it in the body in this emergency by means of antonio i opened negotiations with the officer of the rurales and finally after much secret bargaining it was arranged that in consideration of a sum of two hundred dollarsfor by good luck i had escaped from the brigands with my moneyour flight through the cordon of guards should not be observed in the darkness  we were to start at nine oclock on a certain night at a quarter to that hour i went to the stable to see that everything was ready and in the courtyard outside of it found antonio seated against the water tank groaning and writhing with pains in the back one looked showed me that he had developed the usual symptoms so feeling that no time was to be lost i saddled the mules myself and took them round  where is antonio asked emma as she mounted  he has gone on ahead i answered to be sure that the road is clear he will meet us beyond the mountains  poor antonio i wonder what became of him he was a good fellow and i hope that he recovered it grieved me much to leave him but after all i had my own safety to think of and still more that of emma who had grown very dear to me perhaps one day i shall find him beyond the mountains but if so that is a meeting from which i expect no joy  the rest of our journey was strange enough but it has nothing to do with this history indeed i have only touched upon these long past adventures in a far land because they illustrate the curious fatality by the workings of which every important event of my life has taken place under the dreadful shadow of smallpox i was born under that shadow i wedded under it ibut the rest shall be told in its proper order    in the end we reached mexico city in safety and there emma and i were married ten days later we were on board ship steaming for england    chapter iii  sir john bell  now it is that i came to the great and terrible event of my life which in its result turned me into a false witness and a fraud and bound upon my spirit a weight of bloodguiltiness greater than a man is often called upon to bear as i have not scrupled to show i have constitutional weaknessesmore i am a sinner i know it i have sinned against the code of my profession and have preached a doctrine i knew to be false using all my skill and knowledge to confuse and pervert the minds of the ignorant and yet i am not altogether responsible for these sins which in truth in the first place were forced upon me by shame and want and afterwards by the necessities of my ambition indeed in that dark and desperate road of deceit there is no room to turn the step once taken can never be retraced  but if i have sinned how much greater is the crime of the man who swore away my honour and forced me through those gateways surely on his head and not on mine should rest the burden of my deeds yet he prospered all his life and i have been told that his death was happy and painless this mans career furnishes one of the few arguments that to my sceptical mind suggest the existence of a place of future reward and punishment for how is it possible that so great a villain should reap no fruit from his rich sowing of villainy if it is possible then verily this world is the real hell wherein the wicked are lords and the good their helpless and hopeless slaves    emma becker when she became my wife brought with her a small dowry of about five thousand dollars or a thousand pounds and this sum we both agreed would be best spent in starting me in professional life it was scarcely sufficient to enable me to buy a practice of the class which i desired so i determined that i would set to work to build one up as with my ability and record i was certain that i could do by preference i should have wished to begin in london but there the avenue to success is choked and i had not the means to wait until by skill and hard work i could force my way along it  london being out of the question i made up my mind to try my fortune in the ancient city of dunchester where the name of therne was still remembered as my grandfather and father had practised there before me i journeyed to the place and made inquiries to find that although there were plenty of medical men of a sort there was only one whose competition i had cause to fear of the others some had no presence some no skill and some no character indeed one of them was known to drink  with sir john bell whose good fortune it was to be knighted in recognition of his attendance upon a royal duchess who chanced to contract the measles while staying in the town the case was different he began life as assistant to my father and when his health failed purchased the practice from him for a miserable sum which as he was practically in possession my father was obliged to accept from that time forward his success met with no check by no means a master of his art sir john supplied with assurance what he lacked in knowledge and atoned for his mistakes by the readiness of a bluff and oldfashioned sympathy that was transparent to few  in short if ever a faux bonhomme existed sir john bell was the man needless to say he was as popular as he was prosperous such of the practice of dunchester as was worth having soon fell into his hands and few indeed were the guineas that slipped out of his fingers into the pocket of a poorer brother also he had a large consulting connection in the county but if his earnings were great so were his spendings for it was part of his system to accept civic and magisterial offices and to entertain largely in his official capacities this meant that the money went out as fast as it came in and that however much was earned more was always needed  when i visited dunchester to make inquiries i made a point of calling on sir john who received me in his best heavyfather manner taking care to inform me that he was keeping lord soandso waiting in his consultingroom in order to give me audience going straight to the point i told him that i thought of starting to practise in dunchester which information i could see pleased him little  of course my dear boy he said you being your fathers son i should be delighted and would do everything in my power to help you but at the same time i must point out that were galen or jenner or harvey to reappear on earth i doubt if they could make a decent living in dunchester  all the same i mean to have a try sir john i answered cheerfully i suppose you do not want an assistant do you  let me see i think you said you were married did you not  yes i answered well knowing that sir john having disposed of his elder daughter to an incompetent person of our profession who had become the plague of his life was desirous of putting the second to better use  no my dear boy no i have an assistant already and he sighed this time with genuine emotion if you come here you will have to stand upon your own legs  quite so sir john but i shall still hope for a few crumbs from the masters table  yes yes therne in anything of that sort you may rely upon me and he bowed me out with an effusive smile   to poison the crumbs i thought to myself for i was never for one moment deceived as to this mans character    a fortnight later emma and i came to dunchester and took up our abode in a quaint redbrick house of the queen anne period which we hired for a not extravagant rent of 80 pounds a year although the position of this house was not fashionable nothing could have been more suitable from a doctors point of view as it stood in a little street near the marketplace and absolutely in the centre of the city moreover it had two beautiful reception chambers on the ground floor oakpanelled and with carved adams mantelpieces which made excellent waitingrooms for patients some time passed however and our thousand pounds in which the expense of furnishing had made a considerable hole was melting rapidly before those rooms were put to a practical use both i and my wife did all that we could to get practice we called upon people who had been friends of my father and grandfather we attended missionary and other meetings of a nonpolitical character regardless of expense we went so far as to ask old ladies to tea  they came they drank the tea and inspected the new furniture one of them even desired to see my instruments and when fearing to give offence i complied and produced them she remarked that they were not nearly so nice as dear sir johns which had ivory handles cheerfully would i have shown her that if the handles were inferior the steel was quite serviceable but i swallowed my wrath and solemnly explained that it was not medical etiquette for a young doctor to use ivory  beginning to despair i applied for one or two minor appointments in answer to advertisements inserted by the board of guardians and other public bodies in each case was i not only unsuccessful but men equally unknown though with a greatly inferior college and hospital record were chosen over my head at length suspecting that i was not being fairly dealt by i made inquiries to discover that at the bottom of all this ill success was none other than sir john bell it appeared that in several instances by the shrugs of his thick shoulders and shakes of his ponderous head he had prevented my being employed indeed in the case of the public bodies with all of which he had authority either as an official or as an honorary adviser he had directly vetoed my appointment by the oracular announcement that after ample inquiry among medical friends in london he had satisfied himself that i was not a suitable person for the post  when i had heard this and convinced myself that it was substantially truefor i was always too cautious to accept the loose and unsifted gossip of a provincial towni think that for the first time in my life i experienced the passion of hate towards a human being why should this man who was so rich and powerful thus devote his energies to the destruction of a brother practitioner who was struggling and poor at the time i set it down to pure malice into which without doubt it blossomed at last not understanding that in the first place on sir johns part it was in truth terror born of his own conscious mediocrity like most inferior men he was quick to recognise his master and either in the course of our conversations or through inquiries that he made concerning me he had come to the conclusion that so far as professional ability was concerned i was his master therefore being a creature of petty and dishonest mind he determined to crush me before i could assert myself  now having ascertained all this beyond reasonable doubt there were three courses open to me to make a public attack upon sir john to go away and try my fortune elsewhere or to sit still and await events a more impetuous man would have adopted the first of these alternatives but my experience of life confirmed as it was by the advice of emma who was a shrewd and farseeing woman soon convinced me that if i did so i should have no more chance of success than would an egg which undertook a crusade against a brick wall doubtless the egg might stain the wall and gather the flies of gossip about its stain but the end of it must be that the wall would still stand whereas the egg would no longer be an egg the second plan had more attractions but my resources were now too low to allow me to put it into practice therefore having no other choice i was forced to adopt the third and exercising that divine patience which characterises the eastern nations but is so lacking in our own to attend humbly upon fate until it should please it to deal to me a card that i could play  in time fate dealt to me that card and my long suffering was rewarded for it proved a very ace of trumps it happened thus  about a year after i arrived in dunchester i was elected a member of the city club it is a pleasant place where ladies are admitted to lunch and i used it a good deal in the hope of making acquaintances who might be useful to me among the habitues of this club was a certain major selby who having retired from the army and being without occupation was generally to be found in the smoking or billiard room with a large cigar between his teeth and a whisky and soda at his side in face the major was florid and what people call healthylooking an appearance that to a doctors eye very often conveys no assurance of physical wellbeing being a genialmannered man he would fall into conversation with whoever might be near to him and thus i came to be slightly acquainted with him in the course of our chats he frequently mentioned his ailments which as might be expected in the case of such a luxurious liver were gouty in their origin  one afternoon when i was sitting alone in the smokingroom major selby came in and limped to an armchair  hullo major have you got the gout again i asked jocosely  no doctor at least that pompous old beggar bell says i havent my leg has been so confoundedly painful and stiff for the last few days that i went to see him this morning but he told me that it was only a touch of rheumatism and gave me some stuff to rub it with  oh and did he look at your leg  not he he says that he can tell what my ailments are with the width of the street between us  indeed i said and some other men coming in the matter dropped  four days later i was in the club at the same hour and again major selby entered this time he walked with considerable difficulty and i noticed an expression of pain and malaise upon his rubicund countenance he ordered a whisky and soda from the servant and then sat down near me  rheumatism no better major i asked  no i went to see old bell about it again yesterday but he poohpoohs it and tells me to go on rubbing in the liniment and get the footman to help when i am tired well i obeyed orders but it hasnt done me much good and how the deuce rheumatism can give a fellow a bruise on the leg i dont know  a bruise on the leg i said astonished  yes a bruise on the leg and if you dont believe me look here and dragging up his trouser he showed me below the knee a large inflamed patch of a dusky hue in the centre of which one of the veins could be felt to be hard and swollen  has sir john bell seen that i asked  not he i wanted him to look at it but he was in a hurry and said i was just like an old woman with a sore on show so i gave it up  well if i were you id go home and insist upon his coming to look at it  what do you mean doctor he asked growing alarmed at my manner  oh it is a nasty place that is all and i think that when sir john has seen it he will tell you to keep quiet for a few days  major selby muttered something uncomplimentary about sir john and then asked me if i would come home with him  i cant do that as a matter of medical etiquette but ill see you into a cab no i dont think i should drink that whisky if i were you you want to keep yourself cool and quiet  so major selby departed in his cab and i went home and having nothing better to do turned up my notes on various cases of venous thrombosis or bloodclot in the veins which i had treated at one time or another  while i was still reading them there came a violent ring at the bell followed by the appearance of a very agitated footman who gasped out  please sir come to my master major selby he has been taken ill  i cant my good man i answered sir john bell is his doctor  i have been to sir johns sir but he has gone away for two days to attend a patient in the country and the major told me to come for you  then i hesitated no longer as we hurried to the house which was close at hand the footman told me that the major on reaching home took a cup of tea and sent for a cab to take him to sir john bell as he was in the act of getting into the cab suddenly he fell backwards and was picked up panting for breath and carried into the diningroom by this time we had reached the house of which the door was opened as we approached it by mrs selby herself who seemed in great distress  dont talk now but take me to your husband i said and was led into the diningroom where the unfortunate man lay groaning on the sofa  glad youve come he gasped i believe that fool bell has done for me  asking those present in the room a brother and a grownup son of the patient to stand back i made a rapid examination then i wrote a prescription and sent it round to the chemistit contained ammonia i rememberand ordered hot fomentations to be placed upon the leg while these matters were being attended to i went with the relations into another room  what is the matter with him doctor asked mrs selby  it is i think a case of what is called bloodclot which has formed in the veins of the leg i answered part of this clot has been detached by exertion or possibly by rubbing and travelling upwards has become impacted in one of the pulmonary arteries  is it serious asked the poor wife  of course we must hope for the best i said but it is my duty to tell you that i do not myself think major selby will recover how long he will last depends upon the size of the clot which has got into the artery  oh this is ridiculous broke in mr selby my brother has been under the care of sir john bell the ablest doctor in dunchester who told him several times that he was suffering from nothing but rheumatism and now this gentleman starts a totally different theory which if it were true would prove sir john to be a most careless and incompetent person  i am very sorry i answered i can only hope that sir john is right and i am wrong so that there may be no subsequent doubt as to what i have said with your leave i will write down my diagnosis and give it to you  when this was done i returned to the patient and mr selby taking my diagnosis telegraphed the substance of it to sir john bell for his opinion in due course the answer arrived from sir john regretting that there was no train by which he could reach dunchester that night giving the name of another doctor who was to be called in and adding incautiously enough dr thernes diagnosis is purely theoretical and such as might be expected from an inexperienced man  meanwhile the unfortunate major was dying he remained conscious to the last and in spite of everything that i could do suffered great pain amongst other things he gave an order that a postmortem examination should be made to ascertain the cause of his death  when mr selby had read the telegram from sir john he handed it to me saying it is only fair that you should see this  i read it and having asked for and obtained a copy awaited the arrival of the other doctor before taking my departure when at length he came major selby was dead  two days later the postmortem was held there were present at it sir john bell myself and the third medico dr jeffries it is unnecessary to go into details but in the issue i was proved to be absolutely right had sir john taken the most ordinary care and precaution his patient need not have diedindeed his death was caused by the treatment the rubbing of the leg detached a portion of the clot that might easily have been dissolved by rest and local applications as it was it went to his lung and he died  when he saw how things were going sir john tried to minimise matters but unfortunately for him i had my written diagnosis and a copy of his telegram documents from which he could not escape nor could he deny the results of the postmortem which took place in the presence and with the assistance of the third practitioner a sound and independent though not a very successful man  when everything was over there was something of a scene sir john asserted that my conduct had been impertinent and unprofessional i replied that i had only done my duty and appealed to dr jeffries who remarked drily that we had to deal not with opinions and theories but with facts and that the facts seemed to bear me out on learning the truth the relatives who until now had been against me turned upon sir john and reproached him in strong terms after which they went away leaving us face to face there was an awkward silence which i broke by saying that i was sorry to have been the unwilling cause of this unpleasantness  you may well be sorry sir sir john answered in a cold voice that was yet alive with anger seeing that by your action you have exposed me to insult i who have practised in this city for over thirty years and who was your fathers partner before you were in your cradle well it is natural to youth to be impertinent today the laugh is yours dr therne tomorrow it may be mine so goodafternoon and let us say no more about it and brushing by me rudely he passed from the house  i followed him into the street watching his thick square form of which even the back seemed to express sullen anger and determination at a distance of a few yards stood the brother of the dead man mr selby talking to dr jeffries one of whom made some remark that caught sir johns ear he stopped as though to answer then changing his mind turned his head and looked back at me my sight is good and i could see his face clearly on it was a look of malignity that was not pleasant to behold  i have made a bad enemy i thought to myself well i am in the right one must take risks in life and it is better to be hated than despised  major selby was a wellknown and popular man whose sudden death had excited much sympathy and local interest which were intensified when the circumstances connected with it became public property  on the following day the leading city paper published a report of the results of the postmortem which doubtless had been furnished by the relatives and with it an editorial note  in this paragraph i was spoken of in very complimentary terms my medical distinctions were alluded to and the confident belief was expressed that dunchester would not be slow to avail itself of my skill and talent sir john bell was not so lightly handled his gross error of treatment in the case of the deceased was it is true slurred over but some sarcastic and disparaging remarks were aimed at him under cover of comparison between the old and the new school of medical practitioners    chapter iv  stephen strong goes bail  great are the uses of advertisement when i went into my consultingroom after breakfast that day i found three patients waiting to see me one of them a member of a leading family in the city  here was the beginning of my success whatever time may remain to me today in a sense my life is finished i am a brokenhearted and discomfited man with little more to fear and nothing to hope therefore i may be believed when i say that in these pages i set down the truth and nothing but the truth not attempting to palliate my conduct where it has been wrong nor to praise myself even when praise may have been due perhaps then it will not be counted conceit when i write that in my best days i was really a master of my trade to my faculty for diagnosis i have i think alluded it amounted to a gifta touch or two of my fingers would often tell me what other doctors could not discover by prolonged examination to this i added a considerable mastery of the details of my profession and a sympathetic insight into character which enabled me to apply my knowledge to the best advantage  when a patient came to me and told me that his symptoms were this or that or the other i began by studying the man and forming my own conclusions as to his temperament character and probable past it was this method of mine of studying the individual as a whole and his ailment as something springing from and natural to his physical and spiritual entity that so far as general principles can be applied to particular instances often gave me a grip of the evil and enabled me by dealing with the generating cause to strike at its immediate manifestation my axiom was that in the human subject mind is king the mind commands the body obeys from this follows the corollary that the really great doctor however trivial the complaint should always begin by trying to understand the mind of his patient to follow the course of its workings and estimate their results upon his physical nature  necessarily there are many cases to which this rule does not seem to apply those of contagious sickness for instance or those of surgery resulting from accident and yet even there it does apply for the condition of the mind may predispose to infection and to recovery or collapse in the instance of the sufferer from injuries but these questions of predisposition and consequence are too great to argue here though even the most ruleofthumb village practitioner with a black draught in one hand and a pot of ointment in the other will agree that they admit of a wide application  at least it is to these primary principles over and above my technical skill that i attribute my success while i was successful that at any rate was undoubted day by day my practice grew to such an extent indeed that on making up my books at the end of the second year i found that during the preceding twelve months i had taken over 900 pounds in fees and was owed about 300 pounds more most of this balance however i wrote off as a bad debt since i made it a custom never to refuse a patient merely because he might not be able to pay me i charged large fees for a doctor gains nothing by being cheap but if i thought it inexpedient i did not attempt to collect them  after this matter of the inquest on major selby the relations between sir john bell and myself were very strainedin fact for a while he refused to meet me in consultation when this happened without attempting to criticise his action i always insisted upon retiring from the case saying that it was not for me a young man to stand in the path of one of so great experience and reputation as might be expected this moderation resulted in my triumph for the time came when sir john thought it wise to waive his objections and to recognise me professionally then i knew that i had won the day for in that equal field i was his master never once that i can remember did he venture to reverse or even to cavil at my treatment at any rate in my presence though doubtless he criticised it freely elsewhere  and so i flourished and as i waxed he waned until calculating my chances with my wife i was able to prophesy that if no accident or illchance occurred to stop me within another three years i should be the leading practitioner in dunchester while sir john bell would occupy the second place  but i had reckoned without his malice for although i knew this to be inveterate i had underrated its probable effects and in due course the illchance happened it came about in this wise  when we had been married something over two years my wife found herself expecting to become a mother as the event drew near she expressed great anxiety that i should attend upon her to this however i objected strenuouslyfirst because i cannot bear to see any one to whom i am attached suffer pain and secondly because i knew that my affection and personal anxiety would certainly unnerve me except in cases of the utmost necessity no man in my opinion should doctor himself or his family whilst i was wondering how to arrange matters i chanced to meet sir john bell in consultation after our business was over developing an unusual geniality of manner he proposed to walk a little way with me  i understand my dear therne he said that there is an interesting event expected in your family  i replied that this was so  well he went on though we may differ on some points i am sure there is one upon which we shall agreethat no man should doctor his own flesh and blood now look here i want you to let me attend upon your good wife however much you goahead young fellows may turn up your noses at us old fossils i think you will admit that by this time i ought to be able to show a baby into the world especially as i had the honour of performing that office for yourself my young friend  for a moment i hesitated what sir john said was quite true he was a sound and skilful obstetrician of the old school moreover he evidently intended to hold out the olive branch by this kind offer which i felt that i ought to accept already having conquered in the fray i forgave him the injuries that he had worked me it is not in my nature to bear unnecessary maliceindeed i hate making or having an enemy and yet i hesitated not from any premonition or presentiment of the dreadful events that were to follow but simply because of my wifes objection to being attended by any one but myself i thought of advancing this in excuse of a refusal but checked myself because i was sure that he would interpret it as a rebuff and in consequence hate me more bitterly than ever so in the end i accepted his offer gratefully and we parted  when i told emma she was a little upset but being a sensible woman she soon saw the force of my arguments and fell in with the situation in truth unselfish creature that she was she thought more of the advantage that would accrue to me by this formal burying of the hatchet than of her own prejudices or convenience  the time came and with it sir john bell large sharpeyed and jocose in due course and under favourable conditions a daughter was born to me a very beautiful child fair like her mother but with my dark eyes  i think it was on the fourth day from the birth of the child that i went after luncheon to see my wife who so far had done exceedingly well i found her depressed and she complained of headache just then the servant arrived saying that i was wanted in the consultingroom so i kissed emma and after arranging her bedclothing and turning her over so that she might lie more comfortably i hurried downstairs telling her that she had better go to sleep  while i was engaged with my visitor sir john bell came to see my wife just as the patient had gone and sir john was descending the stairs a messenger hurried in with a note summoning me instantly to attend upon lady colford the wife of a rich banker and baronet who i knew was expecting her first confinement seizing my bag i started and as i reached the front door i thought that i heard sir john who was now nearly at the foot of the stairs call out something to me i answered that i couldnt stop but would see him later to which i understood him to reply all right  this was about three oclock in the afternoon but so protracted and anxious was the case of lady colford that i did not reach home again till eight having swallowed a little food for i was thoroughly exhausted i went upstairs to see my wife entering the room softly i found that she was asleep and that the nurse also was dozing on the sofa in the dressingroom fearing to disturb them i kissed her lips and going downstairs returned at once to sir thomas colfords house where i spent the entire night in attendance on his wife  when i came home again about eight oclock on the following morning it was to find sir john bell awaiting me in the consultingroom a glance at his face told me that there was something dreadfully wrong  what is it i asked  what is it why what i called after you yesterday only you wouldnt stop to listen and i havent known where to find you since its puerperal fever and heaven knows what gave it to her for i dont i thought so yesterday and this morning i am sure of it  puerperal fever i muttered then i am ruined whatever happens to emma  dont talk like that man answered sir john she has a capital constitution and i daresay we shall pull her through  you dont understand i have been attending lady colford going straight from emmas room to her  sir john whistled oh indeed certainly thats awkward well we must hope for the best and look you here when a fellow calls out to you another time just you stop to listen  to dwell on all that followed would serve no good purpose and indeed what is the use of setting down the details of so much forgotten misery in a week my beloved wife was dead and in ten days lady colford had followed her into the darkness then it was that to complete my own destruction i committed an act of folly for meeting sir john bell in my mad grief i was fool enough to tell him i knew that my wifes death and indirectly that of lady colford were due to his improper treatment and neglect of precautions  i need not enter into the particulars but this in fact was the case  he did not say much in answer to my accusation but merely replied  i make allowances for you but dr therne it is time that somebody taught you that peoples reputations cannot be slandered with impunity instead of attacking me i should recommend you to think of defending yourself  very soon i learned the meaning of this hint i think it was within a week of my wifes funeral that i heard that sir thomas colford together with all his relations and those of the deceased lady were absolutely furious with me awaking from my stupor of grief i wrote a letter to sir thomas expressing my deep regret at the misfortune that i had been the innocent means of bringing upon him to this letter i received a reply by hand scrawled upon half a sheet of notepaper it ran   sir thomas colford is surprised that dr therne should think it worth while to add falsehood to murder   then for the first time i understood in what light my terrible misfortune was regarded by the public a few days later i received further enlightenment this time from the lips of an inspector of police who called upon me with a warrant of arrest on the charge of having done manslaughter on the body of dame blanche colford  that night i spent in dunchester jail and next morning i was brought before the bench of magistrates who held a special session to try my case the chairman whom i knew well very kindly asked me if i did not wish for legal assistance i replied no i have nothing to defend which he seemed to think a hard saying at any rate he looked surprised on the other side counsel were employed nominally on behalf of the crown although in reality the prosecution which in such a case was unusual if not unprecedented had been set on foot and undertaken by the colford family  the information was read by the clerk in which i was charged with culpable negligence and wilfully doing certain things that caused the death of blanche colford i stood there in the dock listening and wondering what possible evidence could be adduced against me in support of such a charge after the formal witnesses relations and doctors who testified to my being called in to attend on lady colford to the course of the illness and the cause of death etc sir john bell was called now i thought to myself this farce will come to an end for bell will explain the facts  the counsel for the prosecution began by asking sir john various questions concerning the terrible malady known as puerperal fever and especially with reference to its contagiousness then he passed on to the events of the day when i was called in to attend upon lady colford sir john described how he had visited my late wife and from various symptoms which she had developed somewhat suddenly to his grief and surprise had come to the conclusion that she had fallen victim to puerperal fever this evidence to begin with was not true for although he suspected the ailment on that afternoon he was not sure of it until the following morning  what happened then sir john asked the counsel  leaving my patient i hurried downstairs to see dr therne and found him just stepping from his consultingroom into the hall  did he speak to you  yes he said how do you do and then added before i could tell him about his wife i am rather in luck today they are calling me in to take lady colfords case i said i was glad to hear it but that i thought he had better let some one else attend her ladyship he looked astonished and asked why i said because my dear fellow i am afraid that your wife has developed puerperal fever and the nurse tells me that you were in her room not long ago he replied that it was impossible as he had looked at her and thought her all right except for a little headache i said that i trusted that i might be wrong but if nearly forty years experience went for anything i was not wrong then he flew into a passion and said that if anything was the matter with his wife it was my fault as i must have brought the contagion or neglected to take the usual antiseptic precautions i told him that he should not make such statements without an atom of proof but interrupting me he declared that fever or no fever he would attend upon lady colford as he could not afford to throw away the best chance he had ever had i said my dear fellow dont be mad why if anything happened to her under the circumstances i believe that after i have warned you you would be liable to be criminally prosecuted for culpable negligence thank you he answered nothing will happen to her i know my own business and i will take the chance of that and then before i could speak again lifting up his bag from the chair on which he had placed it he opened the front door and went out  i will not attempt especially after this lapse of years to describe the feelings with which i listened to this amazing evidence the black wickedness and the coldblooded treachery of the man overwhelmed and paralysed me so that when after some further testimony the chairman asked me if i had any questions to put to the witness i could only stammer  it is a lie an infamous lie  no no said the chairman kindly if you wish to make a statement you will have an opportunity of doing so presently have you any questions to ask the witness  i shook my head how could i question him on such falsehoods then came the nurse who amidst a mass of other information calmly swore that standing on the second landing whither she had accompanied sir john from his patients room she heard a lengthy conversation proceeding between him and me and caught the words i will take the chance of that spoken in my voice  again i had no questions to ask but i remembered that this nurse was a person who for a long while had been employed by sir john bell and one over whom he very probably had some hold  then i was asked if i had any witness but now that my wife was dead what witness could i callindeed i could not have called her had she been alive then having been cautioned in the ordinary form that whatever i said might be given as evidence against me at my trial i was asked if i wished to make any statement  i did make a statement of the facts so far as i knew them adding that the evidence of sir john bell and the nurse was a tissue of falsehoods and that the former had been my constant enemy ever since i began to practise in dunchester and more especially since the issue of a certain case in the treatment of which i had proved him to be wrong when my statement had been taken down and i had signed it the chairman after a brief consultation with his companions announced that as those concerned had thought it well to institute this prosecution in the face of the uncontradicted evidence of sir john bell the bench had no option but to send me to take my trial at the dunchester assizes which were to be held on that day month in order however to avoid the necessity of committing me to jail they would be prepared to take bail for my appearance in a sum of 500 pounds from myself and 500 pounds in two sureties of 250 pounds or one of the whole amount  now i looked about me helplessly for i had no relations in dunchester where i had not lived long enough to form friends sufficiently true to be willing to thus identify themselves publicly with a man in great trouble  thank you for your kindness i said but i think that i must go to prison for i do not know whom to ask to go bail for me  as i spoke there was a stir at the back of the crowded court and an ungentle voice called out ill go bail for you lad  step forward whoever spoke said the clerk and a man advanced to the table  he was a curious and not very healthylooking person of about fifty years of age illdressed in seedy black clothes and a flaming red tie with a fat pale face a pugnacious mouth and a bald head on the top of which isolated hairs stood up stiffly i knew him by sight for once he had argued with me at a lecture i gave on sanitary matters when i was told that he was a draper by trade and although his shop was by no means among the most important that he was believed to be one of the richest men in dunchester also he was a fierce faddist and a pillar of strength to the advanced wing of the radical party  what is your name asked a clerk  look you here young man he answered dont have the impertinence to try your airs and graces on with me seeing that youve owed me 24 pounds 3s 6d for the last three years for goods supplied you know well enough what my name is or if you dont i will show it to you at the bottom of a county court summons  it is my duty to ask you your name responded the disconcerted clerk when the laughter which this sally provoked had subsided  oh very well stephen strong is my name and i may tell you that it is good at the bottom of a cheque for any reasonable amount well im here to go bail for that young man i know nothing of him except that i put him on his back in a ditch in an argument we had one night last winter in the readingroom yonder i dont know whether he infected the lady or whether he didnt but i do know that like most of the poisoning calfworshipping crowd who call themselves vaccinators this bell is a liar and that if he did it wasnt his fault because it was gods will that she should die and hed a been wrong to try and interfere with him so name your sum and ill stand the shot  all of this tirade had been said or rather shouted in a strident voice and in utter defiance of the repeated orders of the chairman that he should be silent mr stephen strong was not a person very amenable to authority now however when he had finished his say he not only filled in the bail bond but offered to hand up a cheque for 500 pounds then and there  when it was over i thanked him but he only answered  dont you thank me i do it because i will not see folk locked up for this sort of nonsense about diseases and the like as though the almighty who made us dont know when to send sickness and when to keep it away when to make us live and when to make us die now do you want any money to defend yourself with  i answered that i did not and having thanked him again we parted without more words as i was in no mood to enter into an argument with an enthusiast of this hopeless but to me convenient nature    chapter v  the trial  although it took place so long ago i suppose that a good many people still remember the case of the queen versus therne which attracted a great deal of attention at the time the prosecution as i have said was set on foot by the relations of the deceased lady colford who being very rich and powerful people were able to secure the advocacy of one of the most eminent criminal lawyers of the day with whom were briefed sundry almost equally eminent juniors indeed no trouble or expense was spared that could help to ensure my conviction  on my behalf also appeared a wellknown qc and with him two juniors the judge who tried the case was old and experienced but had the reputation of being severe and from its very commencement i could see that the perusal of the depositions taken in the magistrates court where it will be remembered i was not defended had undoubtedly biased his mind against me as for the jury they were a respectablelooking quiet set of men who might be relied upon to do justice according to their lights of those who were called from the panel and answered to their names two by the way were challenged by the crown and rejected because i was told they were professed antivaccinationists  on the appointed day and hour speaking in a very crowded court counsel for the crown opened the case against me demonstrating clearly that in the pursuit of my own miserable ends i had sacrificed the life of a young highplaced and lovely fellowcreature and brought bereavement and desolation upon her husband and family then he proceeded to call evidence which was practically the same as that which had been given before the magistrates although the husband and lady colfords nurse were examined and on my behalf crossexamined at far greater length  after the adjournment for lunch sir john bell was put into the witnessbox where with a little additional detail he repeated almost word for word what he had said before listening to him my heart sank for he made an excellent witness quiet selfcontained and to all appearance not a little affected by the necessity under which he found himself of exposing the evil doings of a brother practitioner i noticed with dismay also that his evidence produced a deep effect upon the minds of all present judge and jury not excepted  then came the crossexamination which certainly was a brilliant performance for under it were shown that from the beginning sir john bell had certainly borne me illwill that to his great chagrin i had proved myself his superior in a medical controversy and that the fever which my wife contracted was in all human probability due to his carelessness and want of precautions while in attendance upon her when this crossexamination was concluded the court rose for the day and being on bail i escaped from the dock until the following morning  i returned to my house and went up to the nursery to see the baby who was a very fine and healthy infant at first i could scarcely bear to look at this child remembering always that indirectly it had been the cause of its dear mothers death but now when i was so lonely for even those who called themselves my friends had fallen away from me in the time of trial i felt drawn towards the helpless little thing  i kissed it and put it back into its cradle and was about to leave the room when the nurse a respectable widow woman with a motherly air asked me straight out what were my wishes about the child and by what name it was to be baptised seeing that when i was in jail she might not be able to ascertain them the good womans question made me wince but recognising that in view of eventualities these matters must be arranged i took a sheet of paper and wrote down my instructions which were briefly that the child should be named emma jane after its mother and mine and that the nurse mrs baker should take it to her cottage and be paid a weekly sum for its maintenance  having settled these disagreeable details i went downstairs but not to the dinner that was waiting for me as after the nurses questions i did not feel equal to facing the other domestics leaving the house i walked about the streets seeking some small eatingplace where i could dine without being recognised as i wandered along wearily i heard a harsh voice behind me calling me by name and turning found that the speaker was mr stephen strong even in the twilight there was no possibility of mistaking his flaming red tie  you are worried and tired doctor said the harsh voice why aint you with your friends instead of tramping the streets after that long day in court  because i have no friends left i answered for i had arrived at that stage of humiliation when a man no longer cares to cloak the truth  a look of pity passed over mr strongs fat face and the lines about the pugnacious mouth softened a little  is that so he said well young man youre learning now what happens to those who put their faith in fashionable folk and not in the lord rats cant scuttle from a sinking ship faster than fashionable folk from a friend in trouble you come along and have a bit of supper with me and my missis were humble tradesfolk but perhaps as things are you wont mind that  i accepted mr strongs invitation with gratitude indeed his kindness touched me leading me to his principal shop we passed through it and down a passage to a sittingroom heavily furnished with solid horsehairseated chairs and a sofa in the exact centre of this sofa reading by the light of a lamp with a pink shade which was placed on a table behind her sat a prim greyhaired woman dressed in a black silk dress and apron and a lace cap with lappets i noticed at once that the right lappet was larger than the left evidently it had been made so with the design of hiding a patch of affected skin below the ear which looked to me as though it had been caused by the malady called lupus i noticed further that the little woman was reading an antivaccination tract with a fearful picture of a diseased arm upon its cover  martha said mr strong dr therne whom theyre trying at the court yonder has come in for supper dr therne thats my wife  mrs strong rose and offered her hand she was a thin person with rather refined features a weak mouth and kindly blue eyes  im sure you are welcome she said in a small monotonous voice any of stephens friends are welcome and more especially those of them who are suffering persecution for the right  that is not exactly my case madam i answered for if i had done what they accuse me of i should deserve hanging but i did not do it  i believe you doctor she said for you have true eyes also stephen says so but in any case the death of the dear young woman was gods will and if it was gods will how can you be responsible  while i was wondering what answer i should make to this strange doctrine a servant girl announced that supper was ready and we went into the next room to partake of a meal plain indeed but of most excellent quality moreover i was glad to find unlike his wife who touched nothing but water that mr strong did not include teetotalism among his eccentricities on the contrary he produced a bottle of really fine port for my especial benefit  in the course of our conversation i discovered that the strongs who had had no children devoted themselves to the propagation of various fads mr strong indeed was antieverything but which is rather uncommon in such a man had no extraneous delusions that is to say he was not a christian scientist or a blavatskyist or a great pyramidist mrs strong however had never got farther than antivaccination to her a holy cause for she set down the skin disease with which she was constitutionally afflicted to the credit or discredit of vaccination practised upon her in her youth outside of this great and absorbing subject her mind occupied itself almost entirely with that wellknown but most harmless of the crazes the theory that we anglosaxons are the progeny of the ten lost tribes of israel  steering clear of antivaccination i showed an intelligent sympathy with her views and deductions concerning the ten tribes which so pleased the gentle little woman that forgetting the uncertainty of my future movements she begged me to come and see her as often as i liked and in the meanwhile presented me with a pile of literature connected with the supposed wanderings of the tribes thus began my acquaintance with my friend and benefactress martha strong    at ten oclock on the following morning i returned to the dock and the nurse repeated her evidence in corroboration of sir johns testimony a searching crossexamination showed her not to be a very trustworthy person but on this particular point it was impossible to shake her story because there was no standing ground from which it could be attacked then followed some expert evidence whereby amongst other things the crown proved to the jury the fearfully contagious nature of puerperal fever which closed the case for the prosecution after this my counsel reserving his address called the only testimony i was in a position to produce that of several witnesses to character and to medical capacity  when the last of these gentlemen none of whom were crossexamined stood down my counsel addressed the court pointing out that my mouth being closed by the law of the landfor this trial took place before the passing of the criminal evidence acti was unable to go into the box and give on oath my version of what had really happened in this matter nor could i produce any witnesses to disprove the story which had been told against me because unhappily no third person was present at the crucial moments now this story rested entirely on the evidence of sir john bell and the nurse and if it was true i must be mad as well as bad since a doctor of my ability would well know that under the circumstances he would very probably carry contagion with the result that a promising professional career might be ruined moreover had he determined to risk it he would have taken extra precautions in the sickroom to which he was called and this it was proved i had not done now the statement made by me before the magistrates had been put in evidence and in it i said that the tale was an absolute invention on the part of sir john bell and that when i went to see lady colford i had no knowledge whatsoever that my wife was suffering from an infectious ailment this he submitted was the true version of the story and he confidently asked the jury not to blast the career of an able and rising man but by their verdict to reinstate him in the position which he had temporarily and unjustly lost  in reply the leading counsel for the crown said that it was neither his wish nor his duty to strain the law against me or to put a worse interpretation upon the facts than they would bear under the strictest scrutiny he must point out however that if the contention of his learned friend were correct sir john bell was one of the wickedest villains who ever disgraced the earth  in summing up the judge took much the same line the case that was of a character upon which it was unusual though perfectly allowable to found a criminal prosecution he pointed out rested solely upon the evidence of sir john bell corroborated as it was by the nurse if that evidence was correct then to satisfy my own ambition or greed i had deliberately risked and as the issue showed had taken the life of a lady who in all confidence was entrusted to my care incredible as such wickedness might seem the jury must remember that it was by no means unprecedented at the same time there was a point that had been scarcely dwelt upon by counsel to which he would call their attention according to sir john bells account it was from his lips that i first learned that my wife was suffering from a peculiarly dangerous ailment yet in his report of the conversation that followed between us which he gave practically verbatim i had not expressed a single word of surprise and sorrow at this dreadful intelligence which to an affectionate husband would be absolutely overwhelming as it had been proved by the evidence of the nurse and elsewhere that my relations with my young wife were those of deep affection this struck him as a circumstance so peculiar that he was inclined to think that in this particular sir johns memory must be at fault  there was however a wide difference between assuming that a portion of the conversation had escaped a witnesss memory and disbelieving all that witnesss evidence as the counsel for the crown had said if he had not as he swore warned me and i had not as he swore refused to listen to his warning then sir john bell was a moral monster that he sir john at the beginning of my career in dunchester had shown some prejudice and animus against me was indeed admitted doubtless being human he was not pleased at the advent of a brilliant young rival who very shortly proceeded to prove him in the wrong in the instance of one of his own patients but that he had conquered this feeling as a man of generous impulses would naturally do appeared to be clear from the fact that he had volunteered to attend upon that rivals wife in her illness  from all these facts the jury would draw what inferences seemed just to them but he for one found it difficult to ask them to include among these the inference that a man who for more than a generation had occupied a very high position among them whose reputation both in and out of his profession was great and who had received a special mark of favour from the crown was in truth an evilminded and most malevolent perjurer yet if the statement of the accused was to be accepted that would appear to be the case of course however there remained the possibility that in the confusion of a hurried interview i might have misunderstood sir john bells words or that he might have misunderstood mine or lastly as had been suggested that having come to the conclusion that sir john could not possibly form a trustworthy opinion on the nature of my wifes symptoms without awaiting their further development i had determined to neglect advice in which as a doctor myself i had no confidence  this was the gist of his summing up but of course there was a great deal more which i have not set down the jury wishing to consider their verdict retired an example that was followed by the judge his departure was the signal for an outburst of conversation in the crowded court which hummed like a hive of startled bees the superintendent of police who i imagine had his own opinion of sir john bell and of the value of his evidence very kindly placed a chair for me in the dock and there on that bad eminence i sat to be studied by a thousand curious and for the most part unsympathetic eyes lady colford had been very popular her husband and relations who were convinced of my guilt and sought to be avenged upon me were very powerful therefore the fashionable world of dunchester which was doctored by sir john bell was against me almost to a woman  the jury were long in coming back and in time i accustomed myself to the staring and comments and began to think out the problem of my position it was clear to me that so far as my future was concerned it did not matter what verdict the jury gave in any case i was a ruined man in this and probably in every other country and there opposite to me sat the villain who with no excuse of hot blood or the pressure of sudden passion had deliberately sworn away my honour and livelihood he was chatting easily to one of the counsel for the crown when presently he met my eyes and in them read my thoughts i suppose that the man had a conscience somewhere probably indeed his treatment of me had not been premeditated but was undertaken in a hurry to save himself from wellmerited attack the lie once told there was no escape for him who henceforth must sound iniquity to its depths  suddenly in the midst of his conversation sir john became silent and his lips turned pale and trembled then remarking abruptly that he could waste no more time on this miserable business he rose and left the court evidently the barrister to whom he was talking had observed to what this change of demeanour was due for he looked first at me in the dock and next at sir john bell as recovering his pomposity he made his way through the crowd then he grew reflective and pushing his wig back from his forehead he stared at the ceiling and whistled to himself softly  it was very evident that the jury found a difficulty in making up their minds for minute after minute went by and still they did not return indeed they must have been absent quite an hour and a half when suddenly the superintendent of police removed the chair which he had given me and informed me that they were coming  with a curious and impersonal emotion as a man might consider a case in which he had no immediate concern i studied their faces while one by one they filed into the box the anxiety had been so great and so prolonged that i rejoiced it was at length coming to its end whatever that end might be  the judge having returned to his seat on the bench in the midst of the most intense silence the clerk asked the jury whether they found the prisoner guilty or not guilty rising to his feet the foreman a dapper little man with a rapid utterance said or rather read from a piece of paper not guilty but we hope that in future dr therne will be more careful about conveying infection  that is a most improper verdict broke in the judge with irritation for it acquits the accused and yet implies that he is guilty dr therne you are discharged i repeat that i regret that the jury should have thought fit to add a very uncalledfor rider to their verdict  i left the dock and pushed my way through the crowd outside the courthouse i came face to face with sir thomas colford a sudden impulse moved me to speak to him  sir thomas i began now that i have been acquitted by a jury  pray dr therne he broke in say no more for the less said the better it is useless to offer explanations to a man whose wife you have murdered  but sir thomas that is false when i visited lady colford i knew nothing of my wifes condition  sir he replied in this matter i have to choose between the word of sir john bell who although unfortunately my wife did not like him as a doctor has been my friend for over twenty years and your word with whom i have been acquainted for one year under these circumstances i believe sir john bell and that you are a guilty man nine people out of every ten in dunchester believe this and what is more the jury believed it also although for reasons which are easily to be understood they showed mercy to you and turning on his heel he walked away from me  i also walked away to my own desolate home and sitting down in the empty consultingroom contemplated the utter ruin that had overtaken me my wife was gone and my career was gone and to whatever part of the earth i might migrate an evil reputation would follow me and all this through no fault of mine  whilst i still sat brooding a man was shown into the room a smiling little blackcoated person in whom i recognised the managing clerk of the firm of solicitors that had conducted the case for the prosecution  not done with your troubles yet dr therne i fear he said cheerfully out of the criminal wood into the civil swamp and he laughed as he handed me a paper  what is this i asked  statement of claim in the case of colford v therne damages laid at 10000 pounds which i daresay you will agree is not too much for the loss of a young wife you see doctor sir thomas is downright wild with you and so are all the late ladys people as he cant lock you up he intends to ruin you by means of an action if he had listened to me that is what he would have begun with leaving the criminal law alone its a nasty treacherous thing is the criminal law and you cant be sure of your man however black things may look against him i never thought they could convict you doctor never for as the old judge said you see it is quite unusual to prosecute criminally in cases of this nature and the jury wont send a man to jail for a little mistake of the sort but they will cop you in damages a thousand or fifteen hundred and then the best thing that you can do will be to go bankrupt or perhaps you had better clear before the trial comes on  i groaned aloud but the little man went on cheerfully  same solicitors i suppose ill take the other things to them so as not to bother you more than i can help goodafternoon im downright glad that they didnt convict you and as for old bell hes as mad as a hatter though of course everybody knows what the jury meantthe judge was pretty straight about it wasnt hehe chooses to think that it amounts to calling him a liar well now i come to think of it there are one or two thingsso perhaps he is goodafternoon doctor lets see you have the original and i will take the duplicate and he vanished  when the clerk had gone i went on thinking things were worse than i had believed for it seemed that i was not even clear of my legal troubles already this trial had cost me a great deal and i was in no position to stand the financial strain of a second appearance in the law courts also the man was right although i had been acquitted on the criminal charge if the same evidence were given by sir john bell and the nurse in a civil action without any manner of doubt i should be cast in heavy damages well i could only wait and see what happened  but was it worth while was anything worth while the world had treated me very cruelly a villain had lied away my reputation and the world believed him so that henceforth i must be one of its outcasts and black sheep an object of pity and contempt among the members of my profession it was doubtful whether having been thus exposed and made bankrupt i could ever again obtain a respectable practice indeed the most that i might hope for would be some small appointment on the west coast of africa or any other poisonous place which no one else would be inclined to accept where i might liveuntil i died  the question that occurred to me that evening was whether it would not be wiser on the whole to accept defeat own myself beaten and ring down the curtainnot a difficult matter for a doctor to deal with the arguments for such a course were patent what were those against it  the existence of my child well by the time that she grew up if she lived to grow up all the trouble and scandal would be forgotten and the effacement of a discredited parent could be no great loss to her moreover my life was insured for 3000 pounds in an office that took the risk of suicide  considerations of religion these had ceased to have any weight with me i was brought up to believe in a good and watching providence but the events of the last few months had choked that belief if there was a god who guarded us why should he have allowed the existence of my wife to be sacrificed to the carelessness and all my hopes to the villainy of sir john bell the reasoning was inconclusive perhapsfor who can know the ends of the divinitybut it satisfied my mind at the time and for the rest i have never really troubled to reopen the question  the natural love of life for its own sake it had left me what more had life to offer further what is called love of life frequently enough is little more than fear of the hereafter or of death and of the physical act of death i had lost my terror shattered as i was by sorrow and shame indeed at that moment i could have welcomed it gladly since to me it meant the perfect rest of oblivion  so in the end i determined that i would leave this lighted house of life and go out into the dark night and at once unhappy was it for me and for hundreds of other human beings that the decree of fate or chance brought my designs to nothing  first i wrote a letter to be handed to the reporters at the inquest for publication in the newspapers in which i told the true story of lady colfords case and denounced bell as a villain whose perjury had driven me to selfmurder after this i wrote a second letter to be given to my daughter if she lived to come to years of discretion setting out the facts that brought me to my end and asking her to pardon me for having left her this done it seemed that my worldly business was completed so i set about leaving the world  going to a medicine chest i reflected a little finally i decided on prussic acid its after effects are unpleasant but its action is swift and certain what did it matter to me if i turned black and smelt of almonds when i was dead    chapter vi  the gate of darkness  taking the phial from the chest i poured an ample but not an over dose of the poison into a medicine glass mixing it with a little water so that it might be easier to swallow i lingered as long as i could over these preparations but they came to an end too soon  now there seemed to be nothing more to do except to transfer that little measure of white fluid from the glass to my mouth and thus to open the great door at whose bolts and bars we stare blankly from the day of birth to the day of death every panel of that door is painted with a different picture touched to individual taste some are beautiful and some are grim and some are neutraltinted and indefinite my favourite picture used to be one of a boat floating on a misty ocean and in the boat a man sleepingmyself dreaming happily dreaming always  but that picture had gone now and in place of it was one of blackness not the tumultuous gloom of a stormy night but dead cold unfathomable blackness without a doubt that was what lay behind the dooronly that so soon as ever my wine was swallowed and those mighty hinges began to turn i should see a wall of blackness thrusting itself twixt door and lintel yes it would creep forward now pausing now advancing until at length it wrapped me round and stifled out my breath like a death mask of cold clay then sight would die and sound would die and to all eternities there would be silence silence while the stars grew old and crumbled silence while they took form again far in the void for ever and for ever dumb dreadful conquering silence  that was the only real picture the rest were mere efforts of the imagination and yet what if some of them were also true what if the finished landscape that lay beyond the doomdoor was but developed from the faint sketch traced by the strivings of our spiritto each man his own picture but filled in perfected vivified a thousandfold for terror or for joy perfect and inconceivable  the thought was fascinating but not without its fears it was strange that a man who had abandoned hopes should still be haunted by fearslike everything else in the world this is unjust for a little while five or ten minutes not more than ten i would let my mind dwell on that thought trying to dig down to its roots which doubtless drew their strength from the foetid slime of human superstition trying to behold its topmost branches where they waved in sparkling light no that was not the theory i must imagine those invisible branches as grim skeletons of whitened wood standing stirless in that atmosphere of overwhelming night  so i sat myself in a chair placing the medicine glass with the draught of bane upon the table before me and to make sure that i did not exceed the ten minutes near to it my travelling clock as i sat thus i fell into a dream or vision i seemed to see myself standing upon the world surrounded by familiar sights and sounds there in the west the sun sank in splendour and the sails of a windmill that turned slowly between its orb and me were now bright as gold and now by contrast black as they dipped into the shadow near the windmill was a cornfield and beyond the cornfield stood a cottage whence came the sound of lowing cattle and the voices of children down a path that ran through the ripening corn walked a young man and a maid their arms twined about each other while above their heads a lark poured out its song  but at my very feet this kindly earth and all that has life upon it vanished quite away and there in its place seen through a giant portal was the realm of darkness that i had pictureddarkness so terrible so overpowering and so icy that my living blood froze at the sight of it presently something stirred in the darkness for it trembled like shaken water a shape came forward to the edge of the gateway so that the light of the setting sun fell upon it making it visible i looked and knew that it was the phantom of my lost wife wrapped in her last garments there she stood sad and eagerfaced with quickmoving lips from which no echo reached my ears there she stood beating the air with her hands as though to bar that path against me      i awoke with a start to see standing over against me in the gloom of the doorway not the figure of my wife come from the company of the dead with warning on her lips but that of stephen strong yes it was he for the light of the candle that i had lit when i went to seek the drug fell full upon his pale face and large bald head  hullo doctor he said in his harsh but not unkindly voice having a nip and a nap eh whats your tipple hollands it looks but it smells more like peach brandy may i taste it im a judge of hollands and he lifted the glass of prussic acid and water from the table  in an instant my dazed faculties were awake and with a swift motion i had knocked the glass from his hand so that it fell upon the floor and was shattered  ah he said i thought so and now young man perhaps you will tell me why you were playing a trick like that  why i answered bitterly because my wife is dead because my name is disgraced because my career is ruined because they have commenced a new action against me and if i live i must become a bankrupt  and you thought that you could make all these things better by killing yourself doctor i didnt believe that you were such a fool you say you have done nothing to be ashamed of and i believe you well then what does it matter what these folk think for the rest when a man finds himself in a tight place he shouldnt knock under he should fight his way through youre in a tight place i know but i was once in a tighter yes i did what you have nearly donei went to jail on a false charge and false evidence but i didnt commit suicide i served my time and i think it crazed me a bit though it was only a month at any rate i was what they call a crank when i came out which i wasnt when i went in then i set to work and showed up those for whom i had done timeliving or dead theyll never forget stephen strong ill warrantand after that i turned to and became the head of the radical party and one of the richest men in dunchester why i might have been in parliament half a dozen times over if i had chosen although i am only a draper now if i have done all this why cant you who have twice my brains and education do as much  nobody will employ you i will find folk who will employ you action for damages ill stand the shot of that however it goes i love a lawsuit and a thousand or two wont hurt me and now i came round here to ask you to supper and i think youll be better drinking port with stephen strong than hellfire with another tradesman whom i wont name before we go however just give me your word of honour that there shall be no more of this sort of thing and he pointed to the broken glass now or afterwards as i dont want to be mixed up with inquests  i promise i answered presently  that will do said mr strong as he led the way to the door  i need not dwell upon the further events of that evening inasmuch as they were almost a repetition of those of the previous night mrs strong received me kindly in her faded fashion and after a few inquiries about the trial sought refuge in her favourite topic of the lost tribes indeed i remember that she was rather put out because i had not already mastered the books and pamphlets which she had given me in the end notwithstanding the weariness of her feeble folly i returned home in much better spirits  for the next month or two nothing of note happened to me except indeed that the action for damages brought against me by sir thomas colford was suddenly withdrawn although it never transpired publicly i believe that the true reason of this collapse was that sir john bell flatly refused to appear in court and submit himself to further examination and without sir john bell there was no evidence against me but the withdrawal of this action did not help me professionally indeed the fine practice which i was beginning to get together had entirely vanished away not a creature came near my consultingroom and scarcely a creature called me in the prosecution and the verdict of the jury amounting as it did to one of not proven only had ruined me by now my small resources were almost exhausted and i could see that very shortly the time would come when i should no longer know where to turn for bread for myself and my child  one morning as i was sitting in my consultingroom moodily reading a medical textbook for want of something else to do the front door bell rang a patient at last i thought to myself with a glow of hope i was soon undeceived however for the servant opened the door and announced mr stephen strong  how do you do doctor he said briskly you will wonder why i am here at such an hour well it is on business i want you to come with me to see two sick children  certainly i said and we started  who are the children and what is the matter with them i asked presently  son and daughter of a working bootmaker named samuels as to what is the matter with them you can judge of that for yourself he replied with a grim smile  passing into the poorer part of the city at length we reached a cobblers shop with a few pairs of roughlymade boots on sale in the window in the shop sat mr samuels a dourlooking man of about forty  here is the doctor samuels said strong  all right he answered hell find the missus and the kids in there and a pretty sight they are i cant bear to look at them i cant  passing through the shop we went into a back room whence came a sound of wailing standing in the room was a careworn woman and in the bed lay two children aged three and four respectively i proceeded at once to my examination and found that one child a boy was in a state of extreme prostration and fever the greater part of his body being covered with a vivid scarlet rash the other child a girl was suffering from a terribly red and swollen arm the inflammation being most marked above the elbow both were cases of palpable and severe erysipelas and both of the sufferers had been vaccinated within five days  well said stephen strong well whats the matter with them  erysipelas i answered  and what caused the erysipelas was it the vaccination  it may have been the vaccination i replied cautiously  come here samuels called strong now then tell the doctor your story  theres precious little story about it said the poor man keeping his back towards the afflicted children i have been pulled up three times and fined because i didnt have the kids vaccinated not being any believer in vaccination myself ever since my sisters boy died of it with his head all covered with sores well i couldnt pay no more fines so i told the missus that she might take them to the vaccination officer and she did five or six days ago and there thats the end of their vaccination and damn em to hell say i and the poor fellow pushed his way out of the room  it is quite unnecessary that i should follow all the details of this sad case in the result despite everything that i could do for him the boy died though the girl recovered both had been vaccinated from the same tube of lymph in the end i was able to force the authorities to have the contents of tubes obtained from the same source examined microscopically and subjected to the culture test they were proved to contain the streptococcus or germ of erysipelas  as may be imagined this case caused a great stir and much public controversy in which i took an active part it was seized upon eagerly by the antivaccination party and i was quoted as the authority for its details in reply the other side hinted pretty broadly that i was a person so discredited that my testimony on this or any other matter should be accepted with caution an unjust aspersion which not unnaturally did much to keep me in the enemys camp indeed it was now when i became useful to a great and rising party that at length i found friends without number who not content with giving me their present support took up the case on account of which i had stood my trial and by their energy and the ventilation of its details did much to show how greatly i had been wronged i did not and do not suppose that all this friendship was disinterested but whatever its motive it was equally welcome to a crushed and deserted man  by slow degrees and without my making any distinct pronouncement on the subject i came to be looked upon as a leading light among the very small and select band of antivaccinationist men and as such to study the question exhaustively hearing that i was thus engaged stephen strong offered me a handsome salary which i suppose came out of his pocket if i would consent to investigate cases in which vaccination was alleged to have resulted in mischief i accepted the salary since formally at any rate it bound me to nothing but a course of inquiries during a search of two years i established to my satisfaction that vaccination as for the most part it was then performed that is from arm to arm is occasionally the cause of blood poisoning erysipelas abscesses tuberculosis and other dreadful ailments these cases i published without drawing from them any deductions whatever with the result that i found myself summoned to give evidence before the royal commission on vaccination which was then sitting at westminster when i had given my evidence which each case being well established could scarcely be shaken some members of the commission attempted to draw me into general statements as to the advantage or otherwise of the practice of vaccination to the community to these gentlemen i replied that as my studies had been directed towards the effects of vaccination in individual instances only the argument was one upon which i preferred not to enter  had i spoken the truth indeed i should have confessed my inability to support the antivaccinationist case since in my opinion few people who have studied this question with an open and impartial mind can deny that jenners discovery is one of the greatest boonsperhaps after the introduction of antiseptics and anaesthetics the very greatestthat has ever been bestowed upon suffering humanity  if the reader has any doubts upon the point let him imagine a time when as used to happen in the days of our forefathers almost everybody suffered from smallpox at some period of their lives those escaping only whose blood was so fortified by nature that the disease could not touch them let him imagine a state of affairsand there are still people living whose parents could remember itwhen for a woman not to be pitted with smallpox was to give her some claim to beauty however homely might be her features lastly let him imagine what all this means what terror walked abroad when it was common for smallpox to strike a family of children and when the parents themselves the survivors of similar catastrophes knew well that before it left the house it would take its tithe of those beloved lives let him look at the brasses in our old churches and among the numbers of children represented on them as kneeling behind their parents let him note what a large proportion pray with their hands open of these the most i believe were cut off by smallpox let him search the registers and they will tell the same tale let him ask old people of what their mothers told them when they were young of the working of this pestilence in their youth finally let him consider how it comes about if vaccination is a fraud that some nine hundred and ninetynine medical men out of every thousand not in england only but in all civilised countries place so firm a belief in its virtue are the doctors of the world all mad or all engaged in a great conspiracy to suppress the truth  these were my real views as they must be the views of most intelligent and thoughtful men but i did not think it necessary to promulgate them abroad since to do so would have been to deprive myself of such means of maintenance as remained to me indeed in those days i told neither more nor less than the truth evil results occasionally followed the use of bad lymph or unclean treatment after the subject had been inoculated thus most of the cases of erysipelas into which i examined arose not from vaccination but from the dirty surroundings of the patient wound a million children however slightly and let flies settle on the wound or dirt accumulate in it and the result will be that a certain small proportion will develop erysipelas quite independently of the effects of vaccination  in the same way some amount of inoculated disease must follow the almost promiscuous use of lymph taken from human beings the danger is perfectly preventable and ought long ago to have been prevented by making it illegal under heavy penalties to use any substance except that which has been developed in calves and scientifically treated with glycerine when as i believe no hurt can possibly follow this is the verdict of science and as tens of thousands can testify the common experience of mankind    chapter vii  crossing the rubicon  my appearance as an expert before the royal commission gave me considerable importance in the eyes of a large section of the inhabitants of dunchester it was not the wealthiest or most influential section indeed although in it were numbered some rich and powerful men once again i found myself with a wide and rapidly increasing practice and an income that was sufficient for my needs mankind suffers from many ailments besides that of smallpox indeed in dunchester this question of the value of vaccination was at that time purely academical as except for an occasional case there had been no outbreak of smallpox for years now as i have said i was a master of my trade and soon proved myself competent to deal skilfully with such illnesses surgical or medical as i was called upon to treat thus my practice grew especially among the small tradespeople and artisans who did not belong to clubs but preferred to pay for a doctor in whom they had confidence  three years and more had gone by since that night on which i sat opposite to a wineglass full of poison and was the prey of visions when once again i received a call from stephen strong with this goodhearted though misguided man and his amiable but weakminded wife i had kept up an intimacy that in time ripened into genuine friendship on every sunday night and sometimes oftener i took supper with them and discussed with mrs strong the important questions of our descent from the lost tribes and whether or no the lupus from which she suffered was the result of vaccination in infancy  owing to a press of patients to whom i was obliged to attend i was not able to receive mr strong for nearly half an hour  things are a bit different from what they used to be doctor he said as he entered the room looking much the same as ever with the exception that now even his last hairs had gone leaving him completely bald theres six more of them waiting there and all except one can pay a fee yes the luck has turned for you since you were called in to attend cobbler samuels children and you havent seen the top of it yet i can tell you now what do you think i have come to see you about  cant say i give it up  then i will tell you you saw in yesterdays paper that old brewer hicks the member for dunchester has been raised to the peerage i understand he told the government that if they kept him waiting any longer he would stop his subscription to the party funds and as thats 5000 pounds a year they gave in believing the seat to be a safe one but thats just where they make their mistake for if we get the right man the rads will win  and who is the right man  james therne esq md he answered quietly  what on earth do you mean i asked how can i afford to spend from 1000 to 2000 pounds upon a contested election and as much more a year in subscriptions and keeping up the position if i should chance to be returned and how in the name of fortune can i be both a practising physician and a member of parliament  ill tell you doctor for ever since your name was put forward by the liberal council yesterday i have seen these difficulties and been thinking them out look here you are still young handsome clever and a capital speaker with a popular audience also you are very hardworking and would rise but youve no money and only what you earn at your profession to live on which if you were a member of parliament you couldnt continue to earn well such a man as you are is wanted and so he must be paid for  no no i said i am not going to be the slave of a radical five hundred bound to do what they tell me and vote as they like id rather stick to my own trade thank you  dont you be in a hurry young man who asked you to be any ones slave now look hereif somebody guarantees every farthing of expense to fight the seat and 1200 pounds a year and outgoings if you should be successful and a bonus of 5000 pounds in the event of your being subsequently defeated or electing to give up parliamentary life will you take on the job  on those terms yes i think so provided i was sure of the guarantor and that he was a man from whom i could take the money  well you can soon judge of that doctor for it is i samuel strong and ill deposit 10000 pounds in the hands of a trustee before you write your letter of acceptance no dont thank me i do it for two reasonsfirst because having no chick or kin of my own i happen to have taken a fancy to you and wish to push you on the world has treated you badly and i want to see you one of its masters with all these smart people who look down on you licking your boots as they will sure enough if you grow rich and powerful thats my private reason my public one is that you are the only man in dunchester who can win us the seat and id think 10000 pounds well spent if it put those tories at the bottom of the poll i want to show them who is boss and that we wont be lorded over by bankers and brewers just because they are rich men who have bought themselves titles  but you are a rich man yourself i interrupted  yes doctor and i spend my money in helping those who will help the people now before you give me any answer ive got to ask you a thing or two and he drew a paper from his pocket are you prepared to support the abolition of tied houses  certainly they are the worst monopoly in england  graduated incometax  yes the individual should pay in proportion to the property protected  an old age pension scheme  yes but only by means of compulsory insurance applicable to all classes without exception  disestablishment and disendowment of the church  yes provided its funds are pooled and reapplied to church purposes  payment of members and placing the cost of elections on the rates  yes the door of parliament should not be shut in the face of all except the very rich election expenditure is at present only a veiled form of corruption if it were put upon the rates it could be reduced by at least a half and elections would be fewer  home ruleno i neednt ask you that for it is a dead horse which we dont want to flog and nowadays we are all in favour of a big navy so i think that is about everythingexcept of course antivaccination which youll run for all its worth  i never said that i would mr strong i answered  he looked at me curiously no and you never said you wouldnt now doctor let us come to an understanding about this for here in dunchester its worth more than all the other things put together if this seat is to be won it will be won on antivaccination thats our burning question and thats why you are being asked to stand because youve studied the thing and are believed to be one of the few doctors who dont bow the knee to baal so look here lets understand each other if you have any doubts about this matter say so and we will have done with it for remember once you are on the platform youve got to go the whole hog none of your scientific finicking but appeals to the people to rise up in their thousands and save their innocent children from being offered to the moloch of vaccination with enlarged photographs of nastylooking cases and the rest of it  i listened and shivered the inquiry into rare cases of disease after vaccination had been interesting work which whatever deductions people might choose to draw in fact committed me to nothing but to become one of the ragged little regiment of medical dissenters to swallow all the unscientific follies of the antivaccination agitators to make myself responsible for and to promulgate their distorted figures and wild statementsah that was another thing must i appear upon platforms and denounce this wonderful discovery as the law of useless infanticide must i tell people that smallpox is really a curative process and not the deadly scourge and pestilence that doctors pretend it to be must i maintain that vaccination never did never does and never can prevent even a single case of smallpox must i hold it up as a law  of devil worship and human sacrifice to idols  if i accepted strongs offer it seemed that i must do all these things more i must be false to my instincts false to my training and profession false to my scientific knowledge i could not do it and yetwhen did a man in my position ever get such a chance as that which was offered to me this day i was ready with my tongue and fond of public speaking from boyhood it had been my desire to enter parliament where i knew well that i should show to some advantage now without risk or expense to myself an opportunity of gratifying this ambition was given to me indeed if i succeeded in winning this city which had always been a tory stronghold for the radical party i should be a marked man from the beginning and if my career was not one of assured prosperity the fault would be my own already in imagination i saw myself rich for in this way or in that the money would come a favourite of the people a trusted minister of the crown and perhapswho could tellennobled living a life of dignity and repute and at last leaving my honours and my fame to those who came after me  on the other hand if i refused this offer the chance would pass away from me never to return again it was probable even that i should lose stephen strongs friendship and support for he was not a man who liked his generosity to be slighted moreover he would believe me unsound upon his favourite dogmas in short for ever abandoning my brilliant hopes i condemned myself to an experience of struggle as a doctor with a practice among secondclass people  after all although the thought of it shocked me at first the price i was asked to pay was not so very heavy merely one of the usual election platform formulas whereby the candidate binds himself to support all sorts of things in which he has little or no beliefs already i was half committed to this antivaccination crusade and if i took a step or two farther in it what did it matter one crank more added to the great army of british enthusiasts could make little difference in the scheme of things  if ever a man went through a psychological moment in this hour i was that man the struggle was short and sharp but it ended as might be expected in the case of one of my history and character could i have foreseen the dreadful issues which hung upon my decision i believe that rather than speak it for the second time in my life i would have sought the solace to be found in the phials of my medicine chest but i did not foresee them i thought only of myself of my own hopes fears and ambitions forgetting that no man can live to himself alone and that his every deed must act and react upon others until humanity ceases to exist  well said mr strong after a two or three minutes pause during which these thoughts were wrestling in my mind  well i answered as you elegantly express it i am prepared to go the whole hogit is a case of hog versus calf isnt itor for the matter of that a whole styful of hogs  i suppose that my doubts and irritation were apparent in the inelegant jocosity of my manner at any rate stephen strong who was a shrewd observer took alarm  look here doctor he said i am honest i am right or wrong i believe in this antivaccination business and we are going to run the election on it if you dont believe in itand you have no particular call to since every man can claim his own opinionyoud better let it alone and look on all this talk as nothing you are our first and best man but we have several upon the list ill go on to one of them and he took up his hat  i let him take it i even let him walk towards the door but as he approached it i reflected that with that dogged burly form went all my ambitions and my last chance of advancement in life when his hand was already on the handle not of premeditation but by impulse i said  i dont know why you should talk like that as i think that i have given good proof that i am no believer in vaccination  whats that doctor he asked turning round  my little girl is nearly four years old and she has never been vaccinated  is it so he asked doubtfully  as he spoke i heard the nurse going down the passage and with her my daughter whom she was taking for her morning walk i opened the door and called jane in a beautiful little being with dark eyes and golden hair  look for yourself i said and taking off the childs coat i showed him both her arms then i kissed her and sent her back to the nurse  thats good enough doctor but mind you she mustnt be vaccinated now  as he spoke the words my heart sank in me for i understood what i had done and the risk that i was taking but the die was cast or so i thought in my folly it was too late to go back  dont be afraid i said no cow poison shall be mixed with her blood  now i believe you doctor he answered for a man wont play tricks with his only child just to help himself ill take your answer to the council and they will send you the formal letter of invitation to stand with the conditions attached before you answer it the money will be lodged and you shall have my bond for it and now i must be going for i am wasting your time and those patients of yours will be getting tired if you will come to supper tonight ill have some of the leaders to meet you and we can talk things over goodbye we shall win the seat so sure as my name is stephen strong we shall win on the av ticket  he went and i saw those of my patients who had sat out the wait when they had gone i considered the position summing it up in my own mind the prospect was exhilarating and yet i was depressed for i had bound myself to the chariot wheels of a false doctrine also by implication i had told strong a lie it was true that jane had not been vaccinated but of this i had neglected to give him the reason it was that i had postponed vaccinating her for a while owing to a certain infantile delicacy being better acquainted than most men with the risks consequent on that operation slight though it is in certain conditions of a childs health and knowing that there was no danger of her taking smallpox in a town which was free from it i proposed however to perform the operation within the next few days indeed for this very purpose i had already written to london to secure some glycerinated calf lymph which would now be wasted  the local papers next morning appeared with an announcement that at the forthcoming byeelection dunchester would be contested in the radical interest by james therne esq md they added that in addition to other articles of the radical faith dr therne professed the doctrine of antivaccination of which he was so ardent an upholder that although on several occasions he had been threatened with prosecution he declined to allow his only child to be vaccinated  in the same issues it was announced that the conservative candidate would be sir thomas colford  so the die was cast i had crossed the rubicon    chapter viii  bravo the avs  in another week the writ had been issued and we were in the thick of the fight what a fight it was memory could not record tradition did not even record another half as fierce in the borough of dunchester for the most part that is in many of our constituencies it is not difficult for a candidate standing in the radical interest if he is able wellbacked and not too particular as to what he promises to win the seat for his party but dunchester was something of an exception in a sense it was corrupt that is it had always been represented by a rich man who was expected to pay liberally for the honour of its confidence pay he did indeed in large and numberless subscriptions in the endowment of readingrooms in presents of public parks and i know not what besides  at least it is a fact that almost every advantage of this nature enjoyed today by the inhabitants of dunchester has been provided for them by former conservative members for the borough  under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that in choosing a candidate the majority of the electors of the city were apt to ask two leading questions first is he rich and secondly what will he do for the town if he gets in  now sir thomas colford was very rich and it was whispered that if he were elected he would be prepared to show his gratitude in a substantial fashion a new wing to the hospital was wanted this it was said would be erected and endowed also forty acres of valuable land belonging to him ran into the park and he had been heard to say that these forty acres were really much more important to the public than to himself and that he hoped that one day they would belong to it  it is small wonder then that the announcement of his candidature was received with passionate enthusiasm mine on the contrary evoked a chorus of disapproval that is in the local press i was denounced as an adventurer as a man who had stood a criminal trial for wicked negligence and escaped the jail only by the skin of my teeth i was held up to public reprobation as a socialist who having nothing myself wished to prey upon the goods of others and as an antivaccination quack who to gain a few votes was ready to infest the whole community with a loathsome disease of all the accusations of my opponents this was the only one that stung me because it alone had truth in it  sir john bell my old enemy one of the nominators of sir thomas colford appeared upon the platform at his first meeting and speaking in the character of an old and leading citizen of the town and as one who had doctored most of them implored his audience not to trust their political fortunes to such a person as myself whose doctrines were repudiated by almost every member of the profession which i disgraced this appeal carried much weight with it  from all these circumstances it might have been supposed that my case was hopeless especially as no radical had even ventured to contest the seat in the last two elections but in fact this was not so for in dunchester there existed a large body of voters many of them employed in shoemaking factories who were almost socialistic in their views these men spending their days in some hive of machinery and their nights in squalid tenements built in dreary rows which in cities such people are doomed to inhabit were very bitter against the upper classes and indeed against all who lived in decent comfort  this was not to be marvelled at for what can be expected of folk whose lot hard as it is has none of the mitigations that lighten the troubles of those who live in the country and who can at least breathe the free air and enjoy the beauties that are common to all here at dunchester their pleasures consisted for the most part in a dog fight or some such refining spectacle varied by an occasional boose at the publichouse or in the case of those who chanced to be more intellectually inclined by attending lectures where socialism and other advanced doctrines were preached as was but natural this class might be relied upon almost to a man to vote for the party which promised to better their lot rather than for the party which could only recommend them to be contented and to improve themselves to secure their support it was only necessary to be extravagant of promises and abusive of employers who refused to pay them impossible wages  next in importance to these redhot forwards came the phalanx of oldfashioned people who voted liberal because their fathers had voted liberal before them then there were the electors who used to be conservative but being honestly dissatisfied with the government on account of its foreign policy or for other reasons had made up their minds to transfer their allegiance also there were the dissenters who set hatred of the church above all politics and made its disendowment and humiliation their watchword in dunchester these were active and numerous a very tower of strength to me for stephen strong was the wealthiest and most important of them  during the first day or two of the canvass however a careful estimate of our electoral strength showed it to be several hundred votes short of that of our opponents therefore if we would win we must make converts by appealing to the prejudices of members of the electorate who were of conservative views in other words by preaching fads  of these there were many all useful to the candidate of pliant mind such as the total drinkprohibition fad the antidogmuzzling fad and others each of which was worth some votes even the peculiar people a society that makes a religion of killing helpless children by refusing them medical aid when they are ill were good for ten or twelve here however i drew the line for when asking whether i would support a bill relieving them from all liability to criminal prosecution in the event of the death of their victims i absolutely declined to give any such undertaking  but although all these fancies had their followers it was the antivaccination craze that really had a hold in dunchester the avs as they called themselves were numbered by hundreds for the national league and other similar associations had been at work here for years with such success that already twenty per cent of the children born in the last decade had never been vaccinated for a while the board of guardians had been slow to move then on the election of a new chairman and the representations of the medical profession of the town they instituted a series of prosecutions against parents who refused to comply with the vaccination acts unluckily for the conservative party these prosecutions which aroused the most bitter feelings were still going on when the seat fell vacant hence from an electoral point of view the question became one of firstclass importance  in dunchester as elsewhere the great majority of the antivaccinators were already radical but there remained a residue estimated at from 300 to 400 who voted blue or conservative if these men could be brought over i should win if they remained faithful to their colour i must lose therefore it will be seen that stephen strong was right when he said that the election would be won or lost upon antivaccination  at the first public meeting of the conservatives after sir thomass speech the spokesman of the antivaccination party rose and asked him whether he was in favour of the abolition of the compulsory vaccination laws now at this very meeting sir john bell had already spoken denouncing me for my views upon this question thereby to some extent tying the candidates hands so after some pause and consultation sir thomas replied that he was in favour of freeing conscientious objectors to vaccination from all legal penalties like most half measures this decision of course did not gain him a single vote whereas it certainly lost him much support  on the same evening a similar question was put to me my answer may be guessed indeed i took the opportunity to make a speech which was cheered to the echo for having acted the great lie of espousing the antivaccination cause i felt that it was not worth while to hesitate in telling other lies in support of it moreover i knew my subject thoroughly and understood what points to dwell upon and what to gloze over how to twist and turn the statistics and how to marshal my facts in such fashion as would make it very difficult to expose their fallacy then when i had done with general arguments i went on to particular cases describing as a doctor can do the most dreadful which had ever come under my notice with such power and pathos that women in the audience burst into tears  finally i ended by an impassioned appeal to all present to follow my example and refuse to allow their children to be poisoned i called on them as free men to rise against this monstrous tyranny to put a stop to this system of organised and judicial infanticide and to send me to parliament to raise my voice on their behalf in the cause of helpless infants whose tender bodies now day by day under the command of the law were made the receptacles of the most filthy diseases from which man was doomed to suffer  as i sat down the whole of that great audienceit numbered more than 2000rose in their places shouting we will we will after which followed a scene of enthusiasm such as i had never seen before emphasised by cries of we are free englishmen down with the babybutchers we will put you in sir and so forth  that meeting gave me my cue and thenceforward leaving almost every other topic on one side i and my workers devoted ourselves to preaching the antivaccination doctrines we flooded the constituency with tracts headed what vaccination does the law of useless infanticide the vaccine tyranny is vaccination a fraud and so forth and with horrible pictures of calves stretched out by pulleys gagged and blindfolded with their under parts covered by vaccine vesicles also we had photographs of children suffering from the effects of improper or unclean vaccination which by means of magic lantern slides could be thrown lifesized on a screen indeed one or two such children themselves were taken round to meetings and their sores exhibited  the effect of all this was wonderful for i know of nothing capable of rousing honest but ignorant people to greater rage and enthusiasm than this antivaccination cry they believe it to be true or at least seeing one or two cases in which it is true and having never seen a case of smallpox they suppose that the whole race is being poisoned by wicked doctors for their own gain hence their fierce energy and heartfelt indignation  well it carried me through the election was fought not with foils but with rapiers against me were arrayed the entire wealth rank and fashion of the city reinforced by conservative speakers famous for their parliamentary eloquence who were sent down to support sir thomas colford nor was this all when it was recognised that the fight would be a close one an eloquent and leading member of the house was sent to intervene in person he came and addressed a vast meeting gathered in the biggest building of the city seated among a crowd of workmen on a back bench i was one of his audience his speech was excellent if somewhat too general and academic to the av agitation with a curious misapprehension of the state of the case he devoted one paragraph only it ran something like this  i am told that our opponents putting aside the great and general issues upon which i have had the honour to address you attempt to gain support by entering upon a crusadeto my mind a most pernicious crusadeagainst the law of compulsory vaccination i am not concerned to defend that law because practically in the mind of all reasonable men it stands beyond attack it is i am told suggested that the act should be amended by freeing from the usual penalties any parent who chooses to advance a plea of conscientious objection against the vaccination of his children such an argument seems to me too puerile i had almost said too wicked to dwell upon for in its issue it would mean that at the whim of individuals innocent children might be exposed to disease disfigurement and death and the whole community through them to a very real and imminent danger prophecy is dangerous but speaking for myself as a private member of parliament i can scarcely believe that responsible ministers of any party moved by the pressure of an illinformed and erroneous opinion would ever consent under this elastic plea of conscience to establish such a precedent of surrender vaccination with its proved benefits is outside the pale of party after long and careful study science and the medical profession have given a verdict in its favour a verdict which has now been confirmed by the experience of generations here i leave the question and turning once more before i sit down to those great and general issues of which i have already spoken i would again impress upon this vast audience and through it upon the constituency at large etc etc etc  within a year it was my lot to listen to an eminent leader of that distinguished member with the distinguished members tacit consent pressing upon an astonished house of commons the need of yielding to the clamour of the antivaccinationists and of inserting into the bill framed upon the report of a royal commission a clause forbidding the prosecution of parents or guardians willing to assert before a bench of magistrates that they objected to vaccination on conscientious grounds  the appeal was not in vain the bill passed in its amended form and within twenty years i lived to see its fruits  at length came the polling day after this lapse of time i remember little of its details i as became a democratic candidate walked from pollingstation to pollingstation while my opponent as became a wealthy banker drove about the city in a carriage and four at eight oclock the ballotboxes were sealed up and conveyed to the townhall where the counting commenced in the presence of the mayor the candidates their agents and the necessary officers and assistants box after box was opened and the papers counted out into separate heaps those for colford into one pile those for therne into another the spoiled votes being kept by themselves  the counting began about halfpast nine and up to a quarter to twelve nobody could form an idea as to the ultimate result although at that time the conservative candidate appeared to be about five and thirty votes ahead then the last ballotbox was opened it came from a poor quarter of the city a ward in which i had many supporters  sir thomas colford and i with our little knots of agents and subagents placed ourselves one on each side of the table waiting in respectful silence while the clerk dealt out the papers as a player deals out cards it was an anxious moment as any one who has gone through a closelycontested parliamentary election can testify for ten days or more the strain had been great but curiously enough now at its climax it seemed to have lost its grip of me i watched the denoument of the game with keenness and interest indeed but as though i were not immediately and personally concerned i felt that i had done my best to win and no longer cared whether my efforts ended in success or failure possibly this was the result of the apathy that falls upon overstrained nerves possibly i was oppressed by the fear of victory and of that nemesis which almost invariably dogs the steps of our accomplished desires of what the french writer calls la page effrayante    des desirs accomplis at least just then i cared nothing whether i won or lost only i reflected that in the latter event it would be sad to have told so many falsehoods to no good purpose  how does it stand asked the head conservative agent of the officer  the clerk took the last numbers from the counters and added up the figures  colford 4303 therne 4291 and two more bundles to count  another packet was counted out  how does it stand asked the agent  colford 4349 therne 4327 and one more bundle of fifty to count answered the clerk  the agent gave a sigh of relief and smiled i saw him press sir thomass hand in congratulations for now he was sure that victory was theirs  the game is up i whispered to strong who as my principal supporter had been admitted with me to the hall  he ground his teeth and i noticed in the gaslight that his face was ghastly pale and his lips were blue  you had better go out i said you are overtaxing that dilated heart of yours go home and take a sleeping draught  damn you no he answered fiercely in my ear those papers come from the little martha ward where i thought there wasnt a wrong un in the crowd if theyve sold me ill be even with them as sure as my name is strong  come i said with a laugh a good radical shouldnt talk like that for me the bitterness was over and knowing the worst i could afford to laugh  the official opened the last packet and began to count aloud  the first vote was for therne but bad for the elector had written his name upon the paper then in succession came nine for colford now all interest in the result had died away and a hum of talk arose from those present in the room a whispered murmur of congratulations and condolences no wonder seeing that to win i must put to my credit thirtytwo of the forty remaining papers which seemed a thing impossible  the counter went on counting aloud and dealing down the papers as he counted one two three four and straight on up to ten for therne when he paused to examine a paper then one for colford then in rapid successful five ten fifteen for therne  now the hum of conversation died away for it was felt that this was becoming interesting of course it was practically impossible that i should win for there were but fourteen papers left and to do so i must secure eleven of them  sixteen for therne went on the counter seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty  now the excitement grew intense for if the run held in two more votes i should tie every eye was fixed upon the counters hand  to the right and left of him on the table were two little piles of voting papers the pile to the right was the property of colford the pile to the left was sacred to therne the paper was unfolded and glanced at then up went the hand and down floated the fateful sheet on to the lefthand pile twentyone for therne again the process was repeated and again the lefthand pile was increased twentytwo for therne  by heaven youve tied him gasped stephen strong  there were but seven papers left and the candidate who secured four of them would be the winner of the election  twentythree for therne twentyfour twentyfivea silence in which you could hear the breath of other men and the beating of your own heart  twentysix for therne twentyseven twentyeight twentynine all for therne  then bursting from the lips of stephen strong a shrill hoarse cry more like the cry of a beast than that of a man and the words by god weve won the avs have done it bravo the avs  silence said the mayor bringing his fist down upon the table but so far as stephen strong was concerned the order was superfluous for suddenly his face flushed then turned a dreadful ashen grey and down he sank upon the floor as i leant over him and began to loosen his collar i heard the conservative agent say in strident tones  there is some mistake there must be some mistake it is almost impossible that dr therne can have polled twentynine votes in succession on behalf of sir thomas colford i demand a recount  certainly answered some official let it be begun at once  in that ceremony i took no part indeed i spent the next two hours with the help of another doctor trying to restore consciousness to stephen strong in a little room that opened off the townhall within half an hour mrs strong arrived  he still breathes i said in answer to her questioning glance  then the poor little woman sat herself down upon the edge of a chair clasped her hands and said if the lord wills it dear stephen will live and if the lord wills it he will die  this sentence she repeated at intervals until the end came after two hours there was a knocking at the door  go away i said but the knocker would not go away so i opened it was my agent who whispered in an excited voice the counts quite correct you are in by seven  all right i answered tell them we want some more brandy  at that moment stephen strong opened his eyes and at that moment also there arose a mighty burst of cheering from the crowd assembled on the marketplace without to whom the mayor had declared the numbers from a window of the townhall  the dying man heard the cheering and looked at me inquiringly for he could not speak i tried to explain that i was elected on the recount but was unable to make him understand then i hit upon an expedient on the floor lay a conservative rosette of blue ribbon i took it up and took also my own radical colours from my coat holding one of them in each hand before strongs dying eyes i lifted up the radical orange and let the conservative blue fall to the floor  he saw and understood for a ghastly smile appeared upon his distorted face indeed he did morealmost with his last breath he spoke in a hoarse gurgling whisper and his words were bravo the avs  now he shut his eyes and i thought that the end had come but opening them presently he fixed them with great earnestness first upon myself and then upon his wife accompanying the glance with a slight movement of the head i did not know what he could mean but with his wife it was otherwise for she said dont trouble yourself stephen i quite understand  five minutes more and it was over stephen strongs dilated heart had contracted for the last time  i see it has pleased the lord that dear stephen should die said mrs strong in her quiet voice when you have spoken to the people out there doctor will you take me home i am very sorry to trouble but i saw that after he was gone stephen wished me to turn to you    chapter ix  fortune  my return to parliament meant not only the loss of a seat to the government a matter of no great moment in view of their enormous majority but probably through their own fears was construed by them into a solemn warning not to be disregarded certain papers and opposition speakers talked freely of the writing on the wall and none saw that writing in larger or more fiery letters than the members of her majestys government i believe that to them it took the form not of hebraic characters but of two large roman capitals the letters a and v  hitherto the antivaccinators had been known as troublesome people who had to be reckoned with but that they should prove strong enough to wrest what had been considered one of the safest seats in the kingdom out of the hands of the unionists came upon the party as a revelation of the most unpleasant order for stephen strongs dying cry of which the truth was universally acknowledged the avs have done it bravo the avs had echoed through the length and breadth of the land  when a government thinks that agitators are weak naturally and properly it treats them with contempt but when it finds that they are strong enough to win elections then their arguments become more worthy of consideration and so the great heart of the parliamentary pharaoh began to soften towards the antivaccinators and of this softening the first signs were discernible within three or four days of my taking my seat as member for dunchester  i think i may say without vanity and the statement will not be contradicted by those who sat with me that i made a good impression upon the house from the first day i entered its doors doubtless its members had expected to find in me a rabid person liable to burst into a foam of violence at the word vaccination and were agreeably surprised to find that i was much as other men are only rather quieter than most of them i did not attempt to force myself upon the notice of the house but once or twice during the dinner hour i made a few remarks upon subjects connected with public health which were received without impatience and in the interval i tried to master its forms and to get in touch with its temper  in those faraway and longforgotten days a royal commission had been sitting for some years to consider the whole question of compulsory vaccination it was the same before which i had been called to give evidence at length this commission delivered itself of its final report a very sensible one in an enormous bluebook which if adopted would practically have continued the existing vaccination acts with amendments these amendments provided that in future the public vaccinator should visit the home of the child and if the conditions of that home and of the child itself were healthy offer to vaccinate it with glycerinated calf lymph also they extended the time during which the parents and guardians were exempt from prosecution and in various ways mitigated the rigour of the prevailing regulations the subject matter of this report was embodied in a short bill to amend the law and laid before parliament which bill went to a standing committee and ultimately came up for the consideration of the house  then followed the great debate and the great surprise a member moved that it should be read that day six months and others followed on the same side the president of the local government board of the day i remember made a strong speech in favour of the bill after which other members spoke including myself but although about ninety out of every hundred of the individuals who then constituted the house of commons were strong believers in the merits of vaccination hardly one of them rose in his place to support the bill the lesson of dunchester amongst others was before their eyes and whatever their private faith might be they were convinced that if they did so it would lose them votes at the next election  at this ominous silence the government grew frightened and towards the end of the debate to the astonishment of the house and of the country the first lord of the treasury rose and offered to insert a clause by virtue of which any parent or other person who under the bill would be liable to penalties for the nonvaccination of a child should be entirely freed from such penalties if within four months of its birth he satisfied two justices of the peace that he conscientiously believed that the operation would be prejudicial to that childs health the bill passed with the clause which a few days later was rejected by the house of lords government pressure was put upon the lords who thereon reversed their decision and the bill became an act of parliament  thus the whole policy of compulsory vaccination which for many years had been in force in england was destroyed at a single blow by a government with a great majority and a house of commons composed of members who for the most part were absolute believers in its virtues never before did agitators meet with so vast and complete a success and seldom perhaps did a government undertake so great a responsibility for the sake of peace and in order to shelve a troublesome and dangerous dispute it was a very triumph of opportunism for the government aided and abetted by their supporters threw over their beliefs to appease a small but persistent section of the electors convinced that compulsory vaccination was for the benefit of the community they yet stretched the theory of the authority of the parent over the child to such an unprecedented extent that in order to satisfy his individual prejudices that parent was henceforth to be allowed to expose his helpless infant to the risk of terrible disease and of death  it is not for me to judge their motives which may have been pure and excellent my own are enough for me to deal with but the fact remains that having power in their hands to impose the conclusions of a committee of experts on the nation and being as a body satisfied as to the soundness of those conclusions they still took the risk of disregarding them now the result of their action is evident now we have reaped the seed which they sowed nor did they win a vote or a thank you by their amiable and philosophic concessions which earned them no gratitude but indignation mingled with something not unlike contempt  so much for the antivaccination agitation on the crest of whose wave i was carried to fortune and success thenceforward for many long years my career was one of strange and startling prosperity dunchester became my pocket borough so much so indeed that at the three elections which occurred before the last of which i have to tell no one even ventured to contest the seat against me although i was never recognised as a leader of men chiefly i believe because of a secret distrust which was entertained as to my character and the sincerity of my motives session by session my parliamentary repute increased till in the last radical government i was offered and for two years filled the post of undersecretary to the home office indeed when at last we went to the country over the question of the china war i had in my pocket a discreetly worded undertaking that if our party succeeded at the polls my claims to the home secretaryship should be carefully considered but it was not fated that i should ever again cross the threshold of st stephens  so much for my public career which i have only touched on in illustration of my private and moral history  the reader may wonder how it came about that i was able to support myself and keep up my position during all this space of time seeing that my attendance in parliament made it impossible for me to continue in practise as a doctor it happened thus  when my old and true friend stephen strong died on the night of my election it was found that he was even richer than had been supposed indeed his personalty was sworn at 191000 pounds besides which he left real estate in shops houses and land to the value of about 23000 pounds almost all of this was devised to his widow absolutely so that she could dispose of it in whatever fashion pleased her indeed there was but one other bequest that of the balance of the 10000 pounds which the testator had deposited in the hands of a trustee for my benefit this was now left to me absolutely i learned the fact from mrs strong herself as we returned from the funeral  dear stephen has left you nearly 9000 pounds doctor she said shaking her head  gathering from her manner and this shake of her head that the legacy was not pleasing to her i hastened to explain that doubtless it was to carry into effect a business arrangement we had come to before i consented to stand for parliament  ah indeed she said that makes it worse for it is only the payment of a debt not a gift  not knowing what she could mean i said nothing  doubtless doctor if dear stephen had been granted time he would have treated you more liberally seeing how much he thought of you and that you had given up your profession entirely to please him and serve the party that is what he meant when he looked at me before he died i guessed it from the first and now i am sure of it well doctor while i have anything you shall never want of course a member of parliament is a great person expected to live in a style which would take more money than i have but i think that if i put my own expenses at 500 pounds a year which is as much as i shall want and allow another 1000 pounds for subscriptions to the antivaccination societies the society for preventing the muzzling of dogs and the society for the discovery of the lost tribes of israel i shall be able to help you to the extent of 1200 pounds a year if she added apologetically you think you could possibly get along on that  but mrs strong i said i have no claim at all upon you  please do not talk nonsense doctor dear stephen wished me to provide for you and i am only carrying out his wishes with his own money which god gave him perhaps for this very purpose that it should be used to help a clever man to break down the tyranny of wicked governments and false prophets  so i took the money which was paid with the utmost regularity on january the first and june the first in each year on this income i lived in comfort keeping up my house in dunchester for the benefit of my little daughter and her attendants and hiring for my own use a flat quite close to the house of commons  as the years went by however a great anxiety took possession of me for by slow degrees mrs strong grew as feeble in mind as already she was in body till at length she could only recognise people at intervals and became quite incompetent to transact business for a while her bankers went on paying the allowance under her written and unrevoked order but when they understood her true condition they refused to continue the payment  now my position was very serious i had little or nothing put by and having ceased to practise for about seventeen years i could not hope to earn an income from my profession nor could i remain a member of the house at least not for long still by dint of borrowing and the mortgage of some property which i had acquired i kept my head above water for about eighteen months very soon however my financial distress became known with the result that i was no longer so cordially received as i had been either in dunchester or in london the impecunious cannot expect to remain popular  at last things came to a climax and i was driven to the step of resigning my seat i was in london at the time and thence i wrote the letter to the chairman of the radical committee in dunchester giving illhealth as the cause of my retirement when at length it was finished to my satisfaction i went out and posted it and then walked along the embankment as far as cleopatras needle and back again it was a melancholy walk taken i remember upon a melancholy november afternoon on which the dank mist from the river strove for mastery with the gloomy shadows of advancing night not since that other evening many many years ago when after my trial i found myself face to face with ruin or death and was saved by stephen strong had my fortunes been at so low an ebb now indeed they appeared absolutely hopeless for i was no longer young and fit to begin the world afresh also the other party being in power i could not hope to obtain any salaried appointment upon which to support myself and my daughter if mrs strong had kept her reason all would have been well but she was insane and i had no one to whom i could turn for i was a man of many acquaintances but few friends  wearily i trudged back to my rooms to wait there until it was time to dress for i had a dinner engagement at the reform club on the table in the little hall lay a telegram which i opened listlessly it was from a wellknown firm of solicitors in dunchester and ran   our client mrs strong died suddenly at three oclock important that we should see you will you be in dunchester tomorrow if not please say where and at what hour we can wait upon you in town   wait upon you in town i said to myself as i laid down the telegram a great firm of solicitors would not wish to wait upon me unless they had something to tell me to my advantage and their own mrs strong must have left me some money possibly even i was her heir more than once before in life my luck had turned in this sudden way why should it not happen again but she was insane and could not appoint an heir why had not those fools of lawyers told me the facts instead of leaving me to the torment of this suspense  i glanced at the clock then taking a telegraph form i wrote shall be at dunchester station 830 meet me there or later at the club taking a cab i drove to st pancras just in time to catch the train in my pocketso closely was i pressed for money for my account at the bank was actually overdrawni had barely enough to pay for a thirdclass ticket to dunchester this mattered little however for i always travelled thirdclass not because i liked it but because it looked democratic and the right sort of thing for a radical mp to do  the train was a fast one but that journey seemed absolutely endless now at length we had slowed down at the dunchester signalbox and now we were running into the town if my friend the lawyer had anything really striking to tell me he would send to meet me at the station and if it was something remarkable he would probably attend there himself therefore if i saw neither the managing clerk nor the junior partner nor the head of the firm i might be certain that the news was trivial probablydreadful thought which had not occurred to me beforethat i was appointed executor under the will with a legacy of a hundred guineas  the train rolled into the station as it began to glide past the pavement of wet asphalt i closed my eyes to postpone the bitterness of disappointment if only for a few seconds perforce i opened them again as the train was stopping and there the very first thing they fell upon looking portly and imposing in a fur coat was the rubicundfaced head of the firm himself it is good i thought and supported myself for a moment by the hatrack for the revulsion of feeling produced a sudden faintness he saw me and sprang forward with a beaming yet respectful countenance it is very good i thought  my dear sir he began obsequiously i do trust that my telegram has not incommoded you but my news was such that i felt it necessary to meet you at the earliest possible moment and therefore wired to you at every probable address  i gave the porter who took my bag a shilling practically it was my last but that lawyers face and manner seemed to justify the expenditure whichso oddly are our minds constitutedi remember reflecting i might regret if i had drawn a false inference the man touched his hat profusely and i hope made up his mind to vote for me next time then i turned to the head of the firm and said  pray dont apologise but by the way beyond that of the death of my poor friend what is the news  oh perhaps you know it he answered taken aback at my manner though she always insisted upon its being kept a dead secret so that one day you might have a pleasant surprise  i know nothing i answered  then i am glad to be the bearer of such good intelligence to a fortunate and distinguished man he said with a bow i have the honour to inform you in my capacity of executor to the will of the late mrs martha strong that with the exception of a few legacies you are left her sole heir  now i wished that the hatrack was still at hand but as it was not i pretended to stumble and leant for a moment against the porter who had received my last shilling  indeed i said recovering myself and can you tell me the amount of the property  not exactly he answered but she has led a very saving life and money grows you know money grows i should say it must be between three and four hundred thousand nearer the latter than the former perhaps  really i replied that is more than i expected it is a little astonishing to be lifted in a moment from the position of one with a mere competence into that of a rich man but our poor friend waswell weakminded so how could she be competent to make a binding will  my dear sir her will was made within a month of her husbands death when she was as sane as you are as i have plenty of letters to show only as i have said she kept the contents a dead secret in order that one day they might be a pleasant surprise to you  well i answered all things considered they have been a pleasant surprise i may say a very pleasant surprise and now let us go and have some dinner at the club i feel tired and thirsty    next morning the letter that i had posted from london to the chairman of my committee was at my request returned to me unopened    chapter x  jane meets dr merchison  nobody disputed my inheritance for so far as i could learn mrs strong had no relatives nor indeed could it have been disputed for i had never so much as hypnotised the deceased when it was known how rich i had become i grew even more popular in dunchester than i had been before also my importance increased at headquarters to such an extent that on a change of government i became as i have said undersecretary to the home office although i was a useful man hitherto i had always been refused any sort of office because of the extreme views which i professedon platforms in the constituenciesor so those in authority alleged now however these views were put down to amiable eccentricity moreover i was careful not to obtrude them responsibility sobers and as we age and succeed we become more moderate for most of us have a method in our madness  in brief i determined to give up political knighterrantry and to stick to sober business very carefully and in the most conservative spirit i took stock of the situation i was still a couple of years on the right side of fifty young looking for my age an advantage a desirable parti a great advantage although i had no intention of remarrying and in full health and vigour further i possessed a large fortune all in cash or in liquid assets and i resolved that it should not diminish i had experienced enough of ups and downs i was sick of vicissitudes of fears and uncertainties for the future i said to my soul thou hast enough laid up for many days eat drink and be merry and i proceeded to invest my modest competence in such a fashion that it brought in a steady four per cent no south african mines or other soulagonising speculations for me sweet security was what i craved and i got it i could live with great comfort even with modest splendour upon about half my income and the rest of it i purposed to lay out for my future benefit i had observed that brewers merchants and other magnates with cash to spare are in due course elevated to the peerage now i wished to be elevated to the peerage and to spend an honoured and honourable old age as lord dunchester so when there was any shortage of the party funds and such a shortage soon occurred on the occasion of an election i posed as the friend round the corner  moreover i had another aim my daughter jane had now grown into a lovely captivating and highspirited young woman to my fancy indeed i never saw her equal in appearance for the large dark eyes shining in a fair and spirituelle face encircled by masses of rippling chestnut hair gave a bizarre and unusual distinction to her beauty which was enhanced by a tall and graceful figure she was witty also and selfwilled qualities which she inherited from her american mother moreover she adored me and believed in me i who since my wifes death had loved nothing else loved this pure and nobleminded girl as only a father can love for my adoration had nothing selfish in it whereas that of the truest lover although he may not know it is in its beginnings always selfish he has something to gain he seeks his own happiness the father seeks only the happiness of his child  on the whole i think that the worship of this daughter of mine is a redeeming point in my character for which otherwise sitting in judgment on it as i do today i have no respect jane understood that worship and was grateful to me for it her fine unsullied instinct taught her that whatever else about me might be unsound or tarnished this at least rang true and was beyond suspicion she may have seen my open faults and divined my secret weaknesses but for the sake of the love i bore her she overlooked them all indeed she refused to acknowledge them to the extent that my worst political extravagances became to her articles of faith what i upheld was right what i denounced was wrong on other points her mind was open and intelligent but on these it was a shut and bolted door my father says so was her last argument  my position being such that i could ensure her a splendid future i was naturally anxious that she should make a brilliant marriage since with monstrous injustice destiny has decreed that a womans road to success must run past the altar but as yet i could find no man whom i considered suitable or worthy one or two i knew but they were not peers and i wished her to marry a peer or a rising politician who would earn or inherit a peerage  and so good easy man i looked around me and said that full surely my greatness was aripening who thinks of winter and its frosts in the glow of such a summer as i enjoyed  for a while everything went well i took a house in green street and entertained there during the sitting of parliament the beauty of the hostess my daughter jane together with my own position and wealth of which she was the heiress were sufficient to find us friends or at any rate associates among the noblest and most distinguished in the land and for several seasons my dinner parties were some of the most talked about in london to be asked to one of them was considered a compliment even by men who are asked almost everywhere  with such advantages of person intelligence and surroundings at her command jane did not lack for opportunities of settling herself in life to my knowledge she had three offers in one season the last of them from perhaps the best and most satisfactory parti in england but to my great and everincreasing dismay one after another she refused them all the first two disappointments i bore but on the third occasion i remonstrated she listened quite quietly then said  i am very sorry to vex you father dear but to marry a man whom i do not care about is just the one thing i cant do even for your sake  but surely jane i urged a father should have some voice in such a matter  i think he has a right to say whom his daughter shall not marry perhaps but not whom she shall marry  then at least i said catching at this straw will you promise that you wont become engaged to any one without my consent  jane hesitated a little and then answered what is the use of talking of such a thing father as i have never seen anybody to whom i wish to become engaged but if you like i will promise you that if i should chance to see any one and you dont approve of him i will not become engaged to him for three years by the end of which time he would probably cease to wish to become engaged to me but she added with a laugh i am almost certain he wouldnt be a duke or a lord or anything of that sort for provided a man is a gentleman i dont care twopence about his having a title  jane dont talk so foolishly i answered  well father she said astonished if those are my opinions at least i got them from you for i was always brought up upon strictly democratic principles how often have i heard you declare in your lectures down at dunchester that men of our race are all equalexcept the workingman who is better than the othersand that but for social prejudice the son of toil is worthy of the hand of any titled lady in the kingdom  i havent delivered that lecture for years i answered angrily  no father not sincelet me see not since old mrs strong left you all her money and you were made an undersecretary of state and lords and ladies began to call on us now i shouldnt have said that because it makes you angry but it is true though isnt it and she was gone    that august when the house rose we went down to a place that i owned on the outskirts of dunchester it was a charming old house situated in the midst of a considerable estate that is famous for its shooting this property had come to me as part of mrs strongs bequest or rather she held a heavy mortgage on it and when it was put up for sale i bought it in as jane had taken a fancy to the house which was large and roomy with beautiful gardens i let my old home in the city and when we were not in town we came to live at ashfields  on the borders of the ashfields estateindeed part of the land upon which it was built belongs to itlies a poor suburb of dunchester occupied by workmen and their families in these people jane took great interest indeed she plagued me till at very large expense i built a number of model cottages for them with electricity gas and water laid on and bicyclehouses attached in fact this proved a futile proceeding for the only result was that the former occupants of the dwellings were squeezed out while persons of a better class such as clerks took possession of the model tenements at a totally inadequate rent  it was in visiting some of the tenants of these cottages that in an evil hour jane first met dr merchison a young man of about thirty who held some parish appointment which placed the sick of this district under his charge ernest merchison was a rawboned muscular and rather formidablelooking person of scotch descent with stronglymarked features deepset eyes and very long arms a man of few words when he did speak his language was direct to the verge of brusqueness but his record as a medical man was good and even distinguished and already he had won the reputation of being the best surgeon in dunchester this was the individual who was selected by my daughter jane to receive the affections which she had refused to some of the most polished and admired men in england and as i believe largely for the reason that instead of bowing and sighing about after her he treated her with a rudeness which was almost brutal  in one of these new model houses lived some people of the name of smith mr smith was a compositor and mrs smith nee samuels was none other than that very little girl whom together with her brother who died i had once treated for erysipelas resulting from vaccination in a way i felt grateful to her for that case was the beginning of my real success in life and for this reason out of several applicants the new model house was let to her husband as soon as it was ready for occupation  could i have foreseen the results which were to flow from an act of kindness and that as this family had indirectly been the cause of my triumph so they were in turn to be the cause of my ruin i would have destroyed the whole street with dynamite before i allowed them to set foot in it however they came bringing with them two children a little girl of four to whom jane took a great fancy and a baby of eighteen months  in due course these children caught the whoopingcough and jane visited them taking with her some delicacies as a present while she was there dr merchison arrived in his capacity of parish doctor and beyond a curt bow taking no notice of jane began his examination for this was his first visit to the family presently his eye fell upon a box of sweets  whats that he asked sharply  its a present that miss therne here has brought for tottie answered the mother  then tottie mustnt eat them till she is well sugar is bad for whoopingcough though of course a young lady couldnt be expected to know that he added in a voice of gruff apology then went on quickly glancing at the little girls arm no marks i see conscientious objector or only lazy  then mrs smith fired up and poured out her own sad history and that of her poor little brother who died baring her scarred arm in proof of it  and so she finished though i do not remember much about it myself i do remember my mothers dying words which were to mind what the doctor had told her and never to have any child of mine vaccinated no not if they crawled on their knees to ask it of me  the doctor said merchison with scorn you mean the idiot my good woman or more likely the political agitator who would sell his soul for a billet  then jane rose in wrath  i beg your pardon for interrupting you sir she said but the gentleman you speak of as an idiot or a political agitator is dr therne my father the member of parliament for this city  dr merchison stared at her for a long while and indeed when she was angry jane was beautiful enough to make any one stare then he said simply oh indeed i dont meddle with politics so i didnt know  this was too much for jane who afraid to trust herself to further speech walked straight out of the cottage she had passed down the model garden and arrived at the model gate when she heard a quick powerful step behind her and turned round to find herself face to face with dr merchison  i have followed you to apologise miss therne he said of course i had no idea who you were and did not wish to hurt your feelings but i happen to have strong feelings about vaccination and spoke more roughly than i ought to have done  other people sir may also have strong opinions about vaccination answered jane  i know he said and i know too what the end of it all will be as you will also miss therne if you live long enough it is useless arguing the lists are closed and we must wait until the thing is put to the proof of battle when it is one thing is sure there will be plenty of dead he added with a grim smile then taking off his hat and muttering again i apologise he returned into the cottage  it seems that for a while jane was very angry then she remembered that after all dr merchison had apologised and that he had made his offensive remarks in the ignorance and prejudice which afflicted the entire medical profession and were more worthy of pity than of anger further she remembered that in her indignation she had forgotten to acknowledge or accept his apology and lastly she asked him to a gardenparty  it is scarcely necessary for me to dwell upon the subsequent developments of this unhappy businessif i am right in calling it unhappy the piteous little drama is played both the actors are dead and the issue of the piece is unknown and for the present unknowable bitterly opposed as i was to the suit of merchison justice compels me to say that under the cloak of a rough unpromising manner he hid a just and generous heart had that man lived he might have become great although he would never have become popular as least something in his nature attracted my daughter jane for she who up to that time had not been moved by any man became deeply attached to him  in the end he proposed to her how when or where i cannot say for i never inquired one morning i remember it was that of christmas day they came into my library the pair of them and informed me how matters stood merchison went straight to the point and put the case before me very briefly but in a manly and outspoken fashion he said that he quite understood the difficulties of his position inasmuch as he believed that jane was or would be very rich whereas he had nothing beyond his profession in which however he was doing well he ended by asking my consent to the engagement subject to any reasonable conditions that i might choose to lay down  to me the shock was great for occupied as i was with my own affairs and ambitions i had been blind to what was passing before my face i had hoped to see my daughter a peeress and now i found her the affianced bride of a parish sawbones the very foundation of my house of hopes was sapped at a blow all my schemes for the swift aggrandisement of my family were laid low it was too much for me instead of accepting the inevitable and being glad to accept it because my childs happiness was involved i rebelled and kicked against the pricks  by nature i am not a violent man but on that occasion i lost my temper and became violent i refused my consent i threatened to cut my daughter off with nothing but at this argument she and her lover smiled then i took another ground for remembering her promise that she would consent to be separated for three years from any suitor of whom i did not approve i claimed its fulfilment  somewhat to my surprise after a hurried private consultation jane and her lover accepted these conditions telling me frankly that they would wait for three years but that after these had gone by they would consider themselves at liberty to marry with my consent if possible but if necessary without it then in my presence they kissed and parted nor until the last did either of them attempt to break the letter of their bond once indeed they met before that dreadful hour but then it was the workings of fate that brought them together and not their own design    chapter xi  the coming of the redheaded man  half of the three years of probation had gone by and once more we found ourselves at dunchester in august under circumstances still too recent to need explanation the government of which i was a member had decided to appeal to the country the general election being fixed for the end of september after the termination of harvest dunchester was considered to be a safe radical seat and as a matter of parliamentary tactics the poll for this city together with that of eight or ten other boroughs was fixed for the earliest possible day in the hope that the results might encourage more doubtful places to give their support constituencies are very like sheep and if the leaders jump through a certain gap in the political hedge the flock or a large proportion of it will generally follow all of us like to be on the winning side  few people who are old enough to remember it will ever forget the august of two years ago if only because of the phenomenal heat up to that month the year had been very cold so cold that even during july there were some evenings when a fire was welcome while on several days i saw people driving about the roads wrapped up in heavy ulsters but with the first day of august all this changed and suddenly the climate became torrid the nights especially being extraordinarily hot from every quarter of the country came complaints of the great heat while each issue of the newspapers contained lists of those who had fallen victims to it  one evening feeling oppressed in the treeenclosed park of ashfields i strolled out of it into the suburb of which i have spoken almost opposite the private garden of the park stands a board school and in front of this board school i had laid out an acre of land presented by myself as a playground and open space for the use of the public in the centre of this garden was a fountain that fell into a marble basin and around the fountain but at some distance from it stood iron seats to these i made my way and sat down on one of them which was empty in order to enjoy the cool sound of the splashing water about which a large number of children were playing  presently as i sat thus i lifted my eyes and saw the figure of a man approaching towards the other side of the fountain he was quite fifty yards away from me so that his features were invisible but there was something about his general aspect which attracted my attention at once to begin with he looked small and lonely all by himself out there on the wide expanse of gravel moreover the last rays of the setting sun striking full upon him gave him a fiery and unnatural appearance against the dense background of shadows beyond it is a strange and dreadful coincidence but by some extraordinary action of the mind so subtle that i cannot trace the link the apparition of this man out of the gloom into the fierce light of the sunset reminded me of a picture that i had once seen representing the approach to the norwegian harbour of the ship which brought the plague to the shores of scandanavia in the picture that ship also was clothed with the fires of sunset while behind it lay the blackness of approaching night like this wanderer that ship also came forward slowly indeed but without pause as though alive with a purpose of its own and i remember that awaiting it upon the quay were a number of merry children  shaking myself free from this ridiculous but unpleasant thought i continued to observe the man idly clearly he was one of the great army of tramps for his coat was wide and ragged and his hat half innocent of rim although there was something about his figure which suggested to me that he had seen better days i could even imagine that under certain circumstances i might have come to look very much like this poor man now doubtless turned into a mere animal by drink he drew on with a long slow step his head stretched forward his eyes fixed upon the water as he walked now and again lifting a long thin hand and scraping impatiently at his face and head  that poor fellow has got a touch of prickly heat and is thirsty i thought nor was i mistaken for on arriving at the edge of the fountain the tramp knelt down and drank copiously making a moaning sound as he gulped the water which was very peculiar and unpleasant to hear when he had satisfied his thirst he sat himself upon the marble edge of the basin and suddenly plunged his legs boots and all into the water its touch seemed to please him for with a single swift movement he slipped in altogether sitting himself down on the bottom of the basin in such fashion that only his face and fiery red beard from which the hat had fallen remained above the surface whereon they seemed to float like some monstrous and unnatural growth  this unusual proceeding on the part of the tramping stranger at once excited the most intense interest in the mind of every child on the playground with the result that in another minute forty or fifty of them had gathered round the fountain laughing and jeering at its occupant again the sight brought to my mind a strained and disagreeable simile for i bethought me of the dreadful tale of elisha and of the fate which overtook the children who mocked him decidedly the heat had upset my nerves that night nor were they soothed when suddenly from the red head floating upon the water came a flutelike and educated voice saying  cease deriding the unfortunate children or i will come out of this marble bath and tickle you  thereat they laughed all the more and began to pelt the bather with little stones and bits of stick  at first i thought of interfering but as it occurred to me that the man would probably be violent or abusive if i spoke to him and as above all things i disliked scenes i made up my mind to fetch a policeman whom i knew i should find round the corner about a hundred yards away i walked to the corner but did not find the policeman whereon i started across the square to look for him at another point my road led me past the fountain and as i approached it i saw that the waterloving wanderer had been as good as his word he had emerged from the fountain and rushing to and fro raining moisture from his wide coat despite their shrieks half of fear and half of laughter he grabbed child after child and drawing it to him tickled and kissed it laughing dementedly all the while in a fashion which showed me that he was suffering from some form of mania  as soon as he saw me the man dropped the last child he had caughtit was little tottie smithand began to stride away towards the city at the same slow regular purposeful gait with which i had seen him approach the fountain as he passed he turned and made a grimace at me and then i saw his dreadful face no wonder it had looked red at a distance for the erythema almost covered it except where on the forehead and cheeks appeared purple spots and patches  of what did it remind me  great heaven i remembered it reminded me of the face of that girl i had seen lying in the plaza of san jose in mexico over whom the old woman was pouring water from the fountain much such a fountain as that before me for half unconsciously when planning this place i had reproduced its beautiful design it all came back to me with a shock the horrible scene of which i had scarcely thought for years so vividly indeed that i seemed to hear the old hags voice crying in cracked accents si senor viruela viruela  i ought to have sent to warn the police and the health officers of the city for i was sure that the man was suffering from what is commonly called confluent smallpox but i did not from the beginning there has been something about this terrible disease which physically and morally has exercised so great an influence over my destiny that seemed to paralyse my mental powers in my day i was a doctor fearless of any other contagion typhus scarletina diphtheria yellow fever none of them had terrors for me and yet i was afraid to attend a case of smallpox from the same cause in my public speeches i made light of it talking of it with contempt as a sickness of small account much as a housemaid talks in the servants hall of the ghost which is supposed to haunt the back stairs  and now coming as it were from that merry and populous chamber of life and health once again i met the spectre i derided a redheaded redvisaged thing that chose me out to stop and grin at somehow i was not minded to return and announce the fact  why they would say you were the one who did not believe in ghosts it was you who preached of vile superstitions and yet merely at the sight of a shadow you rush in with trembling hands and bristling hair to bid us lay it with bell book and candle where is your faith o prophet  it was nonsense the heat and all my incessant political work had tried me and i was mistaken that tramp was a drunken or perhaps a crazy creature afflicted with some skin disease such as are common among his class why did i allow the incident to trouble me  i went home and washed out my mouth and sprinkled my clothes with a strong solution of permanganate of potash for although my own folly was evident it is always as well to be careful especially in hot weather still i could not help wondering what might happen if by any chance smallpox were to get a hold of a population like that of dunchester or indeed of a hundred other places in england  since the passing of the famous conscience clause many years before as was anticipated would be the case and as the antivaccinators intended should be the case vaccination had become a dead letter amongst at least seventyfive per cent of the people our various societies and agents were not content to let things take their course and to allow parents to vaccinate their children or to leave them unvaccinated as they might think fit on the contrary we had instituted a housetohouse canvass and our visitors took with them forms of conscientious objection to be filled in by parents or guardians and legally witnessed        since the above was written the author has read in the      press that in yorkshire a single bench of magistrates out of      the hundreds in england has already granted orders on the      ground of conscientious objection under which some 2000      children are exempted from the scope of the vaccination      acts so far as he has seen this statement has not been      contradicted at ipswich also about 700 applications      affecting many children have been filed to deal with these      the bench is holding special sessions sitting at seven      oclock in the evening  at first the magistrates refused to accept these forms but after a while when they found how impossible it was to dive into a mans conscience and to decide what was or what was not conscientious objection they received them as sufficient evidence provided only that they were sworn before some one entitled to administer oaths many of the objectors did not even take the trouble to do as much as this for within five years of the passing of the act in practice the vaccination laws ceased to exist the burden of prosecution rested with boards of guardians popularly elected bodies and what board was likely to go to the trouble of working up a case and to the expense of bringing it before the court when to produce a complete defence the defendant need only declare that he had a conscientious objection to the law under which the information was laid against him many idle or obstinate or prejudiced people would develop conscientious objections to anything which gives trouble or that they happen to dislike for instance if the same principle were applied to education i believe that within a very few years not twentyfive per cent of the children belonging to the classes that are educated out of the rates would ever pass the school board standards  thus it came about that the harvest was ripe and over ripe awaiting only the appointed sickle of disease once or twice already that sickle had been put in but always before the reaping began it was stayed by the application of the terrible rule of isolation known as the improved leicester system  among some of the natives of africa when smallpox breaks out in a kraal that kraal is surrounded by guards and its inhabitants are left to recover or perish to starve or to feed themselves as chance and circumstance may dictate during the absence of the smallpox laws the same plan more mercifully applied prevailed in england and thus the evil hour was postponed but it was only postponed for like a cumulative tax it was heaping up against the country and at last the hour had come for payment to an authority whose books must be balanced without remittance or reduction what is due to nature that nature takes in her own way and season neither less nor more unless indeed the skill and providence of man can find means to force her to write off the debt  five days after my encounter with the redheaded vagrant the following paragraph appeared in one of the local papers pocklingham in the casual ward of the union house for this district a tramp name unknown died last night he had been admitted on the previous evening but for some unexplained reason it was not noticed until the next morning that he suffered from illness and therefore he was allowed to mix with the other inmates in the general ward drs butt and clarkson who were called in to attend state that the cause of death was the worst form of smallpox the body will be buried in quicklime but some alarm is felt in the district owing to the deceased who it is said arrived here from dunchester where he had been frequenting various tramps lodgings having mixed with a number of other vagrants who left the house before the character of his sickness was discovered and who cannot now be traced the unfortunate man was about forty years of age of medium height and redhaired  the same paper had an editorial note upon this piece of news at the end of which it remarked as became a party and an antivaccination organ the terror of this filth disease which in our fathers time amounted almost to insanity no longer afflicts us who know both that its effects were exaggerated and how to deal with it by isolation without recourse to the socalled vaccine remedies which are now rejected by a large proportion of the population of these islands still as we have ascertained by inquiry that this unfortunate man did undoubtedly spend several days and nights wandering about our city when in an infectious condition it will be as well that the authorities should be on the alert we do not want that hoary veteranthe smallpox scareto rear its head again in dunchester least of all just now when in view of the imminent election the accustomed use would be made of it by our prejudiced and unscrupulous political opponents  no i said to myself as i put the paper down certainly we do not want a smallpox scare just now and still less do we want the smallpox then i thought of that unfortunate redheaded wretch crazy with the torment of his disease and of his hideous laughter as he hunted and caught the children who made a mock of himthe poor children scarcely one of whom was vaccinated  a week later i opened my political campaign with a large public meeting in the agricultural hall almost up to the nomination day no candidate was forthcoming on the other side and i thought that for the fourth time i should be returned unopposed of a sudden however a name was announced and it proved to be none other than that of my rival of many years agosir thomas colfordnow like myself growing greyheaded but still vigorous in mind and body and as much respected as ever by the wealthier and more educated classes of our community his appearance in the field put a new complexion on matters it meant indeed that instead of the easy and comfortable walk over which i had anticipated i must fight hard for my political existence  in the course of my speech which was very well received for i was still popular in the town even among the more moderate of my opponents i dwelt upon sir thomas colfords address to the electorate which had just come into my hands in this address i was astonished to see a paragraph advocating though in a somewhat guarded fashion the reenactment of the old laws of compulsory vaccination in a draft which had reached me two days before through some underground channel this paragraph had not appeared thus showing that it had been added by an afterthought and quite suddenly however there it was and i made great play with it  what i asked the electors of dunchester could they think of a man who in these modern and enlightened days sought to reimpose upon a free people the barbarous infamies of the vaccination acts long ago we had fought that fight and long ago we had relegated them to limbo where with such things as instruments of torment papal bulls and writs of attainder they remained to excite the wonder and the horror of our own and future generations  well would it have been for me if i had stopped here but led away by the subject and by the loud cheers that my treatment of it purposely flamboyant never failed to evoke forgetful too for the moment of the redheaded man i passed on to deductions our opponents had prophesied i said that within ten years of the passing of the famous conscience clause smallpox would be rampant now what were the facts although almost twice that time had gone by here in dunchester we had suffered far less from smallpox than during the compulsory period for at no one time during all these eighteen or twenty years had three cases been under simultaneous treatment within the confines of the city  well there are five now called out a voice from the back of the hall  i drew myself up and made ready to wither this untruthful brawler with my best election scorn when of a sudden i remembered the redheaded man and passed on to the consideration of foreign affairs  from that moment all life went out of my speech and as it seemed to me the enthusiasm of the meeting died away as soon as it was over i made inquiries to find that the truth had been hidden from methere were five if not seven cases of smallpox in different parts of the city and the worst feature of the facts was that three of the patients were children attending different schools one of these children it was ascertained had been among those who were playing round the fountain about a fortnight since although he was not one whom the redhaired tramp had touched but the other two had not been near the fountain the presumption was therefore that they had contracted the disease through some other source of infection perhaps at the lodginghouse where the man had spent the night after bathing in the water also it seemed that drawn thither by the heat in all two or three hundred children had visited the fountain square on this particular evening and that many of them had drunk water out of the basin  never do i remember feeling more frightened than when these facts came to my knowledge for added to the possible terrors of the position was my constitutional fear of the disease which i have already described on my way homewards i met a friend who told me that one of the children was dead the malady which was of an awful type having done its work very swiftly  like a first flake from a snowcloud like a first leaf falling in autumn from among the myriads on some great tree so did this little life sink from our number into the silence of the grave ah how many were to follow there is a record i believe but i cannot give it in dunchester alone with its population of about 50000 i know that we had over 5000 deaths and dunchester was a focus from which the pestilence spread through the kingdom destroying and destroying and destroying with a fury that has not been equalled since the days of the black death  but all this was still to come for the plague did not get a grip at once an iron system of isolation was put in force and every possible means was adopted by the town authorities who for the most part were antivaccinationists to suppress the facts a task in which they were assisted by the officials of the local government board who had their instructions on the point as might have been expected the party in power did not wish the political position to be complicated by an outcry for the passing of a new smallpox law so few returns were published and as little information as possible was given to the papers  for a while there was a lull the subject of smallpox was taboo and nobody heard much about it beyond vague and indefinite rumours indeed most of us were busy with the question of the hourthe eternal question of beer its purity and the method of its sale for my part i made few inquiries like the ostrich of fable i hid my head in the sands of political excitement hoping that the arrows of pestilence would pass us by  and yet although i breathed no word of my fears to a living soul in my heart i was terribly afraid    chapter xii  the shadow of pestilence  very soon it became evident that the fight in dunchester would be severe for the electorate which for so many years had been my patient servant showed signs of rebelling against me and the principles i preached whether the voters were moved by a desire for change whether they honestly disagreed with me or whether a secret fear of the smallpox was the cause of it i do not know but it is certain that a large proportion of them began to look upon me and my views with distrust  at any other time this would not have caused me great distress indeed defeat itself would have had consolations but now when i appeared to be on the verge of real political distinction the mere thought of failure struck me with dismay to avoid it i worked as i had not worked for years meetings were held nightly leaflets were distributed by the ton and every house in the city was industriously visited by my canvassers who were divided into bands and officers like a regiment  the head of one of these bands was my daughter jane and never did a candidate have a more able or enthusiastic lieutenant she was gifted with the true political instinct which taught her what to say and what to leave unsaid when to press a point home and when to abandon it for another moreover her personal charm and popularity fought for her cause  one evening as she was coming home very tired after a long days work in the slums of the city jane arrived at the model cottages outside my park gates having half an hour to spare she determined to visit a few of their occupants her second call was on the smith family  i am glad to see you now as always miss said mrs smith but we are in trouble here  what is little tottie ill again jane asked  no miss it isnt tottie this time its the baby shes got convulsions or something like it and ive sent for dr merchison would you like to see her shes lying in the front room  jane hesitated she was tired and wanted to get home with her canvass cards but the woman looked tired too and in need of sympathy possibly also for nature is nature jane hoped that if she lingered there a little without in any way violating her promise she might chance to catch a brief glimpse of the man she loved  yes i will come in for a minute she answered and followed mrs smith into the room  on a cheap cane couch in the corner at the foot of which the child tottie was playing with a doll lay the baby an infant of nearly three the convulsive fit had passed away and she was sitting up supported by a pillow the fair hair hanging about her flushed face and beating the blanket with her little fevered hands  take me mummy take me i thirsty she moaned  there thats how she goes on all day and it fairly breaks my heart to see her said the mother wiping away a tear with her apron if youll be so kind as to mind her a minute miss ill go and make a little lemonade ive got a couple of oranges left and she seems to like them best of anything  janes heart was stirred and leaning down she took the child in her arms go and get the drink she said i will look after her till you come and she began to walk up and down the room rocking the little sufferer to and fro  presently she looked up to see dr merchison standing in the doorway  jane you here he said  yes ernest  he stepped towards her and before she could turn away or remonstrate bent down and kissed her on the lips  you shouldnt do that dear she said its out of the bargain  perhaps i shouldnt he answered but i couldnt help it i said that i would keep clear of you and if i have met you by accident it is not my fault come let me have a look at that child  taking the little girl upon his knee he began to examine her feeling her pulse and looking at her tongue for a while he seemed puzzled then jane saw him take a little magnifying glass from his pocket and by the help of it search the skin of the patients forehead especially just at the roots of the hair after this he looked at the neck and wrists then set the child down on the couch waving jane back when she advanced to take it and asked the mother who had just entered the room with the lemonade two or three short quick questions  next he turned to jane and said  i dont want to frighten you but you will be as well out of this its lucky for you he added with a little smile that when you were born it wasnt the fashion for doctors to be antivaccinationists for unless i am much mistaken that child has got smallpox  smallpox said jane then added aggressively well now we shall see whose theory is right for as you saw i was nursing her and i have never been vaccinated in my life my father would not allow it and i have been told that it won him his first election  ernest merchison heard and for a moment his face became like that of a man in a fit  the wicked he began and stopped himself by biting his lips till the blood came recovering his calm with an effort he turned to jane and said in a hoarse voice  there is still a chance it may be in time yes i am almost sure that i can save you then he plunged his hand into his breast pocket and drew out a little case of instruments be so good as to bare your left arm he said fortunately i have the stuff with me  what for she asked  to be vaccinated  are you mad ernest she said you know who i am and how i have been brought up how then can you suppose that i would allow you to put that poison into my veins  look here jane there isnt much time for argument but just listen to me for one minute you know i am a pretty good doctor dont you for i have that reputation havent i and i am sure that you believe in me well now just on this one point and for this one occasion i am going to ask you to give up your own opinion and to suppose that in this matter i am right and your father is wrong i will go farther and say that if any harm comes to you from this vaccination beyond the inconvenience of a swollen arm you may consider all that has been between us as nothing and never speak to me again  thats not the point she answered if you vaccinated me and my arm fell off in consequence i shouldnt care for you a bit the less because i should know that you were the victim of a foolish superstition and believed what you were doing to be right no ernest it is of no use i can assure you that i know a great deal more about this subject than you do i have read all the papers and statistics and heard the cleverest men in england lecture upon it and nothing nothing nothing will ever induce me to submit to that filthy that revolting operation  he heard and groaned then he tried another argument  listen he said you have been good enough to tell meseveral timeswell that you loved me and forgive me for alluding to it but i think that once you were so foolish as to say that you cared for me so much that you would give your very existence if it could make me happy now i ask you for nothing half so great as that i ask you to submit to a trifling inconvenience and so far as you are personally concerned to waive a small prejudice for my sake or perhaps i had better say to give in to my folly cant you do as much as that for me jane  ernest she answered hoarsely if you asked anything else of me in the world i would do ityes anything you can think ofbut this i cant do and wont do  in gods name why not he cried  because to do it would be to declare my father a quack and a liar and to show that i his daughter from whom if from anybody he has a right to expect faith and support have no belief in him and the doctrine that he has taught for twenty years that is the truth and it is cruel of you to make me say it  ernest merchison ground his teeth understanding that in face of this womans blind fidelity all argument and appeal were helpless then in his love and despair he formed a desperate resolve yes he was very strong and he thought that he could do it  catching her suddenly round the waist he thrust her into a cottage armchair which stood by and despite her struggles began to cut at the sleeve of her dress with the lancet in his hand but soon he realised that the task was hopeless  ernest merchison she said as she escaped from him with blazing eyes and catching breath you have done what i will never forgive go your own way in life and i will go mine  to death jane  then she walked out of the house and through the garden gate when she had gone ten or fifteen yards she looked back to see her lover standing by the gate his face buried in his hands and his strong frame shaking with sobs for a moment jane relented it was terrible to see this reserved and selfreliant man thus weeping openly and she knew that the passion must be mighty which would bring him to this pass in her heart indeed she had never loved him better than at this moment she loved him even for his brutal attempt to vaccinate her by force because she understood what instigated the brutality but then she remembered the insultshe to be seized like a naughty child who will not take its dose and in the presence of another woman and so remembering she hardened her heart and passed out of his sight towards the gateways of the grave  at that time jane said nothing of her adventure to me though afterwards i learned every detail of it from her and mrs smith she did not even tell me that she had visited the smiths cottage until one morning about eight days afterwards when some blundering servant informed us at breakfast that the baby smith was dead of the smallpox in the hospital and that the other child was dangerously ill i was shocked beyond measure for this brought the thing home the people lived almost at my gates now i remembered that i had seen the redheaded tramp catch the child tottie in his arms doubtless she introduced the infection though strangely enough her little sister developed the disease before her  jane i said when the servant had left did you hear about the smith baby  yes father she answered languidly i knew that it had smallpox a week ago  then why did you not tell me and how did you know  i didnt tell you dear because the mere mention of smallpox always upsets you so much especially just now with all this election worry going on and i knew it because i was at the smiths cottage and nursing the baby when the doctor came in and said it was smallpox  you were nursing the baby i almost screamed as i sprang from my seat great heavens girl why you will infect the whole place  that was what ernestdr merchisonseemed to think he wanted to vaccinate me  oh and did you let him  how can you ask me such a question father remembering what you have always taught me i said and with omissions she told me the gist of what had passed between them  i didnt mean that i answered when she had done i thought that perhaps under the influence of shockwell as usual you showed your wisdom for how can one poison kill another poison and unable to bear it any longer making some excuse i rose and left the room  her wisdom great heavens her wisdom why did not that fool merchison insist he should have authority over her if any man had and now it was too latenow no vaccination on earth could save her unless by chance she had escaped infection which was scarcely to be hoped indeed such a thing was hardly known as that an unvaccinated person coming into immediate contact with a smallpox patient after the eruption had appeared should escape infection  what did this mean it meant that within a few days jane my only and darling child the very hope and centre of my life would be in the fangs of one of the most dreadful and dangerous diseases known to humanity more having never been vaccinated that disease was sure to strike her with its full force and the type of it which had appeared in the city was such that certainly not more than onehalf of the unprotected persons attacked came alive out of the struggle  this was bad enough but there were other things behind i had never been vaccinated since infancy over fifty years ago and was therefore practically unprotected with the enemy that all my lifetime i had dreaded as i dreaded no other thing or imagination actually standing at my door i could not go away because of the election i dared not show fear because they would cry look at the hangman when he sees the rope here since compulsory vaccination had been abandoned we fought smallpox by a system of isolation so rigorous that under its cruel provisions every one of whatever age rank or sex in whom the disease declared itself was instantly removed to a hospital while the inhabitants of the house whence the patient came were kept practically in prison not being allowed to mix with their fellows we had returned to the preventive measures of centuries ago much as they were practised in the time of the great plague  but how could i send my daughter to one of those dreadful pestpits there at the moment of struggle to be a standing advertisement of the utter failure and falsity of the system i had preached backing my statements with the wager of her life moreover to do so would be to doom myself to defeat at the poll since under our byelaws which were almost ferocious in their severity i could no longer appear in public to prosecute my canvass and if my personal influence was withdrawn then most certainly my adversary would win   oh truly i who had sown bounteously was reaping bounteously truly the birds which i had sent out on their mission of evil had come home to roost upon my rooftree    chapter xiii  harvest  another five days went byto me they were days of most unspeakable doubt and anguish each morning at breakfast i waited for the coming of jane with an anxiety which was all the more dreadful because i forced myself to conceal it there had been no further conversation between us about the matter that haunted both our minds and so fearful was i lest she should divine my suspense that except in the most casual way i did not even dare to look at her as she entered the room  on the fifth morning she was late for breakfast not a common thing for as a rule she rose early i sent one of the parlourmaids to her room to ask if she was coming down and stood awaiting the answer with much the same feeling as a criminal on his trial awaits the verdict of the jury presently the girl returned with the message that miss therne would be down in a few minutes whereat i breathed again and swallowed a little food which till then i had been unable to touch  soon she came and i saw that she was rather pale and languid owing to the heat perhaps but that otherwise she looked much as usual  you are late dear i said unconcernedly  yes father she answered i woke up with a little headache and went to sleep again it has gone now i suppose that it is the heat  as she spoke she kissed me and i thoughtbut this may have been fancythat her breath felt cold upon my cheek  i daresay i said and we sat down to table by my plate lay a great pile of correspondence which i opened while making pretence to eat but all the time i was watching jane over the top of those wearisome letters most of them from beggars or constituents who wanted to know one however was anonymous from a person who signed herself mother it ran   sirafter hearing your speeches some years ago and being told that you were such a clever man i became a conscientious objector and would not let them vaccinate any more of my children the three who were not vaccinated have all been taken to the hospital with the smallpox and they tell me for i am not allowed to see them that one of them is dead but the two who were vaccinated are quite well sir i thought that you would like to know this so that if you have made any mistake you may tell others sir forgive me for troubling you but it is a terrible thing to have ones child die of smallpox and as i acted on your advice i take the liberty of writing the above   again i looked at jane and saw that although she was sipping her tea and had some bacon upon her plate she had eaten nothing at all like the catch of a song echoed through my brain that fearsome sentence it is a terrible thing to have ones child die of the smallpox terrible indeed for now i had little doubt but that jane was infected and if she should chance to die then what should i be i should be her murderer  after breakfast i started upon my rounds of canvassing and speechmaking oh what a dreadful day was that and how i loathed the work how i cursed the hour in which i had taken up politics and sold my honour to win a seat in parliament and a little cheap notoriety among my fellowmen if stephen strong had not tempted me jane would have been vaccinated in due course and therefore good friend though he had been to me and though his wealth was mine today i cursed the memory of stephen strong everywhere i went that afternoon i heard ominous whispers people did not talk openly they shrugged their shoulders and nodded and hinted and all their hints had to do with the smallpox  i say therne said an old friend the chairman of my committee with a sudden outburst of candour what a dreadful thing it would be if after all we avs were mistaken you know there are a good many cases of it about for its no use disguising the truth but i havent heard of any yet among the calfworshippers that was our cant term for those who believed in vaccination  oh let be i answered angrily it is too late to talk of mistakes weve got to see this thing through  yes yes therne he said with a dreary laugh unless it should happen to see us through  i left him and went home just in time to dress there were some people to dinner at which jane appeared her lassitude had vanished and as was her manner when in good spirits she was very humorous and amusing also i had never seen her look so beautiful for her colour was high and her dark eyes shone like the diamond stars in her hair but again i observed that she ate nothing although she who for the most part drank little but water took several glasses of champagne and two tumblers of soda before i could get rid of my guests she had gone to bed at length they went and going to my study i began to smoke and think  i was now sure that the bright flush upon her cheeks was due to what we doctors call pyrexia the initial fever of smallpox and that the pest which i had dreaded and fled from all my life was established in my home the night was hot and i had drunk my fill of wine but i sat and shook in the ague of my fear jane had the disease but she was young and strong and might survive it i should take it from her and in that event assuredly must die for the mind is master of the body and the thing we dread is the thing that kills us  probably indeed i had taken it already and this very moment the seeds of sickness were at their wizard work within me well even if it was soi gasped when the thought struck meas merchison had recognised in the case of jane by immediate vaccination the virus could be destroyed or if not destroyed at least so much modified and weakened as to become almost harmless smallpox takes thirteen or fourteen days to develop cowpox runs its course in eight so even supposing that i had been infected for two days there was still time yes but none to lose  well the thing was easyi was a doctor and i had a supply of glycerinated lymph i had procured some fresh tubes of it only the other day to hold it up before my audiences while i dilated on its foulness and explained the evils which resulted from its use supposing now that i made a few scratches on my arm and rubbed some of this stuff into them who would be the wiser the inflammation which would follow would not be sufficient to incapacitate me and nobody can see through a mans coat sleeve even if the limb should become swollen or helpless i could pretend that i had strained it whatever i had preached to prove my point and forward my ambition in truth i had never doubted the efficacy of vaccination although i was well aware of the dangers that might result from the use of impure or contaminated lymph foul surroundings and occasionally perhaps certain conditions of health in the subject himself therefore i had no prejudice to overcome and certainly i was not a conscientious objector  it came to this then there were only two reasons why i should not immediately vaccinate myselffirst that i might enjoy in secret a virtuous sense of consistency which in the case of a person who had proved himself so remarkably inconsistent in this very matter would be a mere indulgence of foolish pride and secondly because if i did i might be found out this indeed would be a catastrophe too terrible to think of but it was not in fact a risk that need be taken into account  but where was the use of weighing all these pros and cons such foolish doubts and idle arguments melted into nothingness before the presence of the spectre that stood upon my threshold the hideous spotted pestilence who had slain my father who held my daughter by the throat and who threatened to grip me with his frightful fingers what were inconsistencies and risks to me compared to my living terror of the thing that had dominated my whole existence reappearing at its every crisis and by some strange fate even when it was far from me throwing its spell over my mind and fortunes till because of it i turned my skill and knowledge to the propagation of a lie so mischievous in its results that had the world known me as i was it would have done wisely to deal by me as it deals with a dangerous lunatic  i would do it and at once  first although it was unnecessary as all the servants had gone to rest i locked that door of my study which opened into the hall the other door i did not think of locking for beyond it was nothing but the private staircase which led to the wing of the house occupied by jane and myself then i took off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve fastening it with a safetypin to the linen upon my shoulder after this i lit a spiritlamp and sterilised my lancet by heating it in the flame now having provided myself with an ivory point and unsealed the tiny tube of lymph i sat down in a chair so that the light from the electric lamp fell full upon my arm and proceeded to scape the skin with the lancet until blood appeared in four or five separate places next i took the ivory point and after cleansing it i charged it with the lymph and applied it to the abrasions being careful to give each of them a liberal dose the operation finished i sat still awhile letting my arm hang over the back of the chair in order that the blood might dry thoroughly before i drew down my shirt sleeve  it was while i was sitting thus that i heard some movement behind me and turned round suddenly to find myself face to face with my daughter jane she was clothed only in her nightdress and a bedroom wrapper and stood near to the open staircase door resting her hand upon the end of a lounge as though to support herself  for one moment only i saw her and noted the look of horror in her eyes the next i had touched the switch of the electric light and save for the faint blue glimmer of the spirit lamp there was darkness  father she said and in the gloom her voice sounded far away and hollow what are you doing to your arm  i stumbled and fell against the corner of the mantelpiece and scratched it i began wildly but she stopped me  o father have pity for i cannot bear to hear you speak what is not true andi saw it all  then followed a silence made more dreadful by the darkness which the one ghostly point of light seemed to accentuate  presently my daughter spoke again  have you no word of comfort to me before i go how is it that you who have prevented thousands from doing this very thing yet do it yourself secretly and at the dead of night if you think it safer to vaccinate yourself why was i your child left unvaccinated and taught that it is a wicked superstition father father for gods sake answer me or i shall go mad  then i spoke as men will speak at the judgment dayif there is oneand for the same reason because i must sit down jane and listen and if you do not mind let it remain dark i can tell you best in the dark  then briefly but with clearness and keeping nothing back i told her all iher fatherlaying every pitiable weakness of my nature open to my childs sight yes even to the terror of infection that drove me to the act all this while jane answered no word but when at length i finished she said  my poor father o my poor father why did you not tell me all this years ago when you could have confessed your mistake well it is done and you were not to blame in the beginning for they forced you to it and now i have come to tell you that i am very illthat is why i am heremy back aches dreadfully and i fear that i must have caught this horrible smallpox oh had i known the truth a fortnight ago i should have let ernest vaccinate me it broke my heart to refuse him the first thing he ever asked of me but i thought of what you would feel and what a disgrace it would be to you and nowyou see  turn up the light for i must go back i daresay that we shall never meet again for remember you are not to come into my room i will not allow you to come into my room if i have to kill myself to prevent it no you must not kiss me either i daresay that i have begun to be infectious goodbye father till we meet again somewhere else for i am sure that we do not altogether die oh now that i know everything i should have been glad enough to leave this lifeif only i had nevermet ernest and turning jane my daughter crept away gliding up the broad oak stairs back to the room which she was never to quit alive  as for me daylight found me still seated in the study my brain tormented with an agony of remorse and shame which few have lived to feel and my heart frozen with fear of what the morrow should bring forth    after but one day of doubt janes sickness proved to be smallpox of the prevailing virulent type but she was not removed to the hospital for i kept the thing secret and hired a nurse who had recently been revaccinated for her from a london institution the doctoring i directed myself although i did not actually see her not now from any fear of consequences for i was so utterly miserable that i should have been glad to die even of smallpox but because she would not suffer it and because also had i done so i might have carried infection far and wide and should have been liable to prosecution under our isolation laws  i wished to give up the fight for the seat but when i suggested it saying that i was ill my committee turned upon me fiercely  smallpox they declared was breaking out all over the city and i should stop there to sweep out my own grate even if they had to keep me by force if i did not they would expose me in a fashion i should not like  then i gave in feeling that after all it did not matter much as in any case it was impossible for me to leave dunchester personally i had no longer any fear of contagion for within a week from that fatal night four large vesicles had formed on my arm and their presence assured me that i was safe at any other time this knowledge would have rejoiced me more than i can tell but now as i have said i did not greatly care  another six days went by bringing me to the eve of the election at lunch time i managed to get home and was rejoiced to find that jane who for the past fortyeight hours had been hovering between life and death had taken a decided turn for the better indeed she told me so herself in quite a strong voice as i stood in the doorway of her room adding that she hoped i should have a good meeting that night  it would seem however that almost immediately after i left a change for the worse set in of such a character that jane felt within herself her last hour was at hand then it was that she ordered the nurse to write a telegram at her dictation it was to dr merchison and ran come and see me at once do not delay as i am dyingjane  within half an hour he was at her door then she bade the nurse to throw a sheet over her so that he might not see her features which were horribly disfigured and to admit him  listen she said speaking through the sheet i am dying of the smallpox and i have sent for you to beg your pardon i know now that you were right and i was wrong although it broke my heart to learn it  then by slow degrees and in broken words she told him enough of what she had learned to enable him to guess the rest never dreaming poor child of the use to which he would put his knowledge being too ill indeed to consider the possibilities of a future in which she could have no part  the rest of that scene has nothing to do with the world it has nothing to do with me it is a private matter between two people who are dead ernest merchison and my daughter jane therne although my own beliefs are nebulous and at times nonexistent this was not so in my daughters case nor was it so in the case of ernest merchison who was a scotchman with strong religious views which i understand under these dreadful circumstances proved comfortable to both of them at the least they spoke with confidence of a future meeting which if their faith is well founded was not long delayed indeed for strong as he seemed to be within the year merchison followed his lover to the churchyard where they lie side by side  about halfpast six jane became unconscious and an hour afterwards she died    then in his agony and the bitterness of his just rage a dreadful purpose arose in the mind of merchison he went home changed his clothes disinfected himself and afterwards came on to the agricultural hall where i was addressing a mass meeting of the electors it was a vast and somewhat stormy meeting for mens minds were terrified and overshadowed by the cases of disease which were reported in everincreasing numbers and even the best of my supporters had begun to speculate whether or no my antivaccination views were after all so absolutely irrefutable  still my speech which by design did not touch on the smallpox scare was received with respect if not with enthusiasm i ended it however with an eloquent peroration wherein i begged the people of dunchester to stand fast by those great principles of individual freedom which for twenty years it had been my pride and privilege to inculcate and on the morrow in spite of all arguments that might be used to dissuade them fearlessly to give their suffrages to one who for two decades had proved himself to be their friend and the protector of their rights  i sat down and when the cheers with which were mixed a few hoots had subsided my chairman asked if any one in the meeting wished to question the candidate  i do said a voice speaking from beneath the shadow of the gallery far away i wish to ask dr therne whether he believes in vaccination  when the meeting understood the meaning of this jesters question a titter of laughter swept over it like a ripple over the face of a pond the chairman also rising with a smile said really i do not think it necessary to put that query to my friend here seeing that for nearly twenty years he has been recognised throughout england as one of the champions of the antivaccination cause which he helped to lead to triumph  i repeat the question said the distant voice again a cold deep voice with a note in it that to my ears sounded like the knell of approaching doom  the chairman looked puzzled then replied if my friend will come up here instead of hiding down there in the dark i have no doubt that dr therne will be able to satisfy his curiosity  there was a little commotion beneath the gallery and presently a man was seen forcing his way up the length of the huge and crowded hall for some reason or other the audience watched his slow approach without impatience a spirit of wonder seemed to have taken possession of them it was almost as though by some process of telepathy the thought which animated the mind of this questioner had taken a hold of their minds although they did not quite know what that thought might be moreover the sword of smallpox hung over the city and therefore the subject was of supreme interest when death is near whatever they may pretend men think of little else  now he was at the foot of the platform and now in the gaunt powerful frame i recognised my daughters suitor ernest merchison and knew that something dreadful was at hand what i could not guess  there was still timei might have pretended to be ill but my brain was so weary with work and sorrow and so occupied what was left of it in trying to fathom merchisons meaning that i let the precious moment slip at length he was standing close by me and to me his face was like the face of an avenging angel and his eyes shone like that angels sword  i wish to ask you sir he said again whether or no you believe that vaccination is a prophylactic against smallpox  once more there were opportunities of escape i might for instance have asked for a definition of vaccination of prophylactics and of smallpox and thus have argued till the audience grew weary but some god of vengeance fought upon his side the hand of doom was over me and a power i could not resist dragged the answer from my lips  i think sir i replied that as the chairman has told you the whole of my public record is an answer to your question i have often expressed my views upon this matter i see no reason to change them  ernest merchison turned to the audience  men of dunchester he said in such trumpetlike and thrilling tones that every face of the multitude gathered there was turned upon him dr therne in answer to my questions refers to his wellknown views and says that he has found no reason to change them his views are that vaccination is useless and even mischievous and by preaching them he has prevented thousands from being vaccinated now i ask him to illustrate his faith by baring his left arm before you all  what followed i know not from the audience went up a great gasp mingled with cries of yes and shame and show him my supporters on the platform murmured in indignation and i round whom the whole earth seemed to rush by an effort recovering my selfcontrol rose and said  i am here to answer any question but i ask you to protect me from insult  again the tumult and confusion swelled but through it all calm as death inexorable as fate ernest merchison stood at my side when it had died down he said  i repeat my challenge there is smallpox in this citypeople are lying dead of itand many have protected themselves by vaccination let dr therne prove that he has not done this also by baring his left arm before you all  the chairman looked at my face and his jaw dropped i declare this meeting closed he said and i turned to hurry from the platform whereat there went up a shout of no no it sank to a sudden silence and again the man with the face of fate spoke  murderer of your own child i reveal that which you hide  then with his right hand suddenly he caught me by the throat with his left hand he gripped my linen and my garments and at one wrench ripped them from my body leaving my left breast and shoulder naked and there patent on the arm where every eye might read them were those proofs of my infamy which he had sought   i swooned away and as i sank into oblivion there leapt from the lips of the thousands i had betrayed that awful roar of scorn and fury which has hunted me from my home and still haunts me far across the seas   my story is done there is nothing more to tell    the end
